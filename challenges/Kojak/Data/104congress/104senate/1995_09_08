We thank You that, ``never yet a abyss was found \ndeeper than your love could sound.'' We ask that Your healing grace and \nmercy, restitution and release, may sound in the depth of his heart \ntoday. Heal his brokeness and remind him that You have plans for him, \nto give him a future and a hope. We praise You for his immense \ncontribution to the work of this Senate through the years. Give him \nstrength and courage as he begins a new phase of his life sustained by \nYour love and guidance.\n  Lord, we also ask for Your healing of a pain of a very different kind \nof brokeness we are all feeling today. We ask You to heal our divisions \nand bring deeper unity. After our human evaluations are made and \njudgments rendered, we confess with the Psalmist, ``If You Lord, should \nmark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with \nYou that You may be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in \nHis Word I do hope.''--Psalm 130: 3-4.\n  With an acute awareness of our own needs, give us humility to trust \nYou with our weaknesses and praise You for our strengths. Give us a \nrenewed commitment to exemplify strong moral leadership. Most of all, \nbind us together in greater oneness as, with one mind and heart, we \npress on to the work You have given us to do together. In our Lord's \nname. Amen.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S12873-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] is recognized for up to 5 minutes for \ndebate in relation to his amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  I will not take the 5 minutes. I wanted to inform Members who were \nnot here last night when we debated this amendment, I believe this is \nan amendment that should get overwhelming support of this body. The \namendment addresses a problem that I think has come to light through \nnewspaper articles and other studies that have been done by criminal \nexperts where we found that because of the privacy provisions in the \ncurrent welfare statutes, police are not able to get addresses of \npeople who are fleeing the criminal justice system, fugitive felons who \nhave warrants out for their arrest or are, in fact, convicted felons \nwho have escaped.\n  You have warrants out for their arrest, convicted felons that police \nare trying to track down. They go to the welfare agency and say, ``Are \nthey receiving welfare? Is there a current address you might have?'' \nAnd the welfare agency, under law, is not allowed to tell them whether \nthis person is receiving food stamps or AFDC or whatever the case may \nbe.\n  You might say, how big of a problem is this? Well, in Cleveland they \nhad a sting operation a year or so ago and 33 percent of the people who \nthey caught in this sting operation had welfare cards, either receiving \nfood stamps, AFDC, or SSI.\n  In Philadelphia--I went there earlier this year and talked to the \nfugitive task force there--they have 50,000 outstanding fugitive \nwarrants, felony warrants in the city of Philadelphia. And of the \npeople that they have brought in under this task force, the police \nthere claim that 75 percent of the people who they have brought in \ncollect welfare. And there is no way for them to go to the welfare \nagency with this warrant and be able to find out where these people \nlive because one thing the police of Philadelphia told me is that when \nthese folks sign up for welfare, they give the right address because \nthey want those checks to be mailed to the right place.\n  So we have good information and in many cases we have photographs, \nand as you know, in pursuing felons you do not necessarily have a \nrecent photograph. They may have changed appearance. So there are all \nsorts of good reasons this amendment is supported by the chief of \npolice, the FOP--all law enforcement agencies have come out in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate today will adopt this and move forward \nto help police be able to better find fugitives. Remember, these are \ndangerous felons who are hiding out, not taking jobs, by collecting \nGovernment benefits and therefore not signing up for employment where \nthey might otherwise be caught. So we think this is sort of a logical \nexemption to the privacy provisions of the Welfare Act. And I hope that \nthe Senate will support the amendment this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2483, 2484, and 2485, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, to meet the requirements of the \nagreement that has been worked out by the managers of the bill and the \nmajority and minority leaders, I send three amendments to the desk and \nask that it be in order for me to submit them for consideration at this \ntime en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as all Senators know, the Senate is a place \nof tradition, and one tradition we have is honoring those colleagues \nwho preside over the Senate for more than 100 hours a session. Compared \nto Cal Ripken's 2,131 games, 100 hours may not seem like a long time, \nbut presiding over the Senate can be very tough duty.\n  There are periods, of course, when absolutely nothing is happening, \nbut there are also periods when rulings from the Chair may change the \ncourse of legislation or of history itself.\n  Many Senators have presided over the Senate, but I am told that no \nRepublican Senator has ever presided for over 100 hours in a shorter \nperiod of time than the current occupant of the Chair, Senator Mike \nDeWine, of Ohio.\n  It is a pleasure to announce that he is the first recipient of the \nGolden Gavel Award in the 104th Congress. And when Senator DeWine \ndeparts from the chair today, I will invite him back to the cloakroom \nwhere we have a cake in his honor. I know all Senators join me in \ncongratulating the presiding officer on this occasion.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S12876-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12876-S12878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, it is clear that Congress is moving \ninexorably toward what the press is consistently referring to as a \n``train wreck.'' And all of us understand as we look at the budget \nprocess that there is an inevitable confrontation that is going to take \nplace. That train wreck is already beginning to promote a concern in \nthe financial marketplace. It is upsetting people's perceptions about \nwhat Congress is capable of doing or willing to do.\n  And I would like to say at this time, Mr. President, I would like to \nexpress my hope that bipartisanship and common sense will still be \nvirtues here in Washington and that we can take the steps necessary to \navoid any train wreck.\n  It seems to me that all of us ought to be pretty sensitive to what is \nabout to happen. Despite the fact that a huge portion of the public has \nsaid that they did not like the way we do business.\n  Mr. President, a portion of the public has already said to us they do \nnot like the way we do business here. And a lot of us have come to \nunderstand that. Despite the fact that we talk about change, we rarely \naccomplish it. And despite the fact that we claim we want \nbipartisanship and avoid politics as usual, Congress and the President \nare moving in a kind of mindless Alice in Wonderland atmosphere toward \nan inevitable confrontation.\n  And that confrontation is going to leave Americans questioning the \nquality of the leadership of this country and questioning the degree to \nwhich people here are in touch with the real concerns of the American \npeople.\n  I find this a profoundly disturbing and almost incomprehensible \nequation. It is contrary to all of the things that people are asking us \nto do. And yet some people around here seem more content to believe \nthat it is better to have a sort of ripeness to the political \nconfrontation before we sit down and discuss what we are going to do.\n  Mr. President, I think that the American people have made it very \nclear that they want us to behave like adults and they want an \nassurance that critical services are going to continue to be provided \nto the people who pay our bills, who pay our salaries, and who pay for \nthose services. In addition to that, there are very fundamental, basic \nneeds of the country that should not be made poker chips in a political \ngamesmanship one-upmanship process. \n\n[[Page S 12879]]\n\n  Most people have made it very, very clear that their concerns are \nwhether they are going to have a job, whether we are going to do \nsomething about raising their income, whether kids are going to get to \nschool and whether the schools are going to be safe, and whether they \nwill be safe in their communities. These are the real concerns of the \nAmerican people. And every single one of us knows that there are going \nto be some appropriations bills on the floor that are going to be \npassed in a unison of ideological fervor. Those bills are absolutely \npreordained to be vetoed. They are absolutely preordained to have the \nvetoes upheld. And we are absolutely preordained to come here to \nconfront the moment of reality. But that moment of reality is being put \noff into the future in a way that makes the American people the pawns \nin the process.\n  And I guarantee my colleagues--and they know it because I hear them \nsaying it in the back halls--this will not serve America's interests. \nThis will not serve our interests. It will be bad for this institution. \nAnd those of us who I think are concerned about trying to find a \nbipartisan, moderate, commonsense solution would like to suggest that \nrather than waiting for the train wreck, let us do what sensible people \nare supposed to do. Let us sit down now. Let us begin the process now \nof a bipartisan effort to avoid this confrontation and to find out if \nwe can behave like the adults the American people sent us here to \nbehave like. It is not very complicated.\n  I would ask that the President of the United States engage with the \nleadership, with those leaders of the key committees now, and that we \neven invite the American people to participate. Hold a meeting in the \nEast Room. Let C-SPAN be part of the discussion of the priorities of \nthis country. Let them see why there are differences of opinion. Let \nAmerica share together with us an opportunity to prove that we are not \ngoing to conduct business as usual,\n that we are prepared to truly think differently.\n\n  I ask for 1 additional minute, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, rather than go through the process of the \ninevitable confrontation with a continuing resolution, with a then \ndelayed moment of confrontation with another continuing resolution, it \nis incumbent on all of us to have a responsible process in the interest \nof this institution and the American people.\n  I hope that the President of the United States will reach out to the \nleadership, and I hope that the majority leader will not be stuck in a \nposition where he suggests that compromise is impossible.\n  Compromise is the nature of the legislative process. Inevitably, \neveryone knows there will be some kind of compromise. There has to be. \nThe political equation of the veto, the political equation of the \nexecutive versus the legislative branch dictates that that will happen. \nWhat the American people do not want to see is a repeat of the \nWashington Monument and other symbolic closings that ultimately wind up \nwith more than symbolic closings. It is not necessary.\n  So I implore our colleagues, let us not make the American people the \npawns in a political charade. Let us get away from business as usual. \nLet us begin the process of a real dialog now that proves to the \nAmerican people we are prepared to have an important, open, significant \ndebate about the priorities of this country, and we can conduct our \nbusiness in a mature and sensible fashion.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished managers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S12878-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12879-S12893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2466\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire for an opening statement.\n  Mr. President, I rise in an all but empty Chamber to offer an \namendment which is in the nature of a substitute for the bill reported \nfrom the Committee on Finance and later amended by the distinguished \nRepublican leader.\n  On May 26, the committee considered the chairman's mark and the bill \nthat I offered, the Family Support Act of 1995. It failed by a vote of \n12 to 8 in our committee on party lines, with one exception, and it was \nnot a happy moment, much less a promising moment. It was, indeed, a \nforeboding one.\n  Had it not been for the 1994 congressional elections, the wave of \nwhat George Will called a cymbal-clash change of the electorate, this \nmeasure now before the Senate is pretty much the measure we would have \nbeen considering. It brings the Family Support Act of 1988 up to the \nhigher standards, higher expectations that we assumed would come with \ntime and which we also assumed in what might seem the innocence of the \nlast decade would be as bipartisan an effort as was the original.\n  The Family Support Act passed the Senate on June 16, 1988, by a vote \nof 93 to 3. We went to conference. The conference committee agreed. It \ncame back, and on September 29 it passed out of this Senate 96 to 1, \nand then the following day the conference report was agreed to in the \nHouse by a vote of 347 to 53, near to an overwhelming vote. And on \nOctober 13, it was signed by President Reagan in a ceremony in the Rose \nGarden. Then Governor William J. Clinton of Arkansas, the Chairman of \nthe Governors' Association was on hand, as was Governor Mike Castle, \nthen Republican Governor of Delaware. The two of them had helped this \nbipartisan effort in the Governors' Association.\n  President Reagan said:\n\n       I'm pleased to sign into law today a major reform of our \n     Nation's welfare system, the Family Support Act. This bill \n     creates a new emphasis on the importance of work for \n     individuals in the welfare system.\n\n  It basically redefined the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nlegislation, which dates back to 1935. What had been a widow's pension, \nmeant to phase out as survivor's insurance matured in Social Security, \nhad become a wholly different program for a wholly different \npopulation, and within a certain measure of delay, when the time came, \nwe redefined the program, redefined its objectives. We did so, Mr. \nPresident, with a measure of realism, even of modesty, in the face of \nextraordinary change in our social structure, our social system, if you \nwill. This change came suddenly and without warning and to this day it \ncan be quantified but scarcely explained. I refer to the subject that \nhas been spoken about with candor and, I think, understanding, with an \nopenness on the floor in this debate already, which is the rise of out-\nof-wedlock births, from about 6 percent nationwide in 1960 to about 33 \npercent today.\n  I have commented several times that this is something we did not know \nhow to talk about, were not sure we ought to talk about, but which \nPresidents now openly discuss. President Bush was the first President \nto raise this issue in a State of the Union Message. President Clinton \nhas done the same. President Clinton has suggested projections that we \nhave made in our office which could take us surely to 40 percent, a \nnumber without meaning until this moment in history. We could not have \nimagined it.\n  We created the JOBS Program, one of those acronyms, Jobs \nOpportunities and Basic Skills. We set quotas, percentages that States \nhad to meet as they moved along with the funds available, and we began \nto see results.\n  We never promised a very great deal. We made very clear that the \npersons we were concerned about were the persons most in need, and they \nare not difficult to define, Mr. President.\n  About 42 percent of persons who enter the welfare system are there \nfor 24 months or less. They typically are women with children whose \nmarriages have dissolved, and it takes them a period to put their life \nback, their affairs back in order, and they do.\n A fairly considerable amount of research has indicated they do not \nneed anything but time and a certain amount of income support, which is \nwhat the Social Security system is all about.\n\n  On the other hand, a very large proportion of our children enter this \nsystem and stay in it for more than 5 \n\n[[Page S 12880]]\nyears, stay in it for much of their childhood. Seventy-six percent of \npersons on the AFDC rolls at any given time will be on more than 5 \nyears. They are the ones who are most in need. They are the ones who \nare most difficult to help. Those are the ones, when something \nsucceeds, you have saved a life. We should concentrate on that.\n  We were off to a slow start. We had a recession. We had a rise in the \nnumber of out-of-wedlock births. What is worrisome is that the cohort \nof women age 15-24, the age group disproportionately responsible for \nout-of-wedlock births, is expected to rise over the next 10 years. We \nwill have more illegitimacy, and consequently more of a need for \nwelfare assistance. That phrase ``demography is destiny''--demography \nis destiny for the welfare system.\n  In the face of these massive, disturbing, changes in the structure of \nthe family, we enacted the Family Support Act of 1988. For the first \ntime, we said that the single mothers on the welfare rolls must be in \neducation, training, or work to receive their benefits, to the extent \nState resources permit. We gave States great flexibility to experiment. \nAnd we began to get good news from around the country as these programs \ntook effect. The word came out that you can innovate, you ought to try.\n  How many Senators have we heard talking about Riverside, CA? We had \nthe director of that jobs program in to testify before us this spring \nin the Finance Committee, with enthusiasm, full of energy. He had a \nblue button that says ``Life works when you work.'' That sort of energy \nin the executive establishment is to be praised. All across the \ncountry, we began to hear of this program and that program taking hold. \nBut still, the welfare caseload grew.\n  As I said yesterday, our assessment in the Congressional Budget \nOffice is that about half the growth was due to the increase in out-of-\nwedlock births. About a quarter of the decline of the economy is the \nincrease in unemployment. There is a measure in which the economy \naffects welfare dependency. But primarily, welfare dependency derives \nfrom single-parent families. It is affected by the rise in the business \ncycle--but marginally. We are dealing with something very different, \nvery new, just learning our way. And yet, while we simply do not know \nhow to change the behavior which is driving illegitimacy, we are \nlearning how to get welfare recipients off the rolls and into jobs. \nWhat we have learned we have learned under the Family Support Act.\n  That is why it has come as a source of dismay to many students of the \nsubject, scholars such as Lawrence Mead, of New York University, who \ncertainly wishes himself to be understood as conservative in these \nmatters. He said recently of the legislation before us, what we voted \non yesterday and what we will vote on:\n\n       The main effect of block grants would be to disestablish \n     the jobs program which has been the major force pushing \n     States with large caseloads to reform.\n\n  Dr. Meade has commented that even New York is beginning to get the \nmessage. Well, that is a large event. You cannot break the mindset of a \nhalf century instantly. There is a sort of law of retarded response, \nthat large bureaucracies established to provide benefits on a permanent \nbasis to permanently dependent persons, widows react slowly to change, \nand it will take a generation to get it understood that this is no \nlonger the reality.\n  I knew Frances Perkins rather well. She was very much in evidence \nhere in Washington in the early sixties. We began to notice this \nwelfare problem, and I would talk with her about it. When it began, she \nwould describe the typical recipient of the Aid to Families with \nDependent Children. The typical recipient was a West Virginia miner's \nwidow. There was no expectation that she would go to work in the mines. \nIn time, the survivors insurance would take care of that. In time the \nsurvivors insurance did. Only about 71 percent of the persons receiving \nSocial Security benefits are retired persons. The rest are spouses, \nchildren of deceased workers, and persons of that order.\n  We knew we were changing and we knew the change would be difficult, \nbut we built into our legislation very careful evaluation to find what \nworks. We particularly looked to the Manpower Demonstration Research \nCorporation based in New York, which had provided the basic data on \nwhich we enacted the legislation, and they have now reported. They are \nnot easily impressed. They quantify, they measure, and they are very \nrealistic. This is what they recently wrote about an assessment of the \nprogram Nationwide:\n\n       This report represents early evidence that well-\n     implemented, highly mandatory jobs programs that use job \n     search followed by a range of short-term education, training, \n     and other services to promote rapid job entry can produce \n     dramatic reductions in welfare receipt and substantial \n     increases in employment and earnings.\n\n  May I say, Mr. President, the MDRC is not in the habit of referring \nto dramatic reductions. But they have done it. Indeed, we see our \ncaseloads beginning to decline over the last year. They have dropped by \na quarter of a million, 240,000 or almost 5 percent. Most of the \ndecline has come in the 44 smaller States that have about half the \ncaseload. Forty-four States have half of the AFDC cases; six have the \nother half.\n  I have spoken to you, Mr. President, about the degree to which so \nmany of our cities are effectively overwhelmed by this social disorder, \nas it now is. In the city of Chicago, in a given year, 46 percent of \nall children will be on welfare. In Detroit, 67 percent will be. In \nPhiladelphia, 57 percent. In New York, 39 percent. These are numbers \nthat overwhelm a political and a social system. They will stay \noverwhelmed. It will be a generation before we are out of this.\n  But if we now abandon efforts which are beginning to show results, we \nwill regret it. We will regret it if we remember having done it. I \nhave, several times, referred to a remark made on the Charlie Rose show \nby the new director of the National Urban League, Mr. Hugh Price, who \nsaid that what we are proposing is something equal to the measures of \nthe deinstitutionalization of mental patients in the 1960's.\n  I happen to have been much involved in that. The program began in the \n1950's in New York State, where the first tranquilizers were developed. \nI was on hand, Mr. President, when on October 31, 1963, President John \nF. Kennedy had his last public bill signing ceremony. He signed the \nCommunity Mental Health Construction Act of 1963. He gave me a pen, and \nI have had it framed. We were going to build 2,000 community mental \nhealth centers between then and 1980. We were going to empty out our \nmental institutions and treat people in their communities. Well, we \nemptied out our mental institutions, but we did not build the centers. \nWe built about 400 and then forgot what we were doing. Then the problem \nof the homeless appeared, and people said, ``Where did these homeless \npersons come from?\"\n  In my city of New York they said, well, it is obviously the problem \nof lack of affordable housing. It was not a lack of affordable housing. \nIt is schizophrenia, found in a basic incidence of large populations. \nWe did something terribly wrong and we cannot even recover the memory.\n  If in 10 years' time we find children sleeping on grates, picked up \nin the morning frozen, and we ask, why are they scavenging, being awful \nto themselves, awful to one another? Would anyone remember how it \nbegan? It would have begun on the House floor this spring and the \nSenate Chamber this autumn.\n  You will have half a million children in New York City with \naltogether inadequate provision, if any. It will almost be forgotten. \nSuch is the amnesiac quality of so much of our politics, that there was \na time when the Federal Government said it had a responsibility.\n  These children are all our children and we are all responsible for \nthem. If you had more intelligent federalism it would sort so many \nthings out. We have so many things we are doing at the Federal level in \nwhich we have no business.\n  It was remarked yesterday that when the Food Stamp Program began, \nStates were free to set their own levels and they set them at wildly \ndifferent levels, and many were quite inadequate. President Nixon came \nalong and said, no, children are children, they are all American \nchildren. We will have a national standard.\n  President Nixon proposed a guaranteed income. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer was presiding the other day when just by coincidence \na Brazilian \n\n[[Page S 12881]]\nSenator happened to be in Washington and came to watch us, observe us. \nI went out to introduce myself and asked him to come and join us on the \nfloor. Senator Eduardo Suplicy, who gave us a copy of a bill that has \npassed the Brazilian Senate which provided a guaranteed minimum \nincome--all families with children up to age 14.\n  Brazil is doing it, moving in the direction we were. We are moving \naway. We are moving away amidst all manner of myth and misinformation.\n  First of all there is the myth that there is, in fact, an individual \nentitlement to welfare benefits. There is not, sir. States are entitled \nto a Federal matching share of any outlays they make on their own State \nprograms.\n  The Federal share for various States ranges from 50 percent to about \n78 percent. A State may have any program it wishes; it may have no \nprogram and provide $1 per year per child or $1,000 per year per child.\n  The number of actual Federal requirements are relatively few. The \nFederal statute says you can have only $1,000 in assets. All these \nchildren are paupers.\n  The bureaucracy has been too presciptive in detailing how States may \nimplement their programs, and has often taken much too long to approve \nvarious State experiments. But the fact remains that under current law \nStates have a good deal of flexibility, and through the waiver process \nthey can do almost anything they please. There exists now flexibility \nfor innovation, as there exists a Federal commitment to provide a share \nof provision to impoverished dependent children. If we abandon that, we \nabandon those children.\n  The legislation offered in the Finance Committee--I see my \ndistinguished friend from Illinois was there--and now here as an \namendment in the nature of the substitute, would build on the Family \nSupport Act of 1988.\n  We would increase the funding for the Jobs Program from $1.2 billion \nin this coming fiscal year to $2.5 billion. The Federal matching rate \nfor JOBS and child care would go from 60 to 70 percent. The \nparticipation rates would increase from 20 percent this year in stages \nto 50 percent in the year 2001.\n  These are increases we anticipated would be made as we got the hang \nof this effort, got to learn more about it. We learned, for example, \nthat immediate job search is the most important thing; that a focus \nsolely on educational training delays the reality of getting a job.\n  We are even learning to break one of the worst habits we ever \nacquired on this subject, which is disparaging entry-level jobs. My \nLord, how I have spent 30 years listening to ``advocates'' talk about \ndead end jobs. Now the cliche is ``flipping hamburgers.''\n  The present chief executive officer of McDonald's, Ed Rensi, began \nflipping hamburgers. As I recall, he entered his entry wage at 83 cents \nan hour. Everybody starts. It is getting started that matters most.\n  This was our program, Mr. President. We had great hopes for it. It \nwas bipartisan--96 to 1. It has taken hold.\n  If we look around, a great majority of the States have been coming \nin, proposing innovative measures of this kind, such as increasing \nincome--disregards, moving people into the work force.\n  We have a transition from Medicaid provision for a year after leaving \nthe AFDC rolls. We have child care provisions. We thought this out. We \nhave done it. We have done it well. That we should abandon it now would \nbe a great loss to our children. The United States will end up looking \nto the rest of the world as a place that cannot handle its affairs. We \nwill wonder what we did. We have an opportunity to avoid that. We will \nvote in a very short while now.\n  Three years ago we would routinely have upgraded, updated, brought up \nto the expected higher standards the Family Support Act. If we are \nunwilling to do so today, at least in 10 years' time, when the horrors \nwe shall have visited upon the children of the United States begin to \nbe unmistakable, there will be those who can remember this day in this \nChamber and say, ``I saw that coming and I voted to prevent it.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa is managing and would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. But I would like to have the Chair notify me when I have used \n20 minutes because if I have colleagues who want to speak, I want to \nmake sure that they have an opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a defense of the 1988 act from the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. I believe, as one who voted for \nthe 1988 act, that it was pursued from beginning to end with the best \nof intentions. The goals were to move people from welfare to work, from \ndependence to independence, to strengthen the family and even to save \nthe taxpayers money.\n  I have to look back on those efforts as work being sincerely done, \nbut as I look at the evolution of that act, the use of it and what it \nset out to accomplish and has accomplished, I believe I failed when I \nvoted for that bill. I do not want to say that anyone else failed, but \nI look back at our efforts and see 3.1 million more people on AFDC now \nthan we had then as one measure of failure. I see a lot more tax \ndollars being spent as another measure of failure.\n  Now we are being asked by the other side, by the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, to build on the 1988 act. Albeit, \nI am sure, they are suggesting changes in the amendment before us that \nreflect what they see as failures of that 1988 act. But the difference \nbetween the leadership proposal under the distinguished leadership of \nSenator Dole and what the loyal opposition offers is the difference \nbetween night and day.\n  We have seen the Federal Government failing in welfare reform, not \njust since the 1988 act but, we would have to say, over the last \nseveral decades. In contrast, we have seen States succeed where we have \nfailed, States like Missouri and Iowa and Wisconsin, Michigan, \nMassachusetts, New Jersey, and others. That is why we propose to get \nthe Federal Government out of the business of welfare and turn it over \nto the States with the resources to accomplish the goal of ending \nwelfare as we know it.\n  The major difference between what my distinguished friend from New \nYork suggests and what Senator Dole and the Finance Committee on this \nside suggests is whether or not we are going to maintain what is called \nthe Federal entitlement. We propose to end the Federal entitlement. The \nMoynihan proposal maintains it.\n  Republicans propose to save the taxpayers $70 billion. Under the \nMoynihan proposal, the savings is only $2.1 billion. That is $2.1 \nbillion in savings with the proposal on that side of the aisle; $70 \nbillion in savings on the program from this side of the aisle.\n  Now, we do not propose our bill just to save money. We do not propose \nthe ending of the entitlement just to save money. In fact, even if \nthere was not an issue of balancing the budget, the failure of the \nFederal Government, after decades in the welfare business, is why it \nshould be reformed on its own merits, and that is the way we proceed.\n  The litmus test of whether or not there is going to be change in \nWashington, the litmus test of whether it is no longer business as \nusual, is this issue of the Federal entitlement. Our proposal ends the \nFederal entitlement. That side would preserve the Federal entitlement.\n  As I look back at the 1988 legislation, there are things that I see \nas wrong now that I did not see then. It loosened some of the tough \neligibility requirements that were enacted in the 1981 Reagan welfare \nreforms. It expanded the eligibility to two-parent families. It \nprovided for State waivers that would make it possible to reverse still \nmore of those 1981 reforms.\n  I know some people would say we made those waivers available, that is \nwhy these States today are doing what they are doing. That is true. \nBut, also, in the first instance, States were able to seek waivers of \nthe 1981 reforms that were enacted.\n  We also permitted waivers to redefine who was unemployed by basing it \non income earned rather than hours worked. We allowed the term ``strict \nwork requirements'' to be undermined by creating an exemption for \nmothers having another child under 6. We promised a lot of education. \nWe promised a lot of job training. We promised other attractive social \nservices including \n\n[[Page S 12882]]\nchild care and medical services to AFDC recipients who leave the \nwelfare rolls. And the sole price for admission to those rolls was \nhaving that first baby.\n  Now, you can say to me, that any one of those things are very, very \nsmall. These are precisely the reasons, though, why AFDC has grown by \n3.1 million people since 1988. Yes, these results demonstrate, as I \nlook back at the 1988 legislation, that some of those changes were \nwrong. Though each of the changes might have been slight, they created \nincentives which, taken together, have caused the dramatic explosion in \nthe AFDC rolls from 1989 to 1995.\n  Now, I anticipate some will say, ``Well, Grassley, you forget that we \nhad a recession in 1991 and 1992. That obviously had something to do \nwith the explosion of people on AFDC.''\n  Before I respond to that, let me give the statistics on the growth of \nAFDC. There were 3 million in 1960. It rose rapidly through the 1960's \nand early 1970's. It rose rapidly, yes, even into the 1970's and then \nleveled off in 1972.\n  We had a very, very deep recession in 1974 and 1975, and the numbers \ndropped in the middle of that recession. That recession was deeper than \nwhat we had in 1991. The numbers stayed fairly level, though they did \nrise a little bit during the Carter administration, to 11.1 million in \n1981, then they leveled off. They were 10.3 million in 1982, 11 million \nin 1989, and then we had that dramatic increase of another 3 million \npeople that I believe is blamed on the 1988 law.\n We were promised that the numbers would go down as a result of the \n1988 legislation. We thought that the act would steer AFDC parents to \nwork and off the dole. Obviously, the legislation was praised by \nDemocrats as well as Republicans as a final means of reducing welfare \ndependency.\n\n  We heard earlier that President Reagan praised the 1988 act when he \nsigned it into law. But I still maintain, looking back over the \nhistory, that there was a period of time when President Reagan was \nagainst what was going on in the Congress. But we had a candidate for \nPresident in 1988 by the name of President Bush who, all of a sudden, \nat the time of the conference committee, came out and supported the \nlegislation. I think that pulling of the rug out from the efforts to \nmodify the legislation nixed what opportunity we had at that late \nmoment to do more. And that legislation passed with only one dissenting \nvote. It was bipartisan, and I suppose for that reason nobody wants to \nexpose the dramatic failures.\n  I can only speak for myself. But I do see the six or seven reasons \nthat I gave of changes in the 1981 law, some expansion of eligibility \nand the redefinition of unemployed, and the redefinition of strict work \nrequirements as opening up the opportunity for the dramatic growth we \nthen saw. I do not see the growth, Mr. President, in any direct way \nrelated to a recession because we did not have that dramatic of an \nincrease in the last recession that we had in 1974 and 1975.\n  So, we are at the point where we have to consider the new approach to \nwelfare reform, an approach that establishes faith in State governments \nand local governments because they have done a lot to reduce welfare. \nTheir plans are working. Yet, they had to come to the Federal \nGovernment on bended knees, hat in hand, even to get limited waivers to \naccomplish what they wanted to do. I will bet that in most instances \nthey would have been more dramatic, more dynamic in what they would \nwant to try in the way of reform if they had not had to get those \nwaivers. I know my own State of Iowa had to wait 8 months for waivers.\n  Iowa has moved 2,000 people off the welfare rolls and reduced the \nmonthly check from $360 to $340. My State has the highest percentage of \nanybody on AFDC at work, 34 percent. That has been a dramatic increase \nfrom under 18 percent when our program started, less than 2 years ago.\n  President Clinton ran for office in 1992. When he was running for \noffice, he promised to end welfare as we know it. After 2 years of \ninaction, the American people rendered a very dramatic change in \nCongress, so dramatic that some historians say you have to go back to \n1930 to see such a political change at the grassroots in America \nreflected in the membership of Congress. But for the first time since \n1954, Republicans control both Houses of the Congress.\n  The American people said that they wanted change. The people had not \nseen the President and a Congress of the President's party so that \nthere would be no gridlock delivered, as was promised in that 1992 \nelection. They wanted change and they did not receive it. So they voted \nout the old and voted in the new.\n  I stated how in 1988 we passed welfare reform. Unfortunately, it \nfailed our hopes and expectations. We have more people on welfare today \nthan we did then.\n  The proposal that is before us from the other side of the aisle is \nbasically a modification and continuation of the 1988 plan. The only \npositive thing to come out of the 1988 Family Support Act is that some \nStates sought out waivers and came up with changes. As our political \nlaboratories, our State legislatures, they suggested changes which \ncould be made. They began to move people from welfare to work and save \nthe taxpayers' money.\n  The example of the States then is what moved us on this side of the \naisle to our block grant approach as a means of addressing the crisis \nin the current welfare system. We are ending the entitlement approach, \nby ending the attitude that the Federal Government knows the answers to \nall the welfare problems, that we can decide in Washington and we can \npay for them as well.\n  Well, we learned that we do not have all the answers. We have learned \nthat we have not solved all of the problems. And we are finally, after \n30 years, facing up to the fact that we cannot afford all of these \nentitlements.\n  I am surprised when I hear that if we give authority back to the \nStates, children will be left starving in the streets. That has not \nbeen said this morning, but the implication is there when we are told \nthat 10 years from now if we vote for a block grant approach, we are \ngoing to look back and see that it is a mistake. That could be. And we \nhave constitutional authority to reevaluate what we have done. But I \nthink I have seen enough change and improvement in the programs at the \nState level to give me courage to move forward with ending the Federal \nentitlement and to ignore the warnings that I have received from my \ngood friend.\n  Somehow I think some in this body have bought into the idea that we \nat the Federal level know what's best and that we can fix everything. I \nthink it is a fairly arrogant approach to assume that only the Federal \nleaders as opposed to State leaders have compassion towards the needs \nof those less fortunate in our society.\n  In 40 years of Federal control we have seen an increase in \ndependency. We have seen an increase in the number of people on \nwelfare. We have seen an increase in all of the social pathological \nproblems that come from single-parent families.\n  We have heard these statistics over and over, but 70 percent of the \njuveniles in reformatories come from single-parent families, 60 percent \nof the rapists, 72 percent of the adolescent murderers. Kids that come \nfrom broken families are 40 percent more likely to fail a grade, 70 \npercent more likely to be expelled from school. Girls from broken \nfamilies are more likely to have out-of-wedlock births and continue the \nproblem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator he has used \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I am going to take just a few more minutes and then \nyield the floor to my colleagues.\n  We have seen well-intended Federal programs destroy the nuclear \nfamily. And then we see amendments like we have before us today to \ncontinue that form of Federal control.\n  There is something I believe that we as Republicans and Democrats do \nagree on, and that is that the current system must be changed and \nchanged dramatically. How dramatically?\n  Well, not very dramatically from the ideas we are getting from the \nother side of the aisle. When you want to end a Federal entitlement and \nlet the States make the decisions, that is very dramatic.\n  We do not all agree that the welfare state is broken, but both \nRepublicans and Democrats agree that the welfare \n\n[[Page S 12883]]\nsystem within the welfare state is broken, or we would not even have \nthese ideas from the other side of the aisle.\n  The leadership bill meets the basic goals of welfare reform. That is \nto provide a system that meets the short-term needs of low-income \nAmericans as they prepare for independence, to provide for much greater \nState flexibility, to reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock births and \nstrengthen the family, and finally to save the taxpayers some of their \nhard-earned money.\n  It is interesting to me that many Members will oppose the leadership \nbill and support the Moynihan bill because they say our proposal might \nhurt children. Yet I wish that these same Members would admit that the \ncurrent system has hurt children.\n  The system I have described has not been good for our children. If we \ntruly care about these children, we will reform very dramatically the \ncurrent detrimental system.\n  Then you have to consider: If you are concerned about children, you \nalso have to be concerned about children who are not on welfare. And if \nwe are not concerned about doing something about this out-of-control \nFederal spending--though welfare is a small part of it--then we do not \nshow the proper concern for each child born this day who inherits at \nthe first breath $18,000 of responsibility for the $4.9 trillion debt \nwe have. If we do not reverse the deficit crisis, our children, all \nchildren, will pay 80 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxes. Mr. \nPresident, that is wrong. We have to be concerned about the children \nwho are not on welfare as well as children who are on welfare.\n  It is appropriate for us to be concerned about the children of low-\nincome Americans but, frankly, I think it is about time that we are \nconcerned about all the children of America. That means we have to \nreduce the deficit while we change the welfare system to free those who \nare trapped in it. If we take steps to move people from welfare to \nwork, to give more flexibility to the States, to reduce illegitimacy \nand to strengthen the family, we will in the long run save the \ntaxpayers money. This will be the natural result of positive changes to \nthe current system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia would like to offer an amendment, and to do so with \ncelerity. I yield 30 seconds for such purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

The \nSenator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2466\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 90 seconds, first to say \nin response to my friend from Iowa, my long associate on the Committee \non Finance, he was this morning talking of the achievements of the \nState of Iowa in this area, and did so the other day, and he was \ntalking about the achievements under the Family Support Act. There is \nyet a new proposal that came from Iowa, a request for a new set of \ndisregards, and such like, received in April and approved in August for \nthe Iowa Family Investment Program.\n  The Senator is right to be proud, but why not associate what Iowa has \ndone with the legislation that encouraged it. I do not ask a response. \nI do not expect a response. But I would like to put that new Iowa \nFamily Investment Program in the Record at this point, Mr. President. \nIt is one page.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Iowa Family Investment Program\n\n             (Request: April 1993.

Mr. President, again, in response to my friend, it is \nthe fact that in the 1992 campaign, then candidate, now President \nClinton proposed to end welfare as we know it. \n\n[[Page S 12884]]\n In an address to Georgetown University opening his campaign in 1991, \nhe proposed a 2-year limit and now we begin to see the consequences. I \nhave nothing more to say than that except to concede, I hope \ngraciously, the Senator is right. We are ending the Federal entitlement \nto States for the support of dependent children and it is ending what \nwe have known as welfare.\n  Sir, my able colleague and friend from Louisiana would like to speak \nto the experience of Louisiana under the Family Support Act. I am happy \nto yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank very much the ranking member for giving me some \ntime.\n  I, too, was a little confused when the Senator from Iowa was talking \nabout the situation in his State. I have heard many, many times in many \nforums the success of Iowa in being innovative, in creating new \nprograms and ideas of how to solve the problems of welfare reform in \ntheir particular State. And those accomplishments really were \naccomplished under the Family Support Act that was passed in this \nCongress in 1988.\n  That bill, which passed this body by a vote of 96 to 1, allowed \nStates to be creative, allowed States to put in new ideas and new \nprograms. Iowa took advantage of that and I think made some great \nprogress. I think they should be proud of it. But it also is a result \nof actions that this Senate, this body took when we enacted the Family \nSupport Act of 1988, the principal author of which was the ranking \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, the senior Senator from the \nState of New York.\n  Is it perfect? Of course not. Is anything we do ever perfect? Of \ncourse not. But it has allowed for great progress in permitting States \nto be innovative in creating programs that best fit the needs of their \nparticular State.\n  In keeping with that, I wanted to share the experience of my State of \nLouisiana. The headline in the Monroe News Star World of August 14 of \nthis year: ``Project Independence Trims Welfare Rolls Across State.'' \nThis is good news. This was done under the existing program, under the \nFamily Support Act of 1988. There is good news in the land, in many \nStates that have done substantially positive things in getting people \noff welfare. I read from the article. It says:\n  ``In Louisiana, welfare reform is nothing new. Since October of 1990, \nthe number of Louisiana residents receiving Aid to Families with \nDependent Children has dropped 20 percent,'' said Howard Prejeau, \nAssistant Secretary for the Office of Family Support.\n  ``Since 1990, it has dropped 20 percent.'' The article further \ncontinues:\n  ``That decrease,'' he said, ``is due in large part to Project \nIndependence, a program that helps AFDC recipients find jobs and \nincrease their education.''\n Project Independence was created under the Family Support Act of 1988.\n\n  As of June 1995, 11,260 participants received jobs with 8,332 making \nenough money to get off welfare completely, according to a report \nreleased by the Department of Social Services.\n   A program in my State provides child care and transportation, \nabsolutely essential ingredients if we are going to have real reform \nfor those looking for work. Also it helps build up self-esteem by \nteaching the value of working and showing them their own self-worth.\n  Project Independence also has programs to help participants receive \ntheir GED's or high school diplomas, receive associate and 4-year \ndegrees or job-skills training and build resumes through community \nservice work.\n  A report issued by the Public Welfare Association in 1994, Louisiana \nranked last in AFDC caseload growth in the country for 1989 through \n1993.\n  Mr. President, it is not a coincidence that this achievement and this \naccomplishment for my State of Louisiana was produced as a direct \nproduct of the Family Support Act of 1988 offered by the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan. We should recognize and \ncongratulate success where it has occurred. And under this program \nthere have been outstanding examples of real success. We should not \nignore it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding the time.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate during this debate to be \naware of something that is going on around the Nation today that there \nare those individuals trying to hold on to the past with white knuckles \nand using taxpayers' money to do that.\n  I was shocked to find out yesterday that in my hometown of Tulsa, OK, \nwe had a traveling troupe from Texas. These are the regional directors \nof the various agencies: Mr. Steve Weatherford from Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, he is the regional director; Pat Montoya, Health and Human \nServices; and Jim Cantu, of Labor, all converging upon one city, to \nscare the people of Tulsa, OK, into thinking that if we go along with \nthe changes that we are advocating in the welfare system, the changes \nin Government as we know it, the changes that are consistent with the \nrevolution that took place on November 8, 1994, that somehow people are \ngoing to be starving.\n  I am just going to read a couple of the quotes here. And it happens \nthat our mayor in Tulsa is a very strong supporter of President \nClinton, so I am sure she joined in. But Steve Weatherford of HUD said, \n``We are talking about major cuts to our social fabric. * * * We are \ntalking about hundreds of thousands of children and poor people who \nwill be affected in Oklahoma.''\n  We have Pat Montoya with Health and Human Services, ``Tulsa would \nlose more than $5 billion in Federal funding between 1995 and the year \n2002 if the GOP program is adopted.''\n  Jim Cantu of Labor said that GOP budget cuts would ``take food out of \nthe mouths of children and punish 15-year-old mothers.''\n  And on and on and on.\n  You know, I have to join with my fellow Senator from Oklahoma, Don \nNickles, as well as Congressman Steve Largent whose district this city \nof Tulsa is, when we say that there is no better case that can be made \nof the bloated Government and the waste that has taken place today than \nto have these top officials with all their entourage trouping around \ngoing from city to city to scare people and into maintaining the status \nquo.\n  I think that the stories that we are hearing today in conjunction \nwith the welfare bill are very similar to that.\n  I think the most profound thing that was said by the Senator from \nIowa was that if you are really concerned and really having compassion, \nlook at the children who will be born today, if we do not make these \nmajor changes, having to spend 82 percent--I think it has been \ncalculated of their lifetime earnings--on supporting Government. So I \nhope that we can keep this in mind that there is an army of bureaucrats \ntrouping around the country right now, trying to scare people into \nthinking that we cannot afford a major change.\n  Let us keep in mind that in November there was a change, that there \nis a mandate that came with that, and that is, let us end these age-old \nprograms that have been proven failures and change the role of \nGovernment as we have come to know it since the 1960's.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to defer to the Senator from Maine on the \nsame basis we just did a little while ago to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would my friend mind if we alternate at this point?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield the floor to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am very happy to yield 5 minutes of our remaining \ntime to my strong colleague on the Committee on Finance, the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I want to thank the Senator from New York for his \nexemplary leadership in this area and for what I consider to be a \nbrilliant statement earlier.\n  There is so much to say about this subject, one scarcely can say it \nall in 5 minutes. But I am going to just talk about an observation I \nhad a few minutes ago listening to Pat Moynihan on this subject. \n\n[[Page S 12885]]\n\n  The observation had to do with the whole notion of perspective, of \nhow one perceives an issue often dictates the kind of conclusions that \none reaches about it, whether the facts support that perception or not.\n  I was reminded of a fact that Pat Moynihan has been an oracle, if you \nwill, a visionary for a number of years about a number of these issues \ngoing to the social fabric in our country. He has found himself over \ntime derided, criticized for his observations. Then, with the passage \nof time, people come back and say, oh, by the way, that Pat Moynihan \nwas right 20 years ago. He warned us about the increase in \nillegitimacy. He warned us about this development, or he warned us \nabout another development.\n  And so, frankly, it has got to be a little frustrating to him to be \nthat kind of prophet in his own time, pointing the way and trying to \ngive people the facts, the basic information that should influence \ndebates like this one, but I daresay unfortunately all too often do not \ninfluence debates like this one.\n  The fact of the matter is, this is more of a political debate than it \nis anything having to do with reality. The fact of the matter is, this \ndebate is being shaped by hot buttons and wedge issues and frustration \nand, frankly, campaign dynamics more than anything going to the \nexperience, the history, the reality or anything that can be projected \nfor the future.\n  I heard a lot of conversation about this as a revolution we are going \nto go and do things a new way. We are going to get the Federal \nGovernment out of the business of providing for poor children and out \nof setting up the welfare system and the like.\n  The reality is, Mr. President, that there is an old expression that \nthose who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat its \nmistakes. I think that is ancient wisdom that still applies.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Federal Government was not always \nin the business of providing for poor children.\n  Last night, when I made a statement about this issue, I talked about \nthe friendless foundlings and homeless half-orphans, the experience of \nthis country in dealing with the poverty, child poverty particularly, \nbefore the Federal Government ingratiated itself and got involved in \nproviding a national safety net, a national base, if you will, below \nwhich we expect no American child to fall.\n  Well, we apparently did not learn that history or have chosen, \nbecause of our frustration and our aggravation with our inability to \nfix this problem, decided to go back to that, to go back to the model \nthat says the Federal Government has no role and, more to the point, as \na national community because it is not a Federal Government that sets \nout there. We are all as Americans in this democracy--really the \nFederal Government is an expression of all of us as a national \ncommunity. And this legislation, as has been admitted and spoken to \nvery candidly on the floor, says that as a national community we have \nno obligation to poor children in the various locations and locales \naround this country, that a child's situation and the level and degree \nof poverty or privation may well depend on an accident of that child's \ngeography, and that that is OK by this body with the pending \nlegislation.\n  Well, that may be the case. But I submit to you, Mr. President, we \nhave, at a minimum, an obligation to do no harm. As we talk about our \npolitical revolution and anger about politicians making statements or \nwhatever, and we go through all of that, it seems to me we have an \nobligation to do no harm.\n  In my mind, that means that we do not allow ourselves to construct a \nresponse to poverty that will leave the possibility wide open that Pat \nMoynihan might once again be right, will leave the possibility that we \ncould very well wind up with children being found frozen on the grates \non the street corners, that children will no longer have a national \nsafety net, that we will not, as a national community, have a sense of \nobligation and responsibility to poor children.\n  There are estimates that given the leadership proposal, should the \nleadership proposal pass, and this is a preliminary estimate, in my \nState of Illinois alone, it is projected that the number of children by \nthe 21st century--which is not that far from now--the number of \nchildren that will be cut off will be 598,000 children, or 34 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I will be brief. Nationally, the \nnumber of children who are likely to be affected and left with no \nsafety net for their welfare whatsoever in this country will be 12 \nmillion children--12 million children, a third of the children.\n  We already know in this country, in America, right now we have the \nhighest child poverty rate in the entire industrialized world. That, in \nand of itself, ought to make us mindful of our obligation to do better \nby the response to poverty that we construct in this legislative body \nthan the hot button and the politics that is apparently driving the \ndebate today. If anything, that perspective makes me very sad.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Moynihan for continuing to raise the \nissues that these are a phenomenon that transcends anything the Federal \nGovernment standing alone can do or any bill standing alone will do. \nThese are the issues that go to the core of fundamental issues having \nto do with the functioning of our economy, with the existence of \npoverty and with the breakdown of the family as a unit.\n  Those kinds of concerns are not being addressed by the leadership \nbill, and I hope that the Members will support Senator Moynihan's \namendment, at least with the prescription that as we move in this very \nsensitive and important area, we do no harm to the children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from New York he \nhas 2 minutes and 15 seconds. The Senator from Iowa has 17 minutes and \n6 seconds. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor to the Senator from Maine, on the \nsame basis that we did the Senator from West Virginia earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator from Arkansas just offered the amendment. So I \nyield back my few seconds. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time does Senator Moynihan have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 1 minute \nremaining. The Senator from Iowa has 15 minutes, 30 seconds remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2466\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to use the same amount of \ntime Senator Moynihan has left, and then I will yield back my time.\n  I would like to respond to a couple statements that have been made, I \nthink one by Senator Moynihan, the other one by Senator Breaux. They \neach made the point that since my State of Iowa has been doing so well \nin getting waivers, why should we not just continue building upon the \n1988 act.\n  The point here, Mr. President, is first, that it takes such a very, \nvery long time to get a waiver. Second, I believe state legislatures, \nin changing their welfare laws with the hopes of getting a waiver, are \nrelatively less dynamic and venturesome than they would be if they had \nthe sole authority to make a determination of what they wanted in \nwelfare reform for their State.\n  Just to show you how complicated it is to get such a waiver approved, \na State can sometimes be caught getting waivers from four different \nFederal Departments: The Department of Health and Human Services, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and the Department of Labor.\n  All four of these Departments are, in one way or another, responsible \nfor programs that affect low-income families served by our current \nwelfare system. However, there is no coordination among these \nDepartments in granting waivers to the States. In fact, each specific \nprogram has its own set of statutes and rules defining the parameters \nof possible waivers.\n  I could give you description after description of what my State of \nIowa has gone through. In the first days of debate on this legislation, \nwe heard speeches by the Senator from Oregon about the complicated \nprocess of waivers that Oregon had to go through, the multitudes of \nmeetings, the multitudes of trips to Washington, DC, the changes that \nwere required, and then they had to go back through the approval \nprocess again. We want to end the process by which the coequal States \nof our Union come to Washington hat in hand on bended knee to get these \nwaivers.\n  The last point I will make is this. We have had the opportunity again \ntoday to hear from the Senator from Illinois about the plight of \nchildren. She does this very well.\n  There is no disputing anything she says, including the facts and \nfigures that she has given of the rapid increase in the number of \nchildren in those circumstances.\n  But let me remind her--let me remind everybody--as we debate welfare \n\n[[Page S 12887]]\n  reform, as we consider a change of this system, that all the problems \nshe describes are under a failed system. All those statistics that have \nincreased in number, such as the number of people in poverty--the \nsystem that is being defended today, is the cause of those increases.\n  It is about time that we try something new. I think we have seen the \nsuccess of the States, and we ought to move to a new approach.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against the Moynihan amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And I yield 1 minute of the 2 minutes, generously \nprovided by the Senator from Iowa, to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmeasure be set aside for the purposes of sending amendments to the \ndesk, not being counted against my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2496, 2497, and 2498, en bloc, to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I send all three amendments to the desk, \nen bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senator Moynihan \nfor putting together the only welfare alternative that is really based \non what we know about welfare, what the problems are, what we can fix, \nand what we can't fix.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I was struck by the fact that \nwe held several months of hearings, heard from academic experts, State \nadministrators, Governors, people who work with young mothers in \nresidential programs, and job placement specialists. We heard all their \nsuggestions about what could be improved, and then we proceeded to \nignore all their advice. We simply ignored it.\n  Instead we adopted a solution that serves the political purpose of \nclaiming that we've eliminated welfare, but in reality, does nothing. \nIt turns over the whole thing, with all its problems, to the States, in \nthe hopes that they can figure it out.\n  Senator Moynihan took the right approach. He looked at his own \ngreatest accomplishment, the Family Support Act of 1988, and was \nwilling to acknowledge that it had fallen short of our expectations in \nsome very distinct ways:\n  First, the JOBS Program overall was not successful at moving people \ninto work. It put too little emphasis on real work and discouraged real \neducation, leaving people to waste their time in empty job search \nprograms and structured study halls. Some programs actually delayed \nrecipients getting jobs longer than if they hadn't been in the program. \nBut several counties and States found ways to do much better, by \nstriving to place people directly into real jobs and building the \ntraining around those jobs. This amendment shifts the focus of the JOBS \nProgram to build on its strengths rather than its shortcomings.\n  Second, AFDC overall, and the JOBS Program in particular, don't give \nStates enough flexibility to find their own solutions. That's not an \nargument for handing the States a fixed pot of money and washing our \nhands of the whole thing. Instead, it's an argument for giving the \nStates flexibility within clear standards, requiring the States to \nstructure the JOBS Program as they see fit but requiring results. This \namendment does just that.\n  Third, we made a mistake in 1988 that we are now on the verge of \nmaking all over again, in much greater magnitude: We made big promises \nand failed to invest. Taking individuals from the middle of the turmoil \nof America's cities, from the turmoil of their own families and \nneighborhoods, individuals who are caring for children, and helping \nthem to become economically self-sufficient is an enormous challenge. \nIt means giving each person almost constant attention, helping them \nfind a way to balance work and family, helping them master new skills, \ncompensating for the failures of the elementary and secondary school \nsystem. It means sticking with people after they find their first job, \nhelping them keep that job and move on to a better one. It cannot be \ndone with slogans or wishes. It requires an investment.\n  Since 1988, we have spent only $1 billion a year on the JOBS Program, \nand much of that has gone unspent because States have not been willing \nor able to come up with their share. This amendment is the only \nalternative that makes realistic promises about getting people to work \nand puts the investment behind it.\n  The argument I have heard against this amendment is simply that it \nretains the entitlement. That's an evil \n\n[[Page S 12888]]\nwork, but what does it really mean? It means that States will get an \namount of money equal to what they need--when hardship increases \nbecause of the economy, States will have the resources they need. It \nmeans that individuals who need help will get it, as long as they make \nan effort to become self-sufficient. Nobody is entitled to anything if \nthey don't follow the rules. And the States can set the rules with \ngreater flexibility under this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Moynihan's \nalternative. It is the only welfare bill we will vote on that is based \non reality and not slogans. It builds on the successful piece of \nlegislation in 1988 by repairing its most glaring flaws. It will not \nend welfare as we know it, but it will reform welfare into a system \nthat strengthens families, that connects parents to work, that brings \nfathers back into the family, and that promotes innovation.\n  Those may seem like modest expectations compared to the slogans that \nwe hear on this floor throughout this debate. But if we can accomplish \nthis much, we will have reason to be proud.\n  This amendment and this alternative deserves the Senate's support.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator \nMoynihan for his tireless efforts to educate this body and indeed the \nAmerican people about the causes of poverty in modern society. Spanning \nfour decades, Senator Moynihan has performed several roles in the \neffort to end poverty. Throughout his distinguished career, he has been \na professor, a planner, an economist, a social scientist, an advocate, \nand an author, as well as a brilliant legislator and dedicated public \nservant.\n  But most of all, he has been right about the causes of poverty amidst \nthe wealthiest nation on earth. He has given us, chapter and verse, the \nreasons why the number of children receiving AFDC has increased \nthreefold since a small group in the Office of Economic Opportunity \nmapped out the War on Poverty 30 years ago.\n  Senator Moynihan predicted the growing tragedy of the American \nwelfare system. He was right because he knew then, as he maintains \ntoday that there are consequences to behavior.\n  But we are here today because knowing why something happens does not \nnecessarily tell us how to modify the predictable results. In fact, we \nnow have 30 years of experience which tells us that despite the best of \nintentions, the Federal Government cannot replace strong families. The \nneeds of children and families cannot be reduced to mathematical \ndiagrams. The wisdom of Solomon is rarely found in the Federal \nRegister.\n  Under the present welfare system, we now have over 9 million children \nreceiving AFDC benefits. If we do nothing, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services projects there will be 12 million children on AFDC \nwithin 10 years. That is what the present system will bring. This fact \nalone should embolden us to act in a dramatic way to change the status \nquo.\n  Today, we have the choice between two different approaches to \nchanging the welfare system. There are several important, fundamental \ndifferences between Senator Moynihan's proposal and the Republican \nlegislation. Perhaps the most important difference is the role of the \nFederal Government. It is time to release the grasp of Washington which \nfor too long has choked off the initiative and creativity of the States \nin answering the challenges of the welfare system. If the States remain \ndependent on Washington, they will not take the bold steps we need and \nshould encourage to the vexing problems of our welfare system. The \nStates do not need another Washington-based approach. They do not need \nanother revision based on a faulty premise. Our block grant approach \nwill free the 50 sovereign States to serve their needy citizens in the \nmost effective manner possible. It is time to leave the past behind and \nplace our confidence in the states to meet the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I will send it to the desk and ask it be set aside so it \nmay be covered--may be discussed and acted upon next week.\n  Yesterday I told this Chamber about a situation in Sedalia, MO, where \nwe are attempting to get people off of welfare into an employment \nsituation. The program is working well except we found that when \nwelfare recipients, AFDC recipients, went to the employer and tested \npositively for drugs and were refused a job, the State was prohibited \nunder Federal regulations from cutting them off from their AFDC aid. So \nwe have a situation where, if someone wants to stay on welfare and does \nnot want to have to take a job, they could use drugs, be disqualified \nfrom taking a position because of drug tests, and could not be \nsanctioned by the State.\n  This measure very simply states that notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, a State shall not be prohibited by the Federal \nGovernment from sanctioning welfare recipients who test positive for \nuse of controlled substances.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2499 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n\n[[Page S 12889]]\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2500 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment \nbecause I am extremely concerned that the current provisions in this \nbill will neglect and ignore a very important segment of our \npopulation--displaced homemakers. Nationwide, there are over 17 million \ndisplaced homemakers with close to 700,000 in Ohio. The current Perkins \nVocational programs for displaced homemakers and single parents has \nbeen extremely effective. Approximately 80 percent of women served in \nthese programs are placed in employment and/or post-secondary \neducation. I repeat, 80 percent. Now, if this is not considered a \nsuccess story, I do not know what is.\n  This is a good example in which something that we created many years \nago, works and works well. Recent statistics show that 85 percent of \nformer program participants across the Nation rated the displaced\n homemakers programs excellent or very good. Over 75 percent said that \nthese programs were better than other government-funded programs they \nhad participated in.\n\n  You know why the success rate is so high? It's because people like \nAmber McDonald of Akron, OH take their training very seriously and are \ndead set on getting off welfare.\n  In a recent letter to me, Amber wrote:\n\n       I'd like to state that I am on public assistance at this \n     time in my life and have one child. I don't take pride in the \n     fact I receive welfare. I am grateful to the State of Ohio \n     for their help. It has allowed me to survive and keep my \n     child. It's a long hard road to getting off assistance. One I \n     believe I'm on now. I am attending displaced homemaker \n     classes and these classes have helped me make decisions--good \n     solid decisions. Not the ``please-the-system-decisions I've \n     made in the past. The Displaced Homemaker classes educated me \n     about where I could go, what I would need to succeed and how \n     to go about it. We need this program and others like it. A \n     lot of us want off welfare. We are as tired of being on the \n     system as the system is of having us.\n\n  Before 1984, when States were not required to fund displaced \nhomemakers' training activities, States unfortunately spent less than 1 \npercent of their funding on specialized services for displaced \nhomemakers. This is unfortunate because programs for single parents and \ndisplaced homemakers have been effective in both preventing families \nfrom entering the welfare system and helping families move from the \nwelfare system. And displaced homemakers remain an at-risk population. \nAccording to the 1980 census, more than half of the displaced \nhomemakers live in or near poverty.\n  My amendment will not, I repeat, will not result in a set aside. This \namendment will only make it permissible for States to fund for \nspecialized vocational training programs. States will have the \nflexibility in determining the funding amount and the types of programs \nto institute. I just want to make sure that States are encouraged to \ncontinue these programs that are working.\n  I have been hearing from many people from Ohio who have benefited \nfrom these services. These women are now gainfully employed; they are \noff welfare. And they are providing for their families. Are these not \nthe outcomes we want?\n  For example, Rebecca Richards from Fairfield, OH, wrote how her and \nher child's life changed since she participated in a displaced \nhomemaker program. She said ``As a result of the programs available, I \nwas able to become a productive person in society.'' and she concluded \nby saying ``With the program, I found a friend who counseled me, \nlistened to complaints and successes, gave me useful information and \ntraining, and helped me meet with other single parents to form a \nnetwork of friends.'' Let us face it, the traditional vocational \ntraining programs will not provide this type of training.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which \nis central to the welfare reform debate. Another Ohioan--Diane Cook--\nwrote me saying that ``Everyone makes mistakes but they all should be \nallowed a second chance. Give us that second chance.''\n  The bottom line is to get people off welfare and to keep them off \nwelfare. What better way to accomplish this objective than encouraging \nthe States to tailor training programs which will affect over 17 \nmillion women. Mr. President, let us give them that second chance. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be set aside \npending consideration of the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENTERPRISE ZONES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Many of the Nation's urban centers are places with high \n     levels of poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high \n     crime rates, poor schools, and joblessness;\n       (2) Federal tax incentives and regulatory reforms can \n     encourage economic growth, job creation and small business \n     formation in many urban centers;\n       (3) Encouraging private sector investment in America's \n     economically distressed urban and rural areas is essential to \n     breaking the cycle of poverty and the related ills of crime, \n     drug abuse, illiteracy, welfare dependency, and unemployment;\n       (4) The empowerment zones enacted in 1993 should be \n     enhanced by providing incentives to increase entrepreneurial \n     growth, capital formation, job creation, educational \n     opportunities and homeownership in the designated communities \n     and zones;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore, it is the Sense of the \n     Senate that the Congress should adopt enterprise zone \n     legislation in the 104th Congress, and that such enterprise \n     zone legislation provide the following incentives and \n     provisions:\n       (1) Federal tax incentives that expand access to capital, \n     increase the formation and expansion of small businesses, and \n     promote commercial revitalization;\n       (2) Regulatory reforms that allow localities to petition \n     Federal agencies, subject to the relevant agencies' approval, \n     for waivers or modifications of regulations to improve job \n     creation, small business formation and expansion, community \n     development, or economic revitalization objectives of the \n     enterprise zones;\n       (3) Homeownership incentives and grants to encourage \n     resident management of public housing and home ownership of \n     public housing;\n       (4) School reform pilot projects in certain designated \n     enterprise zones to provide low-income parents with new and \n     expanded educational options for their children's elementary \n     and secondary schooling.\n                           Amendment No. 2512\n\n(Purpose: To increase the block grant amount to States that reduce out-\n                           of-wedlock births)\n\n       On page 46, after line 24, insert the following:\n       ``(a) Grant Increased to Reward States That Reduce Out-of-\n     wedlock Births.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The amount of the grant payable to a \n     State under section 403(a)(1)(A) for fiscal years 1998, 1999, \n     and 2000 shall be increased by--\n       ``(A) 5 percent if--\n       ``(i) the illegitimacy ratio of the State for the fiscal \n     year is at least 1 percentage point lower than the \n     illegitimacy ratio of the State for fiscal year 1995;

The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate? \n\n[[Page S 12894]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Boxer amendment \nNo. 2482.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2508\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the portion of the unanimous-consent \nagreement which laid aside consideration of the Brown amendment until \nnext Monday be waived and that I be allowed to bring up the Brown \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I therefore call up amendment No. 2508, the \nBrown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. \nWhen it was initially offered, it was read.\n  Let me simply reiterate for the benefit of Members who may not have \nbeen here at the time, what it does is place a limit of 15 percent on \nthe Federal funds that may be used for administrative expenditures \nunder the temporary assistance block grant. This is under title I.\n  Mr. President, what this suggests is that at least 85 percent of the \nmoney that is given in a block grant go to actual assistance and only \n15 percent, or a maximum of 15 percent go for bureaucracy or \nadministrative costs.\n  History shows that the vast majority of our States can and do live \nwithin this limitation already. Frankly, my purpose in offering it is \nto make it clear that this money is not simply to be consumed in \nadministrative costs but to go to programs and to go to the people \nwhere it will do some good.\n  One may reasonably ask, is 15 percent reasonable?\n  I might say that three-fourths of the States already operate within \nthat for comparable programs. But I also might mention that the other \nparts of the welfare bill have limitations on administrative costs and \nthat this is perhaps more generous than most of those.\n  Let me be specific. In the child care block grant the cap is 5 \npercent whereas this is 15 percent. Job training coordination for \nstatewide work force education is a 1-percent cap--that is 5 percent of \nthe 20 percent. The statewide work force employment program versus the \neducation program is a 5-percent cap. The food stamp block grant option \nis a 6-percent cap. So by suggesting a 15-percent cap for \nadministrative costs we are not trying to be overly tight with the \nStates but we do think some upper limit with regard to administrative \ncosts is appropriate, that is, essential.\n  How many times have we heard from our States and counties where we \nhave said most of the money that was sent to them, or a large portion \nof the money that was sent to them, to deal with a problem is consumed \nat the State level for administrative costs, money that does not go to \nhelp people, money that may not go to directly dealing with the people \nat hand.\n  The 50-percent maximum limit is reasonable. It is one that States can \nlive with. And, frankly, Mr. President, what it says is this money is \nmeant to help people and goes to effect a program, not to simply be \nconsumed by new bureaucracies at a State level.\n  With the broad new discretion given the States, this sort of \nreasonable upper limit for bureaucracy, I think, is appropriate and \nneeded. The saddest commentary of all would be if delineating the money \nto the States, doing away with the Federal bureaucracy, ended up \nproducing a whole new huge bureaucracy on the State level. So a \nreasonable limit is needed, appropriate.\n  I urge its adoption, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, on this amendment I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would rise in support of the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Colorado. I think in this whole process of moving from categorical \nprograms administered from Washington to more flexible programs, you \ncan also call block grants to the States. I think we have an \nappropriate responsibility to the Federal taxpayers to make sure that \nmoney is not eaten up in excess administrative costs.\n  I think the Brown amendment is a step in the right\n   direction. I do not think very many States would exceed that anyway, \nand probably very few States exceed that presently. But we are moving \ninto a program of what we think is of considerable length. And I have \nalways said that to meet the Federal responsibilities on block grants \nit is legitimate to put limits on administrative expenses, to have some \nnational goals that ought to be met, and to have a targeted population \ndescribed by the Federal taxpayers.\n\n  It seems to me that this solves one of those major, legitimate issues \nthat we ought to deal with here, albeit at the same time we are going \nto give the maximum discretion to the States on the administering of \nthe welfare program. So I compliment the Senator from Colorado for his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Brown amendment to the welfare bill \nsounds good on the surface, and I suspect it will pass by a large \nmargin. But, I will vote against it, and I want to explain why.\n  The fact is, this amendment would be prejudicial to my State of \nDelaware. It would require all States to treat their Federal welfare \nblock grant funds as if they were State revenues, thus requiring the \nmoneys to be appropriated by the State legislature.\n  However, Delaware is one of only six States where the General \nAssembly has decided that Federal moneys can bypass the State \nlegislature and be directly appropriated to a State agency by the \ngovernor. In other words, State legislators in Delaware have decided \nthemselves to forego the right to appropriate Federal funds.\n  I simply do not believe that this bill is the time or the place to \nchange my State's budget law and longstanding appropriations process. \nIf the Delaware General Assembly wants to appropriate the Federal funds \nthat Delaware receives, the General Assembly is fully within its rights \nto change Delaware's law. But, I cannot support imposing that on my \nState--especially in a bill that is intended, according to its \nsponsors, to give States more rights and flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this appears to me to be another \namendment that will make the block grant unworkable. And I entirely \nsupport that.\n  I believe the yeas and nays have been requested?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2508 offered by the Senator from Colorado.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], \nthe Senator from Mississippi [Mr. \n\n[[Page S 12895]]\nCochran], the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator \nfrom Alabama [Mr. Shelby] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] is \nabsent due to illness.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, pursuant to the previous agreement, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be briefly set aside so \nthat I and Senator Helms, in that order, may send amendments to the \ndesk and ask for their immediate consideration in accordance with the \nunanimous consent agreement already agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I assume after those two \nare laid down we will go to my amendment. I need only 1 minute to \nexplain it.\n  Mr. HATCH. As soon as we do this procedural matter and we conclude \nthis, we will move right to the Senator from California. I include that \nin the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, may I please have an \nunderstanding of what the procedure is?\n  The Senator from Nebraska also has an amendment to offer that I have \nbeen waiting to offer for some time. I am not in any particular rush. \nAre we setting up an order?\n  If the unanimous consent request is granted, as I understand it, \nthere would be some motion taken up offered by the Senators from North \nCarolina and Utah, and following that we will go to the Senator from \nCalifornia; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. We would be happy to have the Senator put \nhis in, but we are not making arguments at this time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska would like to speak, and we had anticipated after the \nvote on the Boxer amendment other Senators would speak. I see the \nSenator from Idaho may wish to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. My understanding is that the Boxer amendment will require \na vote so we want to move forward as fast as we can.\n  Mr. EXON. With that understanding, I have no objection, and after the \nvote on the Boxer amendment I will proceed at that time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been informed immediately following the Boxer vote \nthat Senator Craig has reserved some time; will the Senator from \nNebraska wait until after Senator Craig?\n  Mr. EXON. Sure. With the understanding I be recognized sometime prior \nto 5 p.m.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be briefly set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2516 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n(Purpose: To establish a block grant program for the provision of child \n                             care services)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 2516 to amendment No. \n     2280.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in this amendment \nby the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. I invite all my colleagues \nto review this amendment and join us as cosponsors.\n  This is not a partisan proposal. It is intended to assist States in \nmaking child care services a key component of their title I temporary \nassistance programs.\n  We will be discussing this amendment in more detail later, but let me \nsimply say today that I believe this amendment addresses a broadly \nrecognized need for child care by families who are on welfare and \nstruggling to get off.\n  Obviously, for a single parent, child care is necessary in order for \nthat parent to work. A mother or father cannot leave a young child at \nhome alone.\n  Mr. President, I believe in the work requirements incorporated in the \nDole substitute. I happen to believe that work--and the sense of \npersonal accomplishment that comes from it--is one of the single most \nimportant things we can provide to welfare recipients. But, we cannot \ndo it without child care.\n  My amendment simply provides a child care block grant into the title \nI temporary assistance block grant. It is not complicated. It carries \nno new administrative requirements.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this next week. I invite \nmy colleagues to join Senator Kohl and me in sponsoring this important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nbriefly set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2517, 2518, and 2519, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send three amendments to the desk on behalf of Senator \nDeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. DeWine, proposes \n     amendments, en bloc, numbered 2517 through 2519 to amendment \n     No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof Senator Boxer, amendment No. 2482.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand I have 60 seconds. I will use \n30 seconds to explain my amendment.\n  What we are saying here is if you are a deadbeat dad or a deadbeat \nmom and have fallen behind on your child support more than 2 months, \nyou must not be eligible for means-tested Federal benefits.\n  I have modified that amendment with the help of Senator Santorum. We \nexclude emergency medical care and nutrition assistance for teenage \nparents, but basically if you do not sign a repayment schedule \ncommitting yourself to make up for those delinquent payments, you will \nnot get benefits such as housing assistance or SSI or food stamps.\n  We feel it is very important to send a message to deadbeat parents. I \nask Senators to give us an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2482), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 712, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 972.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 302, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 506. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT OF FEDERAL BENEFITS TO \n                   CERTAIN PERSONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and except as provided in subsection (b), Federal benefits \n     shall not be paid or provided to any person who is not a \n     person lawfully present within the United States.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to the following benefits:\n       (1) Emergency medical services under title XIX of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       (2) Short-term emergency disaster relief.\n       (3) Assistance or benefits under the National School Lunch \n     Act.\n       (4) Assistance or benefits under the Child Nutrition Act of \n     1966.\n       (5) Public health assistance for immunizations and, if the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that it is \n     necessary to prevent the spread of a serious communicable \n     disease, for testing and treatment of such disease.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Federal benefit.--The term ``Federal benefit'' means--\n       (A) the issuance of any grant, contract, loan, professional \n     license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the \n     United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) any retirement, welfare, Social Security, health, \n     disability, veterans benefit, public housing, education, food \n     stamps, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit \n     for which payments or assistance are provided by an agency of \n     the United States or by appropriated funds of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Veterans benefit.--The term ``veterans benefit'' means \n     all benefits provided to veterans, their families, or \n     survivors by virtue of the service of a veteran in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (3) Person lawfully present within the united states.--The \n     term ``person lawfully present within the United States'' \n     means a person who, at the time the person applies for, \n     receives, or attempts to receive a Federal benefit, is a \n     United States citizen, a permanent resident alien, an alien \n     whose deportation has been withheld under section 243(h) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1253(h)), and \n     asylee, a refugee, a parolee who has been paroled for a \n     period of at least 1 year, a national, or a national of the \n     United States for purposes of the immigration laws of the \n     United States (as defined in section 101(a)(17) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)).\n       (d) State Obligation.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, a State that administers a program that provides a \n     Federal benefit (described in section 506(c)(1)) or provides \n     State bene\n      fits pursuant to such a program shall not be required to \n     provide such benefit to a person who is not a person \n     lawfully present within the United States (as defined in \n     section 506(c)(3)) through a State agency or with \n     appropriated funds of such State.\n       (e) Verification of Eligibility.--\n       (1) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General of the United \n     States, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, shall promulgate regulations requiring \n     verification that a person applying for a Federal benefit, \n     including a benefit described in section 506(b), is a person \n     lawfully present within the United States and is eligible to \n     receive such benefit. Such regulations shall, to the extent \n     feasible, require that information requested and exchanged be \n     similar in form and manner to information requested and \n     exchanged under section 1137 of the Social Security Act.\n       (2) State Compliance.--Not later than 24 months after the \n     date the regulations described in subsection (1) are adopted, \n     a State that administers a program that provides a Federal \n     benefit described in such subsection shall have in effect a \n     verification system that complies with the regulations.\n       (3) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     the purpose of this section.\n       (f) Severability.--If any provision of this title or the \n     application of such provision to any person or circumstance \n     is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this title \n     and the application of the provisions of such to any person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \npending welfare reform bill to address the issue of payment of Federal \nbenefits to illegal aliens. I have talked with the managers of the \nbill, and I have agreed to offer it now, to briefly debate the matter, \nand we will schedule a vote and possibly limited debate sometime next \nweek as we move through the whole series of amendments we have pending.\n  Mr. President, I introduced a similar measure, S. 918, earlier in \nthis Congress. As many Senators know, I have long supported blocking \nFederal benefits to illegal aliens as a matter of both sound \nimmigration policy and as a matter of sound fiscal policy. I have \nintroduced this measure as either a stand-alone bill or as an amendment \nin every Congress since 1989.\n  In 1993, when we debated the comprehensive crime bill, the Senate \naccepted my amendment to restrict benefits to illegal aliens by a vote \nof 85 to 2. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the provision was dropped in \nconference with the House of Representatives. Simply stated, my \namendment says that Federal benefits shall not be paid or provided to \nthose not lawfully present within the United States. My \n\n[[Page S 12899]]\namendment is well crafted to only deny illegals the benefit of Federal \nsupport and specifically defines who is a person lawfully present \nwithin the United States.\n  My amendment also provides for a number of exemptions. Federal funds \ncould be provided to illegal aliens for emergency medical services, \ndisaster relief, school lunches, child nutrition and immunization. Sick \npeople would not be turned away at the hospital emergency rooms, nor \nwould the public health be threatened by a communicable disease.\n  We must draw the line and say that illegal aliens should not be \nreceiving scarce resources except for true emergencies and public \nhealth concerns.\n  Also, States would not be obligated to provide benefits to those not \nlawfully present in our country. Following the publishing of the rules \nby the Attorney General, the States would have 2 years to comply with \nthe verification requirements, and necessary funds would be authorized.\n  It should be noted that the long-awaited report of the U.S. \nCommission on Immigration Reform, headed by former Representative \nBarbara Jordan, has generally recommended that illegal aliens not \nreceive publicly funded services or assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is true that many Federal programs specifically \nexclude by statute illegal aliens in their criteria for eligibility, \nbut in many cases the benefits continue to flow to these illegal aliens \ndue to the expansive and misguided agency regulations and court \ninterpretation.\n  Many Federal programs allow benefits to go to aliens permanently \nresiding in the United States under color of law. However, this \ncategory is not defined by statute, and the categories of aliens it \ncovers vary from program to program because various court decisions \nhave defined it differently. I am sure that my fellow colleagues are \nwell aware of the published growing concern with our country's \nhaphazard immigration policy and porous border. I believe this debate \nover welfare reform provides us with a golden opportunity to create a \nnew and more coherent policy regarding immigrants and to stop, once and \nfor all, the payment of benefits to illegal aliens.\n  The Senate appears ready to give the States more flexibility and \nresponsibility to oversee Federal programs. I think it is only fair \nthat in exchange for the increased flexibility and discretion, the \nFederal Government should ask the States to stand with us in verifying \nimmigrant status and help identify illegal aliens.\n  With the assistance of the States in the verification process, few \nillegals will receive benefits. And both Federal and State budgets will \nreflect those savings. It is the simple fact that a deported alien will \nnot be available to collect welfare benefits that are desperately \nneeded by many of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, the Federal Government and the States \nhave been working at cross-purposes in enforcing our immigration laws. \nThe States have decried the inability of the Federal Government to \npolice our borders. Yet when Congress proposes dropping the payment of \nbenefits to illegal aliens, the States complain that they will be \nsaddled with the full cost of providing these services.\n  It is only reasonable to require States to verify the status of \napplicants provided we help give them the resources to do the job. By \nallowing States to deny benefits to these not lawfully present and \nproviding funds for States to set up verification systems, my amendment \nis actually a fully funded mandate.\n  I believe we must do more regarding immigration reform itself. I feel \nstrongly that deportation proceedings should be expedited, and there \nneeds to be greater enforcement when holders of temporary visas \nintentionally overstay their visit. I also believe that there needs to \nbe a stricter enforcement of sponsor affidavits and the deeming \nprovision to ensure that immigrants will not be a burden to taxpayers. \nEfforts to provide better border patrols and to attack asylum abuse are \nalso needed. The widespread abuse of identification cards by illegal \naliens is a major problem. The production of false resident alien \ncards, drivers' licenses, and Social Security cards is a multimillion \ndollar national crime which only aids illegal aliens receiving \nGovernment benefits. It must be stopped.\n  The word is out, if you want to receive welfare benefits more \ngenerous than any, come to America. Do not even bother to enter \nlegally. By allowing the payment of benefits to illegal aliens, we have \nbecome a magnet. In the past, immigrants came to America to work hard \nand prosper under freedom, but today too many are coming to receive the \nfree ride.\n  Finally, and in closing, Mr. President, I must address briefly the \noverall context in which this issue is being discussed. Right now we \nare debating the welfare bill which will have great impact on those in \nour country who are in need. While I believe that our welfare system \nneeds a major overhaul, I am concerned that those who are truly in need \nwill bear an undue share of the burden. In these times of massive \nbudget reductions, I must remind all that our Government is still \nthere. It still has the responsibility to help its needy citizens. By \nproviding Federal funds to those that are in our country illegally, we \nare misusing scarce resources. We simply cannot justify nor can we \nafford giving Federal benefits to people who are in our country \nillegally.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. And I will make an understanding \nwith the managers of the bill when we will take up this matter again at \nthe beginning of next week.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to the \nWorkforce Development Act, which is contained in this larger welfare \nreform measure, for myself and Mr. Pell.\n  This amendment is very similar to one I offered in the Labor \nCommittee when we considered the Workforce Development bill. While I \ncertainly believe there is much that can be improved upon in the \nWorkforce Development bill, this amendment is quite modest and accepts \nthe basic premise of the bill of moving Federal job training programs \nto the States.\n  However, even in a block grant environment, I believe that we should \npreserve a small amount of money for the \n\n[[Page S 12904]]\nFederal Government to respond quickly to concentrated economic \ndislocations--the kind no one State can predict or pay for.\n  Highly concentrated economic dislocations can be caused by plant \nclosings, base realignments, or natural disasters. These major economic \ndislocations often cross State lines and effect thousands of workers. \nMoreover, many mass dislocations, such as base closures, are in fact \nprecipitated by Federal actions and therefore clearly merit a Federal \nresponse.\n  The House Workforce Development bill includes a provision on mass \nlayoffs and natural disasters, and my amendment draws heavily from that \nlanguage. I actually cut down on the scope of national activities found \nin the House bill.\n\n\n                         need will not go away\n\n  Mr. President, we need to understand that the need for such \nassistance will not diminish in the coming years. Indeed, in some areas \nof the country it could increase.\n  Defense-related layoffs in the private sector alone are continuing, \nwith up to an additional 25 to 30 percent reduction expected within the \nnext 2 to 3 years.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not about the ups and downs of the \nnormal business cycle. This amendment is about the out-of-the-ordinary \nevent involving hundreds or thousands of workers in a dramatic and \nsudden way.\n  It is vitally important that we be prepared for such hopefully rare \noccurrences. Natural disasters, like the recent flooding in the \nMidwest, cannot be predicted, and yet have grown more and more \ndevastating over the years. When these catastrophes occur, we cannot \njust turn our backs on Americans in need. We need to have the resources \navailable to provide emergency funds in order to get these people back \non their feet.\n\n\n                                examples\n\n  So that my colleagues know what I am talking about, here are a few \nexamples of the kinds of activities that have been funded through such \na program in the past:\n  Recently, the State of Connecticut was awarded a $4.3 million grant \nto provide work force development services for more than 1,400 workers \nlaid off by Allied Signal as a result of Defense downsizing.\n  The State of Washington received $14.6 million to assist workers laid \noff by Boeing.\n  More than $4 million in retraining dollars have been made available \nfor 9,500 GTE employees expected to be dislocated from their jobs in 22 \nStates, including Missouri, Washington, and Illinois.\n  More than $100 million have been spent over the last 4 years in \nresponse to natural disasters. For example, for the 1993 Mid-west \nfloods, funding was provided to Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, \nand Kansas.\n\n\n                            Modest amendment\n\n  My amendment would create a modest, 2 percent set-aside for these \nactivities: rapid response grants for mass dislocations and employment \nservices for those affected by natural disasters. This 2 percent set-\naside of the Workforce Development Program's $6.1 billion total \nauthorization would come to roughly $120 million.

Mr. President, I rise to offer on behalf of myself and \nSenator Ashcroft, the charity tax credit amendment. This amendment is \ndesigned to expand the ability of private and faith based charities to \nserve the poor by making it easier for taxpayers to make donations to \nthese organizations. It is an important, urgently needed reform, but it \nalso symbolizes a broader point.\n  The Congress is currently focused on the essential task of clearing \naway the ruins of the Great Society. Centralized, bureaucratic anti-\npoverty programs have failed--and that failure has had a human cost. It \nis measured in broken homes and violent streets. Our current system has \nundermined families and fostered dependence.\n  This is undeniable. But while our Great Society illusions have ended, \nthe suffering of many of our people has not. Indifference to that fact \nis not an option. We cannot retreat into the cocoon of our affluence. \nWe cannot accept the survival of the fittest. No society can live \nwithout hope--hope that its suffering and anguish are not endless.\n  I think we have seen the shape of that hope it is not found in the \nivory towers of academia. It is not found in the marble temples of \nofficial Washington. I found it five blocks from here, in a place so \ndistant from Congress it is almost another world.\n  The Reverend John Woods came to a desolate Washington neighborhood in \n1990 to take over the Gospel Mission, a shelter and drug treatment \ncenter for homeless men. The day he arrived, he found crack cocaine \nbeing processed in the back yard. A few days later, the local gang \nfired shots into his office to scare him away. Instead of leaving, he \nhung a sign on the door extending this invitation: ``If you haven't got \na friend in the world you can find one here. Come in.''\n  The Gospel Mission is a place that offers unconditional love, but \naccepts no excuses. Men in rehabilitation are given random drug tests. \nIf they violate the rules, they are told to leave the program. But the \nsuccess of the mission comes down to something simple: It does more \nthan provide a meal and treat an addiction, it offers spiritual \nchallenge and renewal.\n  Listen to one addict who came to Reverend Woods after failing in \nseveral governmental rehabilitation programs:\n\n       Those programs generally take addictions from you, but \n     don't place anything within you. I needed a spiritual \n     lifting. People like Reverend Woods are like God walking into \n     your life. Not only am I drug-free, but more than that, I can \n     be a person again.\n\n  Reverend Woods's success is particularly clear compared to government \napproaches. The Gospel Mission has a 12-month rehabilitation rate of 66 \npercent, while a once heralded government program just 3 blocks away \nrehabilitates less than 10 percent of those it serves--while spending \n20 times as much as Reverend Woods.\n  This is just one example. It is important, not because it is rare, \nbut because it is common. It takes place in every community, in places \ndistant from the center of government. But it is the only compassion \nthat consistently works--a war on poverty that marches from victory to \nvictory. It makes every new deal, new frontier and new covenant look \nsmall in comparison.\n  Several months ago, I asked a question: How can we get resources into \nthe hands of these private and religious institutions where individuals \nare actually being helped? And, How can we do this without either \nundermining their work with restrictions, or offending the first \namendment? I introduced S. 1120, the Comprehensive Charity Reform Act, \na major portion of which we have incorporated in today's amendment. Our \namendment has two central features.\n  First, it provides a $500 charity tax credit ($1,000 for married \ntaxpayers filing jointly) which will provide more generous tax benefits \nto taxpayers who decide to donate a portion of their tax liability to \ncharities that focus on fighting or preventing poverty.\n  Second, it requires that individuals volunteer their time, as well as \ndonate their money, to qualify for the credit.\n  The purpose of this legislation is twofold: First, we want to take a \nsmall portion of welfare spending in America and give it through the \nTax Code to private and religious institutions that effectively provide \nindividuals with hope, dignity, help and independence. Without \neliminating a public safety net, we want to focus some attention and \nresources where it can make all the difference.\n  Second, we want to promote an ethic of giving in America. When \nindividuals make these contributions to effective charities, it is a \nform of involvement beyond writing a check to the Federal Government. \nIt encourages a new definition of citizenship, one in which men and \nwomen examine and support the programs in their own communities that \nserve the poor. This amendment adopts Senator Ashcroft's proposal that \nrequires individuals to volunteer their time, as well as donate their \nmoney, to local poverty relief programs.\n  I hope that my colleagues take a careful look at this new approach to \ncompassion. It is important for us not only to spread authority and \nresources within the levels of Government, but to spread them beyond \nGovernment altogether--to institutions that can not only feed the body \nbut touch the soul. It is an issue I look forward to debating more \nfully next week.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when an individual is hired for a job, \nthey are handed a job description. A job description outlines their \nresponsibilities. On day one, they know what is expected of them in \norder to earn a paycheck.\n  However, when an individual goes into the welfare office to sign up \nfor benefits, they fill out an application and then the Government \nsends them a check. There is no job description. Nothing is expected on \nday one. The individual simply goes home and collects a paycheck.\n  I believe that is wrong, and I believe it saps an individual's self-\nesteem and makes the family dependent.\n  Mr. President, we must fundamentally change the way we think about \nwelfare, not just to reform welfare, but we have to change the way we \nthink about it. We should be guided by common sense and build a system \nbased on a foundation of responsibility. If you want a check, you must \nwork for it. You must follow a job description. We must stop looking at \nwelfare as a Government giveaway program. Instead, it should be a \ncontract demanding mutual responsibility between the Government and the \nindividual receiving benefits. The contract should outline the steps a \nrecipient will take to become self-sufficient and also a date certain \nby which they will be off welfare.\n  Responsibility should start on day one with benefits conditioned on \ncompliance with the terms of the contract. Essentially, the contract \nshould outline the responsibilities for an individual in the same \nmanner that a job description describes a worker's duties. It would \nbuild greater accountability in the welfare system and it would send \nthe clear message that welfare, as \n\n[[Page S 12909]]\nusual, is history. Mr. President, a binding contract of this nature not \nonly makes common sense, it works.\n  As I have noted previously, the State of Iowa has a relatively new \nwelfare reform program. The centerpiece of the Iowa Family Investment \nProgram is just such a contract which charts an individual's course off \nwelfare and a date when welfare benefits will end. Failure to follow \nthe contract means the elimination of welfare benefits.\n  Over the past 18 months, I have held numerous meetings with welfare \nrecipients, case managers and others to discuss welfare. I often hear \nthat the Iowa contract really does make a difference. Dennette Kellogg \nof Dubuque can receive benefits for several years before the new \nprogram began. She served honorably in the U.S. Marines and then \nmarried and started a family. But she was an unfortunate victim of \ndomestic abuse and left California for her hometown with one child and \npregnant with a second child. She ended up on welfare and wanted out \nbut felt she had few options and felt she was trapped.\n  She recently told me:\n       ``The family investment contract gave me a sense of self-\n     worth, something the old system lacks. . .and now I had a \n     reason to look forward to the future instead of feeling being \n     trapped.''\n\n  She has escaped. She is now working as a housing specialist and is no \nlonger on welfare. But for her, she had a contract which outlined what \nshe was expected to do. The contract also outlined what the State of \nIowa was going to do. So both sides knew what was expected.\n  In addition to making it clear what is expected of individuals on \nwelfare, a contract of mutual responsibility also makes it possible not \nonly for families to simply move off welfare but to stay off \npermanently.\n  Self-sufficiency is the only way to end the cycle of dependency and \npoverty that is claiming more and more victims each year. A well-\ndesigned and enforced contract is a way to make families self-\nsufficient, not Government dependent. It is the way to stop treating \nthe symptoms of the disease and to go after the cause.\n  The proposal that we have before us, the amendment offered by Senator \nDole, at least recognizes the important principle of a contract. \nHowever, it does not define the personal responsibility contract in any \nway. It could be anything or it could be nothing.\n  My amendment, which I just sent to the desk, would add clarity to \nmake sure that it works as envisioned and does not become just another \nfailed promise for welfare recipients and the taxpayers.\n  Without further definition, I am concerned that the provision in the \nDole-Packwood bill will not provide us with the desired result in terms \nof a contract.\n  My amendment is simple. It just says that a State would provide an \nassessment to determine the strengths and the barriers to employment. \nThat information then would be used to draw up a binding contract that \noutlines the steps a family would take to move off welfare and a date \ncertain when welfare benefits would end.\n  Failure to follow the terms of the contract would result in serious \nconsequences--the elimination of cash welfare benefits. The experience \nwe have had in Iowa has shown us that individuality is critical. \nFamilies have different needs, and a cookie cutter that stamps out one \nplan for everyone will fail. You cannot force families into a preshaped \nmold. But instead, we need to form the mold around the family. The last \nthing we need is a one size fits all contract. My amendment would \nclarify that individual family characteristics must be paramount in \nnegotiating the terms of the contract.\n  Accountability, responsibility, and common sense must guide us as we \nreform the welfare system. Strengthening the personal responsibility \ncontract will send a clear message that the rules have changed and that \nresponsibility is required from day one on welfare--just as a worker \nknows the rules on the first day of a new job.\n  We have a responsibility for the taxpayers' money. The taxpayers of \nIowa want to make sure that their money is well spent, whether it is in \nOklahoma, Nevada, California, or Pennsylvania. A contract such as I \nhave outlined here will ensure greater accountability in the welfare \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I have an editorial from the Omaha World Herald \nentitled ``Welfare Contract a Worthwhile Idea.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought I might take a few minutes to buttress my \nremarks for the need for a well-defined contract by once again bringing \nto my colleagues an illustration of what has happened in Iowa since we \nchanged our welfare system.\n  I always point with pride to the fact that in Iowa, we now have the \ndistinction of having a higher percentage of people on welfare who work \nthan any State in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, before we started our welfare reform program, about 18 \npercent of the people on welfare worked. It is now up to about 35 \npercent, which is just about double. So what we have is more people on \nwelfare who are also working. Again, that is one of the objectives of \nwelfare reform.\n  What has happened to our caseload? We knew at the beginning that, in \nchanging the rules, the initial thing that would happen is that we \nwould have more people on welfare. Everyone knew that. Sure enough, \nafter we enacted the bill, we went from 36,000 to almost 40,000 in the \nspace of just about a year. But look at what has happened since then. \nOur caseload has come down, and we now have fewer people by about 2,000 \ncaseload 2 years after we started our program. The first year it went \nup, and then it came down dramatically. So in 2 years we have done two \nthings. We have more people on welfare working--we doubled it--and we \nhave cut the total caseload of people on welfare in Iowa.\n  With all the talk about what all of the States are doing, I point out \nthat Iowa, to this date, as far as I know, is the only State that has \nactually cut people off of welfare. We did it with the contract. People \nhave a contract. They sign it and they have to live up to it. If they \ndo not, they are cut off. The chart shows that we have less of a \ncaseload than we did when we started.\n  How much are we spending on welfare in Iowa? Has the cost gone up or \ndown? Here is total what we spend in Iowa. The yellow, blue, and green \nlines are 1992, 1993 and 1994. The amount we totally spent on welfare \nbasically stayed about the same in the State of Iowa. We enacted a \nwelfare reform program in October 1993, and almost 2 years later you \ncan see what happened. Our total spending on welfare has dropped, and \ndropped dramatically, since we have had our welfare reform program.\n  So, again, people say, No. 1, we want more people to work. Well, in \nIowa we have doubled it. Second, we want fewer people on welfare. Well, \nwe have fewer people on welfare, as I have shown. Third, we want to \nspend less money. Well, here it is, we are spending less money on \nwelfare.\n  The average grant--now, we had the total, and this is the total \namount of money the State of Iowa is spending on welfare. It has come \ndown dramatically. What happened to the average person on welfare? It \nwas about $373 average per family, and we are now down to $336. That is \nabout a 10, 11, 12 percent drop in what we are spending per caseload in \nthe State of Iowa. So, by any yardstick of measuring, the Iowa \nexperiment has worked and has worked well.\n  Some people might say that in Iowa you do not have high unemployment \nand all that kind of stuff. Mr. President, when we enacted welfare \nreform, the Department of Health and Human Services insisted--and I \nadmit I fought this for some time--that we have a control group, a \ncertain group of individuals in Iowa who would not come under the new \nreform program. They would stay under the old system. So, 2 years \nlater, we were able to compare the control group to the new group. What \nwe have found is that under the old group, they are still down to about \n18 percent of those who are working, not 36 percent. The average \ncaseload cost is still high. And so we have that control group to show \nthat it is not just because of the Iowa circumstance, it is because of \nhow we reformed the system. \n\n[[Page S 12910]]\n\n  That brings me back to my amendment. The central feature of the Iowa \nwelfare reform program is a contract. When the person comes in to get \nwelfare, an assessment is done. Who are you? What are you? What is your \nbackground? Do you have disabilities? How many children do you have? \nTests are given; assessments are made by a case manager. Based upon \nthat, an individual contract is drawn up. That person signs that \ncontract. It is a binding contract. That contract spells out, from day \none, what that individual must do to continue to receive benefits. It \nalso spells out what the State will do in terms of child care and that \ntype of thing. As I stated, if the welfare recipient does not live up \nto the terms of the contract, after 3 months benefits are ended. And \nthat has happened in the State of Iowa. That is why I feel so strongly \nabout having a contract as a part of whatever welfare reform program \npasses here.\n  As I stated, the Dole proposal does mention a contract, but it does \nnot say what it is. All my amendment seeks to do is to further define \nand outline what the personal responsibility contract is, and to make \nsure that it is a contract that is molded around the family. Under the \nproposal that we have before us, the Dole-Packwood proposal, it just \nstates a contract. Well, the State can set up one contract for \neverybody. Again, that just will not work.\n  We need a contract for each individual family that is on welfare. It \nneeds to be molded around that family. So that is why I feel that the \nprovision for a personal responsibility contract needs to be \nstrengthened. It is in the bill and that is what my amendment seeks to \ndo.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will inquire of the managers of the bill. \nI would like to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment. I do not \nknow if they are in the mode of accepting amendments or not. I have not \nchecked.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Omaha World Herald]\n\n                   Welfare Contract a Worthwhile Idea\n\n       The idea that welfare should involve a form of social \n     contract continues to deserve attention.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has introduced a bill in the \n     Senate that reflects ideas from a welfare reform plan enacted \n     by Governor Branstad and the Iowa Legislature. One idea is \n     that welfare isn't an automatic entitlement. A recipient must \n     sign a contract with state government. The contract spells \n     out the services the government will provide, and it contains \n     specific steps to be taken by the recipient to become self-\n     reliant.\n       A similar provision has been included in the welfare reform \n     program under consideration in Nebraska. Jerry Oligmueller of \n     the State Department of Social Services said that recipients \n     would sign a ``self-sufficiency contract'' charting a two-\n     year course to self-sufficiency.\n       Emphasis on personal responsibility, he said, is part of \n     the state's effort to recognize and encourage a change in \n     attitudes about welfare.\n       The idea of changing society's thinking about welfare is \n     all to the good. In the case of people who have no physical \n     or mental ailments, welfare should not be an open-ended \n     arrangement. It's not fair for the government to take money \n     from tax-paying citizens to provide for the permanent support \n     of an able-bodied person. State and federal officials who are \n     trying to re-establish welfare as a temporary, rehabilitative \n     program are doing the right thing.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Iowa would be good \nenough, it would seem to me that we could put the amendment over until \nMonday. We will begin voting Monday at 5 o'clock. We can arrange for \nhim to have a vote after 5 o'clock if that is possible. I see the \nmajority leader on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might inquire, Mr. President, if the Senator would \nyield, would now be the appropriate time to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Republican manager would have to agree to any \nsequence on the Senator's vote. If he could be patient, that will be \ndone.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think under the agreement they did want to vote on the \nDodd amendment first.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I said the sequence depends on the Republican manager.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to my colleagues, hopefully in the next minute or so \nwe will be able to get a consent agreement that is now being cleared by \nthe Democratic leader. If it is clear, there will be no further votes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2546 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n (Purpose: To maintain the welfare partnership between the States and \n                        the Federal Government)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2546 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, beginning on line 7, strike all through page \n     24, line 18, and insert the following:\n       ``(5) Welfare partnership.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amount of the grant otherwise \n     determined under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 1997, 1998, \n     1999, or 2000 shall be reduced by the amount by which State \n     expenditures under the State program funded under this part \n     for the preceding fiscal year is less than 75 percent of \n     historic State expenditures.\n       ``(B) Historic state expenditures.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `historic State expenditures' \n     means expenditures by a State under parts A and F of title IV \n     for fiscal year 1994, as in effect during such fiscal year.\n       ``(ii) Hold harmless.--In no event shall the historic State \n     expenditures applicable to any fiscal year exceed the amount \n     which bears the same ratio to the amount determined under \n     clause (i) as--\n       ``(I) the grant amount otherwise determined under paragraph \n     (1) for the preceding fiscal year (without regard to section \n     407), bears to\n       ``(II) the total amount of Federal payments to the State \n     under section 403 for fiscal year 1994 (as in effect during \n     such fiscal year).\n       ``(C) Determination of state expenditures for preceding \n     fiscal year.--\n       ``(i) In general.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     expenditures of a State under the State program funded under \n     this part for a preceding fiscal year shall be equal to the \n     sum of the State's expenditures under the program in the \n     preceding fiscal year for--\n       ``(I) cash assistance;\n       ``(II) child care assistance;\n       ``(III) education, job training, and work; and\n       ``(IV) administrative costs.\n       ``(ii) Transfers from other state and local programs.--In \n     determining State expenditures under clause (i), such \n     expenditures shall not include funding supplanted by \n     transfers from other State and local programs.\n       ``(D) Exclusion of federal amounts.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, State expenditures shall not include any \n     expenditures from amounts made available by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, just a brief explanation.\n  Under the rules that we are operating, as I understand it, we are \nrequired to file any amendments that we have reserved spots for by 5 \no'clock this evening. As such, this is that type of amendment.\n  I do not seek its immediate consideration now. I will call it up in \nsome sequence next week, whenever is a proper time. Basically, this \namendment is the maintenance-of-effort amendment that requires 75 \npercent maintenance of effort based on 1964 State expenditures, and the \nmaintenance of effort shall continue for 5 years. The State \nexpenditures shall only be for those existing categories that State \nexpenditures are now made for, to qualify for matching funds under the \nAFDC and the other payments. In other words, the Federal contribution.\n  The point I am making here is that the State maintenance-of-efforts \nfunds cannot be used, for example, for Medicaid, which they are not \ncurrently committed to be used for.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be set aside and we take it \nup in whatever sequence is deemed proper next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand this consent agreement has been \ncleared by my colleagues on the other side. I will propound it. I ask \nunanimous consent when the Senate completes its business today, it \nstand in recess until 10 a.m. Monday, September 11, 1995, and \nimmediately resume consideration of the welfare bill, H.R. 4. \n\n[[Page S 12911]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask at 10 o'clock a.m. Senator Kassebaum be \nrecognized to offer an amendment concerning block grants, and following \nthe conclusion of debate the amendment be laid aside and the vote occur \non or in relation to the amendment second in the voting sequence to be \noutlined before for Monday, September 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that following the debate on the above-\nmentioned amendment, Senator Helms be recognized to offer an amendment \nregarding work for food stamps, and following conclusion of the debate \nthe amendment be laid aside and the vote occur on or in relation to the \namendment third in the voting sequence on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask following debate, Senator Dodd be recognized \nto offer an amendment regarding child care, and that debate be limited \nto 4 hours to be equally divided in the usual form and the vote occur \non or in relation to that amendment at 5 p.m. on September 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. That would be the first vote.\n  We need to work out additional time, I think, on the Feinstein \namendments. We can do that on Monday.\n  I also ask there be 4 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the \nusual form between the second and third rollcall votes ordered on \nMonday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And that the first vote be for 15 minutes and the other two \nor any other subsequent votes be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to my colleagues I think we are making progress. We \nhave had five votes today. We have been able to dispose of other \namendments. Members are offering their amendments to be considered and \nthey still have until 5:00 p.m. to do so.\n  In light of this agreement, in lining up the three rollcall votes \nbeginning at 5 p.m. on Monday, there will be no further votes today.\n  Members are reminded if you intend to offer an amendment to this \nbill, those amendments must be offered by 5 p.m. this evening.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2280, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I will briefly explain the first modification which \nprovides no additional cash assistance for children born of families \nreceiving assistance. States may provide vouchers in lieu of cash \nassistance, and they may be used to pay for particular goods and \nservices suitable for the care of the child involved.\n  The second one provides a bonus to States reducing out-of-wedlock \nbirths.\n  Third is a maintenance of effort. We are still trying to reconcile \nthat with the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. He just offered \nan amendment. We have a little different amendment. We are very close \nto an agreement. Maybe we can agree on something by Monday.\n  The fourth would be a work family provision relating to child care. \nStates cannot sanction a single custodial parent for failure to work if \nthe parent shows a demonstrated need for child care and the States \ndefine what constitutes demonstrated need.\n  No. 5, services provided by charitable, religious, or private \norganizations, limitation on the use of funds for certain purposes--\njust a modification of the current provision, and a modification of the \nsupplemental growth fund.\n  And finally, a performance bonus fund that provides additional money \nfor States that exceed performance goals.\n  These are modifications to the amendment. There will still be other \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the modifications ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, are as follows:\n\n                Modifications To Leadership Welfare Bill\n\n\n      title I--temporary assistance to needy families block grant\n\n       1. Provides No Additional Cash Assistance for Children Born \n     to Families Receiving Assistance (``Family Cap''). States may \n     not provide additional cash assistance for children born to \n     families receiving assistance. States may provide vouchers in \n     lieu of cash assistance. Vouchers may be used only to pay for \n     particular goods and services that are suitable for the care \n     of the child involved.\n       2. Out-of-Wedlock Birth Ratio. Provides a bonus to States \n     that reduce out-of wedlock births.\n       3. Maintenance of Effort. For the first three years, States \n     must spend 75 percent of what the State spent on AFDC \n     benefits including JOBS and child care, for the preceding \n     fiscal year. This is a modification to current provisions.\n       4. Work Penalty Provisions Relating to Child Care. States \n     can not sanction a single custodial parent for failure to \n     work if the parent shows a demonstrated need for child care. \n     The States define what constitutes demonstrated need.\n       5. Services Provided by Charitable, Religious or Private \n     Organizations and Limitations on Use of Funds for Certain \n     Purposes. Modifications to current provisions.\n       6. Modification to Supplemental Growth Fund. Qualifies \n     States with extraordinary population increases for the \n     supplemental growth fund.\n       7. Performance Bonus Fund. Provides additional money for \n     States that exceed performance goals.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. There may be other amendments. Senator Hatch is here, \nSenator Chafee is here, both members of the Finance Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, ranking member on the committee is \nhere. If there are some amendments that can be taken, I assume we would \nbe open for business for a while. Otherwise, as I indicated, there are \nno further votes today. There may be additional debate, and Members are \nreminded of the 5 o'clock deadline.\n  In my view, I do not see why we cannot complete action on this bill \nby Wednesday or perhaps early Thursday because we would like to do the \nState, Justice Department appropriations bill on Thursday and Friday.\n  We have done seven appropriations bills. That gives us No. 8. That \nwould leave five to do before the end of this month. The only one \navailable to us next week will be State, Justice, Commerce \nappropriations bill. The others come out the following week.\n  I do not think it will be necessary because I think we have had good \ncooperation--we would rather not file cloture. We like to have a good \ndebate and let everybody have a chance to debate their amendments up or \ndown and then have a vote on final passage.\n  Of course, if there should be some effort to frustrate the process, \nthen it would be my suggestion we wrap all this up and put it in \nreconciliation. Welfare reform is very important, and if we are \nfrustrated here, we will try to do it in another way.\n  So far, we have had good cooperation on both sides. Members have been \noffering amendments. We have had good debates. I think we are making \nprogress.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The changes included in the amendment are those child \ncare provisions which will give the State, even, an option, open to the \nStates, that will exclude the parent from the sanctions if the child is \nless than 1 year old? As I understand it, that was going to be the \nintention of the Senator. I am just asking now whether that was--if the \nSenator will just be kind enough to repeat the provisions dealing with \nday care?\n  We had inquired of the majority leader a week or so ago, or just \nbefore the break, about the child care provisions and the Senator had \nindicated that there would be some modifications. I had understood, in \nthe modification that was sent to the desk, it did provide for the \nState's flexibility to exclude from the punitive provisions of the \nlegislation if the child was less than 1 year old.\n  But that was one provision. I am just inquiring of the leader if that \nis the only change that was made with regard to child care? I think \nlater on in the afternoon, Senator Dodd and myself, and I think others, \nare going to be introducing an amendment on the child care which the \nmajority leader referenced, which we will dispose of early next week. I \njust want to try to understand exactly what modification has been \nincluded by the leader relating to the child care, which I consider to \nbe, perhaps, the most important provisions, along with the work \nrequirements, in the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I might say in response, this is an amendment suggested by \nthe Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe. The State would not sanction if \nthey are of preschool age, which I think is a step in the direction the \nSenator would want us to go.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see. So, as I understand it, then----\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to furnish the Senator with a copy of the \nlegislative language, too.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I will not, then, take up the time. As I \nunderstand the amendment of the Senator from Maine, it will, therefore, \nincrease the age of the child? I think it is up to 5 years of age, \nwhich effectively will--5 years of age----\n  Mr. DOLE. Five?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Exclude 60 percent of those who are currently on welfare \ntoday, since 60 percent of those who are on welfare have children under \nthat age.\n  The purpose of the legislation, as I understood it, was to try to get \npeople to work and also to provide for their children with day care. We \nwill have a chance later to debate this, but as I understand the \nchanges in the child care provision, they effectively will say those \nwelfare mothers can stay home and continue to take care of the \nchildren. Then, after that child gets to 6, they will be subject to the \nother provisions of the legislation.\n  I hope we will have a chance to debate that because it seems to me to \nbe both undermining the thrust of the legislation, in terms of moving \npeople from welfare to work, because they will \n\n[[Page S 12914]]\nbe excluded and we do not have additional kinds of child care \nprovisions that will permit them to move to work, which I know is the \nobjective of the majority leader.\n  So I thank the Senator for his explanation, but this is the kind of \nissue I hope we will have an opportunity to debate before we get to \nclosure.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statement, \nas I understood his statement on the participation rates. But we do not \nsanction a single custodial parent for failure to work if the parent \nshows a demonstrated need for child care. And that would be determined \nby the States, what constitutes a demonstrated need.\n  We will have that debate on Monday. Senator Snowe will be here, and I \nam certain she will be happy to go into it in more detail.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have just a procedural question. We are \nopen for business for filing the amendments until 5, and to have an \namendment count you have to send it to the desk. That is what offering \nan amendment is.\n  So, as I understand it--so, therefore, presumably, the establishment \nhas to stay in business until 5?\n  Mr. DOLE. Oh, yes. We will be around until 5. The Senator from Utah \nsuggests maybe we can go into recess until a quarter of 5. But we are \nnot going to try to shut off anybody because there may be Members now \nin the process of drafting amendments. So I hope we could continue to \nmaybe accept amendments, maybe have some debate. There may be other \namendments to be offered.\n  In fact, if some have been offered where we could do the debate this \nafternoon and take up the votes on Monday, we will be happy to do that, \ntoo.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if this is complete, I have an amendment \non behalf of Mr. Cohen. I will send it to the desk.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is a Moynihan-Dole amendment we can accept right \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2502, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cohen, I send to the \ndesk a modification to a prior amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cohen I send an \namendment to the desk dealing with supplemental security income \nbenefits, so-called SSI, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. Cohen, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2547 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEVELOPING OF PROTOTYPE OF COUNTERFEIT-RESISTANT \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY CARD REQUIRED.\n\n       (a) Development.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commissioner of Social Security \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Commissioner'') shall in accordance with the provisions of \n     this section develop a prototype of a counterfeit-resistant \n     social security card.

The study shall \n     also evaluate the feasibility and cost implications of \n     imposing a user fee for replacement cards and cards issued to \n     individuals who apply for such a card prior to the scheduled \n     3, 5, and 10 year phase-in options.\n       (3) Distribution of report.--Copies of the report described \n     in this subsection along with a facsimile of the prototype \n     card as described in subsection (a) shall be submitted to the \n     Committees on Ways and Means and Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committees on Finance and Judiciary \n     of the Senate within 1 year of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated and are appropriated from the Federal Old-\n     Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it was 18 years ago that I first \nproposed we produce a new tamper-resistant Social Security card to \nreduce fraud and enhance public confidence in our Social Security \nsystem. This has been an ongoing battle, and I think there should be a \nnew sense of urgency about this issue in light of the current welfare \ndebate.\n  The amendment I offer today is very simple. It would require two \nthings. First, it would require the Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration to develop a prototype of a counter-proof Social \nSecurity card. The prototype card would be designed with the security \nfeatures necessary so that it could be used reliably to confirm U.S. \ncitizenship or legal resident alien status.\n  Second, it would require the Commissioner to study and report to \nCongress on ways to improve the Social Security card application \nprocess so as to reduce the process' vulnerability to fraud. An \nevaluation of cost and workload implications of issuing a counterfeit-\nresistant Social Security card is also required.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has informed me that this amendment \nwould result in an insignificant increase--less than $500,000--in \nadministrative expenses for the Social Security Administration.\n  When the Social Security amendments were before us in 1983, we \napproved a provision to require the production of a new tamper-\nresistant Social Security card. The law, section 345 of Public Law 98-\n21, stated:\n\n       The social security card shall be made of banknote paper, \n     and (to the maximum extent practicable) shall be a card which \n     cannot be counterfeited.\n\n  What a disappointment when late in 1983, the Social Security \nAdministration began to issue the new card, and it became clear that \nthe agency simply had not understood what Congress intended. The new \ncard looks much like the old, a pasteboard card really much like the \nfirst ones produced by Social Security in 1936. It has the same design \nframing the name and nearly the same colors. It feels the same. An \nexpert examining a card with a magnifying glass can certainly detect \nwhether or not one of the new ones is genuine, but therein lies the \nproblem. We should have a distinguished, durable card that can hold \nvital information and can be authenticated easily.\n  There is a history here. The Social Security Administration, from its \nearlier years, has resisted any use of the Social Security card for \nidentification purposes. In fact, the card actually said it could not \nbe so used.\n  In 1977, when I first proposed that we produce a new card, the Social \nSecurity Administration objected and the proposal was not adopted. I \ntried again and again, and succeeded only on the fifth try.\n  Or so I thought. Until the card was introduced.\n  A new Social Security card--one very difficult to\n   counterfeit and easily verified as genuine--could be manufactured at \na low cost. The major expense, if we were to approve new cards, would \nbe the cost of the interview process and that is why the amendment \nrequires a study to include the cost and workload implications of a new \ncard. Let us explore our options--we must try to improve the system.\n\n  A Social Security card could be designed along the lines of today's \nhigh technology credit cards. The card could be highly tamper-\nresistant, and its authenticity could be readily discerned by the \nuntrained eye. It must be seen as a special document; one which would \nbe visually and tactilely more difficult to counterfeit than the \ncurrent paper card.\n  The magnetic stripe would contain the Social Security number, encoded \nwith an algorithm known only to the Social Security Administration. A \nso-called watermark stripe could be placed over it, making it nearly \nimpossible to counterfeit without technology that currently costs $10 \nmillion. The decoding algorithm could be integrated with the Social \nSecurity Administration computers.\n  The new cards will not eliminate all fraudulent use of Social \nSecurity cards. But it will close down the shopfront operations that \nflood America with false Social Security cards.\n  That is what the Congress intended in the 1983 legislation.\n  Let us try again. We have seen that it can be done. It is what the \nClinton \n\n[[Page S 12916]]\nadministration intended last year when they introduced the health \nsecurity card. As many of you remember, it has a magnetic stripe to \nhold whatever information may be necessary.\n  A key reform in our ongoing welfare debate is the restriction of \nbenefits to U.S. citizens. I think it is safe to say that when this \nrestriction is enforced there will be a revitalized black market for \ndocumentation of U.S. citizenship. It would be wise to head off this \nforeseeable problem. A high technology Social Security card would also \nfacilitate the disbursement of benefits to our citizens. A simpler, \nmore effective way of providing citizenship would strengthen public \nconfidence in our immigration system and improve the efficiency of our \nwelfare system.\n  I offer the present amendment, which as I said earlier, would require \nonly the development of a prototype counterfeit-resistant card and a \nstudy on ways to reduce the vulnerability of the card application \nprocess to fraud. The Attorney General would assist the Commissioner of \nSocial Security with determining what is needed here.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues on this important matter once \nagain--this time for a simple prototype card and a study.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2548) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at long last, the Senate turns its \nattention to an issue at the heart of the availability of any real \nwelfare proposal and close to the heart of all working families, and \nthat is access to safe, affordable child care in the next period of \ntime. I see in the Chamber my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nConnecticut, who will offer the amendment for himself and for myself.\n  Mr. President, somehow amidst all the tough talk and political \nposturing about welfare reform, talk of block grants and State \nflexibility, funding formulas and family caps, this debate seems to \nhave lost sight of the clear and simple fact that a single parent with \na preschool-aged child cannot hold down a job if there is no one to \ncare for that child.\n  I think over the long course of the hearings that have been held on \nthe question of welfare reform in the time that I have been in the \nSenate, it is very clear what the elements of a successful welfare \nreform bill must be. There has to be, obviously, a job at the end of \nthe line for an individual, hopefully in the private sector, public \nsector if necessary. There has to be some training for that individual. \nThere also has to be some care for the child of that parent. And when \nwe realize that two-thirds of those recipients today of welfare have \nsmall children, we understand the importance of providing the child \ncare. And there also has to be an element of health care for that child \nand for that family.\n  Those are essentially the elements. And what is an intolerable \nsituation is to present welfare reform legislation \n\n[[Page S 12919]]\nand pretend that it is really, truly a reform program without \naddressing the enormously important issue of who is going to care for \nthe children that will be affected by this debate.\n  Of those that are on welfare, about 10 million of them are children, \n4 to 5 million are adults. So when we talk about the welfare issue and \nwelfare reform, we are really talking about children and families in \nthis country. Many of those children are the sons and daughters of \nworking families. Children are always the most vulnerable individuals. \nThey are not here to speak for themselves. As responsible policymakers, \nwe must consider the impact of any legislative effort on the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  So throughout this debate we intend to ask over and over again the \nkey questions that should guide this entire debate: Who will care for \nthe children? As families enter the job search, who will care for the \nchildren? As families enter workfare programs, who will care for the \nchildren? As a single parent is mandated to take a job, who will care \nfor the children?\n  I would like to just take a few moments before my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut introduces legislation that will address \nthis issue, and I think in an important way remedy this glaring defect \nin the majority leader's proposal, to consider where we are with the \nproposal that is before the Senate this afternoon.\n  First of all, if we look at the current situation under the existing \nlegislation, legislation that passed in 1988 with virtually unanimous \nsupport in the Senate, which recognized the importance of child care \nprograms, there is $1 billion to take care of 643,000 children.\n  Under the bill that is before the Senate at the present time, that \nparticular funding, the $1.1 billion, which is the total of three \ndifferent child care programs, is effectively eliminated, crossed out \nas separately designated child care funding.\n  There is an additional child care program in current law that is \nprovided under discretionary spending for the child care programs which \nalso amounts to $1 billion--some $935 million spent in the year 1995 to \ntake care of 750,000 children. This is $935 million for 750,000 versus \n$1.1 billion for 643,000 children. These are the sons and daughters of \nlow-income working families and need care for a short period of time, \nand that is why there is some disparity.\n  The majority leader's proposal not only eliminates the $1 billion \nwhich will currently provide for the 643,000 children--eliminates \nthat--but also takes a third of the $1 billion which was appropriated \nfor child care and allows 30 percent of it to be transferred for other \npurposes.\n  We have to ask ourselves, who is going to care for all of these \nchildren? Who is going to care for the children who are being taken \ncare of under the existing discretionary program if these funds are \ndiverted away? Who will care for the children who would have been cared \nfor through the mandatory programs that would otherwise be expended in \n1996 but have been effectively?\n  We have to ask ourselves, what is going to be the response?\n  When this issue was raised just before the break, the leader \nindicated what his response was going to be.\n  In the exchange on the floor of the Senate, the majority leader said:\n\n       Let me just respond this way to the Senator from \n     Massachusetts. I said just a few moments ago--I do not think \n     the Senator was on the floor--that was an area of concern \n     raised by the White House, the same general area. As I said, \n     it is a concern raised by a number of my colleagues on this \n     side of the aisle.\n       We had our first meeting on Friday. And Senator Kassebaum, \n     the chairman of the committee, who did a lot of work in this \n     area, was present.\n       It is certainly true that Senator Kassebaum has been very \n     dedicated to child care. It was Senator Dodd who was the \n     leader of the development of the discretionary program, with \n     strong support of the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and it \n     was Senator Kassebaum who ensured that this valuable program \n     was reauthorized.\n\n  It continues on:\n\n       So I can say to the Senator in all candor, it is something \n     we are looking at. We know there is a problem, and we are \n     looking at it because under the present provision of S. 1120 \n     it would be block granted to the States. But there is a great \n     deal of concern expressed. I can only say that we are going \n     to sit down, I think, again either tonight or tomorrow \n     morning to try to address that on this side.\n\n  Now, what happened? First of all, we have what I call under the \nexisting Dole proposal effectively the home alone program. We are \ntelling parents that they are going to have to leave their children \nhome alone. We are saying if the parent of this family does not go out \nand take a job, they are going to lose any kind of support benefits and \nwe are going to leave the child alone at home.\n  That was the issue brought before the majority leader just before the \nAugust recess and he responded that he was going to address that \nparticular proposal. So what happened? In the proposal sent to the \nSenate just before the break, he included a provision providing the \ndiscretion to the States the option to exempt a parent with a child \nless than 1 year old--but completely at the discretion of the States. \nIf the State did not choose to do it, infants could find themselves \nhome alone again.\n  The new bill did not provide additional child care for families with \nyoung children. The bill did not provide additional funding to help and \nassist those families in achieving self sufficiency, allowing them to \ngo to work with good quality day care. All it did was say that those \nfamilies would be exempt. You will not be denied the benefits of the \nprogram if you do not participate in the work program. And effectively \nwhat you are saying is happy birthday to the child when they turn 1, \nbecause that parent is going to be required to go on out and leave that \nchild at home alone when they are 13 months old.\n  I call that ``Home Alone II.'' You left the children home alone in \nthe initial proposal. And now we are saying we are leaving it up to the \nStates to exempt 10 percent of families from having to leave their \nchildren home alone. But what about getting those parents into the work \nforce, which is part of the desire of this particular legislation? We \nare not providing child care. All we are saying is that if you have \nyoung children, you can stay home and do not have to work.\n  Mr. President, this chart gives a real reflection of what the needs \nare and what the realities are under the day care proposal. We are \ntaking the $1 billion that was spent on child care for welfare families \nand under the Dole proposal it is eliminated. But we will have to spend \n$4.8 billion in the year 2000 alone to provide for day care for welfare \nrecipients mandated to work under the Home Alone bill. That means that \nif the Dole bill is implemented and all the people required to work \nactually go to work, you will need $4.8 billion to provide the day care \nfor them in that one single year--one single year.\n  This assumes that only half of the parents that are going to work \nwill need help finding and affording child care. It says that the \nothers will be able to get child care on their own, which is an \nextraordinary assumption. I mean, it defies what is happening in all of \nour States. I am interested in listening to Senators who have had a \ndifferent experience in their State, finding scores of people receiving \nwelfare that are able to get child care and pay for it. But that is one \nof the assumptions.\n  Even with that assumption, HHS says that the Dole bill will cost $4.8 \nbillion for child care in the year 2000. Cumulatively, under the Dole \nproposal, it will be $11.2 billion from 1996 to the year 2000. And \nStates will only be provided $16.8 billion flat funding over that \nperiod of time. If you are going to need all of this for day care, \nwhere is the money going to be on job search? Where is the money going \nto be in providing for the health care needs of the children? Where is \nthe money going to be for job training and education? Where is it going \nto be? It is just not going to be there. That is why this is so \nfraudulent. That is why this legislation is so basically and \nfundamentally flawed when you think about the needs of the poor \nchildren of this country.\n  Mr. President, I will join with my colleague and friend from \nConnecticut in an amendment to address this particular problem by \nrestoring the existing $1 billion and making up the rest to make sure \nthis legislation addresses the issue of child care for the children \n\n[[Page S 12920]]\nof this country, as well as the requirements in terms of job needs.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity, as we come into the \nweekend, to join with our leader here in the Senate, Senator Dodd, who \nhas provided leadership in this child care area. It has been a \nbipartisan effort, in our committee and on the floor, with Senator \nHatch and Senator Kassebaum and others, very much involved in this \neffort.\n  Let me just say, finally, we heard just a few moments ago, additional \nchanges proposed by the majority leader. As I understand, this includes \nan amendment to raise the age of children whose families are exempt \nfrom 1 to 5 years of age. This effectively will mean that sixty percent \nof those who are on welfare will be excluded from welfare reform \nbecause that many have children under 5.\n  So that raises some serious issues and questions about what we are \ndoing here if we go about excluding people from the requirements rather \nthan assisting them. As a way of trying to respond to this particular \nneed, I think this raises some serious questions about what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will in a second. I prefer that we provide the kind of \nsupport that is included in the Dodd amendment because if we do that, \nwhat we are going to do to get people to work--by providing the \ntraining for them, the day care, and help them to find a job. That is \nthe objective, to care for children and to promote work. That is the \ndesirable end.\n  But certainly, if we are not going to have the kind of support and \nhelp and the funding for the day care, as a matter of policy, it is a \nlot better to have the parent at home taking care of very small \nchildren than requiring them to make a choice between leaving a child \nwho is 2, 3, 4, or 5 home alone and complying with the requirements of \nthis legislation.\n  So this is a very important discussion and debate. I hope that we \nwill have the chance on Monday, to get into greater detail both on the \nchanges that have been made. But just at the opening of this, because I \nsee my friend and colleague from Connecticut on the floor who wants to \nmake a presentation, I think it is important that we understand exactly \nwhere we are with regard to the child care proposals.\n  I will be glad to yield briefly for a question from the Senator, and \nthen I want to yield the floor so that the Senator from Connecticut \ncan----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just wanted to respond to the comments of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts about the Snowe amendment. I think there is a \nmischaracterization. Maybe it is not a mischaracterization. I know the \namendment has not been presented. You received a summary. But what the \nSnowe amendment does is say that the parents with children under 5 who \ncan demonstrate to the State--the States will determine what the \ndemonstration requirements would be--that their child care is either \nunaffordable to them or unavailable to them, whatever, would not be \nsanctioned for not working.\n  That does not mean that anyone who has a child under 5 would be \nexempt from the work requirement. That is not the case. In fact, they \nwould be required to work unless they can prove that there is no child \ncare available. So what happens, since the Snowe amendment does not \nchange the participation standard, which is that 50 percent have to be \nin the work program, what the Snowe amendment really attempts to do by \nkeeping the denominator the same is to encourage States to provide more \nchild care so they can increase work participation by families with \nchildren under 5. So it is, in a sense, a roundabout way of getting \nStates to come up with more child care dollars so we can, in fact, give \nopportunities for women, in most cases women, who have children under \n5.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate that, and I will make a \nbrief comment. That is the very basis of the difference among the Dole, \nSenator Santorum, and other proposals. You are not providing child care \nfor that mother that wants to be able to go out and work. What you are \nsaying is that mothers will have to work unless they are able to \ndemonstrate that for some means they cannot quite get that child care, \nthat they do not have the resources to do it.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, travel around your own State \nor my State or any of the other States and talk to those mothers and \nask them. We already know what is happening out there. We already have \nthat kind of information, and we just know of the availability of child \ncare.\n  I hope it is not quite as punitive as described by the Senator to say \nbecause we know what the shortage is and what the cost is in terms of \nquality child care. I do not know how many working families that are \ntrying to go out and work and provide for their families, let alone \nthose that are caught in the misfortunes of life and have a life of \ndependency, are able to go on out there and get the child care and \nafford to pay it, have someone tell them, ``Well, maybe your situation \nis not desperate enough and you are able to stay home. You are able to \nstay home. We are not going to do anything for you to get child care so \nyou can get off welfare, we are just going to say you can still get \nyour check.''\n  I do not think that is really what this bill should be about.\n  I look forward to the opportunity later this afternoon and Monday to \nget into greater detail on this.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2560 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the establishment of a supplemental child care \n                             grant program)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2560 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the child care amendment. As I \nunderstand it, we will take some time this afternoon, and on Monday we \nwill resume the debate and have a vote on this amendment, I think, at 5 \np.m. I stand corrected if that is not correct. My colleague from \nPennsylvania is indicating that that is the situation procedurally. We \nwill have people over the weekend take a look at the amendment, decide \neither to support it or offer ideas to change it. But I think it is a \ncritically important amendment. It is one of the two or three, I think, \nmost significant amendments we will have during the consideration of \nthis bill, because it is such an important linchpin to the whole debate \non welfare. It determines whether or not the so-called welfare reform \nproposal can actually work.\n  Let me, first of all, thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \nsupport in putting this amendment together, and for his support not \njust today and recently, but over the years.\n  As he has pointed out, Mr. President, going back some 5, 6, 7 years \nago, we were able to fashion a child care proposal, the very first, I \nmight add, ever adopted by a Congress with the exception of the period \nin about 1942 or 1943 when, in the middle of World War II, the Congress \nappropriated $50 million for a national child care program for the \nobvious reasons.\n  We had young men in uniform who were fighting in the European and \nPacific theaters. War production was critical. Women went to work in \nwar production facilities and, obviously, taking care of their children \nwas something that needed to be done.\n  In fact, I invite my colleagues to look at a fascinating exhibit at \nthe Library of Congress. There are marvelous photographs and stories \nabout these child care facilities and how sophisticated they were with \ndoctors and nurses, wonderful feeding programs and the like. In fact, \none of them still is in operation in Santa Monica, CA, the only one I \nknow of that is still operating from that period of time.\n  Obviously, that was a time of national emergency. Once World War II \nwas over, young men came back from the war, women left war production, \nmen went to work in our companies and factories across the country, and \nthese child care facilities, many of them, closed their doors.\n  It is intriguing to note, because it was, obviously, a recognized \nneed that we could not very well ask people to go to work in war \nproduction without a parent being home and to leave children home \nalone.\n  I have gone back and examined that legislation. There was no criteria \nestablished in that bill based on the age of the children or exemptions \nfrom work and war production. It was designed to take care of kids, and \nit was a wonderful educational process as well, where those children \nactually had a good education experience while being in that child care \nsetting.\n  At any rate, we are again engaged in a debate. This time another \nemergency, not of the magnitude of World War II, but an emergency. We \nhave far too many people who are living on public assistance of one \nkind or another. We are trying to break that cycle. We are trying to \nmake it possible for people to go back to work or to go to work for the \nfirst time ever, and we are faced not with a dissimilar fact situation.\n  In World War II, the men in those families were fighting a war. \nToday, in many cases, there are not any men at all in these households, \njust women raising children alone. And yet we want them to go to work, \nnot in war production today, but we want them to get into the work \nforce, because we think it is not only good for them, it is good for \nthe country. But the issue regarding the children is the same, it is \nthe common denominator. In 1942 and 1943, we reached the collective \nconclusion those kids should not be left home alone. We needed women in \nwar production; take care of the kids.\n  Today we are saying collectively, I think, we ought to get people to \nwork in this country. We are tired of watching two and three \ngenerations and four generations live on public assistance. We want to \nget them to work, and yet we know we have a staggering number of \nchildren who need care.\n  What this amendment is designed to do is to come up with a means by \nwhich we make the work requirements in this particular bill be \neffective. So that is what we have crafted with this amendment. We take \n$5 billion as part of the block grant--it is already in the bill--and \ndedicate that to child care. We then recognize, as a result of HHS's \nnumbers, that you cannot possibly meet the criteria outlined in the \nDole legislation that requires that a certain percentage of people on \nwelfare get to work, if you do not have a child care component. So 44 \nStates would not be in compliance according to CBO. We come up with $6 \nbillion to come out of a corporate welfare approach that is designated \nby a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Some will argue you do not need $6 billion, you can do with a sum \nless than that. I, frankly, will be listening and more than happy to \nentertain some discussion of that. Health and Human Services says \nroughly $6 billion. CBO says less than that, depending on what numbers \nyou use as the base.\n  The point is, what presently exists in the bill does not meet the \ncriteria at all. You need to have more resources. I will get into why \nthat is the case in a moment.\n  As I pointed out yesterday during our debate, and when the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, pulled his welfare reform \nbill 3 weeks ago, that, in my view, the bill pretended to be serious \nabout work but ignored how children would fit into that equation.\n  At that point, I described the legislation as ``child care--less.'' \nThere has been a lot of talk, obviously, in the past several weeks \nabout a modified proposal. But as far as I can tell, not much has \nchanged in the legislation.\n  The Republican proposal is still, as Senator Kennedy has pointed out, \na home alone bill. The Republican proposal amounts, in my view, to \nnothing more than a bitter taste for thousands of families across the \ncountry. You cannot throw a dab of budgetary so-called gravy on it and \ncall it tasty or a success. It is just window dressing, Mr. President, \nand Americans simply, I think, will not take it.\n  The Republican proposal still imposes significant new work \nrequirements without acknowledging that child care is essential if \npeople are going to go to work. Funds previously designated for child \ncare and child care only disappear.\n \n[[Page S 12922]]\n\n  I point out, on one of the charts that we have here, that in 1994, we \ndesignated $1 billion for child care assistance in our welfare reform \nprograms. That was only done a year or so ago. The Dole bill, as \npresently crafted, as Senator Kennedy pointed out a moment ago, takes \nthat money previously earmarked for child care, lumps it into general \nwelfare, a pool. One can argue that the States may decide to use those \nresources.\n  Let us assume, if you want to, that they may. But there is no \nrequirement. They may decide to do something else with it. If you say \nwe are going to insist that that $1 billion be left in the bill for \nchild care, the fact is, that with the changes in the Dole bill we are \ngoing to increase the need for child care slots by 165 percent. So the \n$1 billion is going to be totally inadequate in order to meet this \nincreased demand that we have. So it is not even going to come close to \nthe demands that we will have on us. The bottom line here is that no \nmoney is guaranteed at all. Not a single penny is guaranteed here at \nall.\n  In fact, even under previous legislation, you had a requirement that \nStates had to dedicate some of their own resources for child care. We \neven stripped that out of the bill. So there was no requirement there \nat all either. So we have taken out the Federal money, and the State \nrequirement too. We have said that you have to go to work quickly, and \nwe do not provide the resources to allow that to happen.\n  Let me quickly add that we are seeing add-ons or modifications now. \nWe had the provision that was added that said if you had children under \nthe age of 1, you would be exempted from the work requirement. Now, \nthat has been raised to the age of 5. I appreciate the point of our \ncolleague from Pennsylvania that that exemption only exists if child \ncare is not available. The fact of the matter is, if you are on welfare \nand you do not have any dedicated resources, child care is de facto not \ngoing to be available.\n  A point I think that needs to be made here is that we need to remind \nourselves what the essence of this bill is. That is, to try and get \npeople to work. If we start exempting people because they have children \nunder the age of 1 or 5--while I appreciate the motivations behind it--\nit is going to run counter to what we should be trying to do. Does that \nmean if you have three children above the age of 5 and one under, that \nyou are exempt? Is that going to be an inducement to some families--at \na time of trying to discourage more children, is it in fact going to be \nan inducement in some ways for people to have a child in order to avoid \nthe work requirements? I would much rather see us stick with the \ncriteria that you try and get people to work and then provide the child \ncare for them. That, it seems to me, makes more sense and goes to the \nessence and heart of what we are trying to achieve, instead of trying \nto come up with an exemption for each age group here. I think we ought \nto be trying to assist these families to become self sufficient, \nindependent, and to give them the resources to achieve those goals.\n  As we know right now, we have been told that as a result of no \nadditional funds, we will have to find an $4.8 billion in the year 2000 \njust to meet the child care requirements. States would be required to \nspend totally, we are reminded, some $11 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Let me emphasize again that I think there is general consensus here \nthat if there is one common theme in all of the various proposals that \nare being discussed regarding welfare reform it is that we want to get \npeople to work. We are trying to figure out the best way to do that, \nthe most efficient way to do it.\n  What those who agree with that proposition are suggesting is that if \nwe are going to get people on public assistance to work, there are \nseveral things we have to do.\n  First, we have to see if they have the training and the education in \norder to meet the criteria of the job market, which is critically \nimportant. Second, we have to recognize the reality that almost \neveryone in the country understands; that is, it is difficult to get to \nwork if you have young children and you have no place to leave them \nwhere they will be cared for and adequately protected.\n  That is an issue that everyone understands. You certainly do not have \nto be on welfare to understand that. As I said yesterday and the day \nbefore, every single family in this country whether two parents who \nwork, or a single parent works, knows of the anxiety of child care.\n  Even if you have a good child care system today in place for your \nchildren, every week you wonder whether it will be there next week, and \nhow much more it may cost. Will there be a problem for one reason or \nanother?\n  Child care for working families with young children is an issue that \neveryone understands, regardless of their economic situation.\n  What I am suggesting here and what we successfully passed a few years \nago, with the tremendous help of my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, \nin a very strong, bipartisan way, with the ultimate support of \nPresident Bush and the Bush administration, was the recognition that we \nneed to have some support for child care, for families, as we try to \nmove them into the workplace, and for the working poor.\n  What we are doing with this amendment is trying to come up with \nadequate resources that make it possible for the work requirements of \nthis bill to become effective. If we are really going to get people \nfrom welfare to work, where two-thirds of these families have children \nthat are very young, then you will have to deal with the child care \nissue.\n  That does not require any great leap of faith. It does not require a \ngreat understanding of the complexity of law. It merely states what \neveryone ought to be able to appreciate and understand. That is what we \nare trying to do with this amendment.\n  Now we are being told, as it stands right now, the Governors would \nhave to come up with $4.8 billion in the year 2000. If we are going to \njust provide for the welfare recipients mandated under the home alone \nbill, if you are going to get to the year 2000, you will need a total \namount of roughly $11 billion between now and then.\n  You can take out of the block grant $5 billion, but you have to come \nup with $6 billion more, roughly, to meet the criteria. Am I absolutely \ncertain of the $6 billion? No, I am not. I am listening to a lot of \npeople who spend a lot of time on these issues, and they tell me that \nis roughly the number. It could be somewhat less. But the point is, it \nis roughly in that ballpark if you are going to meet the work criteria.\n  Now, it is being suggested by the majority leader and others, rather \nthan do that, why not just exempt these families that have very young \nchildren?\n  First, the proposal was under age 1. Now the proposal is up to 5 \nyears.\n  My suggestion here is, rather than start exempting people with young \nchildren right and left, why not try to come up with the resources so \nwe get back to the heart of the welfare proposals, and that is to make \nit possible for people to get to work? That seems to me to be a more \nlogical step to take, rather than retreating from those obligations of \nwork requirements.\n  So that is what we do with this amendment. We try to make it possible \nfor that to happen. Otherwise, I do not know what these Governors are \ngoing to do. They do not have the resources, Mr. President. We are \nshifting the problem to them. We are saying, you come up with the \nresources or you face the penalties, because we have penalties in the \nbill. And if you do not get a certain percentage of your welfare \nrecipients into the work force in the first year or two and then at a \nhigher percentage a year or two after that, then there are penalties \nthat we at the Federal Government levy on these States.\n  So what are the options? Either you do not get the child care, you do \nnot get people to work, and then you have a penalty, which means you \nhave to raise taxes to pay it; or you have to come up with $4.8 billion \nin 2000, or more over the next 5 years in one form of taxation or \nanother.\n  Why not try to come up here with a means by which we make it possible \nfor people to make that transition, so we get from the dependency on \nwelfare to work by providing adequate child care for these children?\n  I have recommended here corporate welfare as an offset--I cannot \nidentify choices specifically because then you end up with bill being \ntransferred immediately to various committees. We have in the \namendment--because the obvious question is how do you pay for \n\n[[Page S 12923]]\nit--a section. We asked people to look at corporate welfare. There is a \nlot in there. We talk about deductions and availability of certain \nthings. There is a lot that exists. We have a tax proposal that is \ngoing to be submitted to us that calls for $250 billion in tax cuts, \nthe bulk of which will go to upper-income families. If we would just \nmodify that by $6 billion, I might add, or take a look at the literally \nbillions of dollars that exist in corporate welfare and find $6 billion \nin order to achieve this desirable goal of getting people to work, it \nseems to me to be a modest request. I am confident that people who are \ncommitted to this will be able to find the resources over the next 5 \nyears to do so.\n  This ought to be, in my view, an issue which people can gather \naround. We may disagree on other aspects of this bill, but I do not \nbelieve there ought to be the kind of partisan debate over child care, \nover coming up with the resources to make it possible for people to go \nto work and have their kids well taken care of. That is an issue \neverybody understands. As I said a moment ago, anybody who is at work \ntoday and has young children understands the problem, the worry, the \nconcern, the anxiety that people have.\n  Frankly, with all due respect to those who have made the proposal of \n1 year or 5 years, you have a child that is 5 years and 6 months, or 6 \nyears old, 7 years old, you are not going to leave that child home \nalone and go to work. That is just unrealistic.\n  In fact, even when those children are in school, the great anxiety \nthat parents have at 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon is hoping the \nchild gets home safely. Look at the number of phone calls that get made \nat 3:30 and 4 o'clock when people are at work to find out whether or \nnot that young child has made it home, and then worrying when they are \nhome what happens to them. Who is watching them? What are they doing?\n  Again, I have to believe most of my colleagues understand these \nissues because they have certainly heard the general worry and concern \noutside of the welfare debate when it comes to the issue of care for \nchildren. It's obviously compared to the other things we do--my God, we \ncome up with criteria for parking places. We take care of people's cars \nbetter. We have criteria for pets in this country to make sure they are \nnot going to get harmed. All I am saying is what about our kids? In \nthis day and age, we just increased the defense budget by $7 billion \nfor next year, $7 billion more than the Pentagon wanted. That is $1 \nbillion more than would take care of all the child care needs under the \nDole bill for 5 years--for 5 years. One year of increased spending that \nwas not asked for by the Pentagon.\n  In a just and fair society, with the tremendous and legitimate demand \nof the constituencies of this country that said we ought to get people \noff of welfare and to work, understanding the element of child care, we \nought to be able to do that. And this ought to be a unanimous vote. \nThere ought to be no great split here on that issue, and that is what I \nam offering with this amendment.\n  We can have, over the weekend, a talk about it. Staffs may meet. \nMaybe somebody will have some other ideas how we can fashion this to \nthe satisfaction of everyone. I am not rigidly holding onto every \ndotted ``i'' and crossed ``t.'' If there are some other numbers people \nwant to use, I am open to them. I am not looking for an acrimonious \ndebate on this issue. I am just telling you flatout that a welfare \nreform bill that demands that people go to work and does not have a \nchild care factor to it, an element to it to allow for that transition \nto occur, is just unworkable.\n  I promise that you can threaten families all you want, they are not \ngoing to abandon their children. They just will not do it. I do not \ncare what income category, what part of the country you are talking \nabout. These families are not going to walk out of the house and leave \nthat child alone. We would condemn them if they did. You get arrested \nin parts of this country if you do it. We have had cases in Connecticut \nin recent times where people have gone to casinos and left children in \nparked cars. We arrest them. It is a headline story when it happens.\n  Does anyone think that we are going to have a law that requires that \npeople go to work and leave their kids locked up in their houses, and \nthat we are not going to have a sense of outrage about it? And we are \nthen going to penalize those States because they have not met the \ncriteria because people have refused to obey the law and leave their \nchildren alone? That is insanity. That does not make any sense at all.\n  So I do not know why people have so much difficulty with this \nconcept. This ought to be a 20-minute debate, not a great source of \ncontroversy. If you do not understand the linkage between child care \nand welfare reform, then you do not have the vaguest notion about \nwelfare and what needs to be done to make it work better.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope over the coming 2 or 3 days before we come \nback on Monday afternoon, that people will take a good look at this, \ncome together, and see if we cannot either support this amendment or \nsome modifications to it so it roughly will allow the Dole bill \nprovisions to actually take effect and make it possible for these \nStates to meet the criteria without raising taxes.\n  In the absence of doing it, you have the biggest unfunded mandate I \nhave seen so far. It was S. 1, I think, the unfunded mandate bill, \nwhere we said you cannot put mandates on States without coming up with \nthe resources so they do not have to raise their own taxes. Here we are \ngoing to have a mandate that you take your welfare recipients and put \nthem to work or face penalties. That is an unfunded mandate if we do \nnot help them provide the resources to meet those criteria that we are \nlaying out in this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues for listening here \nthis afternoon. I know I have probably bored them over the years on \nthis subject matter, going back 7 and 8 years ago when we started the \nchild care debates. But I think most people recognize today--certainly \nthe corporate community does. The business community has had tremendous \nsophistication in understanding its employees' needs. They \nunderstanding the value of productive workers and having good, adequate \nchild care alleviates worries so those employees can pay full attention \nto their jobs. Every sector of our society seems to appreciate the \nrelationship between people's worries about their children, the \npriorities that people place on their children and their children's \nneeds and the simultaneous need to be a productive and successful \nworker.\n  As we now talk about getting people off public assistance and moving \nthem into the work force for the benefit of everyone, most importantly \nthat individual, the element of dealing with their young children is \nsomething that we have to take into consideration.\n  I think exempting the families, as appealing as that may be to some, \nconfuses the issue rather than sticking to the point of trying to make \nit possible for people to get to work and help them stay there through \nan adequate and appropriate child care system or structure.\n  So with that, Mr. President I urge my colleagues to take a look at \nthis. We will reengage the debate on Monday and hopefully come up with \nan adequate solution that will make it possible for all of us to begin \nto support the Dole proposal on welfare reform.\n  I know, in speaking with others, that the administration is very \ninterested in supporting a bill that will truly be a welfare reform \nbill. That is the strong desire of President Clinton. He wants to do \nit. He believes that can be done if an issue like this can be \nadequately addressed and several others. But this is certainly an \nimportant element in all of that.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S12893-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12923-S12924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     SENATOR PACKWOOD'S RESIGNATION EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 1, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I am delighted to \nhave this opportunity to make a few remarks and to offer two amendments \nto the Dole modified amendment for the welfare reform proposal.\n  Mr. President, the Dole modified amendment which is offered today is \na substantial improvement, a very substantial and significant step \ntoward the right kind of operation in terms of reforming welfare. I am \npleased to see that the mechanism for delivering block grants--which \nwas first recommended in the proposal I made on welfare reform called \nCIVIC, Senate bills 842, 843, 844 and 845, the proposal for delivering \nblock grants directly from the Department of the Treasury to the \nStates--is included and that will vastly reduce the Federal welfare \nbureaucracy, which I considered to be a bureaucratic tax upon the poor, \nand make resources available to the truly needy. It should limit \nWashington's interference in the States' welfare reform efforts.\n  As I have spoken many times on the floor, ending the micromanagement \nand intermeddling involvement of HHS to the extent possible, and giving \nStates the opportunity to craft and shape welfare reform so that it \nmeets the needs of the people in the States, is very important. We do \nneed to replace the failed system of welfare which has been a \nWashington-run system, and the modified amendment proposed by Senator \nDole would help achieve this, in part, by adopting the proposal which \nis for direct block grants to the States that bypass much of the \nredtape of Washington.\n  Also, it is important that the Dole amendment includes an independent \naudit provision which will eliminate much of the Washington \nmicromanagement and prevent funds from being consumed needlessly on \nbureaucratic oversight. Under this provision, States would supply to \nthe Department of the Treasury audits conducted by independent auditors \ndemonstrating their compliance and that block grant funds have been \nused properly in serving the needy populations.\n  I want to also say how pleased I am to see that the modified \namendment includes a provision adapted from my welfare reform bill, \nwhich recognizes that Government programs alone will never solve all of \nour welfare needs. We have to allow States to involve a number of \nnongovernmental charitable organizations, including faith-based \norganizations, in serving the poor. Organizations like the Salvation \nArmy and Boys and Girls Clubs are often more successful in serving \npeople in need than are governmental institutions. We need to be able \nto tap these resources effectively. There is a character in the \nprograms like the Boys and Girls Clubs and the Salvation Army that is \nimportant in meeting needs. It is a character associated with charity, \nwhich provides for a kind of compassion and caring that instills hope \nand aspiration in the lives of people.\n  The modified amendment includes very important provisions in this \nrespect, which will ensure that such organizations that are selected to \nparticipate in meeting the needs of the poor are not forced to \ncompromise their character. Furthermore, any person eligible for \nassistance who would be offended by going to one of these organizations \nto receive assistance would have an opportunity to receive alternative \nservices from the state.\n There have been clear guidelines set to protect individual rights and \nto protect the rights of the organization.\n\n  While these are important provisions included in the modified Dole \namendment, Mr. President, the modified amendment still I think needs \nadjustment and falls shorts of being a comprehensive welfare reform \nbill.\n  That is why I intend to send a pair of amendments to the desk which \nwould broaden the bill to include block grants for two major welfare \nprograms: Food stamps and supplemental security income, or the SSI \nprogram.\n  Block grants are essential for these programs because if you leave \nwelfare partially open ended as entitlement programs, and partially \nblock granted, there is a tendency on the part of jurisdictions to \nshift the welfare caseload from the areas which are block granted to \nthe areas that are open ended and entitlements.\n  As a result, rather than controlling and managing welfare \neffectively, you just push from one area of the welfare population to \nanother, move people from AFDC over to SSI. In some cases, that move \nwould be far more expensive.\n  A single child on SSI gets $448 a month. There are AFDC programs \nwhich provide $200 or $300 a month, and a shift in that population \nwould not be a reform at all in terms of cost containment, but a way of \njust dramatically increasing our welfare costs. As a matter of fact, it \nwould make it very difficult for us to control costs.\n  In addition, when you have a program which has no limit on it, \ntotally entitlement and totally federally funded, the incentives on the \npart of State and local instrumentalities to combat fraud and abuse are \nlow. If we give the items in block grants to the States, the incentive \nto contain fraud and abuse, to detect it, to root it out of the system, \nis elevated.\n  Mr. President, fraud and abuse are rampant in the Food Stamp Program \nand SSI today because as the rolls grow, the money flows. There is no \nincentive to the welfare industry to reduce the problem. The only way \nwe will be able to combat fraud and abuse is to give States the ability \nto design and enforce these programs and the incentive for them to \nlimit the expenditures in these programs. I intend to send two \namendments to the desk regarding SSI and food stamps.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I join today Senator Coats in introducing an \n\n[[Page S 12925]]\n  amendment which also recognizes we must look beyond Government to solve \nthe welfare problems. Specifically, we need to encourage people to get \ninvolved personally in helping the needy. Our amendment combines \nproposals which we have offered in the past to accomplish this goal. It \nwould provide a nonrefundable tax credit to individuals who volunteer \ntime as well as money to give to charitable organizations so that \nindividuals who contributed at least 50 hours per year at nonprofit \nprivate or religious charitable organizations which serve the needy \nwould be eligible for not just the tax deduction regarding a $500 \ncontribution, but if they also have a $500 contribution, they would be \neligible for a tax credit of up to $500.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that simply rearranging the deck \nchairs on the ``Welfare Titanic'' would be turning our backs on the \nmost pressing issues facing our future. We must fundamentally reform \nthe entirety of our welfare system.\n  We simply cannot tinker around the margins. We cannot afford to \nrepeat the mistakes we made in the past. We must all admit that \nGovernment alone has failed miserably and will continue to fail.\n  We must, I believe, have these expanded block grants so we do not \nhave a partial system of block grants which invites cost-shifting and \ndoes not provide incentives for fraud and abuse containment.\n  I believe we must invite a far broader band of our society to \nparticipate in meeting the needs of the needy, and for that reason we \nneed to encourage involvement by a far broader group of individuals in \nsociety.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2561 and 2562 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I offered several amendments which I will \nexplain in brief.\n  My first amendment would change the formula for distributing Federal \nwelfare funds to the States.\n  I am offering this amendment with Senator Dale Bumpers. I would ask \nfor unanimous consent to add Senators Bryan, Moseley-Braun, Pryor, \nJohnston, and Reid as cosponsors.\n  In sum, our formula amendment would distribute funds under this bill \non the basis of a State's number of children in poverty.\n  In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at this point a description of the Graham-Bumpers formula \namendment. Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Graham-Bumpers Children's Fair Share Proposal\n\n  The Graham-Bumpers Children's Fair Share proposal allocates funding \nbased on the number of poor children in each state.\n  The amendment would be needs based, adjusts for population and \ndemographic changes, treats all poor children equitably does not \npermanently disadvantage states based on previous year's spending in a \nsystem that is being dismantled, and allows all states a more equitable \nchance at achieving the work requirements in S. 1120. The Graham-\nBumpers Children's Fair Share measure would establish a fair, equitable \nand level playing field for poor children in America, regardless of \nwhere they live.\n  Disparities in funding would be narrowed in the short-run and \neliminated over time--in sharp contrast to S. 1120.\nI11Children's Fair Share Allocation Formula: The Children's Fair Share \nformula would allocate funding based on a three-year average of the \nnumber of children in poverty. This information would come from the \nBureau of the Census in its annual estimate through sampling data. With \nthe latest data available, the Secretary would determine the state-by-\nstate allocations and publish the data in the Federal Register on \n  January 15 of every year.Small State Minimum Allocation: For any \nState whose allocation was less than 0.6%, the minimum allocation would \nbe set at the lesser of 0.6% of the total allocation or twice the \nactual FY 1994 expenditure level.\n  Allocation Increase Ceiling: For all states except those covered by \nthe small state minimum allocation, the amount of the allocation would \nbe restricted to increase not more than 50% over FY 1994 expenditure \nlevels in the first year and to 50% increases for every subsequent \nyear.\n  Final Adjustment to Minimize Adverse Impact: The savings from the \n``allocation increase ceiling'' would exceed that for ``small state \nminimum allocation''. The net effect of these adjustments would be \nreallocated among the states who receive less than their FY 1994 actual \nexpenditures.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My second amendment addresses the issue of unfunded \nmandates. In the spirit of S. 1, the first bill of this session that \nwill seek to limit unfunded mandates in the future, a bill which was \npassed with bipartisan support and signed into law by the President, I \nam offering an amendment to apply the principles of S. 1--the unfunded \nmandates bill--to the welfare reform bill.\n  My third amendment deals with the section of the Dole bill the calls \nfor a ranking of States' compliance with the provisions of this bill. \nMy thesis is that this ranking system would be inherently unfair, \nbecause of the disparate amounts that would flow to States under this \nbill. Therefore, if we're going to give the States a grade, my \namendment would require the Secretary to take into account the number \nof poor children in each State.\n  My fourth amendment deals with the work-participation goals in the \nDole bill. My amendment would allow those work goals to be modified, \nbased on the amount of funding a State receives. My final amendment \nwould allow legal aliens currently receiving benefits to continue to be \neligible under this legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH).

Mr. President, seeing no other Senators present, I \nwould like to respond to the comments of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  As I said, yesterday when I made comments on the issue of child care, \nI have sympathy for what he is talking about. I was a member of the \nWays and Means Committee which last year worked on the Republican Task \nForce on Welfare and came up with a bill, H.R. 3,500, with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts spoke to and came over and said we should adopt the \nSantorum bill over here from last session because indeed in the last \nsession we introduced a bill that, as chairman of the task force, will \nprovide more money for child care recognizing the need that if we are \ngoing to put people into work that we would in fact be required to come \nup with some more money for child care.\n  I say that under H.R. 3,500 we did not block grant the program. We \ndid not give States the kind of flexibility that we do in this bill, \nand that Governors from across the country--as I said, yesterday, 80 \npercent of the people who are on welfare today are represented by \nRepublican Governors. Those Governors have almost unanimously--I think \nthere is one Governor so far that has not come out and endorsed this \nproposal--said that they are willing to take the allocation of \nresources provided in this bill and can in fact run programs that will \nput people to work and provide day care and the other support services \nthat are necessary to get people into work.\n  So while we did provide money in that bill in the House, we did not \nprovide the flexibility that the Governors wanted. They believe, as \nsort of the age-old tradeoff, as most Governors will tell you, if you \nare going to give us all these requirements give us the money to live \nwith them. If you are going to give us responsibility, give us the \nflexibility and we will not need as much money.\n  That is pretty much the bottom line here. We believe we are actually \nable to provide more money overall if we give more flexibility to run \nthe programs and not have the bureaucratic hoops to jump through here \nin Washington which cost a lot of money for the States to comply with. \nSo that is one comment.\n  The other comment I would make is that in the programs that have in \nfact required work and in fact did put people into work. I cite the \nexample of Riverside, CA, Grand Rapids, MI and Atlanta. In those \nprograms where you had these work requirements you had substantial cost \nsavings from the existing programs as a result of implementing this \nprogram.\n  You had I believe about a 15 percent reduction in food stamps, over \n20 percent reduction in AFDC payments and over 25 percent reduction in \nAFDC caseload. So you got a lot of people off welfare who maybe should \nnot have been on welfare in the first place and you had a reduction in \nthe expenditures which that pool of resources \n\n[[Page S 12930]]\ncould be used to provide the supplemental benefits that are necessary \nto put people to work. In fact, that is what was done in these \nexperimental cities that I referenced.\n  So it is a matter of better targeting resources. It is not a matter \nthat we have to keep putting up more and more money.\n  The final point I wanted to make on child care, and it is a sensitive \none, is that I share the concern, and in fact I support the Snowe \namendment which now is the modified Dole package which would provide \nfor mothers who have children under 5 to be able to be exempted from \nthe work requirement if they can demonstrate that they simply do not \nhave child care available or the child care available is simply \nunaffordable under the circumstances that they are in.\n  I support that because I think we first have to make sure that before \nwe create an entitlement for someone to get child care we have to make \nsure there are not any other sources of day care available. There are \npeople on welfare who have parents and grandparents who can help \nprovide day care for children, who have neighbors, who have other \nsituations in which they can in fact find child care for their children \nwithout resorting to government entitlement. The government entitlement \nand the big concern I have with the Government entitlement is it \nbecomes the first resort for day care, not the last, and that it \nbecomes another program that just simply grows and grows and grows and \nwe continue to break down the family, the need for parents and \ngrandparents as we have done historically not just in this country, in \nevery civilization known, to have parents and grandparents of the \nmother be able to be there and help provide for the extended family.\n  We can continue to say that is not as important, or the Government is \ngoing to take their place now, that the Government is going to be in \nthere first to provide this day care. I think that is harmful. I do not \nthink that should be the first resort. I think we should say that \nfamilies should continue to work together and not look to the \nGovernment to provide day care for children. If you are going to have \nchildren, there should be a responsibility of not only the parents but \nthe grandparents involved to be a participant in helping. And in fact \nthat is what happens today in most cases in America.\n  If we create this entitlement, which is what has been talked about, I \nthink we really potentially damage. Unintended as it may be, I think we \ndamage the nucleus of the relationships of families in America, and the \ndependency which I think is so necessary between generations to hold \nfamilies together.\n  The other point I would want to make on that is that if we provided \nan entitlement for mothers--and it is predominantly mothers--for \nmothers on welfare, we say if you go on welfare and then go to work \nunder a work program, we will provide you day care, but if you do not \ngo on welfare and you just are trying to make ends meet as a single \nmom, you are on your own, wow. What are we saying here? What are we \nsaying to single mothers who are out there, as they are, in the \nmillions today just trying to get kids to day care and get to work and \nnot be late and get home on time and the rest, and we say if you get on \nwelfare, we will make it easy for you; the Government will pay for it? \nWhat are we saying?\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. It is an interesting point because presently we provide \nabout 640,000 children in a program with assistance. What we need to \ntalk about is not just people on welfare but people going to work at \n125 percent or so of poverty. And there is a transition where people \nshould start to contribute to their own child care needs.\n  I did not mention this in my remarks, but one of the dangers I think \nof what is going to happen here is that you have people working right \nnow that are out there, they are getting help with their child care. If \nwe are now going to say to the welfare recipient that you have got to \ngo to work, and we are going to say, take what exists out there today, \nwe may be taking care from some of the very people working right now, \nmanaging to stay at work because they are getting help with child care. \nThey are going to be put into a second-class status because the person \non welfare is going to utilize that dollar.\n  My colleague is correct. We have provided, not to any great extent, \nfor some families to try and keep them off of welfare because even if \nyou get off welfare, you have to stay off and staying off requires a \nbit of time so you can get up to a point where you can afford the rent. \nSetting aside health care and looking just at food, rent and so forth, \naverage day care costs, private costs are $80, $100 a week, for the \nleast expensive programs in many cases, and if you are pulling down \nsomething a bit above minimum wage that gets almost impossible.\n  So it is a good point, but it seems to me it does not necessarily \nargue against trying to get people off welfare and providing that \ntransitional assistance. I think the Senator was making that point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not making the point that we should not provide \nchild care for women who are on welfare who want to work. I am not \nsaying we should not do that. The point I was making is I do not think \nwe should create a guaranteed entitlement for it. There is a \ndifference. The Senator mentioned in fact for working mothers today \nthere is no entitlement to day care. There simply is not. We do, as the \nSenator mentioned, have some 600,000 people who are in need of day care \nassistance, that assistance, but it is a very tough program. You have \nto walk through the hoops to be able to qualify. You have to prove that \nthere is no family or other kind of support necessary.\n  It is not easy to qualify. And even at that, even if you qualify, you \nare not guaranteed a slot.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to make the case. We have no entitlement. This \namendment is not an entitlement. There is no provision here saying that \nyou are entitled to it. We have been told this is the rough amount of \nmoney--with the 165 percent increase under the Dole work provisions, \nthis is the amount of money we have been told would be adequate to \nprovide for child care. There is no entitlement here at all. In the \npast, I have argued for entitlement.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator has.\n  Mr. DODD. But not on this one. This is no entitlement.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If you provide the amount of money that will be \nnecessary to fully fund the program, in a sense you have not created an \nentitlement but you have created a slot for everyone.\n  Mr. DODD. Hopefully. But you do not have a right to go to court, as \nyou do under an entitlement program, and say I have met the criteria; \ntherefore, you must provide me.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think that is a distinction without a difference.\n  Mr. DODD. That is an entitlement program.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. OK. Then if we are going to provide sufficient money \nfor everyone to get child care as a first resort and a last resort, \nwhile it may not be an entitlement, it has in effect the same \nconsequence which is everyone will have a day care slot, and that is a \nFederal day care slot which I think is a dangerous precedent and a \ncounterproductive one.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that I think through the Snowe amendment \nwe are going to without a doubt encourage States--and I think a lot of \nStates would do this without our encouragement--encourage States to \nmove forward and to provide day care support for working single \nparents. And I will go through that rationale again. I think it is \nimportant.\n  Under the Dole provision, we are going to require eventually 50 \npercent of all people who participate in this program, the welfare \nprogram, 50 percent will have to be in the work program. There will be \na substantial number, roughly a third is usually the number, a third \nconsidered to be incapacitated, disabled, whatever the term you want to \nuse, who will never be in a work program because of either their own \nincapacity or disability of a child that would make that parent really \nineligible to have to leave that child and go to work.\n  So you are setting aside a third that you pretty well know are not \never going to be in that program. So you have 50 percent of the whole \nthing and \n\n[[Page S 12931]]\nagain a third of that is gone, so you have a pretty good chunk of the \nremaining caseload that are going to be required to work.\n  If you say that single parents are going to be required to work \nirrespective of the age of the child, so they are going to be in the \ndenominator of the equation, but they are not required to work if they \ncan demonstrate that child care is not available to them--and again the \nState will set the criteria--that means they are not going to be in the \nenumerator, and if you have a pool here of roughly 67 percent of the \nwhole group, and you have to get 50 percent to work, you have a pretty \nslim margin to work with to exclude people because they cannot get day \ncare.\n  So what you are going to do is to meet your 50 percent number the \nState really is going to be forced to go out and provide day care \nopportunities for younger mothers, and I think that is what we want to \ndo. We want to make sure that as efficiently as possible we can direct \nthe States to in effect go out and provide those dollars.\n  So we think we have gotten around the problem without getting into \nthe--I will not use the term entitlement because it is not \nentitlement--without getting used to, I would say, the guaranteed slot \nthat is being provided for in the Dodd amendment, however well-\nintentioned I think--I know the Senator from Connecticut has been a \nchampion in trying to expand the number of day care guarantees for \nparents. However well-intentioned that is, I do not think that is the \nright direction we should be taking at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield for just one more point, I \nappreciate his concerns, and I was not aware of his efforts in the \nprevious Congress in the other body with H.R. 3500, with the Senator's \nown welfare reform and child care proposals, but I will take a look at \nthem. Maybe I will offer that as an amendment, the Santorum bill--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Do not put me on the spot.\n  Mr. DODD. From the previous Congress. I just raise this because it is \na good point. States under the Dole proposals I suspect--I am sure they \nare going to be wanting to do what they can in child care, but I \nsuspect they are also going to weigh the cost of doing that, through \nwhatever mechanism they have to do it, either by cutting spending in \nother areas or raising taxes, and the penalties imposed upon them if \nthey do not meet the criteria of the legislation regarding a certain \npercentage of the welfare recipients going to work. They will decide \nwhich they would rather do, pay the penalty, which I presume would be \nlower--I do not know exactly, but I suspect it is lower than what it \nwould be to come up with the resources to see to it that the welfare \nrecipient makes the transition. That is one of my concerns here. So we \nwill end up with States paying the penalties in some cases because it \nis cheaper to pay the penalties than it is to meet that criteria, or \nthat race to the bottom approach where they will say: Look, we are \ngoing to lower this thing so that people will not stay around in this \nState and they will find some other State, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, \nsome other place to go to, so you will have a competition as to who \nwill get this thing done and we have another national problem.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would say to the Senator again in the Dole bill as \nrecently modified there is a provision that States have to do 75 \npercent maintenance of effort over 3 years. There really is no attempt \nto race to the bottom. I do not know how many States are going to be \nwilling to sort of give back dollars as opposed to reallocating \nexisting dollars.\n  We are not really asking to spend more money. We are telling them to \nreallocate dollars to child care, to implement the work program. And \nthat is not costing them any Federal funds to do that. If they violate \nand suffer penalties, they will lose Federal dollars. And that is a \npretty powerful incentive, I think. I will get those numbers as to what \nthe penalties will be.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think it is important to look. If, in fact, we see \nthe penalties are not particularly stiff, I would look at dealing with \nthat down the road.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD.

I want to make a brief explanation of this amendment. I \nhope it will be adopted as a technical amendment. I have provided a \ncopy to each side.\n  I think this is a necessary change in the provision that is in the \nDole amendment dealing with Indians, Indian tribes and tribal \norganizations. It will provide in Alaska there be a specific regional \nframework for block granting welfare funds. We think that is necessary \nto meet the circumstances of our State. After all, it is one-fifth the \nsize of the United States.\n  The administrative costs of just having the welfare assistance \nprograms administered from Juneau are almost the same as administering \nthe whole east coast of the United States from Washington, DC. It is \nsomething we are trying to get away from through block granting.\n  This amendment would apply only to Alaska and specify that there are \n12 Alaska Native regional nonprofit corporations that are the only \nnative organizations in Alaska which would be eligible to receive \nfamily subsistence block grants directly under the concepts of this \nbill. I think that this will limit the eligible organizations. There \nare some 170 different organizations that would be entitled otherwise \nif we would block grant directly to those organizations.\n  We prefer to do it on a regional basis to keep administrative costs \nto a minimum and it is my hope that having decided to do this, if it is \napproved by Congress, that within each region the regional nonprofits \nthemselves will work with the villages so that these moneys can be \nadministered with the very least administrative costs and will not be \nspending money on people flying planes or going to visit these \nindividual areas from far distant places. Let the people of the area \ndetermine what the basic family assistance money should be used for.\n  It is consistent with the law. We are not changing the law at all. It \nmerely changes the concept of the tribal organization that is specified \nin the previous subsection (a) of subsection 4, which is the Indian \ntribe and tribal organization section. I am hopeful that it will be \naccepted as a technical amendment.\n  I ask that the amendment be set aside temporarily until there is a \nreport from the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside \nfor later consideration.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nDole-Packwood welfare reform bill.\n  Mr. President, we live in the greatest nation on Earth. We are the \nwealthiest country in the world. But it is clear that some in our \nsociety do not share in this wealth. They are poor. They are jobless \nand in some cases homeless. And they must rely on public assistance to \nsurvive. In America, this is unacceptable. And we should be committed \nto improving their lives.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the current welfare system \nneeds reform. But the central goal for any welfare reform bill should \nbe to move welfare recipients into productive work.\n  This will only happen if we provide welfare recipients with education \nand job training to prepare them for employment. It will only happen if \nwe provide families with affordable child care. It will only happen if \nwe can place them into jobs, preferably in the private sector or--as a \nlast resort--in community service.\n  But the Dole-Packwood bill is not designed to help welfare recipients \nget on their feet and go to work. It is only designed to cut programs--\npure and simple.\n  It is designed to take money from the poor so that Republicans can \nprovide huge tax cuts for the rich. That is what is really going on \nhere!\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the radical experiment proposed in this \nlegislation will inflict problems on our society while producing \ndefenseless victims. Those victims are not represented in the Senate \noffices. They are not here lobbying against this bill. They do not even \nknow they are at risk.\n  The victims will be America's children. And there will be millions of \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the AFDC Program provides a safety net for 9 million \nchildren. These young people are innocent. They did not ask to be born \ninto poverty. And they do not deserve to be punished.\n  These children are African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and white. They \nlive in urban areas and rural areas. But, most importantly, they are \nAmerican children. And we as a Nation have a responsibility to provide \nthem with a safety net.\n  The children we are talking about are desperately poor, Mr. \nPresident, They are not living high off the hog. These kids live in \npoverty.\n  Consider the following:\n  The median AFDC grant for a family of three is $366 per month. This \nis the same amount a Member of Congress makes in one day; $366 per \nmonth does not buy much these days. As a matter of fact, it gets a \nfamily of three to 38 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  Mr. President, this is the median. Consider the conditions some \nchildren live under in certain States.\n  In Mississippi, the maximum a family of three can receive is $120 per \nmonth. This will get a family to 13 percent of the poverty level.\n  In Texas, the maximum a family of three can receive is $184 per \nmonth. This will get a family to 19 percent of the poverty level.\n  Mr. President, it is hard for many of us to appreciate what life is \nlike for the 9 million children who live in poverty and who benefit \nfrom AFDC.\n  I grew up to a working class family in Paterson, NJ, in the heart of \nthe Depression. Times were tough. And I learned all too well what it \nmeant to struggle economically.\n  But as bad as things were for my own family, they still were not as \nbad as for millions of today's children.\n  These are children who are not always sure whether they will\n   get their next meal. Not always sure that they will have a roof over \ntheir heads. Not always sure they will get the health care they need.\n\n  Mr. President, these children are vulnerable. They are living on the \nedge of homelessness and hunger. And they did not do anything to \ndeserve this fate.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about reforming a program that keeps \nthese children afloat, we will not adopt a radical proposal like the \nDole-Packwood bill. We will not put millions of American children at \nrisk. And we will not simply give a blank check to States and throw up \nour hands.\n  Mr. President, this Republican bill is not a serious policy document. \nIt is a budget document. It's a down payment on a Republican tax cut \nthat targets huge benefits for millionaires and other wealthy \nAmericans. A tax cut that, as passed by the House, would provide \n$20,000 to those who make $350,000 per year.\n  Mr. President, if the Republicans were serious about improving \nopportunities for those on welfare, they would be talking about \nincreasing our commitment to education and job training. In fact, only \nlast year, the House Republican welfare reform bill, authored in part \nby Senator Santorum, would have increased spending on education and \ntraining by $10 billion.\n  This year, by contrast, the House Republican welfare bill actually \ncuts $65 billion, including huge reductions in education and training.\n  So what has changed? The answer is simple. This year, the Republicans \nneed the money for their tax cuts for the rich.\n  Mr. President, shifting our welfare system to 50 State bureaucracies \nmay give Congress more money to provide tax cuts. But it is not going \nto solve the serious problems facing our welfare system, or the people \nit serves.\n  To really reform welfare, Mr. President, we first must emphasize a \nvery basic American value: the value of work.\n  We should expect recipients to work. In fact, we should demand that \nthey work, if they can.\n  Of course, Mr. President, that kind of emphasis on work is important. \nBut it is not enough. We also have to help people get the skills they \nneed to get a job in the private sector. I am not talking about \nhandouts.\n  I am talking about teaching people to read. Teaching people how to \nrun a cash register or a computer. Teaching people what it takes to be \nself-sufficient in today's economy.\n  We also have to provide child care.\n  Mr. President, how is a woman with several young children supposed to \nfind a job if she can not find someone to take care of her kids? It is \nsimply impossible. There is just no point in pretending otherwise.\n\n[[Page S 12934]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Dole-Packwood bill does not even begin to address \nthese kind of needs. It does not even try to promote work. It does not \neven try to give people job training. It does not even try to provide \nchild care.\n  All it does is throw up its hands and ship the program to the States. \nThat is it.\n  Mr. President, that is not real welfare reform. It is simply\n   passing the buck to save a buck. And who's going to get the buck \nthat's saved? The people the Republicans really care about: the rich.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about welfare reform, I would \nsuggest that we start with adopting provisions that were contained in \nthe ``Work First'' alternative developed by Senators Daschle, Breaux, \nand Mikulski. Unlike the Dole-Packwood bill, this proposal addresses \nthe real problems facing our welfare system.\n  It emphasizes moving people into productive work by providing \neducation, training, child care, and health care for those who leave \nthe welfare rolls. And after 2 years, recipients would have to work, \neither in the private sector or in community service.\n  It provides flexibility for States to run welfare experiments, while \npreserving the Federal commitment to poor children.\n  It encourages families to stay together and discourages teen \npregnancy.\n  It contains tough new measures to better collect child support.\n  Finally, it makes savings in the Food Stamp and SSI Programs by \ncracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  This is a much preferable approach to welfare reform, Mr. President. \nIt emphasizes work and protects the safety net for children. It is the \ntype of balance we need to truly reform our welfare system.\n  Therefore, I will work with my colleagues to try to improve this \nDole-Packwood bill through amendments.\n  Mr. President, we have an enormous opportunity to improve the welfare \nsystem. President Clinton has made welfare reform a priority, and the \nAmerican people are demanding action.\n  But to do the job right, we are going to have to work on a bipartisan \nbasis. That means that my Republican colleagues will have to sit down \nwith Senate Democrats and the administration and produce a balanced \nreform bill. A bill that protects children. And a bill that promotes \nwork.\n  Mr. President, there is a precedent for such a bipartisan effort, and \nit can happen again. In 1988, the Senate passed the Family Support Act \nwhich provided funds for States to train AFDC recipients so that they \ncould move permanently into the work force.\n  We passed that legislation by a vote of 96 to 1 when the Democrats \ncontrolled both Houses of Congress. It was signed by President Reagan. \nAnd you know who attended the bill signing ceremony at the White House? \nThen-Gov. Bill Clinton.\n  I would hope that we could repeat this kind of bipartisanship. But to \ndo so, we are going to have to move well beyond budget-driven proposals \nthat simply shift the welfare problem to the States, and that threaten \nmillions of children in the process.\n  So I would strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Dole-Packwood \nbill. Let us reform our welfare system. But let us do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n                 tribal block grants and welfare reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Indian \nprovisions contained in the Dole substitute to H.R. 4, the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995. I commend the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nPackwood, for their efforts to overhaul our Nation's welfare system and \nfor including provisions which responsibly address the unique needs and \nrequirements of Indian country. Senators Dole and Packwood have taken \ngreat care to draft a welfare plan that effects real change in a system \nthat is greatly in need of repair while ensuring that all citizens, \nincluding our Nation's Indian population, receive equitable access to \nnecessary welfare assistance. It is important to point out that the \nDole substitute bill honors in many practical ways the special \nrelationship that the United States has with Indian tribal governments.\n  Clearly, our welfare system has failed to meet its goals. Dependency \nis the off-spring of the current welfare system. In order to foster \nindependence, we must completely replace the welfare system that breeds \nthis dependency.\n  Let me put it plain and simple--the great social programs of the past \nhave failed American Indians as much or even more than they have failed \nthe rest of America's citizens. These programs have failed Indians \nbecause they have largely ignored the existence of Indian tribal \ngovernments and the unique needs and of the Indian population. Recent \nattempts to fix this problem have been like placing a bandaid on a \ngaping wound. Under existing programs, Indians remain the worst-off and \nyet benefit the least. If we are to truly reform welfare then we cannot \nignore Indians, who year-after-year rank the highest in poverty and \nunemployment.\n  I believe that the Dole substitute bill promises greater hope for \nIndians because it allows their own tribal governments to serve Indians \nnow living in poverty. It empowers tribes themselves to assist in \nending the welfare dependency often created by existing programs by \nplacing resources necessary to fight local welfare problems into the \nhands of local tribal governments. Mr. President, I believe this bill \ndemonstrates a real commitment to ending welfare as Indians have known \nit. As I have said on many occasions, our successes as a nation should \nbe measured by the impact that we have made in the lives of our most \nvulnerable citizens--American Indians.\n  Early in the 104th Congress, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \nheld several hearings on the potential impact to Indians of various \nwelfare reform proposals such as block grants. During these hearings, \ntribal leaders spoke out in strong favor of direct Federal funding \nwhich would allow tribal governments flexibility in administering local \nwelfare assistance programs and stated their hopes of receiving no less \nauthority than the Congress chooses to give to State governments in \nthis regard. The committee also received testimony from the Inspector \nGeneral of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who \ntestified to how poorly Indians fare under block grants as currently \nadministered by State governments. In response to the record adduced at \nthese hearings, the Indian Affairs Committee developed provisions for \ndirect, block grant funding to tribal governments which are now \ncontained in the Dole substitute bill. These provisions reflect the \nefforts of many members on both the Indian Affairs and Finance \nCommittees, and to them I express my gratitude.\n  Let me take several minutes to explain the Indian provisions related \nto temporary assistance for needy families contained in the leader's \nbill and the goals and purposes of those governments. In general terms, \nthe bill authorizes Indian governments, like State governments, to \nreceive direct Federal funding to design and administer local tribal \nwelfare programs. Let me be clear--an Indian tribe retains the complete \nfreedom to choose whether or not it will exercise this authority. If it \ndoes not, the State retains the authority and the funds it otherwise \nhas under the Dole substitute bill.\n  Section 402(b) requires a State to certify, as it does with several \nother important Federal priorities, that it will provide equitable \naccess to Indians not covered by a tribal plan. This provision \nexpressly recognizes the Federal Government's trust responsibility to, \nand government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes.\n  Section 402(d) provides standard definitions of the terms ``Indian'', \n``Indian tribe'', and ``tribal organization'' in order to clarify the \nrespective limits of State and tribal government responsibilities under \nthe bill.\n  Section 403(a) establishes the method by which tribal plans are \nfunded, basing tribal grants on the amount attributable to Federal \nfunds spent by a State in fiscal year 1994 on Indian families residing \nin the service area of an approved tribal plan. Under this Section, \nStates are given advance notice before the tribal grant amounts are \ndeducted from their quarterly payment. Once deducted, the State has no \nresponsibility under the bill for those Indian families and service \nareas so identified in an approved tribal plan.\n  Section 403(e) provides that the secretary shall continue to provide \ndirect \n\n[[Page S 12935]]\nfunding, for fiscal years 1996 through 2000, to those Indian tribes or \ntribal organizations who conducted a job opportunities and basic skills \ntraining program in fiscal year 1995, in an amount equal to the amount \nreceived by such tribal JOBS programs in fiscal year 1995.\n  Section 404(b)(4) provides that a state may, at its option, count \nthose Indian families receiving assistance under a tribal family \nassistance plan as part of the calculation of a State's monthly \nparticipation rates in accordance with paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B) of \nsection 404.\n  Section 414 is the main Indian provision setting forth the basic \nauthority for tribal direct funding and the express requirements of \ntribal family assistance plans. It requires the Secretary to make \ndirect funding available to Indian tribes exercising this option in \norder to strengthen and enhance the control and flexibility of local \ngovernments over local programs, consistent with well-settled \nprinciples of Indian self-determination. In particular, section 414(a) \ndescribes how the goals of welfare reform pursued under this bill and \nthe goals of Indian self-determination and self-governance authorized \nunder separate authority are consistent. Section 414(b) establishes the \nmethodology for funding an approved tribal family assistance plan, \nincluding the use of data submitted by State and tribal governments. \nThis provision anticipates that the data involved is already collected \nor the added burden of data collection required will be de minimus. \nSection 414(c) provides that in order to be eligible to receive direct \nfunding, an Indian tribe must submit a 3-year family assistance plan. \nEach approved plan must outline the tribe's approach to providing \nwelfare-related services consistent with the purposes of this section. \nEach plan must specify whether the services provided by the tribe will \nbe provided through agreements, contracts, or compacts with intertribal \nconsortia, States, or other entities. This allows small tribes to join \nwith other tribes in order to economize on administrative costs and \npool their talents to address their common problems. Each plan must \nidentify with specificity the population and service area or areas \nwhich the tribe will serve. This requirement is designed to ensure that \nthere is no overlap in service administration and to provide a clear \noutline to affected State administrations of the boundaries of their \nresponsibilities under the Act. Each plan must also provide guarantees \nthat tribal administration of the plan will not result in families \nreceiving duplicative assistance from other State or tribal programs \nfunded under this part. Each plan must identify employment \nopportunities in or near the service area of the tribe and the manner \nin which the tribe will cooperate and participate in enhancing such \nopportunities for recipients of assistance under the plan consistent \nwith any applicable State standards. And finally, each plan must apply \nfiscal accounting principles in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31, \nUnited States Code. This last requirement is consistent with other \nFederal authority governing the administration by tribes and tribal \norganizations of similar block grant programs under authority of the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as \namended. Section 414(d) requires the establishment of minimum work \nparticipation requirements, time limits on receipt of welfare-related \nservices, and individual penalties consistent with the purposes of this \nsection and the economic conditions of a tribe's service area and the \navailability to a tribe of other employment-related resources. These \nrestrictions must be developed with the full participation of the \ntribes and tribal organizations, and must be similar to comparable \nprovisions in Section 404(d). The remaining provisions of Section 414 \nfurther ensure that funding accountability will be maintained by tribes \nand tribal organizations in administering funds under an approved \ntribal family assistance plan.\n  The funds provided to a tribe under section 414 are deducted from the \nState allocation, but only after advance notice to the State. Having \nlost the Federal support for temporary assistance to needy Indian \nfamilies in a tribal plan's service area, the State no longer has any \nresponsibility under the bill for those families. The Indian Affairs \nCommittee has been informed by various State representatives that it is \nadministratively more difficult and costly for States to provide \nservices to Indians who reside in remote locations of their States. \nWhile these States acknowledge a responsibility to provide services, \ncircumstances such as geographic isolation make it more difficult to do \nso. States are, therefore, well-served by these provisions, because if \nIndian families in a geographical area are identified in an approved \nand funded tribal plan, a State government no longer has the \nresponsibility to serve those families unless the tribe and the State \nagree otherwise.\n  Some tribal representatives have pointed out that some tribes may \nchoose not to exercise the option to administer a tribal plan, because \nthe bill does not require a State to provide State funding to \nsupplement the Federal funding provided to a tribe. As originally \ndrafted, the Indian provisions expressly permitted States to agree to \nprovide State funding or services to an Indian tribe with an approved \nplan in order to maintain equitable services. It is my understanding \nthat this language was deleted because other provisions in the bill \nprovide sufficient guarantees that States will ensure the delivery of \nequitable services. But under the bill's current provisions, a State is \nnot prohibited from entering into an agreement with a tribe for the \ntransfer of State funds or the provision of specific State services to \na tribe for the benefit of Indians within that State. Indeed, a State \ngovernment may choose to enter into an agreement with a tribal \ngovernment to induce the tribe to take over administration of these \nprograms, and one of the inducements could be a transfer of State funds \nto the tribe that would otherwise have been used by the State to serve \nthose who would now be served under the tribal plan. If State \nadministrators are sincere about making real progress on welfare \nreform, and I think they are, I expect they will act responsibly and \nsensitively with tribes that wish to join the State in administering \nprograms that end welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, it is important to point out that these Indian \nprovisions are consistent with the purposes of the Dole substitute \nbill. They do not seek to circumvent these purposes nor give preferable \ntreatment to Indian tribal governments. The tribal plans remain subject \nto minimum requirements and penalties similar to those applied to State \ngovernments. The Dole substitute also requires a tribe to comply with \nthe fiscal accountability requirements of chapter 75 of title 31, \nUnited States Code and the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, as amended. I would also submit that giving \ntribal governments the authority to administer a tribal welfare program \nis consistent with our goal of empowering local government control over \nlocal programs. It only stands to reason that, like States, Indian \ntribal governments are most familiar with the problems that plague \ntheir local communities.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate know that some Indian tribal \ngovernments may not have existing capacity or infrastructure to \nadminister complex welfare programs. Consequently, the Dole substitute \nbill includes provisions authorizing tribes to enter into cooperative \nagreements with States or other tribal governments for the provision of \nwelfare assistance. This will allow small tribes to join with other \ntribes in order to economize on administrative costs and pool their \ntalents and resources to address their common problems. However, I \nbelieve it is very important to permit and encourage those Indian \ntribal governments that do possess such capacity to participate in \nthese new welfare initiatives by addressing welfare issues at a local \nlevel.\n  It should go without saying that any State may enter into any \nagreement it chooses with a tribe for the transfer of State funds to \nthat tribe for the purpose of administering a welfare program that \nbenefits Indians within that State. In my view, it is in both a State \nand tribe's best interest to work out supplemental agreements for \nfunding and services where necessary because to do otherwise could \nundermine the goals of the bill.\n  I know that many Members in this body are aware that Indian Country \nhas historically been plagued by high \n\n[[Page S 12936]]\nunemployment and therefore its residents suffer from extremely high \npoverty rates. Therefore, I was pleased to learn that the Finance \nCommittee Chairman drafted provisions that enable Indian tribes that \nare\n currently administering tribal JOBS programs to continue to do so. \nSection 403 of the Dole substitute provides that the Secretary shall \nprovide direct funding in an amount equal to the amount received by the \nexisting tribal JOBS programs in fiscal year 1995. By keeping the JOBS \nprograms in Indian country intact, we will acknowledge the positive \nimpact it has made in the lives of thousands of Indians. Indians \nresiding in communities where a tribal JOBS program is in operation \nhave experienced a new sense of hope by developing basic job skills \nthat have helped them to secure stable job opportunities both on and \noff the reservation. The Dole substitute bill also contains provisions \nin titles VI and VIII which provide continuing resources for programs \nthat have proven successful in Indian country, such as the Child Care \nand Development Block Program as well as new programs that are critical \nto ending the high Indian unemployment rates such as the proposed \nworkforce development and training activities. These provisions, along \nwith the JOBS component will greatly assist in helping Indian country \ncontribute to the goals of welfare reform and the purposes of the act.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to point out that with \npassage of these provisions in the Dole substitute bill the Senate will \ndischarge some of its continuing responsibilities under the U.S. \nConstitution--the very foundation of our treaty, trust, and legal \nrelationship with the Nation's Indian tribes, and which vests the \nCongress with plenary power over Indian affairs. I was deeply troubled \nto learn that H.R. 4, as passed by the House, did not address the \nunique status of Indian tribal governments or the trust responsibility \nof the Federal Government to the Indian tribes. There was no House \ndebate on the status of the welfare state on many Indian reservations \nnor the impact that the proposed changes to welfare programs would have \non access to services already in existence in Indian country. Nor was \nthere any mention made in the House welfare debate of the significant \nlegal and trust responsibility that the Federal Government has to the \nIndian tribes. Therefore, it is extremely important that the Senate do \nso. to do otherwise would be to abrogate our responsibilities. I was \npleased to learn that the distinguished chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee has acknowledged with some regret the failure of the \nHouse to address the Indian issues and has given his assurance to \naddress this oversight during conference on the bill.\n  As the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I feel it is my \nresponsibility to take a moment to briefly expand my remarks to a \ndiscussion of the responsibilities of the Congress toward Indians under \nthe U.S. Constitution. The Constitution provides that the Congress has \nplenary power to prescribe Federal Indian policy. These powers are \nprovided for pursuant to the Commerce and the Treaty Power clauses. \nSadly, over the last two centuries, the Congress has poorly exercised \nits power and responsibility--subjecting Indian tribal governments to \ninconsistent or contradictory policies--policies of termination and \nassimilation. These policies have served to weaken well established \nIndian systems of government and, in my view, have greatly contributed \nto the welfare state that exists today on most Indian reservations.\n  I know that time and time again, I have stood on this floor to recite \ngrim statistics revealing that Indians are, and consistently remain--\neven in 1995--the poorest of the poor and always the last to benefit. \nToday, I will withhold from reciting that data because I believe that \nthis bill begins to turn the tide in this Nation's treatment of Indians \nand their tribal governments. Similar to the unfunded mandates bill we \nenacted into law earlier their year, the Dole substitute bill under \nconsideration will treat tribal governments like State governments by \nallowing them the flexibility and authority to directly administer \ntheir own programs free of Federal bureaucratic intrusion and control. \nDue in large part to the leadership of the late President Nixon, the \nCongress for more than two decades have responsibly exercised its \nplenary authority by replacing the distorted and dismal policy of \ntermination of Indian tribal governments with empowering policies of \ntribal self-determination and self-governance--policies that respect \nand honor the government-to-government relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and the Indian tribes--policies that are consistent with the \nFederal trust responsibility and that set a new course of fairness in \nthe Federal Government's dealings with Indian tribal governments.\n  Given the renewed commitment by Congress to deal fairly with the \nIndian tribes, I fully understood why many tribal leaders became \nconcerned when the Congress earlier this year began moving toward a \nsystem of block grants to States. The\n concerns were that if the Congress did not revise the block grant \nmodel to reflect its responsibility to Indian tribal governments, the \ngovernment-to-government relationship between the tribes and the United \nStates would be soon eroded and the Federal trust responsibility held \nsacred in our Constitution and the decisions of our Supreme Court would \nbe relegated to the States.\n\n  These tribal concerns are likewise valid in a practical sense. A \nFederal Inspector General's report issued in August 1994 found that \nFederal block grants to States, in some instances have not resulted in \nequitable services being provided to Indians. That report found that in \n15 of the 24 States with the largest Indian populations, eligible \nIndian tribes did not receive funds even though Indian population \nfigures were used to justify the State's receipt of Federal funding. In \naddition, findings of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs revealed \nthat even when States were attempting to serve Indians, the \nprogrammatic and administrative costs of providing welfare services to \nIndians are often greater than providing local services to others. What \nthese findings revealed to me is that when either the Federal or State \ngovernments have administered programs for Indians, Indians have not \nreceived an equitable share of services.\n  Mr. President, the whole purpose of welfare reform is to provide the \ntools to State governments to design and administer local welfare \nprograms. After all, we have come to understand that local governments \nwant and have the ability to create local solutions to address what \nare, in essence, local problems. I would suggest that this policy is no \ndifferent than the Federal Indian policies of tribal self-determination \nand self-governance. I also know that elected tribal officials have a \ngreat love of country and an incredible desire to contribute to the \nNation's goal of elevating members of their communities out of the \ndepths of poverty. Given the tools to do so, I believe that Indian \ntribes will make great contribution to the Nation's war on poverty.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I would like to \nacknowledge a group of Senators that I believe have demonstrated a \ngreat level of understanding and commitment to the importance of \naddressing the needs of Indian tribes in the Nation's welfare reform \nmovement. Senators Hatch, Inouye, Domenici, Simon, Murkowski, Pressler, \nCampbell, and Kassebaum have contributed to ensuring that Indian tribes \nare not overlooked and abandoned in the current welfare reform efforts.\n  Two members of the Indian Affairs Committee deserve particular \nrecognition: my good friend from Kansas, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum \nand my good friend from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Kassebaum, \nas chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, worked \nclosely with the Indian Affairs Committee and Senator Simon to ensure \nthat provisions for direct Federal funding would be available to Indian \ntribes in her committee's employment consolidation bill and that tribes \nwould continue to receive funding through the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. Senator Kassebaum's leadership has \ngreatly contributed to the fairness with which Indian tribes are \ntreated under H.R. 4 and the progress that has been made by the \nCongress in its treatment of Indian tribes.\n  I want to give particular thanks to my good friend from Utah, Senator \nOrrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has \n\n[[Page S 12937]]\nworked tirelessly with me over the last several months to shape and \nenhance tribal welfare provisions that could be acceptable in any \nwelfare reform plan. Senator Hatch is a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and he is a new member of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs. He has demonstrated a great level of understanding and \ncommitment to the betterment of the lives of Indian people, and I \ncommend Senator Hatch for his steadfast leadership in ensuring that \nIndian tribal governments are fairly treated in the welfare reform \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I understand that other major welfare reform proposals \nmake an effort to similarly address the needs of Indian tribes. While I \nhave placed my full support behind the provisions of H.R. 4 related to \nIndian tribal governments, I want to make sure to recognize the \nattention that has been paid and the work that has been done on behalf \nof Indian tribal governments by my colleague so the other side of the \naisle. For example, I know that S. 1117 would have provided a 3-percent \nallocation of funds to Indian tribes under the JOBS Program and would \nhave authorized new funding for teen pregnancy prevention and for teen \nparent group homes, and like the Dole substitute bill, provides \ncontinued funding for child care and development block grants to \ntribes.\n  The spirit in which the Senate has acted has adhered to a principle \nthat I believe should guide the Congress in matters of Indian affairs: \nIndian issues are neither Republican, nor Democratic. They are not even \nbipartisan issues--they are nonpartisan issues. They are day-to-day \nhuman issues which call for a level of understanding on both sides of \nthe aisle. While this body is not in total agreement with just how to \nreform welfare, the one thing we all agree upon is that whatever new \nform this Nation's welfare system takes, providing equal access to the \nNation's Indian population is not only the right thing to do, it \nhonorably discharges some of our continuing responsibilities under the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one definition given for the word ``ethics'' \nby the Random House Dictionary is--and I quote--``The branch of \nphilosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect \nto the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness \nand badness of the motives and ends of such actions.''\n  Members of this body who are called to service on the Ethics \nCommittee are asked to make judgments quite unlike the judgments \nrequired by service on any other committee of the Senate. These \nindividuals are called upon to grapple not only with public policy and \nlegal and constitutional questions, but also with the deeper \nphilosophical questions which have confronted the human race since Adam \nand Eve found themselves tempted in the Garden--namely ``the rightness \nand wrongness of certain actions'' by their own colleagues. There is no \nmore daunting task than this.\n  To be asked to sit in judgment of another's actions and motives is, \nin one sense, an honor, but it is also an humbling experience for those \nwho are so honored to sit in judgment. And with that charge must come \nthe certain inner realization that no one among us is without fault, \nthat none of us is free from errors in judgment, weakness, and at times \nfailings of character. Such task is made all the more difficult in a \nbody such as this, where politics too easily intrudes, and where \nfriendships developed over long years can cloud one's objectivity.\n  I am deeply saddened by the tragedy that has befallen our colleague, \nSenator Packwood. However, he has done the right thing in choosing to \nspare the Senate further agony over his fate. Although this experience \nhas been difficult for all concerned, one thing is clear. The Senate \nEthics\n Committee has again performed its most arduous function with honor, \nthoroughness and professionalism. I commend the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator McConnell, vice chairman, Senator Bryan, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Smith, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Craig for their \nhandling of this extremely contentious matter. I commend the very \nprofessional staff of the Ethics Committee for their diligent work \nstretching over some 2\\1/2\\ years. I understand that the staff read \n16,000 pages of documents, spent approximately 1,000 hours in meetings \nand interviewed over 260 witnesses during the investigation of this \nmatter. That staff has served the Senate well.\n\n  We live in times which are, unfortunately, more politically charged \nand ruthlessly partisan than I have ever witnessed in my tenure in the \nSenate. And it is nothing short of amazing that the Ethics Committee, \nevenly split among Democrats and Republicans, could come to a unanimous \ndecision on this very unfortunate and highly politically charged \nmatter. They were pulled and they were tugged by the media, by other \ncolleagues, by an enormous workload, by political forces outside this \nbody, and I am sure by their own personal inner turmoil over judging \nthe actions and determining the fate of a fellow human being. Still and \nall, they came through. The ability of the Senate to police itself has \nbeen questioned time and time again.

REALLOCATION MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \n     purposes of this title, during any fiscal year reallocations \n     of expenditures required by section

Federal \n     agency shall--\n       (i) identify qualified firms in eligible States designated \n     under section   04 and disseminate any information to such \n     firms necessary to increase participation by such firms in \n     the bidding for such contracts and subcontracts,\n       (ii) in order to ensure the objective described in section   \n     02, increase the national share of such contracts and \n     subcontracts for each eligible State designated under section \n       04(a) by up to 10 percent each fiscal year, and\n       (iii) thirty days after the end of each fiscal year, report \n     to the Director regarding progress made during such fiscal \n     year to increase the share of such contracts and subcontracts \n     for\n      such eligible States, including the percentage increase \n     achieved under clause (ii) and if the goal described in \n     clause (ii) is not attained, the reasons therefor.\n\n     Within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, the \n     Director shall review, evaluate, and report to the Congress \n     as to the progress made during such fiscal year to increase \n     the share of procurement contracts and subcontracts the \n     preponderance of the value of which has been performed in \n     such eligible States.\n       (B) With respect to each fiscal year, if any Federal agency \n     does not attain the goal described in subparagraph (A)(ii), \n     then, during the subsequent fiscal year, such agency shall \n     report to the Director prior to the awarding of any contract \n     or subcontract described in subparagraph (A) to any firm in \n     an ineligible State the reasons such contract or subcontract \n     was not awarded to any firm in an eligible State.\n       (C) In the case of any competitive procurement contract or \n     subcontract, the head of the contracting Federal agency shall \n     award such contract or subcontract to the lowest bid from a \n     qualified firm that will perform the preponderance of the \n     value of the work in an eligible State designated under \n     section ____04 if the bid for such contract or subcontract is \n     lower or equivalent to any bid from any qualified firm that \n     will perform the preponderance of the value of the work in an \n     ineligible State.\n       (D) In the case of any noncompetitive procurement contract \n     or subcontract, the head of each Federal agency shall \n     identify and award such contract or subcontract to a \n     qualified firm that will perform the preponderance of the \n     value of the work in an eligible State designated under \n     section ____04 and that complete such contract or subcontract \n     at a lower or equivalent price as any qualified firm that \n     will perform the preponderance of the value of the work in an \n     ineligible State.\n       (E) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any \n     procurement contract or subcontract, any firm shall be \n     qualified if--\n       (i) such firm has met the elements of responsibility \n     provided for in section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) as determined by the head of the \n     contracting Federal agency to be necessary to complete the \n     contract or subcontract in a timely and satisfactory manner, \n     and\n       (ii) with respect to any prequalification requirement, such \n     firm has been notified in writing of all standards which a \n     prospective contractor must satisfy in order to become \n     qualified, and upon request, is provided a prompt opportunity \n     to demonstrate the ability of such firm to meet such \n     specified standards.\n       (F) In order to reallocate expenditures with respect to \n     subcontracts as required by subparagraph (A), each Federal \n     agency shall collect necessary data to identify such \n     subcontracts beginning in fiscal year 1991.\n       (a) With respect to all other expenditures described in \n     section ____05, including all grants administered by the \n     Department of Transportation, the Department of the Interior, \n     the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, any \n     eligible State designated under section ____04(a) shall \n     receive 110 percent of such State's historic share with \n     respect to such expenditures.\n       (b) No reallocation shall be made under this section with \n     respect to allocable expenditures for any program to any \n     State in any fiscal year which results in a reduction of 10 \n     percent or more of the amount of such expenditures to such \n     State.\n       (c) No reallocation shall be made under the provisions of \n     this title which will result in any allocable Federal \n     expenditure to Federal tax ratio of any State being reduced \n     below 90 percent.\n\n     SEC. ____08. AMENDMENTS.\n\n       No provision of law shall explicitly or implicitly amend \n     the provisions of this title unless such provision \n     specifically refers to this title.\n\n     SEC. ____09. STUDY.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Treasury or a delegate of the \n     Secretary shall conduct a study on the impact of Federal \n     spending, tax policy, and fiscal policy on State economies \n     and the economic growth rate of States and regions of the \n     United States. In particular, the Secretary or his delegate \n     shall examine the extent to which the economies of States \n     which have allocable Federal expenditure to Federal tax \n     ratios below 100 are harmed by such a fiscal relationship \n     with the Federal Government.\n       (b) The report of the study required by subsection (a) \n     shall be submitted to Congress not later than December 31, \n     1996.\n\n     SEC. ____10. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this title shall take effect for fiscal \n     years beginning after the date of the enactment of this \n     title.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the Senate today winds to a close, we \nwill have perhaps a few more amendments by the 5 o'clock deadline. My \ncolleague and friend from Pennsylvania observes that there were about \n120 when we last counted, which does not auger well for the conclusion \nof our business by Wednesday evening. But it does speak to the \nextraordinary transformation in the debate over welfare policy in the \nUnited States.\n  I spoke earlier this week of the moment of February 8, 1971, when \nTime and Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report had as their cover \nstories the subject of welfare and the seeming intractable problem--\nthat at a time when the illegitimacy ratio in our country was one-third \nwhat it is today. The number of children born outside of marriage was \none-third of what it is today. In 1992, it was 1.2 million. The ratio \nwould be about 30 percent. It is about 33 percent today. That is the \nbasic social condition that leads to this baffling problem.\n  We are not alone, and it is important to know that. Just by \nhappenstance, Mr. President, this week's issue of The Economist, a \nBritish ``newspaper,'' as they call it, has as its cover story, ``The \nDisappearing Family.'' They have a chart on page 26 called ``Fewer Gold \nRings: Births to Unmarried Mothers as a Percentage of the Total.'' I \nfind myself cited as the source. Indeed our office did do this work.\n  Characteristically, the administration did nothing. \nCharacteristically, the Department of Health and Human Services does \nnothing. Characteristically, they are absent from this debate. At \ntimes, there has been no one in the Vice President's office, as there \nis on any major issue affecting legislation. They are vanishing, \ndefeated by the commitment to end welfare as they know it, and \nhorrified at the prospect of what that will mean as they see it happen.\n  The Economist has its ``lead article,'' as they say, on the subject, \nand then they have a long story. It begins:\n\n       To European ears, America's family values debate can sound \n     shrill, even surreal. It is taken as a sign that the citizens \n     of the new world remain considerably less sophisticated and \n     more moralistic than those of the old. But Europe would do \n     well to listen. In many American neighborhoods, the family \n     has collapsed. Among households with children and poor inner \n     cities, fewer than one in ten have a father in residence. If \n     there are lessons from this awful experience, they are worth \n     learning.\n\n  They go on to say that many of the same phenomenon are appearing in \nBritain. They differentiate between different parts of Europe that are \nadjacent but are very different in their approaches. Sweden is a \ncountry of individuals, and has a very high rate of birth outside of \nmarriage, but they are not births outside of households. All their \nfamily structure, their social policy, is built around the individual. \nGermany, which is just across the Baltic, is a nation built around \nfamilies. And all of their social policy is designed in that direction, \nand the consequences are easy to see. Our policies are hard to find.\n  Years ago, we observed that there is no way a nation can avoid a \nfamily policy.\n  It can only avoid acknowledging what the family policy is--or being \naware. Whatever you do, one way or another, will have consequences.\n  I rise in the remaining few moments of today's session to thank my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side, the minority side, for their support \nin the bill I offered this morning, the Family Support Act of 1995. \n\n[[Page S 12944]]\n\n  Mr. President, 41 Democrats voted for it; five did not. They have \ntheir reasons. They are understood and respected. Fifty-six altogether, \n51 Members of the other side voted ``no.'' Several mentioned to me that \none Senator on that side volunteered that it was the worst vote he ever \ncast, but that is understandable.\n  The point I tried to make is that this legislation, the Family \nSupport Act of 1988, passed the Senate 93-3 in its first form and then \nthe conference report 96-1.\n  We had consensus and we lost it. I have to think we began to lose it \nwhen President Clinton, campaigning for the Presidency, said he would \nend welfare as we know it, asked for a 2-year time limit, and no \nfurther details.\n  Legislation finally came forward in the 103d Congress, but very late, \nwith no expectation that it would be dealt with. I was chairman of the \nFinance Committee and was happy to do it but nobody wanted it. It was \nleft for this. A curious--how to say--silence from organizations. You \nwould have expected to hear something from the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, which I have worked with for 35 years in one form or another, \nhelping them get revenue sharing going directly to municipalities, and \nthings like that. Silent on our bill. The welfare reform advocates, \nchildren's advocates, silent on our bill. Democratic Governors, silent.\n  Well, the fact is, there has been an extraordinary change in \nexpectations of what Congress will do and a passivity which perhaps \naccounts for events, a complacency, the assumption that a Democratic \nadministration confirmed in these matters.\n  Well, we see the results. I will put on the Record that the absence \nof any support for the legislation which we put forward in the Finance \nCommittee last spring--the vote was 12-8, eight Democrats--has to be \ntaken as an unprecedented surrender and unprecedented abandonment of \nprinciple.\n  I say to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, they have abandoned every \nprinciple they have stood for in 35 years I have worked with them. The \nGovernors are split on partisanship.\n  The advocacy groups--what advocacy groups? Maybe their anxiety is \nthat, if they say anything, their funding will be cut off. Well, then, \nwe know where their priorities are.\n  Mr. President, I can only regret that silence, even as I express my \nappreciation for the Senators who did support us today. The time will \ncome when they will be proud of that vote. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2476 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate regarding Enterprise Zone legislation)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask amendment 2476 offered by the \nSenator from Michigan be called up and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] for Mr. \n     ABRAHAM (for himself an Mr. Lieberman) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2476 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENTERPRISE ZONES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Many of the Nation's urban centers are places with high \n     levels of poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high \n     crime rates, poor schools, and joblessness;\n       (2) Federal tax incentives and regulatory reforms can \n     encourage economic growth, job creation and small business \n     formation in many urban centers;\n       (3) Encouraging private sector investment in America's \n     economically distressed urban and rural areas is essential to \n     breaking the cycle of poverty and the related ills of crime, \n     drug abuse, illiteracy, welfare dependency, and unemployment;\n       (4) The empowerment zones enacted in 1993 should be \n     enhanced by providing incentives to increase enterpreneurial \n     growth, capital formation, job creation, educational \n     opportunities and home ownership in the designated \n     communities and zones;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore, it is the Sense of the \n     Senate that the Congress should adopt enterprise zone \n     legislation in the 104th Congress, and that such enterprise \n     zone legislation provide the following incentives and \n     provisions:\n       (1) Federal tax incentives that expand access to capital, \n     increase the formation and expansion of small businesses, and \n     promote commercial revitalization;\n       (2) Regulatory reforms that allow localities to petition \n     Federal agencies, subject to the relevant agencies' approval, \n     for waivers or modifications of regulations to improve job \n     creation, small business formation and expansion, community \n     development, or economic revitalization objectives of the \n     enterprise zones;\n       (3) Home ownership incentives and grants to encourage \n     resident management of public housing and home ownership of \n     public housing;\n       (4) School reform pilot projects in certain designated \n     enterprise zones to provide low-income parents with new and \n     expanded educational options for their children's elementary \n     and secondary schooling.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

A bill to relinquish any interest that the United States may \nhave in certain land that was subject to a right-of-way that was \ngranted to the predecessor of the Chicago and Northwestern \nTransportation Company, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    land title transfer legislation\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to permit \nthe transference of clear title to certain land in Douglas, WY. I \nbelieve that this legislation should be uncontroversial because of the \nunique history of this land, and the obvious public benefits which will \naccrue from its transfer.\n  Among those benefits: The transfer will facilitate the cleanup of a \n200-foot-wide blighted area that divides the city in half. It will also \nenable a number of citizens to finally secure sound and merchantable \ntitle to property on which their homes are located. These actions will \ndo much to continue to revitalize the city's downtown business \ndistrict.\n  The need for this legislation is based upon the particular legal \nhistory of this land. In the mid-19th century, the United States was \neager to fully settle the Western territories which had been acquired \nduring the Mexican War and in the Louisiana Purchase. The principle \nmeans of accomplishing this lay with the development of the railroads, \nwhich could bring not only settlers, but the rapid transportation of \ncommerce.\n  Laying rail over these vast expanses of the West was a most expensive \nundertaking. Realizing this, Congress passed a number of railroad acts \nallowing the immediate establishment of a series of railroad right-of-\nways. This was done through the use of special grants that were \nimmediately effective once a railroad decided to locate its track over \na specific piece of ground.\n  According to a document entitled ``Railroad Lands and Rights-of-Way'' \nthat was prepared by The First American Title Insurance Co., these \ngrants provided railroads with a limited fee title to strips of land \nranging from 200 to 400 feet in width wherever the track might be laid, \nas long as they adhered to the general routes established in these \ncongressional acts. No patents were given on these rights-of-way\n because the congressional act was sufficient in itself to convey the \ninterest to the railroad.\n\n  The titles to the track strips granted by Congress have been \ndetermined by \n\n[[Page S 12960]]\nvarious court interpretations to be limited fee estates. This is an \ninterpretation that has grown up over time, quite apart from the \nspecific mandates of statutory language.\n  It is at this point that the city of Douglas, WY, enters the story. \nOn March 3, 1875, one of these congressional railroad acts established \na railroad right-of-way for the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad \nthrough a section of what is now central Wyoming. Almost immediately \nthe city of Douglas, WY, was born and it grew up around the right-of-\nway, which still runs right smack through the center of town.\n  As the years passed, the railroad sold portions of land out of the \n200-foot-wide easement to the local citizens. Many of these lots now \ncontain homes whose current owners now have a quite serious problem: \nbecause the right-of-way is a limited fee, they are unable to gain good \nand clear title to their land.\n  To make matters more confounding, the railroad ceased operation and \nsought abandonment of this right-of-way on April 14, 1989, and filed \nformal notice in the Federal Register to that effect. In its wake, the \nrailroad left behind this strip of land that has since become quite \nunsightly and overgrown with weeds. Additionally, this land also \ncontains a number of dilapidated old buildings that blight the \ncommunity and are dangerous attractions to young children.\n  Fortunately, the city of Douglas remedied one of the most serious \ndangers by remodeling an old depot and part of the surrounding strip \ninto the city's chamber of commerce and a railroad interpretive center. \nThe city stands by now, ready and able to develop the remainder of this \nland into an attractive subdivision if Congress is willing to transfer \nclear title to this land.\n  I trust that the Senate will approve of this legislation in order to \ntransfer this land which previously was governed by the Chicago and \nNorthwestern Railroad. To do so will clearly serve the public interest, \nand impinges upon no private interests. The good citizens of Douglas \nwill greatly benefit from this correction of a problem rooted in long-\nago 19th century law, and I earnestly urge its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1224. A bill to amend subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, \nUnited States Code, relating to alternative means of dispute resolution \nin the administrative process, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n           the administrative dispute resolution act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the bill that I and Senator Levin are \nintroducing today, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1995, \nis an amendment to subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5 of the United \nStates Code, a law which I sponsored in 1989. That law, also titled the \n``Administrative Dispute Resolution Act,'' was designed to encourage \nFederal agencies to streamline dispute resolution processes through the \nuse of alternative dispute resolution techniques instead of litigation. \nIn other words, it would reduce our litigation process. These \ntechniques--often collectively referred to as ADR--include mediation, \narbitration, conciliation, fact-finding and minitrials, among others.\n  Since the implementation of the 1989 act, both Federal agencies and \nprivate parties have realized significant time and cost savings by \navoiding the litigation quagmire, while sacrificing little in fairness \nand party satisfaction. Almost all the Federal agencies now have some \nsort of ADR framework in place, and most have enjoyed significant \ndegrees of success. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency \nnow uses mediation and arbitration processes to resolve superfund, \nClean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act disputes. \nThe EPA and the private parties involved expressed great satisfaction \nwith the efficiency and fairness of these techniques for the resolution \nof complex regulatory issues.\n  Not only are ADR techniques more efficient, they are also far less \ncostly than litigation. One agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, has estimated a savings of $13 million in legal costs in \nthe last 3 years alone. Even better, the Resolution Trust Corporation \nestimated it saved $114 million over the last 4 years. Nor are these \ncost savings realized only in the Government. NRC, a private computer \ncompany, reduced it's pending lawsuits from 263 to 28 and cut the cost \nof outside attorneys' fees by half over a period of 10 years through \nthe use of ADR techniques. Also, a contractor was able to deliver a \ncompleted rocket testing facility to the Air Force 3\n months ahead of schedule and $12 million under budget by using ADR. In \nfact, the contractor was so satisfied with past ADR outcomes that it \nreleased all further claims against the Government.\n\n  Despite these gains, much work still remains in integrating ADR \ntechniques into the Federal Government. Many agencies lag behind in \nadopting ADR programs into their daily routines. This lag is at least \npartially due to institutional misgivings about the new and unfamiliar. \nHowever, it is also due to legitimate concerns about confidentiality, \nfairness and quality assurance. It is these latter concerns that our \nnew bill seeks to address. Based largely on an extensive and thorough \nanalysis by the Administrative Conference of the United States, this \nbill modifies and clarifies the 1989 ADR Act, making ADR more \nattractive to both Federal agencies and private parties for solving \nregulatory disputes. At this time I would like to briefly summarize how \nthe proposed act will accomplish this goal.\n  First, the bill removes the term ``settlement negotiations'' from the \ngroup of ADR techniques listed in the 1989 act. This will not decrease \nthe effectiveness of the act as ``settlement negotiations'' are not and \nhave never been covered by the act as they do not use third party \n``neutrals'' in resolving conflicts. Thus, abolition of the term merely \neliminates widespread agency confusion as to whether ``settlement \nnegotiation'' is a statutorily supported ADR technique, and does not \ndecrease the scope of the original act.\n  Second, the bill addresses agency confidentiality concerns by \nexempting all dispute resolution communications from Freedom of \nInformation Act disclosure. Although these communications have always \nbeen confidential by implication, this amendment to the 1989 act makes \nthat confidentiality express and clear.\n  Third, the bill makes it easier for agencies to acquire ``neutrals'' \nby streamlining competitive procedures for obtaining expert services \nand by allowing the acquisition of ``neutrals'' from nonprofit \norganizations.\n  Fourth, the bill eliminates the requirement that the validity of all \ncontract claims under $100,000 be certified by the contractor. This \nchange brings the 1989 ADR Act into conformance with the certification \nlevels in the Contracts Disputes Act, thus encouraging the use of ADR \ntechniques in many small disputes where they may be particularly \nappropriate.\n  Fifth, the bill authorizes the use of ``any alternate means of \ndispute resolution under the act or other mutually agreeable \nprocedures'' for resolving claims. This greatly expands the range of \navailable ADR techniques, above and beyond those listed in the statute, \nprovided that both parties in the dispute agree to the method \nultimately used.\n  Sixth, the bill orders the Chairman of the Administrative Conference \nof the United States to study the benefits and problems of Federal ADR \nuse and report these findings to Congress 3 years after this bill is \nenacted. This will allow Congress to reassess the value of ADR methods \nat that time and make appropriate changes.\n  Finally, the bill permanently authorizes the ADR Act by striking the \nsunset provision presently in the law.\n  Mr. President, there has been much progress in the implementation and \nuse of ADR techniques in the Federal Government since I first \nintroduced the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act in 1989. Passage \nof this amendment to the act will further this progress by eliminating \nthe remaining statutory barriers to ADR use and by clarifying statutory \nlanguage. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Levin and I in this \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 12961]]\n\n\n                                S. 1224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \nan inventory of historic sites, buildings, and artifacts in the \nChamplain Valley and the upper Hudson River Valley, including the Lake \nGeorge area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n          the champlain valley heritage corridor inventory act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation known as \nthe Champlain Valley Heritage Corridor Inventory Act. The legislation \nthat I am introducing is very similar to legislation that I have \nintroduced in the past, with minor alterations to reflect the many \ncomments I have received on this matter.\n  The corridor bill would inventory the many historically significant \ncultural resources which make up the Upper Hudson River Valley, the \nChamplain Valley, and the Lake George region. This would be \naccomplished by the Secretary of the Interior working with officials of \nState and local government, local historians and archaeologists, owners \nof historic sites, native Americans, local and regional planning \ncommissions, local and regional chambers of commerce, interstate \ncitizen groups, and any other interested parties. This is to be a grass \nroots coalition intended to benefit individuals and communities alike.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I offer today seeks to enhance \nsomething that, truly, already exists. Along Lake Champlain, Lake \nGeorge, and the Upper Hudson River in my home State of Vermont, and in \nNew York and the Province of Quebec, is a wondrous corridor of \nheritage, perhaps unrivaled for its historic richness in all of the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  Americans wishing to discover the history, first hand, of the French \nand Indian wars, the decisive campaign of the American Revolution and \nof a key campaign of the War of 1812, must come to this area.\n  Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point, the Saratoga Battlefield, Mount \nIndependence, Bennington Battlefield, Hubbardton Battlefield, the \nPlattsburgh battle sites are there, and nowhere else. It is a resource \nthe people of the north country truly cherish, and long have shared \nwith the rest of the world.\n  Trouble is, it's not an easy task to guide oneself along those paths \nof history. I would like to change that. And if I can, it seems to me \nthat all the people of the corridor, indeed all the people of this \nNation, stand to benefit.\n  One day in the not-too-distant future, I would hope to see the great \nhistoric sites of this corridor linked, made easy to discover and \nexplore. Here and there we ought to have a visitors center to help the \ntraveler, the historian, in their search for the storied places of the \npast. Here and there ought to be a pulloff by the roadside with \nexplanations of the historic significance of the area, a map. Common \nsignage would be a great help.\n  A heritage corridor along these historic waterways would be a \nwonderful gift of our generation to future generations of Americans who \nwould go forth to seek this Nation's fascinating past, indeed this \ncontinent's history. We should go forward in the spirit of those \nfarsighted pioneer preservationists of this corridor, such as \nTiconderoga's Pell family. Long ago they had the foresight to preserve \nand protect Ticonderoga, Mount Independence, Saratoga, Hubbardton, and \ndozens of other historic places.\n  T.S. Eliot said that history ``is a pattern of timeless moments.'' We \nare indeed fortunate that a wealth of such moments were enacted in our \ncorridor, and that many of their settings have survived. They \nconstitute a valued bequest that carries a considerable responsibility. \nThey constitute a heritage that should be shared with all Americans.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, today I introduce this heritage corridor \ninventory bill. I do it in the name of the people of my home country \nwho have long cared deeply about their history. Also, I do it in the \nname of those who wrote the history of the corridor that we seek to \nhonor, preserve and make more accessible. Those names include Ethan \nAllen, Arthur St. Clair, Seth Warner, Robert Rogers, Philip Schuyler, \nGeorge Washington, and a thousand more now forgotten, but never \nunappreciated, men and women who stood firm to make a new Nation called \nAmerica.\n  Those long-ago people, and the people who live along the storied \nwaterways that are true paths of history, deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n\n                                 \n[[Page S 12962]]\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1226. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a \nstudy of battlefields of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, to \nestablish an American Battlefield Protection Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n the revolutionary war and war of 1812 historic preservation study act \n                                of 1995\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to say that there is in this \nland a great wellspring of caring for the places where freedom was won \nand defended. Millions of Americans have, in recent years, become aware \nof the hallowed ground of our Civil War battlefields, have visited \nthem, read of them, many have written of them.\n  The clear and eloquent message I hear is that these treasured places \nshould be saved, intact, for future generations. The preservation \nmessage goes forth from Gettysburg, Antietam, Manassas, Cold Harbor, \nMalvern Hill, Petersburg, Stones River, and dozens more Civil War \nplaces. It is heard from the banks of the Mississippi to the Atlantic \nCoast, from Mobile to the Monocacy.\n  When battlefields become severely threatened, such as has happened at \nBrandy Station and Manassas, there quickly develops a continuity of \nAmericans that spreads nationwide. The American people care about their \nhistory, look on these places as national treasures, and speak \neloquently and effectively for their preservation.\n  Five years ago, Congress responded to the growing awareness of our \nCivil War heritage and the concern for the sites where that heritage \ntook form, by passing legislation that created a national Civil War \nSites Advisory Commission. Composed of distinguished historians, \nsupported by a staff of National Park Service experts, the Commission \nfor 2 years studied the remaining Civil War battlefields. Civil War \nsites were visited, public meetings held, and in the end a report was \nwritten.\n  In that report, Commissioner James McPherson of Princeton University \nnoted that while Americans no longer have the power to consecrate their \nhistoric sites, they clearly have the power to desecrate them. A plan \nof action was presented for protecting what remains of the Civil War \nbattlefields. It is a plan now being discussed in the Halls of \nCongress, a plan that I strongly favor and which I hope will be acted \nupon.\n  Thanks in large part to the work of Ken Burns, before he turned to \nbaseball, this Nation is now highly aware of its Civil War history and \nthe places where that history took place. That war, in Lincoln's words, \nbrought forth a new birth of freedom. It was a freedom won initially, \nof course, four score years earlier on the battlefields of the American \nRevolution.\n  Somewhat sadly, the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 has not had, of \nlate, a bard the equal of Mr. Burns to sing its praises, reawaken the \nawareness of its history. The people nowadays do not go forth in \nanywhere the numbers to the Revolutionary battlefields, as they do to \nour Civil War fields.\n  Nonetheless, the Revolutionary and War of 1812 sites offer \nexperiences full well as intriguing, meaningful, even haunting, as the \nscenes of the Civil War. Many of the key sites of the Revolutionary War \nand War of 1812 still exist, though some are in jeopardy and some are \nmuch in need of enhancement. A half million people do visit the \nSaratoga Battlefield each year--scene of the war's decisive battle. Yet \nthe battlefield of Hubbardton in Vermont, a key prelude to Saratoga, \nand once called by National Park historian Edwin Bearss the best \npreserved of all American battlefields, is visited by only about 2,500 \npeople annually. It just isn't very well known.\n  Fort Ticonderoga, both a French and Indian War and Revolutionary War \nsite, receives more than 100,000 visitors annually. Yet just across \nLake Champlain on the Vermont shore, Mount Independence receives only \nabout 3,000 visitors. And it lacks a museum, even permanent toilet \nfacilities. Yet it has been called the least disturbed major \nRevolutionary War site, a place where as many as 1,000 American \nsoldiers may be buried. In the winter of 1776-77, Mount Independence \nwas garrisoned against a British invasion from Canada. The troops there \nprobably spent a harder winter than Washington's men at Valley Forge. \nEarthworks, a hospital site, blockhouse foundations, the abutments of a \nmilitary bridge, all survive on the Mount. Thousands of artifacts have \nbeen dug and preserved, awaiting a proper facility for display. This is \na major American historic site that needs the caring attention of this \nNation. At the very least it would seem to qualify as a national \ncemetery.\n  It is part of the American freedom story, a story that, sadly, is \nvery hard to follow today. While a great chapter of that story was \nwritten along Lake Champlain, finding the places where the story \nhappened, following the military routes, is a near-impossible job for \nanyone seeking history. That is but one example of why our \nRevolutionary War sites need attention.\n  It is time to take a thorough look at our Revolutionary War places, \nto make a thorough study of what remain, even of what has been lost. \nThis Nation continues to grow, the heaviest concentrations of \npopulation being along the east coast corridor. And this, of course, is \nwhere the old and fragile sites of the Revolution exist.\n  There needs to be done, I believe, a thorough study of Lexington and \nConcord, Cowpens and Brandywide, Yorktown and Saratoga. We need an \nassessment of Mount Independence and Crown Point, Valley Forge, and \nGermantown. We need to know what we have and what needs doing so that \nthose wondrous sites are preserved and made understandable and \naccessible to the American public.\n  The American people are ever more interested in the story of their \nNation's past--want their history protected and interpreted.\n  So I say today that Congress should act now to create a Revolutionary \nWar and War of 1812 Sites Commission. This Commission should go forth \nto the places where independence was won, determine what remains, and \nwhat is needed to make sure our founding heritage is not lost. It is a \ntask that history calls upon us to make, so that our present \ngenerations can pass on to the Americans of the fast approaching new \nmillennium a wondrous gift of history. That gift would be the landscape \nwhere the Nation that our Civil War President called the last best hope \nof mankind was born in fire and blood and bravery, thus establishing \nthe glowing promise of freedom that yet abides across this great land.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN:\n  S. 1227. A bill to extend and revise agricultural price support and \nrelated programs for cotton, peanuts, and oilseeds, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  THE SOUTHERN AGRICULTURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southern \nAgriculture Act of 1995. This legislation will extend and revise \nagricultural loan and related programs for cotton, peanuts, and \noilseeds.\n  Some farm programs, as currently structured, have served rural \nAmerica well, and in the case of southern crops, farm programs have \nserved the rural South extremely well. Therefore, it is my intention to \nintroduce legislation that fine tunes these programs, rather than \nradically restructuring them, as some as proposing.\n  In 1994, the cotton industry experienced a record year. Cotton \nproduction in the United States totaled a record 19.7 million bales. \nProduction in the Southeast totaled 3.7 million bales, an increase of \n89 percent over the previous year. U.S. exports and domestic mill \nconsumption together totaled in excess of 21 million bales in 1994, the \nlargest total offtake on record. During calendar 1994, U.S. cotton \ntextile exports increase 15 percent above 1993 to surpass 1 billion \npounds, a new record.\n  Much of this success is due to the structure of the cotton program. \nThrough the use of the marketing loan, that I put in, in the 1985 farm \nbill, the cotton industry has been able to take advantage of favorable \nworld prices resulting from poor planting decisions and harvest \nconditions experienced by some of our foreign competitors. The \nmarketing loan has been an enormously valuable tool for this industry \nand is responsible for drastically reducing the cost of the cotton \nprogram by allowing producers to effectively market their crop. \n\n[[Page S 12963]]\n\n  The cotton program stands as a shining example of a farm program that \nworks as it should. For instance, there will be no idled acres, or set-\nasides, for this year's crop, further reducing the cost of the program. \nDespite the perception that commodity programs pay farmer not to plant \na portion of their crops, cotton producers only get paid for the cotton \nthat they produce.\n  Due to the success in the manner in which the industry is operating, \nI see no reason to change a policy just for the sake of change. \nTherefore, this legislation proposes to extend the cotton program as \nwritten.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize that while cotton \nhas just had a record year and expectations are high for 1995, cotton \nproducers in Alabama, and throughout the Southeast, are having to deal \nwith a severe drought and have been plagued by an extraordinary \noutbreak of insect and worm infestations.\n  Roughly two-thirds of Alabama's cotton crop has had some degree of \nsignificant yield damage, and nearly one quarter of the State's cotton \ncrop will not be harvested this year. As work progresses on the 1995 \nfarm bill, I will be mindful of this situation as our deliberations \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, there is a crop that is unique to a handful of States \nin the South that has represented more than just an economic endeavor, \nrather it has been responsible for a way of life and the preservation \nof a rural culture. The peanut program which is essential to Alabama, \nhas lately been the target of those who would have us believe that \nending this program or radically altering its structure would be in the \nbest interest of all American consumers.\n  While it is acknowledged that the American farmer receives a higher \namount for his peanuts, it should also be pointed out that the world \nprice against which they are measured represents an entirely different \ngrade and quality of peanuts. Peanuts of foreign origin are not subject \nto similar requirements for minimum wage, environmental protection, \nrestricted chemical use, rigorous post harvest treatment, or \ninspection.\n  Detractors tell us that by radically changing the peanut program that \nconsumers will realize savings at the check-out stand as a result. The \nGAO in 1993 interviewed both small and large manufacturers of peanuts \nproducts and were told that they ``may not pass the savings directly on \nto the final consumer of peanut products, but they could develop some \nnew product lines''. What this peanut product manufacturer, anti-peanut \nmovement sounds like to me is an effort to increase the manufacturer's \nbottom line, at the expense of peanut producers with absolutely no \nguarantee whatsoever that any savings realized by manufacturers will be \npassed along to consumers.\n  Auburn University recently released a study that indicates that the \npeanut industry in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida has an economic impact \nin the tri-State area exceeding $1.3 billion, and employment associated \nwith economic activity related to the peanut\n industry exceeds 16,000 jobs in the three States. This record of \nsuccess has been accomplished through one of the USDA's most cost \neffective commodity programs. The peanut program has a 10-year average \ncost of about $13 million annually.\n\n  The Auburn study goes further to indicate, using the very same \neconomic impact model used by the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission, that changes in the order of those being proposed by the \nantipeanut forces would cost 4,510 jobs in Alabama, Georgia, and \nFlorida and have a negative economic impact exceeding $320 million.\n  However, in an effort to further limit the already minimal cost \nexposure of the program, this legislation will freeze the support price \npaid to producers at the 1995 crop level. Additionally, the Southern \nAgricultural Act of 1995 will eliminate other production control \nprovisions, thereby even further reducing the cost of the program by \nlimiting the amount of peanuts that a producer may carry over to the \nfollowing year's crop.\n  According to the USDA, this peanut proposal will save an estimated \n$173 million over 7 years from the cost of the program. Furthermore, \nother peanut State Senators and I are working on ways to eliminate all \ncost to the Federal Government from the peanut program to achieve a no-\nnet-cost program. The peanut program is vital to Alabama and I strongly \nsupport its continuation.\n  Soybeans are another crop of great importance to Alabama. However, \ndue to the lack of profitability, acres planted to soybeans in Alabama \nhave declined by 90 percent over the last 10 to 15 years.\n  Soybeans and other oilseeds do not receive income support under the \nfarm program. Lacking income protection, soybean producers in Alabama \nand other States are vulnerable to sharp increases in production and \nreductions in prices. This vulnerability has resulted in a lost of over \n10 million acres of soybean production in the United States since 1981, \nwith most of this loss occurring in Southern States. Soybean production \npeaked in Alabama in 1979 with 2.2 million acres planted. Data on the \n1995 crop indicates only 230,000 acres are planted to soybeans in \nAlabama.\n  In an effort to correct his situation, this legislation addresses \nthis issue by increasing marketing loan rates for soybeans to $5.25 per \nbushel from the current level of $4.92 per bushel. While not high \nenough to incur outlays except during years when soybean prices fall \nwell below historical levels, this increased loan rate will provide a \nminimal amount of support for our soybean producers, encouraging \ngreater planting of soybeans in years when prices warrant it.\n  Every year the farming community takes risks that most Americans take \nfor granted each time they go to the grocery store and purchase a \ngallon of milk or loaf of bread or jar of peanut butter. Each time they \nwalk down the grocery aisles, there is that same consistency in quality \nand price that consumers now rarely, if ever, stop to appreciate. \nHowever, it is the farmer who each spring puts his family on the line \nby planting his crops. Every farming family is no more than a natural \ndisaster away from losing his farm and home. Regardless, each year he \nagain takes that risk that provides us all with the highest quality, \nmost abundant, and most affordable food and fiber in world. For that, I \nstrongly believe that we should, at the very least, provide some \nmeasure of a safety net for the unavoidable natural disasters and the \nheavily subsidized competition that our farmers must face from our \nforeign trading partners.\n  I realize that we are faced with budget realities that dictate that \nwe must make some difficult and painful choices. We must keep in mind, \nthough, that Commodity Credit Corporation outlays for farm programs \nhave declined from a high of $26 billion in fiscal year 1986 to less \nthan $9 billion in fiscal year 1995, a 65-percent reduction. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, farm program outlays are projected \nto remain below this level for fiscal year 1996-2002, even if no \nchanges are made in current law for existing farm programs. If all \nother sectors of the Federal Government had experienced the same \nproportion of cuts as agriculture has, the Federal budget would now be \nbalanced. However, the upcoming reconciliation bill appears to be the \nplace for those decisions to be debated.\n  The Southern Agricultural Act of 1995 is a statement of support for \nthe continuation and improvement of the cotton, peanut, and soybean \nfarm programs, programs that have worked well and do not warrant \ndrastic overhaul. This bill is designed to allow these farm programs \ncontinue to build upon their many successes which include benefits to \ntaxpayers, consumers, and producers alike.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Pressler, Mr. \n        Faircloth, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1228. A bill to impose sanctions on foreign persons exporting \npetroleum products, natural gas, or related technology to Iran; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               THE IRAN FOREIGN OIL SANCTIONS ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Inouye, Pressler, Faircloth, and Kohl to introduce \nthe Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995. The purpose of this \nlegislation is simple. It will place sanctions on any foreign company \nthat supplies \n\n[[Page S 12964]]\nIran with equipment to extract petroleum, natural gas, or other \nactivities that would enable Iran to obtain hard currency with which to \nfund the acquisition of a nuclear bomb and to continue its funding of \ninternational terrorism. Any increase in Iranian oil revenues should be \nviewed as a threat to the national security and foreign policy \ninterests of the United States.\n  Several months ago, I commended President Clinton for his wisdom in \nimplementing a total United States trade ban against Iran. I had been \npushing for this ban for 2 years, because I felt that it was wrong for \nus to be subsidizing Iranian terrorism. Thankfully, the United States \nno longer is doing so. I wish, however, I could say the same for the \nrest of the world. While Iran is racing to obtain weapons of mass \ndestruction, most of the other countries of the world are subsidizing \nthem through their development of the Iranian oil fields. What they are \nforgetting is that by providing Iran with hard currency, they are \nproviding Iran with the means with which to fulfill their dreams of \nobtaining nuclear weapons. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n  While I know that this administration has tried to convince our \nallies of their mistake in subsidizing Iranian aggression, I feel that \nthey can do more. I feel that they must have the proper tools with \nwhich to deal with the allies regarding Iran and this bill provides \nthose tools. Our allies must understand that oil is Iran's lifeline. If \nwe are going to persuade the Iranian regime that its efforts to achieve \nnuclear status, its support for international terrorism, and its \nhorrendous human rights abuses against the Iranian people should all \nend, we must end the funding with which they are paying for it all. The \nrest of the world now must stop providing that funding.\n  Our legislation provides a series of mandatory sanctions and \ndiscretionary sanctions that the President may place upon any foreign \ncompany, foreign person, successor entity to that company or person, \nparent, and subsidiary who engages in either trade with Iran in the \nabove-mentioned sectors or has requisite knowledge thereof.\n  Among the mandatory sanctions that the President can place upon the \noffending foreign company are the following:\n  Procurement sanctions which state that the U.S. Government shall not \nprocure, or enter into any contract for the procurement of, any goods \nor services from such sanctioned foreign persons or any parent, \nsubsidiary, affiliate, or successor entity thereof.\n  Export sanctions which state that the U.S. Government shall not issue \nany license or grant any other permission or authority to export any \ngoods or technology to a sanctioned foreign person or company.\n  Inclusion onto the table of denial orders stating that sanctioned \nforeign persons shall be included within the table of denial orders for \ngeneral and validated export licenses for a period of not less than \nthree years.\n  Denial of entry of persons into the United States meaning that senior \nexecutives of sanctioned companies, as well as sanctioned persons are \nineligible to receive visas and shall be excluded from admission into \nthe United States.\n  Additional to the mandatory sanctions, there is a menu of \ndiscretionary sanctions that the President can choose from to impose \nupon the offending foreign company. They include the following choices:\n  Review of certain mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers, stating that \nthe President may exercise his statutory authority to prohibit mergers, \nacquisitions, takeovers, and other similar investments in the United \nStates by sanctioned companies and persons.\n  Import sanctions, stating that the President may ban the importation \ninto the United States of products produced by any sanctioned foreign \nperson, including any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or successor \nentity.\n  Prohibition against export-import bank assistance for exports to \nforeign persons, stating that there shall be no export-import \nguarantees, credit, or insurance for goods or services to sanctioned \ncompanies or persons.\n  Loans from U.S. financial institutions, stating that the U.S. \nGovernment may prohibit U.S. financial institutions from making any \nloan or providing any credit to any sanctioned foreign person or \ncompany.\n  Prohibitions on foreign financial institutions, stating that a \nsanctioned foreign financial institution will lose its designation as a \nprimary dealer in the United States, a sanctioned foreign financial \ninstitution shall not serve as an agent of the U.S. Government or serve \nas a repository of U.S. Government funds and a sanctioned foreign \nfinancial institution shall not engage in any line of business or \nconduct any business from any location that it did not conduct before \nthe determination by the President of becoming a sanctioned company or \nperson.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that we are providing the \nPresident with a wide variety of options to deal with foreign companies \nthat provide Iran with oil fields and affiliated equipment. We have \nprovided ample waiver authority for the President, and in no way mean \nto tie his hands in his conduct of foreign affairs. We are, however, \nputting the countries of the world on notice that Iran is a dangerous \ncountry, with intentions inimical to our own, possessing aspirations \nthat provide a real and sustained threat to the region and the world. \nContinued coddling and trading with Iran will only serve to build up a \nmonster that we will have to deal with at some future time. It is \nbetter to deal with Iran now, in this manner, than a nuclear-armed Iran \nin the more dangerous future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them \n     endanger potentially the national security and foreign policy \n     interests of the United States and those countries with which \n     it shares common strategic and foreign policy objectives.\n       (2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction through existing multilateral and \n     bilateral initiatives requires additional efforts to deny \n     Iran the financial means to sustain its nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, and missile weapons programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United \n     States to deny Iran the ability to fund the development and \n     acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to \n     deliver them by preventing Iran from acquiring equipment that \n     would enhance Iran's ability to extract, refine, process, \n     store, or transport petroleum, petroleum products, or natural \n     gas.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The Secretary may \n     extend the deadline for implementation if the State \n     demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the \n     State cannot implement such system by the date specified in \n     such planning document due to circumstances beyond the \n     State's control.\n       (d) Impact on Medicaid Benefits of Noncompliance With \n     Certain TAP and WAGE Requirements.--If a family becomes \n     ineligible to receive transitional aid under the State \n     transitional aid program because an individual in such family \n     fails to comply with the requirements of this subtitle--\n       (1) a needy child of such family shall remain eligible for \n     medical assistance under the State's plan approved under \n     title XIX of the Social Security Act, and\n       (2) the family shall be appropriately notified of such \n     extension (in the State agency's notice to the family of the \n     termination of its eligibility for such aid) as required by \n     section 1925(a)(2) of the Social Security Act.\n\n     SEC. 1303. PAYMENTS TO STATES.\n\n       (a) Computation of Amounts.--From the sums appropriated \n     therefor, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to each \n     State which has an approved plan for a transitional aid \n     program, for each quarter, beginning with the quarter \n     commencing October 1, 1995, an amount equal to--\n       (1) the Federal medical assistance percentage (as defined \n     in section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act) of the \n     expenditures by the State for benefits and assistance under \n     such plan, and\n       (2) 50 percent of so much of the sums expended during such \n     quarter as are attributable to the planning, design, \n     development, or installation of such statewide mechanized \n     claims processing and information retrieval systems as--\n       (A) meet the conditions of section 1302(a)(10), and\n       (B) the Secretary determines are likely to provide more \n     efficient, economical, and effective administration of the \n     plan and to be compatible with the claims processing and \n     information retrieval systems utilized in the administration \n     of State plans approved under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act, and State programs with respect to which there \n     is Federal financial participation under title XX of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       (b) Method of Computation and Payment.--The method of \n     computing and paying such amounts shall be as follows:\n       (1) Estimates.--The Secretary shall, prior to the beginning \n     of each quarter, estimate the amount to be paid to the State \n     for such quarter under the provisions of subsection (a) of \n     this section, such estimate to be based on--\n       (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of \n     the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance \n     with the provisions of such subsection and stating the amount \n     appropriated or made available by the State and its political \n     subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if \n     such amount is less than the State's proportionate share of \n     the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or \n     sources \n\n[[Page S 12991]]\n     from which the difference is expected to be derived,\n       (B) records showing the number of needy children in the \n     State, and\n       (C) such other information as the Secretary may find \n     necessary.\n       (2) Adjustments for prior quarters.--The Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall then certify to the Secretary \n     of the Treasury the amount so estimated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services--\n       (A) reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by \n     which the Secretary finds that the Secretary's estimate for \n     any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount which \n     should have been paid to the State for such quarter,\n       (B) reduced by a sum equivalent to the pro rata share to \n     which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of the net \n     amount recovered during any prior quarter by the State or any \n     political subdivision thereof with respect to transitional \n     aid to families with needy children furnished under the State \n     plan, and\n       (C) reduced by such amount as is necessary to provide the \n     ``appropriate reimbursement of the Federal Government'' that \n     the State is required to make under section 457 of the Social \n     Security Act out of that portion of child support collections \n     retained by the State pursuant to such section,\n     except that such increases or reductions shall not be made to \n     the extent that such sums have been applied to make the \n     amount certified for any prior quarter greater or less than \n     the amount estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services for such prior quarter.\n       (3) Payment of the amount certified.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall thereupon, through the Fiscal Service of the \n     Department of the Treasury and prior to audit or settlement \n     by the General Accounting Office, pay to the State, at the \n     time or times fixed by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, the amount so certified.\n       (c) Uniform Reporting Requirements.--In order to assist in \n     obtaining the information needed to carry out subsection \n     (b)(1) and otherwise to perform the Secretary's duties under \n     this subtitle, the Secretary shall establish uniform \n     reporting requirements under which each State will be \n     required to furnish data regarding--\n       (1) the monthly number of families assisted under this \n     subtitle;\n       (2) the types of such families;\n       (3) the monthly number of children assisted under this \n     subtitle;\n       (4) the amounts expended to serve such families and \n     children;\n       (5) the length of time for which such families and children \n     are assisted;\n       (6) the number of families and children receiving child \n     care assistance;\n       (7) the number of families receiving transitional medicaid \n     assistance; and\n       (8) in what form the amounts of assistance are being spent \n     (the amount spent on wage subsidies compared to the amount \n     spent on cash benefits).\n       (d) Bonus Amount.--\n       (1) In general.--For fiscal year 1997 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter, a State operating a transitional aid program \n     under subtitle A in the preceding fiscal year meeting the \n     requirements of paragraph (2) shall receive a bonus amount \n     equal to 10 percent of the base payment amount determined for \n     such State under section 1381(b).\n       (2) Requirements.--A transitional aid program meets the \n     requirements of this paragraph if the program--\n       (A) provides for disregards of earned income for families \n     receiving transitional aid to ensure that a family in which a \n     family member worked part-time in a minimum wage job did not \n     have a lower monthly income after calculation of reasonable \n     work-related expenses than a family of the same size in which \n     a family member did not work;\n       (B) provides that calculation of the level of transitional \n     aid under the program for a family is based only on the needs \n     of needy children and the caretaker relatives of such \n     children; and\n       (C) provides for equal treatment of one-parent and two-\n     parent families.\n\n     SEC. 1304. DEVIATION FROM PLAN.\n\n       (a) Stoppage of Payments.--In the case of any State plan \n     for transitional aid to families with needy children which \n     has been approved by the Secretary, if the Secretary, after \n     reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State \n     agency administering or supervising the administration of \n     such plan, finds that in the administration of the plan there \n     is a failure to comply substantially with any provision \n     required by section 1302(a) to be included in the plan, the \n     Secretary shall notify such State agency that further \n     payments will not be made to the State (or in the Secretary's \n     discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under \n     or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure) \n     until the Secretary is satisfied that such prohibited \n     requirement is no longer so imposed, and that there is no \n     longer any such failure to comply. Until the Secretary is so \n     satisfied the Secretary shall make no further payments to \n     such State (or shall limit payments to categories under or \n     parts of the State plan not affected by such failure).\n       (b) Misuse of Funds.--In any case in which the Secretary \n     finds that a State has misappropriated or misused funds \n     appropriated pursuant to section 1303, the Secretary shall \n     reduce the payment to which the State would otherwise be \n     entitled under this subtitle for the fiscal year following \n     the fiscal year in which such finding is made by an amount \n     equal to two times the amount of funds found to be misused or \n     misappropriated.\n\n     SEC. 1305. USE OF PAYMENTS FOR BENEFIT OF CHILDREN.\n\n       Whenever the State agency has reason to believe that any \n     payments of transitional aid to families with needy children \n     made with respect to a child are not being or may not be used \n     in the best interests of the child, the State agency may \n     provide for such counseling and guidance services with \n     respect to the use of such payments and the management of \n     other funds by the relative receiving such payments as it \n     deems advisable in order to assure use of such payments in \n     the best interests of such child, and may provide for \n     advising such relative that continued failure to so use such \n     payments will result in substitution therefor of such \n     protective payments as the State may authorize, or in seeking \n     appointment of a guardian or legal representative as provided \n     in section 1111 of the Social Security Act, or in the \n     imposition of criminal or civil penalties authorized under \n     State law if it is determined by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction that such relative is not using or has not used \n     for the benefit of the child any such payments made for that \n     purpose; and the provision of such services or advice by the \n     State agency (or the taking of the action specified in such \n     advice) shall not serve as a basis for withholding funds from \n     such State under section 1304 and shall not prevent such \n     payments with respect to such child from being considered \n     transitional aid to families with needy children.\n\n     SEC. 1306. SPECIAL RULE.\n\n       Each needy child, and each relative with whom such a child \n     is living (including the spouse of such relative), who \n     becomes ineligible for transitional aid to families with \n     needy children as a result (wholly or partly) of the \n     collection or increased collection of child or spousal \n     support under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act, \n     and who has received such aid in at least 3 of the 6 months \n     immediately preceding the month in which such ineligibility \n     begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of transitional aid \n     to families with needy children for purposes of title XIX of \n     such Act for an additional 4 calendar months beginning with \n     the month in which such ineligibility begins.\n     SEC. 1307. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than July 1, 1996, the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall submit \n     recommendations to Congress to streamline the system for \n     monitoring the accuracy of payments made for transitional aid \n     to families with needy children and for transforming the \n     transitional aid program into a system that measures a \n     State's performance in moving recipients of such aid into \n     permanent employment.\n       (b) Details of Recommendations.--The recommendations \n     required by subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) be based on a system which replaces the AFDC quality \n     control system (described in section 408 of the Social \n     Security Act as in effect on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of the Work and Gainful Employment Act),\n       (2) include an effort to ensure the continuity of recipient \n     data collected under the AFDC quality control system and the \n     new streamlined system, and\n       (3) integrate the performance measurements under the WAGE \n     program and any other applicable performance measurements \n     that are designed to measure the effectiveness of States in \n     promoting work.\n\n     SEC. 1308.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT \n                   INFORMATION SYSTEMS.\n\n       The Secretary shall provide such technical assistance to \n     States as the Secretary determines necessary to assist States \n     to plan, design, develop, or install and provide for the \n     security of, the management information systems referred to \n     in section 1303(a)(2).\n     SEC. 1310.

INCENTIVES AND SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Incentives.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary \n     of Education, acting jointly on the advice of the Federal \n     Partnership, may award incentive grants of not more than \n     $15,000,000 per program year to a State that--\n       (A) reaches or exceeds State benchmarks established under \n     section 731(c), with an emphasis on the benchmarks \n     established under section 731(c)(3), in accordance with \n     section 731(c)(6); or\n       (B) demonstrates to the Federal Partnership that the State \n     has made substantial reductions in the number of adult \n     recipients of assistance, as defined in section 712(b)(1)(A), \n     resulting from increased placement of such adult recipients \n     in unsubsidized employment.\n       (2) Use of funds.--A State that receives such a grant may \n     use the funds made available through the grant to carry out \n     any workforce development activities authorized under this \n     title.\n       (b) Sanctions.--\n       (1) Failure to demonstrate sufficient progress.--If the \n     Federal Partnership determines, after notice and an \n     opportunity for a hearing, that a State has failed to \n     demonstrate sufficient progress toward reaching the State \n     benchmarks established under section 731(c) for the 3 years \n     covered by a State plan described in section 714, the Federal \n     Partnership shall provide advice to the Secretary of Labor \n     and the Secretary of Education.

The Federal \n     Partnership may determine that the failure of the State to \n     demonstrate such progress is attributable to the workforce \n     employment activities, workforce education activities, or \n     flexible workforce activities, of the State and provide \n     advice to the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of \n     Education. The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of \n     Education, acting jointly on the advice of the Federal \n     Partnership, may decide to reduce only the portion of the \n     allotment for such activities.\n       (2) Expenditure contrary to title.--If the Governor of a \n     State determines that a local entity that carries out \n     workforce employment activities in a substate area of the \n     State has expended funds made available under this title in a \n     manner contrary to the purposes of this title, and such \n     expenditures do not constitute fraudulent activity, the \n     Governor may deduct an amount equal to the funds from a \n     subsequent program year allocation to the substate area.\n       (c) Funds Resulting From Reduced Allotments.--The Secretary \n     of Labor and the Secretary of Education, acting jointly on \n     the advice of the Federal Partnership, may use an amount \n     retained as a result of a reduction in an allotment made \n     under subsection (b)(1) to award an incentive grant under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 733.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPETITIVE BIDDING \n                   FOR INFANT FORMULA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the federal Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \n     Infants and Children (WIC) is a proven success story, \n     providing special nutrition and health assistance to at-risk \n     pregnant women, infants and children;\n       (2) WIC has been shown to reduce the incidence of fetal \n     death, low birthweight, infant mortality and anemia, to \n     increase the nutritional and health status of pregnant women, \n     infants and children and to improve the cognitive development \n     of infants and children;\n       (3) research has shown that each dollar spent on WIC for \n     pregnant women results in savings of $1.92 to $4.21 in \n     Medicaid expenditures;\n       (4) because of funding limitations not all individuals \n     eligible for WIC assistance are served by the program;\n       (5) infant formula is a significant item in the cost of WIC \n     monthly food packages, amounting to approximately 26 percent \n     of WIC food costs after subtracting manufacturer's rebates, \n     but approximately 48 percent of food costs prior to applying \n     rebates;\n       (6) rebates obtained through competitive bidding for infant \n     formula have reduced the cost of infant formula for WIC \n     participants by approximately $4.1 billion through the end of \n     fiscal year 1994, allowing millions of additional pregnant \n     women, infants and children to be served by WIC with the \n     limited funds available;\n       (7) the Department of Agriculture has estimated that in \n     fiscal year 1995 rebates obtained through competitive bidding \n     for infant formula will total over $1 billion, which will \n     enable WIC to serve approximately 1.6 million additional \n     women, infants and children; and\n       (8) because of the very substantial cost savings involved, \n     Congress enacted in 1989 legislation requiring that states \n     administering the WIC program conduct competitive bidding for \n     infant formula.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that any legislation enacted by Congress should not eliminate \n     or in any way weaken the present competitive bidding \n     requirements for the purchase of infant formula with respect \n     to any program supported wholly or in part by federal funds.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S12968-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n\n   SubCommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, sometimes the good news that we get comes \nin small pieces that we hope portend better things to come.\n  The recent agreement between Turkey and Armenia for an air corridor \nis a small step toward improved relations between those two countries \nbut, nevertheless, it is a positive development. It would be a mistake \nto exaggerate it, but it would be a mistake to ignore it.\n  I noticed that when Prime Minister Tansu Ciller visited Azerbaijan, \nshe returned to Turkey by way of the corridor over Armenia and was the \nfirst high-ranking Turkish official to use the air corridor. While she \ntraveled, she congratulated Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian on \nthe victory of his party in the July 5th parliamentary elections in \nTurkey.\n  These concessions seems small, indeed, and they are small. But I hope \nthey can result in improvements.\n  I recall, about 2 years ago, flying in a U.S. military plane to \nArmenia. The Turkish Government would not let us fly over Turkey to go \nto Armenia--\n\n[[Page S 13134]]\nstrange conduct on the part of a government that has been helped in a \nsubstantial way over the years by the United States.\n  It was an action taken that was not so much adverse to the United \nStates as adverse to Armenia.\n  In noting this step forward in better relations between Turkey and \nArmenia, it must also be noted with regret that Turkish President \nSuleyman Demirel refuses to use the corridor over Armenia.\n  I hope he can overcome his fears or his hatreds enough to do that one \nof these days.\n  And I hope the use of the air corridor over Armenia by the Turkish \nPrime Minister will be followed with more significant actions by Turkey \nand Armenia.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13133-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO REBEKAH HARLESTON\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise here today to pay tribute \nto Rebekah M. Harleston, a pioneer in the field of documents \nlibrarians. Ms. Harleston died on October 14, 1994, after dedicating \nmore than two decades of her life to public service.

Mr. President, some weeks ago, I gave a lengthier \nthan usual talk on the floor of the Senate about the growing problem of \nlegalized gambling in the United States.\n  This is not a phenomenon only in the United States. The Jerusalem \nPost contained an article about the problem in Israel. The title of \nthis article: ``They play to lose.''\n  The subhead is: ``Compulsive gambling is a disease that gradually \noverwhelms one's life, Ruth Beker writes.''\n  There is an unfavorable reference to the United States.\n  The article quotes a Dr. Yair Caspi as saying: ``Together with an \nincrease in use of alcohol and drugs, gambling is part of a general \naddictive phenomenon growing rapidly in Israel, trying to be little \nAmerica.''\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n               [From the Jerusalem Post, March 25, 1995]\n\n  They Play to Lose--Compulsive Gambling Is a Disease That Gradually \n                Overwhelms One's Life, Ruth Beker Writes\n\n       Gambling is a gate to dangerously false hope.\n       For Michael, 53, a compulsive gambler, it was sweet at the \n     beginning, hell at the end, and many things in between.\n       Michael's sickness--for that's what it is--is rooted in the \n     Holocaust.\n       When he was six months old, he was given to a Gentile \n     family for safekeeping before his parents were sent to Bergen \n     Belsen, where his mother died. ``After the war [my father] \n     found me and took me home. When I was eight he remarried. It \n     was disastrous.\n       ``My father and stepmother always punished me harshly for \n     no reason. Once I spent three months in my room on bread and \n     water. I was never allowed to play outside. My father forced \n     me to wear a skullcap to school. This was very cruel as we \n     lived in a Gentile neighborhood.\n       ``My father and stepmother crushed my spirit and destroyed \n     my willpower. I could not think for myself, make any \n     decisions. My self-confidence was shot. I'm still afraid of \n     my father and he's been dead for years.''\n       Such a background, according to at least one expert in the \n     field, is typical.\n       ``A compulsive gambler is like someone who touches a hot \n     stove, gets burned yet keeps coming back for more,'' explains \n     Don Lavender, clinical coordinator at Arizona's Sierra Tucson \n     Treatment Center for Psychological and Emotional Disorders. \n     He was in Israel recently to give a one-week workshop at the \n     new Herzliya Medical Center for Addictions at Beit Oren.\n       Gambling becomes the lover, the best friend, the only \n     comfort as the sufferer runs from a pain he cannot deal with, \n     Lavender explains.\n       ``I didn't know I was addicted, but I knew something was \n     wrong if I organized my whole day around gambling,'' Michael \n     continues. ``At first gambling was fun, a diversion. Then it \n     became a habit I couldn't live without and finally an escape \n     for all my problems. I spent my business money, my children's \n     money, everyone's money.\n       ``My wife knew nothing about my gambling. I was a great \n     liar and came home with a thousand stories. I was clever at \n     ``combinations,'' the expertise of every gambler. I hid the \n     truth brilliantly from everyone, including myself.\n       ``I was in a trance, in a blackout when I played. Lost to \n     the world. If the man next to me dropped dead I wouldn't look \n     up. I wouldn't go to the bathroom.\n       ``I could feel the adrenalin pumping in me while I was \n     playing. I felt alive.\n       ``You always lose. I didn't care. A compulsive gambler \n     plays; it doesn't matter if he wins or loses. It has nothing \n     to do with money.\n       ``I know I have tons of anger in me and I can't let it go. \n     I'm afraid to show my anger or any other emotion. I'm afraid \n     to be myself.\n       ``Nothing was sacred. I gambled everything away. If I had \n     money to pay the bills, I gambled it away.\n       ``Because gambling isn't physical like drugs or alcohol, it \n     is hard for people to understand what a dangerous addiction \n     it is,'' warns Michael. ``It sneaks up on you.\n       ``Win or lose, I kept playing. I couldn't stop. My business \n     was ruined. I owed money everywhere. I couldn't sleep. \n     Suicide seemed the only way to go. Gambling had gobbled up my \n     life.''\n       At that desperate point, Michael read about Penina Eldar's \n     gambling disorder clinic. The treatment has been successful \n     so far. ``I can't ever gamble again, not even for a penny,'' \n     he insists.\n       Eldar opened the Center for Compulsive Gambling in \n     Jerusalem in 1991, and recently opened a branch in the Center \n     for Alternative Medicine in Tel Aviv.\n       ``The Jewish people are more vulnerable to this disorder \n     than others because of their troubled history,'' Michael \n     says. ``The Holocaust had a lot to do with all this.''\n       Dr. Yair Caspi, a lecturer in addiction at the Hebrew \n     University Law School and the Tel Aviv School of Social Work, \n     defines a compulsive gambler: ``What place has gambling in \n     his life? Does he think about it all the time? Is every \n     vacation planned around it, whether the casino is in Turkey, \n     Egypt or Rio?''\n       ``Gambling gives you the same high you get from drugs. It's \n     easy money. You don't have to work, you just play games,'' \n     said Dr. Val Velkes, co-director with Dr. Pinhas Harris of \n     the Herzliya Medical Center's addiction clinic.\n       ``People here are addicted to Lotto, Hish Gad, Toto, all \n     the state lottery games,'' says Harris. ``Gambling is much \n     more of a problem here than anyone wants to admit.'' He adds \n     that Jews are big gamblers.\n       ``The mania of gambling sweeping Israel is going to cause \n     lots of problems,'' Penina Eldar warns.\n       ``Eldar is former director of the department for the \n     treatment of alcoholics at the Ministry of Labor and Social \n     Affairs, and founded Alcoholics Anonymous 20 years ago.\n       ``Now with credit and access cards you can phone around the \n     world and bet on any sporting event you want, a dangerous and \n     tempting situation for compulsive gamblers and people \n     vulnerable in that direction,'' she warns.\n       Eldar began the gambling program four years ago, but \n     despite extensive media attention and an advertising \n     campaign, ``of the 100 people who came to talk to me, only 50 \n     decided on treatment.''\n       ``That in itself is no part of the problem. ``It is very \n     hard for a compulsive gambler to admit his sickness,'' she \n     says. ``Today we are treating 12 people in intensive \n     treatment and 30 in group therapy. It is a commitment many \n     are not ready to take.''\n       ``Eldar's method of treatment is more attractive than that \n     used in Spain and France, \n\n[[Page S 13135]]\n     where compulsive gamblers are kept in psychiatric wards. Eldar espouses \n     rehabilitation and group and family therapy. The gambler \n     seeking help gets 10 one-on-one sessions, 10 group meetings, \n     two meetings with the family, and, if therapy is going well, \n     monthly group sessions that continue ``for as long as \n     necessary, sometimes forever.''\n       ``Compulsive gambling disorder is a man's disease,'' Eldar \n     explains, ``though it is the wives and mothers who face the \n     dire economic consequences.'' An alcoholic may drink only a \n     bottle a day and still be an alcoholic, but a compulsive \n     gambler spends all the family's money, leaving them \n     physically and emotionally destitute, she says.\n       Playing cards with family or friends is okay, but stay away \n     from gambling clubs, she warns. ``It gets tricky when you \n     start playing two to three times a week. Then it's only a \n     matter of time.'' She says it can take five to seven years \n     for gambling to develop into a compulsion.\n       ``According to my statistics, 67,000 compulsive gamblers \n     need treatment here, and there are between 50,000 and 200,000 \n     gamblers at risk in Israel.''\n       The hundreds of illegal casinos mushrooming all over Israel \n     signify the breakdown of Israeli society, warns Dr. Yair \n     Caspi.\n       ``This wasn't here 20 years ago. Not the growing gambling \n     phenomenon, nor the drugs or alcohol. It isn't that we \n     weren't aware, it just wasn't here.\n       ``Together with an increase in use of alcohol and drugs, \n     gambling is part of a general addictive phenomenon growing \n     rapidly in Israel, trying to be little America.''\n       Caspi holds an opposing view to the widely accepted theory \n     that addiction is caused by individual deficiency.\n       ``Israel has lost its traditional Jewish value system. The \n     '50s immigration from North Africa and Eastern Europe lost a \n     value system from which they never recovered. Then Zionism \n     and socialism and idealism were still strong and gave \n     something back to replace it.''\n       Religion, he says, has ``reneged on its job.''\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13134-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM S. CONN, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to William \nS. Conn Jr., a resident of Louisville, KY, who will soon retire from \ntwo decades of service as president of the Kentucky Hospital \nAssociation.\n  A native of Monticello, Mr. Conn began his career pursuits at Western \nKentucky University where he received a degree in Business and \nAccounting. He then went on to receive his graduate degree in Hospital \nAdministration from the University of Michigan.\n  After serving 7 years with the Kentucky Department of Mental Health, \nhe became president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Association and \nthe Kentucky Hospital Research & Education Foundation in 1975. His \ndedication to professional excellence took him one step further in 1980 \nwhen he became president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Service \nCorp., a wholly-owned, for-profit subsidiary of the Kentucky Hospital \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, William Conn has given faithful service to his country \nand community. From 1954 to 1958 he served in the Medical Service Corps \nof the U.S. Navy. Throughout the years, William has invested both his \ntime and creativity in community service. Mr. Conn is a former member \nof the U.S. Jaycees and is past president of the Fleming County \nJaycees. He is currently a member of the Masonic Lodge and the American \nSociety of Association Executives. He has also served as past president \nof the Kentucky Society of Association Executives.\n  His extensive service to his community and dedication to his field \nhas earned Mr. Conn such admirable awards as the Distinguished Service \nAward from the Kentucky Hospital Association.\n  Administrator, community leader and friend--Mr. Conn's retirement is \nwell deserved. His accomplishments over the past two decades are too \nextensive to capture in these few words. He is a respected and admired \nKentuckian, and I appreciate this opportunity to honor his professional \nand community achievements today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13135-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE 22ND ANNUAL GERMAN HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States' greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ, began \nits 1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. The Heritage Festival program \nsalutes some of the different ethnic communities that contribute so \ngreatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old country \ncustoms and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity to \nexpress pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a part of our \ncollective heritage. Additionally, the Spring Heritage Festivals will \ncontribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden State Arts \nCenter's Cultural Center Fund which presents theater productions free-\nof-charge to New Jersey's school children, seniors and other deserving \nresidents. The Heritage Festival thus not only pays tribute to the \ncultural influences from our past, it also makes a significant \ncontribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Sunday, September 10, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series will \ncelebrate the 22d Annual German Heritage Festival. Chaired by Ted \nHierl, this year's event is a wonderful opportunity for the German-\nAmerican community to share its colorful culture with New Jerseyans and \npeople from surrounding States through folk dancing, singing, food, and \ncraft and cultural displays. Ted Hierl, of the radio stations WTTM/\nTrenton and WJDM/Elizabeth will join Hansel Kronauer and Edith Prock, \ntwo of Germany's most popular entertainers as part of the evening's \nstage entertainment. The day promises to be full of fun, friendship and \nfamily.\n  On behalf of all New Jerseyans of German descent, I offer my \ncongratulations on the 22d anniversary of the German Heritage \nFestival.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13135-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE DETROIT HEBREW FREE LOAN ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise to congratulate \nthe Hebrew Free Loan Association of Detroit on the celebration of 100 \nyears of service to the Jewish community.\n  The Hebrew Free Loan Association of Detroit was founded in 1895 to \nprovide loans to Jewish people in the Detroit metropolitan area. Over \nthe last century, this revered institution has made loans without \ninterest to assist people in small businesses, and other endeavors with \na particular emphasis on aiding people to do productive work.\n  The Hebrew Free Loan Association has also provided aid to waves of \nimmigrants and refugees arriving in the Detroit area. A critical part \nof its mission has been to assist these newcomers in getting their \nstart in America and in bringing their relatives from the old country \nto join them. Many of our families in the Jewish community have \nbenefited from such loans and have gone on to become successful and to \nhelp others. Remarkably, historically, more than 96 percent of the \nloans made have been repaid.\n  Mr. President, this is an organization with old and strong roots in \nJewish tradition, the Detroit community, and in American values. On \nSeptember 10, the Hebrew Free Loan Association of Detroit will \ncelebrate its centennial. I know all of my colleagues in the Senate \njoin me in congratulating its president, Paul Hack, its executive \ndirector Ruth Marcus, its officers and directors, and all of those \nwhose efforts over the years have contributed to this American success \nstory.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13135-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13135-S13136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CORPORATE AIR\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a made in \nMontana business. Corporate Air of Billings, MT is a modern day success \nstory. Founded in 1981 by Mike and Linda Overstreet, Corporate Air has \ngrown to employ over 300 people and serve a national and international \nmarket.\n  Mike has been an ambassador for Montana and America. And Corporate \nAir has created new jobs both here and abroad. Today, they are leaders \nin an overseas market that appears limitless. \n\n[[Page S 13136]]\nThat is what teamwork and Corporate Air is all about.\n  This company was years ahead of the industry in recognizing that \nfreight hauling was a viable growth industry for the future. And they \nwere also far ahead in recognizing and seizing the opportunity for \nexpansion in Asia. Mike Overstreet accompanied me on two trade missions \nto Asia in order to look at exciting business opportunities.\n  That is why I was not surprised when Corporate Air was recently \nrecognized with the Regional Airlines Teamwork Award by the \nProfessional Pilots Association. This award is testament to teamwork \nand a can-do attitude that describes Montanans in general and the \nOverstreets in particular.\n  Corporate Air and Montana understand that teamwork can solve almost \nany problem, no matter how difficult. When founded in 1981, the economy \nin America and Montana was weak. Naysayers discounted the chances of a \nlittle Montana air service that did not carry passengers.\n  Well, they were wrong. Through organization, vision, and hard work, \nthe Overstreets and Corporate Air not only made it but are national and \ninternational leaders.\n  Finally, Corporate Air is as committed to the Billings community as \nto success in business. They organized a successful Big Sky \nInternational Air Show, with an attendance of over 12,000 people, with \nthe proceeds going to local charities.\n  That is just one example of how Corporate Air and the Overstreet \nfamily strive daily to give back to the community that helped them \ngrow. Their children, Luke and Sara, and their three wonderful \ngrandchildren represent generations of hardworking Montanans who will \ncontinue Mike and Linda's work.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, we in Montana are justifiably proud of \nthis important award and Corporate Air's many contributions. The rest \nof America would do well to follow the example set by these innovative \nMontanans.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13135-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     REMARKS OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN AT THE V-J. 50TH ANNIVERSARY \n                         COMMEMORATION SERVICE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to praise our \ncolleague, Senator Howell Heflin. Senator Heflin served in the U.S. \nMarine Corps in World War II. He was wounded twice and decorated with \nthe Silver Star. Senator Heflin is a strong supporter of America's \nmilitary and has worked hard to ensure that the United States maintains \nits position as the leader of the free world.\n  Although his time on active duty is behind him, Senator Heflin \nremains a soldier at heart. On September 2, he attended the V-J 50th \nAnniversary Commemoration Service at Pearl Harbor. I would like to \nshare the remarks he delivered with my colleagues.\n  For all of us in Congress who served in World War II, and for that \nmatter, all World War II veterans, his words remind us of the faith we \nplaced in God and our country. A faith that remains unshakable today.\n  I ask that Senator Heflin's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n             V-J Day 50th Anniversary Commemoration Service\n\n                       (By Senator Howell Heflin)\n\n       I was asked to read from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 5, \n     verses 3-16. I have chosen to depart from the printed program \n     and read from the Bible familiar to all troops and sailors \n     during World War II--The King James Version:\n       Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom \n     of heaven.\n       Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n       Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n       Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after \n     righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n       Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n       Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n       Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the \n     children of God.\n       Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness \n     sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n       Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute \n     you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, \n     for my sake.\n       Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward \n     in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were \n     before you.\n       Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his \n     savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good \n     for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot \n     of men.\n       Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an \n     hill cannot be hid.\n       Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, \n     but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are \n     in the house.\n       Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your \n     good works, and glorify your Father, which is in heaven.\n       I have been asked to say a few words on behalf of the \n     veterans of World War II.\n       In the early days of World War II, American Chaplain \n     William Thomas Cummings was delivering a sermon to troops on \n     Baatan when he uttered the words, ``There are no atheists in \n     foxholes.'' Those words quickly spread throughout the Pacific \n     and shortly thereafter to wherever American troops were \n     deployed. This truism symbolized the reliance of American \n     service personnel on Almighty God as they served under the \n     Stars and Strips.\n       On this 50th anniversary of the official end of World War \n     II, I know that each surviving veteran of World War II gives \n     thanks to our Supreme Deity for His decisive role in \n     protecting us from the chains of totalitarianism, for the \n     preservation of democratic values and for victory over our \n     then-enemies as well as for life itself and many join me in \n     thanking our Father in heaven for His redeeming grace of \n     salvation.\n       At this time, I am reminded of the written words of Francis \n     Scott Key which he penned as he watched the bombardment of \n     Fort McHenry on the night of September 13-14, 1814, contained \n     in the last stanza of the Star Spangled Banner. These words, \n     which I paraphrase slightly, express our hope for our \n     nation's future:\n       Blest with victory and peace, may this heaven-rescued land\n       Praise the power that hath made and preserved us as a \n     nation!\n       Then defend it we must, may our cause always be just,\n       And this be our motto: ``In God is our trust!''\n       And may this star-spangled banner continue to wave, O'er a \n     land of the free, and a home of the brave!\n       On behalf of all veterans of World War II, our prayer is \n     that there will never be World War III.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13136-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13136-S13137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 WORK NOT WELFARE IN THE MORMON CHURCH\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are talking a great deal in the \nSenate these days about welfare reform. Recently, I had a chance to \nread an article by Ralph Hardy, a Mormon leader in the Washington, D.C. \narea, in the magazine American Enterprise published by the American \nEnterprise Institute.\n  It is titled, ``Work not Welfare.''\n  For a long time we have known that Mormons have been exceptional in \nnot having their people on welfare. But this article goes into more \ndetail than I had known.\n  If we try to get welfare reform without providing jobs for people, we \nwill not have welfare reform.\n  It is interesting to note in the article, he says, ``I quickly \nlearned that the physical welfare of my charges was an important \ninfluence on their spiritual welfare.'' That is true in the religious \nsense and also in the non-religious sense.\n  I will have an amendment to try a WPA-type of demonstration in four \ndifferent places in the country.\n  I hope it can pass.\n  The reality is there is simply no great demand for unskilled labor in \nthe United States today, and most of the people on welfare fall in that \ncategory. If we were to do that, not only would we help the people \nmore, as the Latter-Day Saints do, but we would be moving on other \nsocial problems.\n  We spend a great deal of time making speeches about crime and doing \nvery little constructive about it. Show me an area with high \nunemployment, whether it is White, Black, or Hispanic, and I will show \nyou an area of high crime.\n  I ask that the Ralph Hardy piece be printed in the Record and I urge \nmy colleagues to read it.\n  The article follows:\n                 Work Not Welfare in the Mormon Church\n\n                            (By Ralph Hardy)\n\n       In 1996, the 9 million-member Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-Day Saints (popularly known as the Mormons) will \n     commemorate the sixtieth year of its welfare program. It was \n     in 1936, with the Great Depression sapping the strength and \n     spirit of the nation, that our church's visionary president \n     Heber Grant inaugurated the Church Welfare Program as ``a \n     system under which the curse of idleness would be done away \n     with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, \n     industry, thrift, and self-respect be once more established \n     amongst our people. The aim of the \n\n[[Page S 13137]]\n     church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-\n     enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our church \n     membership.''\n       From this beginning, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\n     Day Saints developed a detailed system for social assistance \n     that favors work instead of welfare. It has proven extremely \n     practical and effective in helping vulnerable people. This I \n     know from my own personal experiences.\n       In the late 1940s, when I was about eight years of age, my \n     father roused me out of bed one early Saturday morning and \n     announced that we were going to the stake (roughly analogous \n     to a diocese) welfare farm. This was an exciting prospect; I \n     had never visited a farm and I eagerly anticipated seeing \n     many creatures of my imagination. However, when my father and \n     I arrived at the enterprise on the far west side of Salt Lake \n     City, I was surprised not only by the lack of farm animals \n     but by the large machete I was given. There ended the fun. \n     For the remainder of that Saturday my father and I, along \n     with several other men and their sons, harvested heavy, dirty \n     sugar beets by hand, throwing them into the back of a three-\n     quarter-ton truck. After hefting those beets I never felt the \n     same about sugar again. I did, however, acquire a healthy \n     respect for the life of a farm boy.\n       Later, a few years after my family had moved to Washington, \n     D.C., the assignment came again to work on the stake welfare \n     farm. This time, however, I held no illusions. I braced \n     myself to work in the intent heat and 95 percent humidity \n     that only the Washington area can promise in July. Throughout \n     that day, which still ranks as one of the hardest episodes of \n     labor I can remember, my father and I toiled in the fields \n     digging fence-post holes.\n       It was with a little sadness that I later learned that this \n     stake welfare farm had been sold, with a large dairy farm on \n     Maryland's Eastern Shore acquired in its place. When I \n     returned to Washington after graduate school, I spent many \n     more Saturdays cleaning barns and pouring cement at the dairy \n     farm.\n       When I turned 12, I became a deacon in the church like \n     other boys of my age. One of my first assignments was to \n     visit about eight families in our local congregation on the \n     first Sunday of every month. My purpose in going was to \n     collect from these families a ``fast offering''--a cash \n     contribution from each household equal to the value of two \n     meals skipped by that family on the first Sunday of the \n     month, known as Fast Sunday. I traveled by bicycle, and at \n     the end of the afternoon I would bring all the offerings back \n     to the bishop at the meetinghouse. These contributions \n     created a pool of funds for our bishop to use in providing \n     assistance to needy families in our ward. Although I did not \n     know who these families were, I knew that our wise bishop \n     would put the funds to good use.\n       When I was 34, the leadership of the church asked me to \n     serve as bishop of my ward. One of the key assignments I was \n     given, like all other bishops in the Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-Day Saints, was to assume direct responsibility for \n     the physical welfare of the nearly 600 members of the \n     congregation. I quickly learned that the physical welfare of \n     my charges was an important influence on their spiritual \n     welfare.\n       The good people of my ward were from all walks of life. \n     Some were reasonably affluent, many were not. More than a \n     few, especially young families, struggled. One adult member \n     of my ward was retarded and living alone. Another was \n     severely overweight, without family or transportation, and \n     virtually unemployable. Over the five years of my service I \n     spent an enormous amount of time administering to the many \n     needs of these people.\n       One day, after I had been bishop for only about four \n     months, one of the very faithful men in my ward came to see \n     me. He had been assigned as the ``home teacher'' to several \n     families, and, as such, he visited these families faithfully \n     each month on my behalf. This man said to me, ``Bishop Hardy, \n     I am concerned about one of my families. The husband is out \n     of a job, and his spirit and self-confidence are broken.'' I \n     knew the man's name at once, and was distressed that I had \n     not been perceptive enough to detect that the family was in \n     difficulty.\n       I immediately visited the man and his wife and confirmed \n     that they were without the basic necessities of life. Their \n     pantry was bare. All of their meager income went toward \n     paying rent, now in arrears, and for gasoline so the man \n     could search for work. And that search was not proving \n     successful. That evening, I immediately called the very \n     capable president of our ward's women's auxiliary, known in \n     our church as the Relief Society, and asked her to also visit \n     the home so that this family's immediate needs could be \n     confidentially assessed. By noon the next day this was done. \n     Counseling was begun, and a list of commodities and other \n     necessities that this struggling family would need was \n     compiled. By five o'clock in the evening, the Relief Society \n     president and the wife in the family had driven to our \n     regional bishops' storehouse facility and filled a large \n     order of foodstuffs and other commodities to sustain that \n     family of five for a period of time.\n       A few days later, by prearrangement with the husband, I \n     contacted the man's older brother living in the southwest and \n     inquired about the extended family's ability to be of \n     assistance to their kin. To my joy I received a commitment \n     from them to donate not only cash assistance to their brother \n     but also a good used automobile to replace the family's old \n     car, which was not worth fixing. Then I asked a capable young \n     attorney in my ward to help me prevent the family from being \n     evicted from their rented townhouse; he was able to work out \n     a rent moratorium with the landlord. From the Fast Offering \n     funds donated by members of my congregation I advanced a \n     deposit of one month's rent so that the landlord would feel a \n     sense of commitment. Also from Fast offering funds I made \n     several direct payments to the electric utility and to \n     several physicians, in order to free up the family's meager \n     cash resources for other purposes.\n       As is the practice in our church, I asked the man and his \n     wife if they would perform some church service to partially \n     recompense for the assistance that they received. I asked the \n     man if he would undertake a project to repaint one of the \n     long hallway walls in our ward meetinghouse. This assignment \n     was accepted and the work was performed over the course of \n     several Saturdays.\n       A member of our ward who had been assigned to serve as an \n     employment specialist then began turning over to this man \n     every possible job lead. Before we could succeed at this, \n     however, the man's own extended family found him employment \n     in the Southwest. I still hear from him every Christmas and \n     can report that he has been gainfully employed ever since his \n     crisis, and is a productive member of our church and society.\n       At every turn the LDS church teaches the dignity of work \n     and the importance of personal industry. Work is emphasized \n     as a ruling principle in the lives of all of our believers. I \n     learned this lesson as part of a religious congregation, \n     through personal labor in the church welfare system, and \n     through my participation in our system of financial and \n     service offerings. Work is basic in the doctrine of our \n     church, and the virtues of work--and the cursedness of \n     idleness--are taught to Latter-Day Saints at a young age.\n       More generally, the members of our church are taught to be \n     self-reliant. Coming in part from our pioneer traditions, the \n     importance of self-reliance and personal independence \n     receives great emphasis. Spencer W. Kimball, a recent church \n     president, taught that:\n       The responsibility for each person's social, emotional, \n     spiritual, physical, or economic well-being rests first upon \n     himself, second upon his family, and third upon the church if \n     he is a faithful member thereof. No true Latter-Day Saint, \n     while physically or emotionally able, will voluntarily shift \n     the burden of his own or his family's well-being to someone \n     else.\n       Our emphases on work and self-reliance lead directly to a \n     third requirement in church teaching--that of provident \n     living. This means we must train members, from youth, to live \n     within their means; to avoid unnecessary debt; to adopt on a \n     family basis the principle of the ``storehouse,'' which \n     encourages laying up a year's stock of food, commodities, and \n     financial resources against a time when they may be needed.\n       These work- and independence-based principles inoculate \n     most church members from serious problems of economic \n     security. And where personal welfare problems do crop up, our \n     vast system of temporary church assistance and guidance back \n     toward work is able to ease most situations without any \n     involvement by the government. This is not mere rhetoric. \n     Last year within the United States alone, 35,207 of our \n     unemployed members were placed in gainful employment through \n     the church's employment centers. In addition, over 1,500 so-\n     called ``unemployable'' persons were placed in jobs, with \n     more than 85 percent still working at the same business over \n     one year later.\n       I have seen the LDS church welfare assistance system in \n     action. I learned its principles as a child; I taught them as \n     a full-time missionary for the church as a young man \n     overseas; I have administered the system at the grassroots \n     level as a church bishop. This system works because it is \n     focused on the self-worth of the individual, and because it \n     is administered as a part of religious practice at the local \n     level.\n       Ours is a program built on work, self-help, personal \n     dignity, and redemption. I have seen it succeed. And I know \n     that many of its principles could be applied to the world at \n     large.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13136-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13136-S13137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 WORK NOT WELFARE IN THE MORMON CHURCH\n Mr. SIMON.

No true Latter-Day Saint, \n     while physically or emotionally able, will voluntarily shift \n     the burden of his own or his family's well-being to someone \n     else.\n       Our emphases on work and self-reliance lead directly to a \n     third requirement in church teaching--that of provident \n     living. This means we must train members, from youth, to live \n     within their means; to avoid unnecessary debt; to adopt on a \n     family basis the principle of the ``storehouse,'' which \n     encourages laying up a year's stock of food, commodities, and \n     financial resources against a time when they may be needed.\n       These work- and independence-based principles inoculate \n     most church members from serious problems of economic \n     security. And where personal welfare problems do crop up, our \n     vast system of temporary church assistance and guidance back \n     toward work is able to ease most situations without any \n     involvement by the government. This is not mere rhetoric. \n     Last year within the United States alone, 35,207 of our \n     unemployed members were placed in gainful employment through \n     the church's employment centers. In addition, over 1,500 so-\n     called ``unemployable'' persons were placed in jobs, with \n     more than 85 percent still working at the same business over \n     one year later.\n       I have seen the LDS church welfare assistance system in \n     action. I learned its principles as a child; I taught them as \n     a full-time missionary for the church as a young man \n     overseas; I have administered the system at the grassroots \n     level as a church bishop. This system works because it is \n     focused on the self-worth of the individual, and because it \n     is administered as a part of religious practice at the local \n     level.\n       Ours is a program built on work, self-help, personal \n     dignity, and redemption. I have seen it succeed. And I know \n     that many of its principles could be applied to the world at \n     large.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13136-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13137-S13138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COL. ROBERT F. BEHLER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, each of us has found cause to use the \nservices of congressional liaison offices that have been set up by \nGovernment agencies to assist us in servicing our constituents and \nmanaging the affairs of the Nation. Almost without exception, the men \nand women who staff these offices are individuals who are competent, \npolite, and eager to serve. I rise today to pay tribute to a person who \nhas met and exceeded those characteristics, the Chief of the U.S. Air \nForce Office of Senate Liaison, Col. Robert F. Behler.\n  Known, liked, and respected by Senators and staffers, Colonel Behler \nhas spent the last 2 years representing the Air Force and striving to \nmeet the needs of the Members of this Chamber. \n\n[[Page S 13138]]\n Always maintaining the highest degree of professionalism, Colonel \nBehler ensured that he and those under his direction responded to our \nqueries quickly and completely. As the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I greatly appreciated the commitment that Colonel \nBehler and his staff made to their jobs and I hope that his successor \nwill maintain the same sense of duty and responsibility.\n  Soon Colonel Behler will take command of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing \nat Beale Air Force Base, CA. This will certainly be an important and \nchallenging assignment, but one I am confident he will quickly master \nand at which he will excel. I wish him the best of luck in his new \nassignment and in the remainder of his career.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13137-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 169, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 169) expressing the sense of Senate \n     welcoming his holiness the Dalai Lama on his visit to the \n     United States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am today joined by the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Senator Helms, the equally \ndistinguished ranking minority member Senator Pell, and Senators Mack \nand D'Amato to introduce a resolution welcoming the visit to the United \nStates this week and next of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n  The story of the 14th Dalai Lama is one with which I believe we are \nall familiar. Exiled from his homeland along with over 100,000 of his \nfellow Tibetan citizens, repeatedly frustrated and rebuffed in his \nsincere efforts to resolve their differences with the Chinese \nGovernment, His Holiness has never wavered in his determination to \nbring freedom and the full panoply of human rights to his people. His \ncommitment to nonviolence in pursuit of the goal, even in the face of \nconsistent provocations, has never faltered and earned him the Nobel \nPeace Prize.\n  For 45 years since the forcible invasion and occupation of their \ncountry by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tibetans have been \nsubjected to systematic abuses and human rights violations. Those 45 \nyears have seen the deaths of tens of thousands of Tibetans, the \ndestruction of thousands of their temples and monasteries, the \nimprisonment of their religious and political figures, the forced \nsinocization of their country, and the systematic destruction of \ntraditional Tibetan culture.\n  Despite hollow Chinese declarations to the contrary, the present \nstate of human rights in Tibet is deplorable. The Chinese Government \ncontinues to arrest and imprison Tibetans solely for their religious \nbeliefs or for the peaceful expression of political dissent. Yesterday, \nthe Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs which I chair held a \nhearing on Tibet. Witnesses presented ample evidence of these \ncontinuing abuses; Mr. Gendun Rinchen, a former political prisoner in \nTibet, very recently escaped across the Himalayas into India and flew \nhere this week to provide us with firsthand testimony on the plight of \nthe Tibetan people.\n  Mr. President, the resolution is fairly self-explanatory. It extends \nthe welcome of the Senate to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, urges the \nPresident to meet with His Holiness and to encourage the Chinese \nGovernment to sit down at the negotiating table with the Tibetan \nGovernment-in-exile, and reminds the Tibetan people that as they move \nforward in their struggle the Congress and the American people stand \nwith them.\n  In closing, I note that one of the central tenets of Tibetans' \nBuddhist belief is that life and its sufferings are transitory; this \nhas allowed them to remain remarkably restrained since the invasion. I \nsincerely hope that sometime soon the Chinese Government will see fit \nto sit down with His Holiness and negotiate an end to the present \nunacceptable and untenable situation so that the Tibetan people no \nlonger have to be patient in their suffering.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe considered and agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements related to the \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 169) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas historically Tibet has demonstrated those \n     attributes which under international law constitute \n     statehood: it has had a defined territory and a permanent \n     population; it has been under the control of its own \n     government; and it has engaged in, or had the capacity to \n     engage in, formal relations with other states;\n       Whereas beginning in 1949 Tibet was forcibly and coercively \n     invaded and occupied by the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas under the principles of international law Tibet is \n     an occupied country and its true representatives continue to \n     be His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-\n     exile, which the Congress has recognized on several \n     occasions;\n       Whereas the Tibetan people are historically, territorially, \n     and culturally distinct from the Chinese population in the \n     People's Republic of China and were forcibly incorporated \n     into the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the Tibetan people are entitled to the right of \n     self-determination as recognized in 1961 by the United \n     Nations General Assembly in Resolution No. 1723;\n       Whereas instead of being afforded that right they have been \n     subjected to repressive actions on the part of the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China, which have resulted in the \n     deaths of countless Tibetans, the destruction of over 6,000 \n     temples and monasteries as well as much of Tibet's unique \n     cultural and spiritual patrimony, the fight of the Dalai Lama \n     and over 100,000 Tibetans from their homeland, the \n     established in Tibet by the Chinese of a consistent and well-\n     documented pattern of human rights abuses including numerous \n     violations of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, \n     and the settlement of thousands of Chinese in Tibet in an \n     effort to reduce Tibetans to being a minority in their own \n     land; and\n       Whereas this September His Holiness the Dalai Lama will be \n     making his first extended visit to Washington, DC, since \n     1993; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) warmly welcomes His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the \n     United States;\n       (2) urges the President to meet with His Holiness the Dalai \n     Lama during his visit to discuss substantive issues of \n     interest to our two respective governments, and to continue \n     to encourage the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to meet with the Dala Lama or his representatives to discuss \n     a solution to the present impasse in their relations; and\n       (3) urges His Holiness the Dalia Lama to remind the Tibetan \n     people that, as they move forward in their struggle toward \n     preserving their culture and regaining their freedom, the \n     Congress and the American people stand with them.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/08/senate-section/article/S13138-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 1530\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPETITIVE BIDDING \n                   FOR INFANT FORMULA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the federal Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \n     Infants and Children (WIC) is a proven success story, \n     providing special nutrition and health assistance to at-risk \n     pregnant women, infants and children;\n       (2) WIC has been shown to reduce the incidence of fetal \n     death, low birthweight, infant mortality and anemia, to \n     increase the nutritional and health status of pregnant women, \n     infants and children and to improve the cognitive development \n     of infants and children;\n       (3) research has shown that each dollar spent on WIC for \n     pregnant women results in savings of $1.92 to $4.21 in \n     Medicaid expenditures;\n       (4) because of funding limitations not all individuals \n     eligible for WIC assistance are served by the program;\n       (5) infant formula is a significant item in the cost of WIC \n     monthly food packages, amounting to approximately 26 percent \n     of WIC food costs after subtracting manufacturer's rebates, \n     but approximately 48 percent of food costs prior to applying \n     rebates;\n       (6) rebates obtained through competitive bidding for infant \n     formula have reduced the cost of infant formula for WIC \n     participants by approximately $4.1 billion through the end of \n     fiscal year 1994, allowing millions of additional pregnant \n     women, infants and children to be served by WIC with the \n     limited funds available;\n       (7) the Department of Agriculture has estimated that in \n     fiscal year 1995 rebates obtained through competitive bidding \n     for infant formula will total over $1 billion, which will \n     enable WIC to serve approximately 1.6 million additional \n     women, infants and children; and\n       (8) because of the very substantial cost savings involved, \n     Congress enacted in 1989 legislation requiring that states \n     administering the WIC program conduct competitive bidding for \n     infant formula.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that any legislation enacted by Congress should not eliminate \n     or in any way weaken the present competitive bidding \n     requirements for the purchase of infant formula with respect \n     to any program supported wholly or in part by federal funds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.
