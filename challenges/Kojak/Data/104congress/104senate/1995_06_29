Mr. President, as has been our custom recently, the \nfreshman class would like to take some time this morning to talk about \ntopics that are of primary interest. This morning we want to talk about \nthe budget.\n  This is an exciting day. We will pass the budget balanced for the \nfirst time in 30 years.\n  Mr. President, let me yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding.\n  I think he said it right. This is really a historic day, a day we \nhave been waiting for--many Members--for years, since the 1960's, when \nthis country decided that the Great Society days were coming in and \nGovernment would play an expanded role, and that we would be able to \ntake care of everyone from birth to death.\n  A lot of people realize that this cannot be done. The resources are \nnot there. The money was not there, so we borrowed it.\n  Over the years, we have established huge deficits and huge debts. \nFinally, today, we will be passing a budget resolution that is going to \nput the United States in a position to balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  In other words, we will be in a position where we will have \neliminated our deficit at that time, and then can start paying off this \nhuge, huge, debt that is out there.\n  A lot of things happened in the last few weeks. President Clinton \nsubmitted a budget to this body. It was a pretty big spending budget \nresolution. It went down by a margin of 99 to 0.\n  Then a short while after that, the Republicans came forth with \nessentially what we will be voting on today and passed it. This was a \nresolution that would eliminate our deficit by the year 2002.\n  A week after that, the President came with another resolution that \nwould have had the effect, he said, of eliminating the deficit by the \nyear 2005. Until we started looking at it. The Congressional Budget \nOffice looked at it and said, well, wait, in the next 10 years, you \nwill be increasing the debt by about $200 billion a year. When I \nmultiply that out, that would be a $2 trillion increase in our Nation's \ndebt by the year 2005. That is certainly not bringing the deficit under \ncontrol.\n  I would like to quote the President. During the speech that was made \nto a joint session, the President came out and talked about what he was \ngoing to do with the deficit. He praised the Congressional Budget \nOffice by saying,\n\n       Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point \n     out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more \n     conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right \n     than the previous Presidents have been.\n\n  Yet it was the CBO that came out and said that it was a phony budget \nresolution, that it did not reduce the deficit. It certainly did not \nreduce the deficit.\n  This is an exciting time. We have heard over the last few months of \ndebate that this is not a fiscal issue that we will be dealing with \ntoday. This is a moral issue, in that someone who is born today--like \nyoung Daniel that was born, and his new father, standing proudly behind \nme, the Senator from \n\n[[Page S 9326]]\nPennsylvania--young Daniel, in his lifetime, would have to pay 82 \npercent of his lifetime earnings if we stayed on the track that we are \non today to the Federal Government. This is something we are not going \nto allow to happen.\n  I am very proud, Mr. President, to be here today and be able to say, \nfinally, a historic moment has arrived. We are participating in it. I \nam very proud of the participation of the 11 freshmen, the new Members \nof the U.S. Senate, who participated in putting this together.\n  Today is an exciting day. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me comment just briefly before I yield \nto my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  This is, I think, a day to which we have been looking forward. All 11 \nfreshmen who came to the Senate this year supported the balanced budget \namendment. All 11 freshmen will support this balanced budget \nresolution.\n  I think it is indicative of the fact that we were on the campaign \ntrail, probably more than anyone else, because we were seeking our \nfirst election to the Senate. I think we found among all the issues \nthat the idea of a responsibility in budgeting, the idea of \nresponsibility in spending, was the issue that most people cared about.\n  Through all these years, we have put it on the charge card. The old \ncharge card is maxed out, and most people know that. So we have a \nchance, and we will pass a balanced budget today for the first time in \nmany, many years.\n  Now, I think it is honest and fair to say that passing this budget \nresolution is the easiest part. After this, of course, given these \nparameters, we have to go in and determine where the cuts are \nspecifically. Where the additions will be, specifically. How the money \nis apportioned, and what the priorities are. That, of course, will be \nthe difficult part.\n  The nature of it, obviously, is that each Member in our own program \nsays we want to balance the budget but not on my program. We want to \nbalance the budget, but we ought to take it away somewhere else. \nMembers would be amazed at the number of folks who say, ``We need a \nlittle more money because it will save money in the long run.''\n  Probably true. Nevertheless, next year's budget is what we are \ntalking about when we have to do something with it. It does demonstrate \non the part of this Congress and on the part of the House, and I am \nproud of, some discipline, some concern for the future.\n  We had 50 4-H youngsters from Wyoming in yesterday, talking about \nwhat is going on, about their future. Talked about the fact that if we \ndo not do something by the time the 4-H'ers are at their high-earning \ncapacity in middle-age they will be paying 80 percent of their income \nin taxes.\n  It is not a question of whether we change but how we do it. It is \ndifficult. Everyone said in the balanced budget amendment, I am for a \nbalanced budget amendment--but. But. We have a dozen reasons we cannot \ndo it this way or why we cannot do it in another way.\n We will hear that, of course, all through this debate, ``I want to \nbalance the budget, but we cannot do it on the backs of the farmers, \nbut we cannot do it on the backs of these people.''\n\n  We have to find a way, and we will find a way. I am delighted the \nPresident has finally come around to a balanced budget. Even though he \ndoes it in a different way, the principle is there and, finally, some \ncommitment to balancing the budget.\n  He said in his letter, which I was a little disappointed in where he \nthreatens to veto, ``We share the goal of balancing the Federal \nbudget,'' he says, ``but we must do it in the right way.''\n  The right way is his right way, of course. Each of us has a right \nway. So it will be difficult, and I understand that. I understand it is \na great debate. There are bona fide differences in views, how people \nthink the Government should function. There are those who have a notion \nthat spending more is better; that the Government's job is to collect \nmore taxes and spend it out in the right way. That is a legitimate \npoint of view. I do not happen to share it. I think the real thrust in \nthis country is that the Federal Government is too big and costs too \nmuch; that is the general notion. But the other view--it is shared by a \nnumber of people in this Congress--is a legitimate one.\n  So it is a great debate. And, of course, people sometimes say, ``Why \ncan't you guys get together and pass something?'' There are differences \nof view about it. So it will not be easy, and there will be endless \nposturing going on defending this little group and defending that \ngroup. But through it all, in honesty, there are different sets of \npriorities. People push those priorities in good faith.\n  Let me make just a couple of points that I think are important. One \nis, defense will be one of the areas of great concern. Let me just say \nI do not know the number, I do not know where it ought to be. But \ncertainly defense, among all the other functions of the Federal \nGovernment, is one that is a legitimate one. The Federal Government is \nthe only unit that can carry out defense. This is not a peaceful world. \nHow much you spend, sure, we can debate that. Should we have a strong \ndefense establishment? Of course.\n  The other one, which I think is interesting in terms of principle, is \nMedicare. Medicare part A is financed by withholding in Social \nSecurity. So there is a fund that comes in, spending comes out. That \nfund is going to go broke, according to the trustees, in 7 years. There \nis no question about that. The real issue is, do you take general tax \nrevenues and prop up the fund or do you cause the fund to be self-\nsustaining, as it should be? Even in part B, where a portion of it is \npaid for by the recipient, the question is do you fund those things out \nof general tax revenues with no control over the spending? Or do you \nseek to fix the program as it is by reducing the spending from 10 \npercent a year to 7 percent a year?\n  Mr. President, we have a great opportunity to do some things that \nneed to be done, some things of principle that must be done. We have \nthat exciting opportunity today, and then to move within that budget \nresolution to the appropriations for the remainder of the year.\n  I yield at this time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, for \nyielding, and I thank him for his steadfast effort to come to the floor \non a regular basis and organize the 11 freshman Republican Members of \nthe Senate to come and talk about the important issues facing this \ncountry today. Obviously, the one on all of our minds is the issue of \nthe budget.\n  I think the comments of the Senator from Wyoming were right on point. \nWe have a great opportunity today to make history, and I believe we \nwill do so. It is just the beginning of the process. We have a long way \nto go from passing this budget resolution, which is simply a blueprint. \nThis budget resolution does not get signed by the President. It is a \nworking document, in a sense, for the Congress to follow, laying forth \nthe blueprint as to how we should get to a balanced budget over the \nnext 7 years.\n  Then it is our job, over the next several months, before the end of \nthe fiscal year, by the end of September, to craft a reconciliation \npackage that brings in line the spending with the projections made in \nthe budget resolution. So we have the actual reductions in the programs \nover the next several months--not just the blueprint as to how you get \nto a balanced budget. That is the tough one. That is where we have the \ndisagreement, as the Senator from Wyoming stated, between those of us \nin the Congress and the President, on the ``right way'' to go about \nbalancing the budget.\n  I will say, I am at least heartened by the fact that the President \nnow accepts the premise of a balanced budget. When he submitted this \nbudget--this is the President's fiscal year 1996 budget--when he \nsubmitted this budget back in February, he did not accept the premise \nthat the Congress and the President should work together to balance the \nFederal budget, because this budget, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office and his own budgeteers, had perpetual deficits of over \n$200 billion a year for as far as the eye could see, in fact, \nincreasing 5 or 6 years out. So his first submission did not accept \nthat premise. \n\n[[Page S 9327]]\n\n  He, also, when he submitted this--and this was during the balanced \nbudget debate--suggested that a balanced budget was harmful; a time \ncertain set for a balanced budget was a harmful thing for the economy, \nwas bad for this country, was bad for people. Now he, surprisingly, has \nflip-flopped and suggested that a balanced budget is a good idea for a \ntime certain; that we can do it in 7 years--or he suggests 10 years--\nbut a date certain to arrive at a balanced budget is not a catastrophic \nevent as his advisers and many of the President's close advisers \nsuggested during the last several months.\n  So we have now seen that he first said a balanced budget was not \nnecessary, and now he says it is. He first said we did not need a date \ncertain, now he says we can set one. Then we find out the President \nsays we should not be attacking Medicare. And now, in the most recent \nbudget submission--and by the way, this is it. This is the President's \nnew budget. Just to give a comparison, this is the original President's \nbudget. This is the new President's budget.\n  You might wonder how you condense all of this into this. It is very \nsimple. There is not much here, relative to what is here. There just is \nnot the specificity, if you look at these pages. It is 20-some pages. \nYou have an executive summary in the first four pages or so. Then you \nhave six pages, double sided--I will admit that, it is double sided, \nwhich we save paper on; double sided--of the specifics of the \nPresident's budget. This is it. This is the entire new President's \nbudget.\n  All you have heard about is, ``The President submitted and comes to \nthe table with this great new budget he talked about.'' It is six \ndouble-sided pages. Understand this, this is six double-sided pages to \ndescribe how we are going to spend, over the next 10 years, somewhere \nin the area of $16 trillion; six double-sided pages, $16 trillion. Just \nto put it in perspective a little bit. But this is it.\n  The other part here are charts. We always have to have charts. So we \nhave charts here at the back that show how he is going to get his \nnumbers down.\n  He was very critical of the Republicans in their budget that came out \nof the House and Senate, of cuts in Medicare. He was to draw a line in \nthe sand. Now with this new budget, in fact, the first thing he talks \nabout is reducing the growth in Medicare and contrasts his cuts--which \nhe says are modest, necessary and modest--to ours.\n  His reductions are around the area of $120 billion over 10--7 years. \nOurs are a little more than double that, $270 billion over 7 years. The \ninteresting thing is, Budget Director Alice Rivlin testified before the \nJoint Economic Committee last week, and she went on and just excoriated \nthe Republicans for their horrible reductions in Medicare.\n  I asked her a very simple question. I said, I look at your budget and \nthe budget numbers. I look at the Republican budget numbers on \nMedicare. The Republican's budget asks for more money to be spent on \nMedicare than you do every year. We actually spend more money on \nMedicare every year. She said we spend less. Their cuts are draconian \nand terrible, and ours are not. How does that figure? You say most \npeople say how can you spend more money every year on a program and cut \nless? This is how. Here is the rub. The rub is that the President in \nall of his projections projects a slower rate of growth in all of these \nprograms. So he assumes that Medicare is not going to grow that much \nand then only cuts from a lower rate of growth. So he cuts less but he \nassumes less growth in the first place, which nobody else by the way \nassumes; just him.\n  As a result, we have less cuts but lower numbers which is sort of a \nstrange thing. You can argue both sides as to who is being cruel to \nMedicare. Are you being cruel because you have cut more money, or are \nyou being cruel because you are spending actually less money per year? \nI would think the people in Medicare would be more concerned about how \nmuch money you spend as opposed to what you are required to cut.\n  We are suggesting more spending on Medicare. But at least the \nPresident has suggested that Medicare needs to be fixed and that we \nhave to do something to reduce the rate of growth of spending in \nMedicare. So he has at least come to the table on that issue. Again, \nthat is not where he was a few months ago in railing against the \nRepublicans.\n  Finally, I will be willing to say that the President still has a tax \ncut in his proposal. So he is in agreement with us that we do need some \ntax relief for middle-income families in America. So there are bases \nfor us to be encouraged about some sort of commonalty, even though the \nPresident has come up woefully inadequate and short in his budget, his \nnew budget does not balance even though he says it does. The \nCongressional Budget Office, which is the numbers that we use, the \nminority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, just last week said, \nyou know, the President cannot be fooling around with these funny \nnumbers. He has to use Congressional Budget Office numbers. This is the \nminority leader, the Democratic leader of the Senate, who says the \nPresident has to come with a serious proposal that uses the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers, what his trumped-up, optimistic \nassessment that the world, the United States is going to continue to \ngrow and inflation is going to be down, all these rosy scenarios so we \nget to balance by not having to cut as much. We have to use the \nCongressional Budget Office. The CBO says this budget, this detailed \nsummary here, does not bring us to balance in 10 years like the \nPresident said. It does not bring us to balance. In fact, by the year \n10 of this budget the deficit is over $200 billion. In fact, the \ndeficit stays about $200 billion over the next 10 years.\n  So it does not work. This is not a real budget. You hear so much \nabout the argument saying your way or my way, and my way is the right \nway. His way is no way. No way does this thing get us to a balanced \nbudget. This does not work.\n  So while I sincerely give the President credit for coming to the \ntable and saying we have to address this issue, we agree on a date \ncertain, we agree that we have to balance the budget, we agree we have \nto do something with Medicare, we agree we need to do something with \ntax cuts, you know I appreciate that. It does form a working basis for \nrelationship to try to move forward and not end up at a horrible \nconfrontation come the end of this fiscal year. I think the President \nhas to go back and get real and get real with the numbers, get real \nwith what every business person would use, which is, you know, the most \nlikely or conservative estimates of growth and things like that. The \nPresident has not done that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield in a minute.\n  So I have to continue to count the days before the President has come \nup with a balanced budget proposal. He has still not come to the table \nscoring to the Congressional Budget Office numbers we have to use here \nin this place, and that the President agreed in his first State of the \nUnion Address he would use. He has not come to the table with a \nbalanced budget that is credible. And, as a result, we have to continue \nto do the counting. I think that is unfortunate but I am hopeful that \nthe President will come forward.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I, too, find fault with the President's budget. I have no difficulty \nwith the assertion of the Senator from Pennsylvania that there are some \ndifficulties with the budget, with the numbers in the budget. I am \nwilling to do that.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Pennsylvania is willing to take a look \nat page 3 of the budget resolution that he brings to the floor and says \nis a balanced budget. On page 3 the majority party brings to the floor \na budget document that page 3, paragraph (4), deficits--in the year \n2002, it says the deficit is $108 billion. The speaker before the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I expect \nthe speakers after the Senator from Pennsylvania, will continue to \ninsist that this budget is a balanced budget in the year 2002. If that \nis the case, why on page 3 does it say in the year 2002 there is a \nbudget deficit of $108 billion?\n  Will the Senator from Pennsylvania not agree that is what it says in \nthis document, and that is what we will have in the year 2002, not a \nbalanced budget but in fact a deficit of over $100 billion?\n\n[[Page S 9328]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All I know is the Congressional Budget Office scores \nthis document as a balanced budget. I would defer to the Senator from \nNew Mexico as to the specifics of that particular page. This is the \nfirst time I have seen it. But from all the scoring that we have had, \nthis was scored by the Congressional Budget Office as a balanced budget \naccording to the Senator from New Mexico. So the Senator's question is \nwith him as to what this document says versus what he has represented \nto the Congressional Budget Office has told him. That is all I can \nrespond to.\n  But I will say that, if, in fact, this budget is not balanced, we \nshould go about the process of getting one that does come into balance.\n  So I guess I do not know the answer to the question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, and I appreciate his \nindulgence, he apparently has found what I found on page 3. This is a \ncondition in the original budget as well. I do not think there is a \nconflict with what the Congressional Budget Office says and what this \ndocument says. I think if the Senator, following his presentation, will \ncheck he will discover, as the Senator from New Mexico or Congressional \nBudget Office and with everyone else has, that, in fact, this budget is \nnot balanced by 2002; this budget on page 3 says the deficit at 2002 is \n$108 billion. That is a problem.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All I would say is that is a very good question. I \nwould like to get the answer. I do not have the answer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nwrong about the question of whether this budget will balance. That is \nmy only point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I know where the Senator is coming from.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My only point is, if this is a balanced budget, zero in \nthe year 2002, it does not say zero. It says by the year 2002 there \nwill be a $108 billion deficit. I would say that I do not think there \nis disagreement among us about whether or not we ought to be in \nbalance. There may be a disagreement about the priorities in spending. \nBut there is no disagreement about the need to balance the budget. The \nonly reason I come and raise the point is that this does not balance \nthe budget. It still remains at a $108 billion deficit in the year \n2002, and much more remains to be done.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. I assure the Senator that I will \nbring this matter before the chairman of the Budget Committee for his \nresponse to that. I am sure he has a response to that.\n  What I will say is that we have put forth an honest effort, according \nto all the numbers that I have seen, that this does bring us to a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, and it does so in the way that I think is \nreally the only way possible to do it: By containing the growth of \nGovernment. Under this budget resolution, the Federal Government's \nbudget continues to grow 3 percent a year. Growth is continuing in \nGovernment spending. It does not freeze. The spending goes up 3 percent \na year. It does not go up as fast as it would had we not changed some \nof the things here in the budget.\n  So I am excited about today. I think it is a great opportunity for us \nto do something for--I see some young people up in the audience--to do \nsomething for the next generation of Americans, and provide some rays \nof hope for them, that we are going to get our economic ship right and \ngive them the opportunity for a successful economy so that they can \nseek their dreams and fulfill those dreams in a free and prosperous \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I see the Senator from Tennessee is \nhere to speak on this issue. I would be happy to yield at this point to \nthe Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I make an inquiry, if I may?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Is there a prescribed time this \nmorning for Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The following are the conditions under which \nmorning business was to be conducted: The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas] was recognized for up to 30 minutes. He had yielded time to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and was to yield time to the Senator from \nTennessee. The Senator from Alaska was to be recognized to speak for up \nto 15 minutes, the Senator from North Dakota recognized to speak for up \nto 30 minutes, and the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] \nrecognized to speak for up to 15 minutes. Morning business was to close \nat the hour of 10:30.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and wish the President good day. I \nyield to my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                          A Historic Occasion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my fellow freshman colleagues and I are \nhere to continue the discussion and would like to close the discussion \nwith the importance of balancing the Federal budget and to mark this \nhistoric occasion for final passage of the 1996 budget resolution \nconference report.\n  It was just 18 months ago that I was performing heart and lung \ntransplant surgery in the operating rooms at Vanderbilt University, and \nat that point in time I worked taking out enlarged, worn-out hearts and \nreplacing them with strong, powerful new hearts that were healthy. \nThese operations gave people with heart disease, heart disease which \nhad crippled their lives, new hope, a new opportunity, a new chance, a \nnew beginning.\n  Today, I believe we are doing the same thing for our Government. We \nare reversing the out-of-control spending habits of the past. We are \ninstituting discipline over the spending process. We, indeed, are \nreenergizing a tired, worn-out Congress with a strong, healthy one; and \nafter 40 years, a new heart is beginning to beat. A new spirit of \nfederalism is flowing out of Washington, and this budget sets forth the \nblueprint for returning power to the States and to the American people.\n  The budget resolution conference report eliminates waste. It \nconsolidates duplicative programs and calls for reform of obsolete \nprograms in anticipation of governing in the 21st century. It \nrecognizes the need to phase out programs gradually and responsibly, \nstill mindful of the ever-mounting interest and Federal debt. Franklin \nRoosevelt once said, ``We can afford all that we need, but we cannot \nafford all we want.''\n  Today, the Republicans will complete a dramatic first step towards \nreforming Government so that it provides all that we need and yet does \nnot provide more than the American taxpayer is willing to pay for.\n  Mr. President, despite ever-changing tax rates, the amount of \nrevenues paid to the Federal Government have hovered consistently near \n19 percent of GDP, gross domestic product, for the last 30 years, and \nyet Federal spending has risen from 19 percent of GDP in the early \n1960's to a high of 24.4 percent in 1983, settling at about 22 percent \nof GDP today. It is that 3 percent gap between the amount of Government \nservices the American public would like to have and the amount which \ntaxpayers are willing to pay for that is really at the heart of the \nmatter.\n  Republicans never said it would be easy to close this gap between \nFederal spending and Federal revenues, and there really should be no \nmisconceptions. This budget makes tough choices. But the American \npeople did not send us here last November to shrink from what they knew \nwould be a mammoth task, that of balancing the budget and reexamining \nnearly every aspect of modern American Government.\n  As President Harry Truman has pointed out, no government is perfect. \nAnd yet as he said, ``One of the chief virtues of democracy * * * is \nthat its defects are always visible and under democratic processes can \nbe pointed out and corrected.'' And today, America is correcting one of \nits greatest problems, that is, that of fiscal irresponsibility. And \ntomorrow we will move on to tackle the other problems that plague our \nNation--crime, decay of the inner cities, and breakdown of the American \nfamily. The primary step toward solving all of these problems is to \nrely less on the Federal Government, as we have done in this budget, \nand to empower America's citizens once again.\n  All of the Members of the 104th Congress can be proud that democracy \nhas worked, that we have made great \n\n[[Page S 9329]]\nstrides in addressing the Nation's budget deficit. When our founders \nsacrificed so much that America might be independent and free, we \naccepted a trust to preserve this Nation for future generations.\n  This conference report is a historic first step, and we must continue \nto stand tall through the entire reform process.\n  I will close with a list of 10 points, often attributed to Abraham \nLincoln that I believe we should be mindful of as we consider reform of \nnearly every government program in the coming months:\n  First, you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.\n  Second, you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.\n  Third, you cannot help small men up by tearing big men down.\n  Fourth, you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.\n  Fifth, you cannot lift the wage-earner up by pulling the wage-payer \ndown.\n  Sixth, you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your \nincome.\n  Seventh, you cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class \nhatred.\n  Eighth, you cannot establish sound social security on borrowed money.\n  Ninth, you cannot build character and courage by taking away a man's \ninitiative and independence, and\n  Tenth, you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they \ncould and should do for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my understanding was that morning business \nallocated one-half hour to the Republican side, controlled by Senator \nThomas this morning, and then one-half hour to our side controlled by \nmyself. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order provided to the Chair was that the \nSenator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] was to be recognized to speak for up \nto 30 minutes, the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] recognized to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes, the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] \nrecognized to speak for up to 30 minutes, and the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Was it to have been in that order? My understanding was \nthat----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no specific sequence. That is the way \nin which it was provided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not want to complicate this by any means. I think \nthat there is some legitimate confusion relative to the process here. I \nasked for morning business. I was told that my time, the 15 minutes, \nbegan at 9:30. It is just a little after 9:30. I do not want to belabor \nit. My only effort in coming over was that I have to chair a hearing at \n10 o'clock. So I attempted to try to come over in order to make that. \nWith the indulgence of my colleagues, with no objection, I prefer to \nmake a brief statement and then go and open my hearing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just respond, I arrived at 9 \no'clock and our caucus at the moment, our Democratic caucus, is meeting \non regulatory reform. All of us have problems.\n  My understanding was that we were going to have one-half hour over \nthere and one-half hour over here. If that was not locked in, I guess I \nwould be willing to be flexible on that. But I say that I arrived here \nat 9 o'clock. I know the Senator from New Mexico is missing the same \ncaucus that I am missing, and I very much did want to respond to some \nof the points in the budget.\n  The Senator from Alaska intends to take how long for his \npresentation?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will not take a full 15 minutes, in response in the \nSenator from North Dakota. I encourage the floor managers, or however \nthe process works, if this could be alleviated perhaps. I am not being \ncritical, but I appreciate the concern of my friend. We are both in the \nsame situation. Maybe the best thing to do is for me to start and get \nout of here, and then I can yield to my friend from North Dakota the \nremaining time that I have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not object to that. I hope that we \nwill be able to sequence it in the future, if that side has 30 minutes, \nperhaps, if we have 30 minutes reserved, we would be recognized for the \nnext 30 minutes. If the Senator from New Mexico has no objection, I \nwould be happy to allow the Senator from Alaska to proceed at this \npoint and assume the time following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator from North \nDakota. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from North Dakota. I wish him a good \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9329-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9329-S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to use my time to speak on \nrisk assessment. I had intended to do that at 10:30. However, the \nhearing which I have to chair, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, is a joint hearing with the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on a very important and timely topic, and that is the \nKomi oilspill which has taken place in Russia at this time as I speak. \nThe significance of this spill is unprecedented in relationship to any \nspills that we have ever experienced previously. Approximately 400,000 \nbarrels of oil per day are leaking from various pipelines in Russia.\n That equals twice the Exxon Valdez spill, which, of course, was one \nincident. This volume of 400,000 barrels a day is occurring each and \nevery day. The joint committee that will be meeting today will be \nattempting to focus on this and generate notoriety and, hopefully, a \nplan to assist in cleanup and to ensure that this terrible, terrible \ntragedy does not continue.\n\n  My statement this morning, Mr. President, is to call attention to the \nreality that listening to some people in Congress, listening to some \npeople in the executive branch, you might not think it, but I think \nthose of us who have been listening understand that this town was given \na very simple message last November. And that message is that it is \ntime for the Federal Government to wake up and reform the way it does \nbusiness.\n  It just so happens we now have bipartisan legislation to help point \nus in that direction. That legislation is the Comprehensive Regulatory \nReform Act of 1995. Its purpose is to protect public health and safety \nand to protect the environment while sparing people, you and I and \nthose out there, from the nasty side effects of overregulation. It is a \nstatement in favor of freedom, common sense, and responsible \ngovernment, and one more, and that is accountability.\n  From the air we breathe to the food we eat and the ground we walk on, \nFederal regulations govern almost every phase of our lives. Their \nstated purpose, of course, is to help make people healthier and safer \nby reducing exposure to a variety of risky substances and products and \nby regulating various activities.\n  In many cases, Mr. President, these goals are accomplished. However, \nin others, regulations focus on unsubstantiated or minute risks to \nhealth, safety or the environment, and end up wasting a lot of \ntaxpayers' money and time that could be spent on more pressing \nproblems. Worst of all, unnecessary regulations, duplication, take away \nour freedoms. Our freedoms are lost bit by bit by empowering \nbureaucrats in Washington to tell us what we can and cannot do and \nalmost on a worst-case basis.\n  Last year, Mr. President, Americans spent an estimated $647 billion \non regulations. That is more than every element of the average person's \nbudget except housing. Yes, that is even more --$104 billion more, as a \nmatter of fact--than America spent in paying its tax bill in 1994. But, \nunlike taxes and the other bills we pay, much of the costs of \nregulations are hidden in the price of goods and services, so most \npeople do not know about their true costs to each of us. \n\n[[Page S 9330]]\n\n  Let me make it perfectly clear, Mr. President. We do need regulations \nthat actually do protect health, safety and welfare. No one wants to \nturn back the clock on the progress that we have made in protecting our \nhealth and safety. But there is a movement in grassroots America to \nshrink the size, expense, and scope of the Federal Government and to \nreform the way the Federal Government regulates.\n  We need to respond by making sure that the benefits derived from \nparticular regulations are worth the cost and that we use sound \nscience, not emotion, to address and assess risk to health safety and \nthe environment.\n  We also need to rebuild public confidence in Government's risk \nassessments so people will listen when real threats to health and \nsafety are detected. I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Dole; \nthe ranking member of the committee that I chair, Senator Bennett \nJohnston; and the Energy and National Resources Committee for their \nefforts on this front. I also want to thank my fellow chairmen, \nChairman Hatch and Chairman Roth, who worked with us on the creation of \nthis consensus legislation. My committee and theirs each reported a \nbill addressing regulatory reform.\n  Now, to those who ask, Do we need reform? Well, there is absolutely \nno question. Recognizing that there are many horror stories, let me \njust share one that occurred in my State of Alaska: Anchorage, AK, is \nour largest city. The water comes down from the mountains, flows into \nthe gutters for the most part, has very little contamination in it, \njust what it might pick up on the streets. And the Environmental \nProtection Agency came down with the ruling mandating that before the \nwater moves in the drains and could be dumped into Cook Inlet where we \nhave 30-foot tides a day, that we must remove 30 percent of the organic \nmatter in the water.\n  Well, Mr. President, there was no organic matter there. There was \nabsolutely nothing to remove. As a consequence, the city of Anchorage \nwas in violation of their permit from the Environmental Protection \nAgency and subject to substantial fines. Finally, an enterprising \nentrepreneur suggested that they put some of the fish waste in the \nwater. So 5,000 pounds of fish waste was put into the water system so \nit could be removed so that they could comply.\n  Now, once it became known and the heat began to focus on EPA, they \nwere rather embarrassed and they actually wrote out a press release and \nsaid, well, we did not make them do it; they did it themselves. You can \nimagine the type of an example that sets and the reflection that the \npeople of Anchorage have on the Environmental Protection Agency for \ncoming down in a ruling like that.\n  We had another situation in Fairbanks. We have cold winters. We pick \nup a little snow. The city properly would bar parked buses from the \nroad, and buses get snow on them. They were moved onto the back lot. \nThey were cited for dumping the snow on the adjacent lot. We have a \nhard time understanding that, Mr. President. We have a number of other \npoints I am not going to read. I just want to bring your attention to a \nfew.\n  Now, finally, I think as we look at the principles contained in the \nrisk assessment bill passed by my committee, we recognize that while \nthe risk assessment process is used by many Federal regulatory \nagencies, their application and standards are wildly divergent, and \nthere is no set standard for all uses. In fact, the EPA, OSHA, and FDA \noften differ in their assessment of chemical carcinogens and other \nmatters that are of great interest and concern.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just focus on one more item with \nregard to our legislation because it provides several important \nimprovements to the risk assessment process requiring Federal \nregulators to use the following:\n  Sound science and analysis as the basis for conclusions about risk; \nthe appropriate level of detail for the analysis; the mandate to be \nreasonable in reviewing the data; using assumptions only when actual \ndata is not available; characterize risk in a clear and understandable \nmanner; do not express risk as a single, high-end estimate that uses \nthe worst-case scenario; compare the risk to others people encounter \nevery day to place it in perspective; describe the new or substitute \nrisks that will be created if the risk in question is regulated; use \nindependent and external peer review to evaluate risk assessment \nresults; and provide appropriate opportunities for public \nparticipation.\n  Let me close by reading a passage that I think sums up the efforts of \nall who support this risk assessment regulatory reform. I quote:\n\n       The American people deserve a regulatory system that works \n     for them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects \n     and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-\n     being and improves the performance of the economy without \n     imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; \n     regulatory policies that recognize that the private sector \n     and private markets are the best engine for economic growth; \n     regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, local, \n     and tribal governments; and regulations that are effective, \n     consistent, sensible, and understandable. We do not have such \n     a regulatory system today.\n\n  Now these are the words of President Clinton in his Executive order \non regulatory planning and review.\n  So I say to the Senate, the time has come to stem the sea tide of \nregulation that threatens to engulf us all. We need commonsense health \nand safety regulations based, again, on sound science and not emotion. \nWe do not need and we must take steps to reform the current Federal \nregulatory tyranny.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota and \nwish him a good day.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of the 30 minutes allotted to me in \nmorning business, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding me \ntime. I do believe that it is heartening that we have a consensus for \ndeficit reduction here in the country. I believe the President led the \nway in that effort during the first 2 years of his term, and I commend \nmy Republican colleagues for the commitment they have shown to bringing \nus back to that important goal this year in this Congress.\n  But, Mr. President, I want to express some concerns that arise when I \nlook at the budget resolution that has been brought to the floor by the \nRepublican majority, concerns that we may be losing sight of our real \nobjective in this budget-cutting exercise.\n  It seems to me the sole purpose of deficit reduction is to increase \nour investment in the future. What we are attempting to do is to get \nthe Government to live within its means so as not to leave the bill for \nthis generation's largesse to our children.\n  Mr. President, indiscriminately slashing budgets is no recipe for \ngrowth and is a bad way to organize investments for the future. To \nleverage our investment, I believe that we need to support programs, \nparticularly education programs, technology programs, and export \npromotion programs that contribute to our economy's growth and that \nhelp create high-wage jobs that enhance the standard of living for all \nAmericans.\n  I will speak separately on the importance of maintaining our \ninvestment in education, but let me first discuss the issues of \ntechnology and export promotion.\n  In this analysis of what works and what does not work, what \nGovernment should focus on and what it should not, we need to worry \nabout tomorrow's bottom line just as much as we worry about today's \nbottom line. Growth policies that help keep our economy strong are \nvital in looking at that bottom line for tomorrow.\n  America has much to be proud of in its technology infrastructure, but \nit would be wrong to believe that Government did not help lead in \nbuilding that infrastructure, but it would be wrong to believe that \nGovernment was not an essential partner with the private sector in \nhelping to innovate and to nurture technologies that the corporate \nworld has further developed.\n  The conference report on the budget resolution promises to seriously \ndamage our Nation's future vitality. I have a number of problems with \nthe plan, none greater than handing the bill for this balanced budget \nto those least able to pay and leaving the wealthiest in society in \nbetter shape. But I also know that if our Government fails to remain \nsteadfast in its commitment to a national technology infrastructure and \nto \n\n[[Page S 9331]]\nthe funding of civilian research and development and to programs that \nsupport and help finance export efforts, then our economy will continue \nto erode; and we will forgo the gains and growth from high-technology \ndevelopments and will become a nation built on a lower paying service \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, in this Chamber, we have heard a great deal about \nleaving things to the market; that the private sector and the invisible \nhand will solve our problems most effectively if we essentially shut \ndown many areas of Government. I believe, as do all of us, in a lean \nand a streamlined Government, but I do not believe that the market \nalone can solve all the problems of our citizens. And I do not believe \nthat we should ignore the fact that our Government has a good track \nrecord and has gotten a great deal right in technology support and in \nexport assistance. There is no doubt that we would be eating our own \nseed corn if we were to go forward and dismantle these programs.\n  I recommend to those who frequently call on the ghost of Adam Smith \nand subscribe to a prescription of the invisible hand that Smith \nreferred to in the ``Wealth of Nations,'' that they go back and reread \nsome of that treatise that he wrote.\n  Smith clearly outlined a role for Government, a perspective with \nwhich I agree.\n  He states that first, the state has a ``night-watchman function'' to \nsee to the safety and security of its citizens. He argues that the \nstate must educate its labor force, something that we have not done \nwell in this Nation. He continues that the state must build \ninfrastructure on which commerce depends; that is the Government must \nbuild roads, canals, and bridges. In the modern context, that means \nairports and a national information infrastructure and basic research \nlaboratories and export assistance offices.\n  The Government must pay for itself and must, therefore, tax and \ncharge for its services and the Government must support development of \nthose technologies that are not at first easily commercializable. In \nhis day, an example was shipbuilding, and in our day an example is \nnuclear energy. Adam Smith himself outlines these as indispensable \nfunctions of Government, of minimalist Government, as he saw it and \nleaves the rest to be fixed by the market.\n  Those of us who are tasked with the responsibilities of writing \nbudgets and voting on budgets, as we will today, cannot neglect the \nindispensable roles that Government does have to play. But I believe \nthat the theologies that are driving the Republican budget we are \ndealing with here have neglected many of these roles. And we must \nrevisit this effort knowing that while we must cut our budget deficit, \nwe must also promote high-end economic growth which creates high wage \njobs and a better standard of living for our citizens. And enmeshed as \nwe are in a global economy, we have to export more and erase the \nchronic deficits that represent real job leakage from our economy.\n  As I have previously stated in this Chamber, our Government's program \nin civilian research and development under this budget will be cut by \n30 to 40 percent by the year 2002 and will be pushed to a 40-year low \nas a percentage of the gross domestic product. In contrast, the \nresearch communities in Germany and Japan continue to receive increased \nresources as the growth they have generated for their nations has been \nrecognized and rewarded.\n  Yet in the United States, we are abandoning those who won the cold \nwar, those who put men on the Moon, who initiated genetic research and \nbiotechnology efforts, who created computers and advanced electronics, \nwho have fought disease and revolutionized a myriad of enhancements in \nagriculture. Our national investments in science and technology, that \nhave yielded semiconductors, molecular biology advances, and materials \nscience development, have paid off tremendously for the Nation.\n  In 1969, when the Federal budget was last in balance, Federal \ncivilian research spending was 0.76 percent of gross domestic product. \nOnly the Bush administration stands out among the administrations of \nthe last several decades in trying to correct the downward decline in \ncommitment by this country to technology support. This present \nadministration has maintained the commitment that the Bush \nadministration demonstrated. Today, our support of civilian research \nand development is running at approximately 0.46 percent of gross \ndomestic product, and in the Republican budget plan is estimated to \nfall to 0.27 percent of GDP.\n  The real impact, the impact on our children and on the citizens of \nthis great Nation, is that we will strip them of their opportunities in \nthe future if we go the path that this budget resolution calls for. Are \nwe prepared to do that? Are we prepared to forfeit the important \nleadership role the United States has played in technological \ninnovation and growth? I hope that we give a resounding ``no'' to those \nquestions.\n  I have to say that our ambivalence about these issues has already \nallowed Japan to quickly rise to parity with this Nation in the number \nof patents produced and in the overall excellence of its technological \nand manufacturing infrastructure. It is anachronistic to say that Japan \nsimply licenses American technological wizardry. They have their own \nstable of wizards now, and we must compete. We simply cannot role over \nand allow ourselves to become followers in the field of high technology \nadvancement. That would be an unforgivable legacy to leave to our \nchildren.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nreconsider our Nation's technology support program. I think that most \nwould agree that our Government should not be engaged in picking \nwinners and losers. That is not the issue. What we need to understand \nis that the combination of fierce market forces and the globally \ncompetitive environment we are in rarely support the precompetitive \nstage of product development. Despite the prospect of substantial \nreductions in federally supported civilian research and development, \nthe Wall Street Journal has reported that numerous private commitments \nto research and development are also being cut. In fact, the Wall \nStreet Journal reported that AT, General Electric, IBM, Kodak, \nTexaco, and Xerox have all announced intentions to cut their research \nbudgets.\n  While other nations ensure that they will build and maintain a strong \nfoundation for research support in their private sector, our Nation is \nturning away from this strategy and seems all too ambivalent about \nletting advanced manufacturing move abroad, allowing high-wage jobs to \ndisappear, and allowing the responsibilities and rewards of innovation \nto be taken by our competitors. If we hope to restore the economic \nhealth of our Nation, then we should embrace these proven growth-\nproducing programs which help our industry and help our citizens, \nrather than running from those programs. Adam Smith, if he were here \ntoday, would argue that our precompetitive technology programs are \nindispensable to the national interest.\n  Export assistance programs are also in our national interest. On the \n19th of June, Senator Bond outlined for us the important role that the \nInternational Trade Administration and the Bureau of Export \nAdministration of the Department of Commerce play in our international \ntrade activities and in our economy. I agree with him that these \ngovernmental functions need to be maintained. To the degree that the \nconference report fails to support these activities, we need to go back \nto the drawing board.\n  Let me first point out that our great Nation spends less than 2.8 \ncents supporting each $100 of exports. On one hand, given that export \nrelated jobs tend to earn higher wages and, on the other, that our \nNation is approaching a $200 billion trade deficit this year, our \nsupport for export activities is a worthwhile investment. In fact, our \ninvestment in exports is too paltry as it is.\n  Comparatively, as a recent report from the Economic Strategy \nInstitute reports, the lowest level of export assistance support among \nother developed nations is about 10 times the U.S. level. The recent \ntrade agreement that was just consummated yesterday between ourselves \nand Japan should highlight for the American people and for this body \nthe importance that trade plays in our ability to maintain good-paying \njobs in this country.\n  A gauge often used to assess the jobs impact of exports is that a \nbillion dollars of exports equals about 20,000 jobs \n\n[[Page S 9332]]\nin the American economy. If you run the numbers, it is clear that our \neconomy is losing about 4 million jobs because of trade deficits. \nCutting the budget deficit should help increase the overall health of \nthe economy, should lower interest rates, and should help spur business \nactivity in the Nation. But it is also clear that the export sector \nwill become an even more important driver of our economic growth. Given \nthese trends, it is important that Government address market failures \nin the export sector.\n  Exports are important to this economy. And exports create jobs, good \njobs. Export-related jobs are growing seven to eight times as fast as \nthe growth of total employment. A decade ago, less than 7 million \nAmericans worked in export-related jobs while today the number is close \nto 12 million. In another 5 years, the number will approach 16 million. \nAnd given what we know about the stagnation of wages in this Nation, \nthat despite high corporate profitability today, our workers are not \nbenefiting from increased productivity, it is important to underline \nthe fact that export jobs pay more, in fact, about 15 percent more than \nother manufacturing jobs.\n  Companies that manufacture for export are more productive, and they \nare less likely to be caught in the tailspin of a shrinking \nmanufacturing sector. We ought to consider putting manufacturing jobs \non the endangered species list, Mr. President, if we turn away from our \nefforts to export. To be clear about the financial impact: white-collar \nmanufacturing workers earn an average of $20.50 an hour in wages and \nbenefits, blue collar workers earn $16.69 an hour, and people employed \nin the service sector average just $8.39 an hour. Every time we replace \na manufacturing job with a service job, we are cutting our wages in \nhalf. Mr. President, just going with this trend cannot be in the \nnational interest. We need to support our export base and support our \ntechnology base. Anything else would be irresponsible.\n  Some might ask, why not leave a sector that is growing--and that is \nthe export sector--that seems healthy and headed in the right \ndirection, free from any Government meddling? First of all, this export \nactivity has been achieved through private partnerships with \nGovernment. When the market fails to provide critical export financing, \nthe Ex-Im Bank, a classic example of Government/private sector \npartnerships, absorbs credit risks that private institutions would not \nabsorb. And has the Ex-Im Bank been a deficit creator? No. During the \nlast fiscal year, the Ex-Im Bank took $785 million from the U.S. \nTreasury and provided $15 billion in financing that supported $17 \nbillion in United States exports, with nearly half of this going to the \nfastest-growing big emerging markets such as China, India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil.\n  There are many other examples of how we have helped in promoting \nexports in this economy, Mr. President, through Government/industry \npartnerships. Addressing risks that the private sector would not, the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation, a quasi-Government \ninstitution, has provided the insurance to make global trade and \ninvestment more secure. OPIC, which has not paid out any large claims \nsince the mid-1970's, has actually generated significant returns to the \ntreasury. But even when discussions have been held about privatizing \nthis activity, private providers contend that they will not make \ninsurance commitments that OPIC can. These are examples of the \nGovernment addressing failures of the market; and they happen to be \nexamples where the costs, if any, to the Government, have been turned \ninto strong positive gains.\n  In the international arena, when foreign markets are truly free, then \nthe Department of Commerce and USTR need not negotiate for and protect \nAmerican economic interests, but such free markets exist only in \ntheory. A realistic look at world trade would show the French \nsubsidizing their export financing; Chancellor Kohl offering $2 billion \nin low cost loans to China linked to purchases of German products; and \nTokyo pouring over $2 billion a year for foreign aid into Indonesia to \ngrease the way for its firms.\n  The neoclassical economist would argue, no problem. They would argue \nthat American consumers still win, and these other governments are only \nharming themselves and their people. The problems with that line of \nreasoning are many, but in particular, we are not engaged in a perfect \nworld economy. In Japan, producers' interests are dealt with more \npreferentially than consumers'. And as we know in this Nation, \nconsumers' interests are not generally subordinate to producers. Over \nthe long run, specialization will occur, and production will move to \nareas like Asia where consumer interests have been constrained. To \nprevent further erosion of the American manufacturing and export base, \nwe need to support industry efforts to penetrate otherwise closed \nforeign markets.\n  The Department of Commerce estimates that over $1 trillion of \ninfrastructure projects will come on line in Asia in the next decade. \nVirtually all of these projects will be awarded by governments, and \nvirtually all will be hotly contested by companies supported by their \nhome governments. I believe that we cannot responsibly afford to \nfurther diminish the meager support that we provide our exporters just \nas other competitors are expanding theirs. We need our Government on \nthe front line to make sure that American firms and American workers \nget a good share of these projects.\n  Furthermore, over the last 40 years, the American economy has been \nthe robust growth market on which our firms have focused and which \nfirms around the world have targeted. Our corporations have not \ndeveloped the same skills base and support structures that other \nnations have developed to promote exports. For smaller and mid-size \nfirms, international opportunities are new and important, and America \nhas hardly tapped the tremendous potential of this sector. For these \ncompanies, acting purely on their own, the task of penetrating foreign \nmarkets is expensive and overwhelming.\n  Fifty large firms account for about half of America's exports. We \nneed to do better, and we need to, as a Government, support an \ninfrastructure for export growth. That means that we need to support \nthe efforts of the Foreign Commercial Service, need to broaden our \ncounseling activities, and need to continue to connect our small firms, \nwhich are the backbone of our economy, with resources to achieve \nexport-led growth. This is what Government is supposed to do. And I \nwould propose to you that such a jobs-growth strategy complements our \nbudget reduction goals, the combination of which will maximize our \ninvestment in the future.\n  Let me briefly share with you two brief stories of encounters of \nfirms from the great State of New Mexico with the Department of \nCommerce, that so many here seem bent on dismantling. FMI, an \nAlbuquerque developer of software applications for barcode scanners, \nhad never exported to the Mexican market. With the assistance of the \nSanta Fe office of the International Trade Administration, FMI \nparticipated in RepCom '94, a show organized under the State of New \nYork trade division that enabled the firm to secure important \ndistributors, establish relations with potential client firms, and even \nyielded a significant direct sale. The firm has just secured its first-\never sales in to the Mexican market and expects its position to grow. \nSecond, United States Cotton, a manufacturer of cotton pads and other \ncotton cosmetic products, recently reported the signing of a joint \nventure agreement with a firm in Chile, where it too had never traded \nbefore. Using the Gold Key Service Program of the Department of \nCommerce, U.S. Cotton has been able to generate first-year sales \napproaching $500,000. The firm anticipates that expanded production \ncapabilities in Chile will result in expanded sales and will create \nadditional jobs.\n  Let me also add that the great State of New Mexico, which has led the \nNation in terms of export sector growth over the last 5 years, trades \ntoday nearly as much with Japan as with Mexico. And New Mexico exports \nto the Asian region in total are actually much greater than to Mexico. \nLast year, New Mexico exported approximately $100 million in goods to \nMexico, $80 million to Japan, and $150 million to the Asian region. The \ncombined efforts of the state's trade development offices and the Santa \nFe office of the International Trade Administration in \n\n[[Page S 9333]]\nthe Department of Commerce as well as the resources of the Small \nBusiness Administration have helped New Mexico to participate in the \nglobal economy. We have a long way to go in our great State, but \nsupporting exports, supporting technology development make sense for \nNew Mexico and make sense for America.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we need to heed Adam Smith's word. We \nneed to make sure that Government addresses those tasks that the \nprivate sector cannot or will not address. We need to maintain our \ninvestment in civilian research and development efforts, and we must \ncontinue to build the export platform that has been under construction \nfor some time. To fail to do this would limit our leverage in building \na more prosperous future and securing continued American leadership.\n  I would like to remind my Republican colleagues that their opposition \nto these export programs is an entirely new development. Letters of \nsupport for the Foreign Commercial Service, for expansion of \nInternational Trade Administration domestic service centers, and for \nprevention of reduced staffs for sites have been sent to the Secretary \nof Commerce by Senators Brown, Campbell, Coverdell, D'Amato, Domenici, \nHatch, Hatfield, and numerous others. I realize that we are all facing \na confluence of tough choices in our budget deficit reduction efforts, \nwhat to cut and what not to cut--but I would argue that our colleagues' \nearlier intentions were correct, that supporting our small and mid-\nsized businesses into the international arena was the correct strategy \nto jump start growth, spur jobs, and create a more healthy economy.\n  Claims that these programs significantly impact our budget deficit \nare not supported by the facts. We spend less than a billion a year for \nall export programs in a $1.2 trillion annual budget, but reducing this \namount would harm our business sector, reduce growth, stifle incomes \nand keep us blocked out of important growing economies. We would \neffectively be handing over to other nations important, high-paying \njobs that would otherwise go to American workers.\n  That, Mr. President, is not what we have been elected by the citizens \nof this great Nation to do.\n  Mr. President, let me just urge that in finalizing a budget \nresolution between this Congress and the President, we need to keep our \neye on the ball of those programs that will promote job creation and \npromote more economic growth in the future.\n This budget, as it comes before us today, does not do that. Mr. \nPresident, I hope that can be corrected before final action is taken by \nthis Congress.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack).

Mr. President, today we will consider the conference \nreport on the budget. It is interesting that we saw, today, a big chart \non the floor of the Senate, again, entitled Where is Bill? I indicated \nthe other day that if I were someone inclined to do that sort of thing, \nI would bring a chart that says Where is the Bill?\n  This budget conference report comes to the floor of the Senate, I \nbelieve, nearly 75 days after the law required that it be brought to \nthe floor. But, frankly, I think that is less important than the \nquestion of what is brought to the floor. I do not think there is much \ndifference here on the floor of the Senate with respect to our desire \nto balance the budget. No one who is thinking very clearly in this \nSenate or in this Congress or in the country could believe that we can \nspend money we do not have very long and remain a strong nation.\n  The question is not whether. The question is how do we put our fiscal \nhouse in order and balance the budget?\n  In 1993, I voted for an initiative recommended by President Clinton \nto cut $500 billion from the projected deficits. The $500 billion cut \nin deficits included some very controversial things. It included some \ntax increases that were not popular, some specific spending cuts that \nwere not popular. And I understand why a number of people did not want \nto vote for it. In fact, it passed the Senate by one vote. It passed \nthe House of Representatives by one vote.\n  In the Senate, in fact, we did not even have one Member of the \nminority vote for that resolution--not one. I understand that as well. \nThey felt strongly that it was a resolution that did not have the \ncorrect priorities, so they did not want to support it. Many of us \nvoted for it, even though it was very controversial, in order to reduce \nthe deficit. We felt it was necessary to do so. Now we have folks \nsaying, well, the Democrats do not care about the deficit, and they do \nnot want to do anything. The fact is that we had to produce all the \nvotes in 1993 on the $500 billion deficit reduction package. We did not \nget help from one Republican.\n  But what is past is past. The question is what do we do now for the \nfuture? The majority party brings a budget resolution to the floor of \nthe Senate today. First of all, let me give them credit. I think this \nis the right issue. We need to reduce the deficit. In fact, some were \ncritical of the President this morning, and I share that criticism. I \nhave indicated to the President that the initial budget he sent to this \nCongress had deficits that were too large, and I assume that is why he \nsent us a supplemental budget recently. I share that criticism. I think \nwe have to do this in a manner that is right and real for the American \npeople.\n  A while ago, I asked one of my colleagues on the floor of the Senate \nto look at page three of the budget resolution. The budget resolution, \nwhich is on every Senate desk, which we are going to vote on today, \nsays on page three, line four, Deficits. It says, ``For the purposes of \nthe enforcement of this resolution, the amounts of the deficits are as \nfollows * * *'' And then it indicates that in the year 2002 the deficit \nis $108 billion.\n  I have been watching people break their arms patting themselves on \nthe back this morning, saying that this is a balanced budget. I come \nfrom a town of 300 people where people talk pretty straight about these \nthings. If you look at this and read page three, they would say, wait, \nif you say this is a balanced budget, why in the year you claim there \nis a budget in balance do you have a $108 billion deficit? This is not \na balanced budget.\n  The only way they can claim it is to say: We will reduce this $108 \nbillion to zero by taking the trust funds in the Social Security \naccount for that year, and we will show this as a zero debt. Well, let \nus say a business has lost $100 million. If a business did what this \nbudget does, if you told business people to take the money from their \nemployees' pension accounts and bring it into their books and claim \nthey have lost no money, the folks that did that will be fast on their \nway to jail. This is not an honest way to budget. This budget is not in \nbalance. That is point No. 1.\n  We need to balance the budget. We need to do it without misusing the \nSocial Security trust funds. Those Social Security trust funds coming \nfrom taxes taken from the paychecks of workers, contributions made by \nbusinesses, which go, by law, into a trust fund. They are not to build \nstar wars, or to offset other kinds of spending in the Federal budget, \nbut only for the purposes of funding Social Security. This budget is \nout of balance.\n  The only way they can put it in balance--even though on page three it \nsays it is a $108 billion deficit in the year 2002, the only way they \ncan put it in balance, and the way they come to the floor and claim it \nis in balance is to misuse the Social Security trust funds. That is not \nan honest thing to do; it is not the right thing to do.\n  Second, with respect to priorities. Previous speakers today said the \nfact is that we need to cut spending. I do not disagree with that. I \nsent to the Budget Committee recommendations on over $800 billion of \ndeficit cuts, most of it spending cuts.\n  But this budget comes to the floor with more money for defense. This \nbudget comes to the floor with a special accommodation made so we can \ncontinue to build star wars, SDI, or \n\n[[Page S 9334]]\nballistic missiles defense, BMD. I happen to think that is a priority \nthat is out of whack. There is no disagreement about cutting spending. \nBut at this time and place, we say in a budget we are going to make it \nharder for kids to go to college, but it is time now to build star wars \nwhen the Soviet Union is gone, is that a priority that makes sense, or \nis that going to strengthen or weaken our country? I would switch that \naround and take the billions for star wars and pump it back into \nallowing kids to go to school, allowing kids to get a higher education. \nThat is what strengthens our country. In my judgment, that is the right \npriority.\n  The budget that is brought to the floor of the Senate today says that \nwe need a tax cut. I understand why that is popular. If one were to \ntake a poll and say to people, ``Would you like a tax cut?'' the answer \nwould be, ``Heck, yes, I would like a tax cut.''\n  But the job before us is not first to cut our revenue. The job before \nus is first to get our fiscal house in order and reduce the Federal \nbudget deficit. When that is done, then I think we ought to talk about \ntrying to relieve the tax burden on middle-income families in this \ncountry, but only when we have solved the deficit problem. The fact is \nthat this budget resolution brings with it to the floor of the Senate a \n$108 billion deficit in the year 2002 and brings with it a $250 billion \nor so tax cut, most of which will go to the upper income families in \nthis country.\n  Now, I do not have the specifics of a Senate tax cut, but we know \nthat this budget is closer to the House tax cut, and we do have the \nspecifics of that, as measured by the Congressional Budget Office. It \nshows that the bulk of the tax cut is going to go to upper income \nfamilies. So we are saying that we are going to leave a $108 billion \ndeficit in the year 2002, and we are going to embark on the effort to \nprovide lower taxes for upper income folks. I do not share that \npriority.\n  I understand why calling it a family middle-income tax cut is \npopular. I understand why promising a tax cut is popular. My children \nwould love it if I promised them dessert before dinner. The tax cut is \nenormously popular. But the fact is that we have a responsibility to \ncut the budget deficit and balance the budget. That ought to be the \nhonest responsibility that is brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I fully understand that the easiest possible political course for \nanyone is merely to be critical, and that is not enough for our \ncountry. We have, in this country, it seems to me, far too much \ncriticism and far too little examples of rolling up one's sleeves and \ndoing what is necessary to fix what is wrong in our country.\n  We also have too many people who are part of the blame America first \ncrowd who get up, as I said the other day, get up crabby and are \ndetermined to share that mood with the rest of America.\n  This is a remarkable, very special country, with very special \nstrengths and attributes. We have done a lot of things, a lot of \nwonderful things, which I support.\n  We had someone speaking on the floor today about regulations. Boy, I, \nmore than most, understand what a pain regulations can be, and some of \nthem go way too far. We have folks who work in the permanent \nbureaucracy who say, ``Well, we will impose this regulation despite the \nfact that it may make no common sense at all.'' And it makes people \nangry with Government. I understand that.\n  Let me give another side of the same issue so we do not decide \nimmediately to get rid of all regulations. Twenty years ago we used \ntwice as much energy in America as we do today, yet we have less \npollution in America today. We have cleaner air now than we did 20 \nyears ago, and we use twice as much energy.\n  Why do we have cleaner air in America today? Because of regulations. \nWe said to the captains of some industries, we are sorry, but you \ncannot keep dumping this pollution into our air. It may cost a little \nmore to retrofit your smokestacks, and so on, but that cost is worth it \nbecause America must have an environment in which it is healthy to \nlive.\n  So we have cleaner air today than 20 years ago. That is not by \naccident. That is because some people had the strength to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and the House of Representatives to say there are \nrules. One rule is you cannot dump chemicals into the streams, cannot \nsend pollution up into the air.\n  We want a clean place for our children to live. We have cleaner \nstreams and cleaner water and cleaner lakes in America today than we \ndid 20 years ago. Why is that? We have less acid rain. Why? Because we \ndecided 20 years ago that we would require the right things. We will \nsay that if you do certain things you have to do them right.\n  Not only is production good, creating jobs is important. That is the \ngolden goose, there is no question. But the private sector, in creating \njobs and advancing the standards in this country, also must respect the \nenvironment. We have said that. Those in many cases are regulations \nthat I would not want our country to back away from.\n  So, we must do things, it seems to me, in a whole range of areas, \nwhether it is regulation, or the budget. We must do things that we \nthink represent the economic interests in our country, to advance the \nstandard of living in our country, and advance the interests of all \nAmericans. That includes the economic interest and it includes the \ninterests that we have to live in a country that is not polluted and \nnot despoiled. All of those things come to bear in one document. That \ndocument is the budget.\n  None of us will be around 100 years from now. None of us. Not one in \nthis room will be around 100 years from now to answer for any of this. \nBut anyone, 100 years from now, who is interested in who we were and \nwhat we felt was dear to us and important to the future of our country, \ncan simply search our records or the history of the Senate and take a \nlook at a budget document. They can say, at least with respect to \npublic resources, here is what that group of men and women thought were \nthe priorities for their future. Here is how they decided to spend \ntheir money.\n  This budget document says we are going to spend our money on star \nwars, because star wars must be deployed. And we are going to decide \nthat we do not have as much money to send children to college, so we \nmake it harder for families to send their kids to colleges. That is \nwhat the budget says--a priority I do not share.\n  We could flip that and we could say, well, the Soviet Union is gone, \nwe will not build star wars--it is a gold-plated weapon system we do \nnot need--and we well invest for the future. We will make sure that our \nNation's children can become the best they can be, have the best \neducation that their talents will allow them to have.\n  Well, that would represent the priority, I think, that is important \nfor this country. We can do that all in the context, still, of making \ndecisions that have the right priorities that still lead to a balanced \nbudget.\n  In the aggregate, we only have so much money to spend. The question \nis not whether--it is how we balance the budget. That is the fight \nabout priorities.\n  I always get a kick when we come to these debates in the Senate, we \nhave people, especially people who have been speaking currently in \nrecent months, that say, ``Well, we want to balance the budget, the \nother side does not care. Therefore, we are responsible and the other \nside is not.''\n  I do not share that view of this body. I think we have terrific \npeople all around this body on both sides of the political aisle. I \nthink all Members should share a responsibility and a determination to \ntry to do what we can to bring this budget in balance.\n  There is not any question that we have different priorities about \nwhat we think is important. The political process is the process by \nwhich we make those choices. This is a great process.\n  John F. Kennedy used to kid, he said, ``Every mother kind of hopes \nthat her child might grow up to be President, as long as they do not \nhave to get involved in politics.'' But of course, politics is a system \nby which we make choices in America. It is a great system.\n  In some cases, I am on a side that loses, in some cases I am on a \nside that wins; but my responsibility is always to fight for the things \nI think are important for the future of this country.\n  My kids, and everybody's kids--they are all that we have in this \ncountry, today and tomorrow and in the future. \n\n[[Page S 9335]]\nThe question is, what makes this a better future for America? When I \nlook at what our ancestors left us, it is pretty striking and pretty \nremarkable. And the courage and the strength and the determination with \nwhich they approached life and with which they made decisions were \nreally quite remarkable.\n  We have been a nation of builders and doers. This country has not \ngotten to where it has gotten in the world stage by deciding to sit \nback and do nothing. We have been out rolling up our sleeves and doing \nand creating. We have led the world in dozens of areas, even in \npollution control and civil rights.\n  If we have a problem, we face it. A lot of countries just push it \naside because it is too painful. Part of the genius of this country is \nto face these issues and fight about them, and to make public decisions \nin a consensus in our political system about the issues.\n  That is what this budget debate is. Nobody ought to be concerned \nabout the fact that we are fighting about priorities. That is what this \nis about. That is the political system. It is the genius and the wonder \nof the political system.\n  I hope in the end stage of this process, that good will and \ndetermination expressed by people on all sides of the political aisle, \nand including the President of the United States, will result in \ncompromises that really do balance the budget, No. 1, to put our fiscal \nhouse in order; and, No. 2, do it in a way that advances the interests \nof all the people in this country, so that this country can have a \nbrighter and better future.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Jordanelle State Park, located in \nWasatch County, UT, will soon become Utah's newest and most modern \nrecreational facility. Funded through the Bureau of Reclamation as part \nof the Central Utah Project [CUP], this project represents the \ncumulative efforts of nearly 50 interfacing agencies, scores of special \ninterest groups, and an extensive public input process. The Jordanelle \nState Park will not only contribute to Utah's critically needed water \nreserves, but it will also provide excellent recreational opportunities \nfor residents and visitors.\n  The Jordanelle recreation development deserves recognition for \nachieving its project-specific objectives by maximizing each \nparticipant's resources. With a multimillion dollar project such as the \nJordanelle, a burden rests on the shoulders of responsible agencies to \nmake certain that appropriated funds are conscientiously expended. \nThose associated with the Jordanelle project have set and achieved this \ngoal.\n  The effort to provide recreational use of Jordanelle Reservoir has \nserved as a model of intergovernmental cooperation among the Federal, \nState, and local agencies that have institutional control over the \nproject. This same level of cooperation and trust was generated with \nthe public during numerous informational meetings. An uncommon \ndedication to common goals existed, most notably among the U.S. Bureau \nof Reclamation, the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation, and \ninterested parties from throughout the State of Utah. This mutual \ndedication grew out of an important understanding of one another's \nexpectations and values. All of these factors have brought about a \nrefreshing and healthy partnership that has produced wonderful results.\n  A significant achievement is being reached in the mountains east of \nSalt Lake City today with the dedication of the Jordanelle State Park. \nThe water resources of Utah will be significantly supplemented with the \ncompletion of Jordanelle Reservoir, and millions of recreationists \nacross this country will have the opportunity to utilize and enjoy \nJordanelle State Park for years to come.\n  In my view, this two-fer is an excellent tribute to the \nresourcefulness and stewardship of Utahns. I congratulate everyone on a \nremarkable achievement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9335-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9335-S9336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN E. BURGER\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, America lost one of its great \nconstitutional thinkers and jurists with the death of former Chief \nJustice Warren Earl Burger on Sunday, June 25. He served as Chief \nJustice for 17 years, longer than any other in this century. While he \npointed the Court toward a more centrist course during his tenure, he \nnevertheless presided at a time when the Supreme Court was still seen \nas being at the forefront of social change in this country.\n  As my colleagues know, I have an abiding interest in judicial \nadministration, and I always looked to Justice Burger as a true leader \nin improving the administration of justice. My term as chief justice of \nthe Alabama Supreme Court coincided with his as the U.S. Chief Justice. \nHe was a tremendous help with our efforts to pass the judicial article \nand with the court reform movement in our State. He was keenly \ninterested in judicial education not only for legal professionals, but \nfor people from all walks of life, believing that knowledge of the \nsystem could help individuals improve their lives.\n  Chief Justice Burger advocated the unified court system for States \nand founded the National Center for State Courts. He helped organize \nState and Federal judicial councils to ease the friction that tended to \nresult between State and Federal courts at the time.\n  He developed the Federal Judicial Center, an educational and research \narm for the Federal court system. He persuaded Senior Judge Alfred \nMurrah--for whom the Federal building in Oklahoma City was named--to \nserve as head of the Judicial Center. Judge Murrah's leadership \nresulted in enormous strides for the center. Justice Burger was also a \nstrong supporter of the National College of the Judiciary.\n  We might say that Justice Burger's passion was more the overall \nadministration of the law as opposed to the hard substance of the law. \nHe believed that the process of the law was important to preserving its \nsubstance. He strove to make the courts run better. He pushed Congress \nto create more judgeships and to raise judges' salaries. To help \neliminate congestion and reduce case backlog, he promoted the \nstreamlining of court procedures. He has been called the guiding force \nin helping State courts improve their judicial administration.\n  Born in St. Paul, MN, Warren Burger spent his early life on a farm. \nHe worked his way through the University of Minnesota and the St. Paul \nCollege of Law, now the Mitchell College of Law. After obtaining a law \ndegree in 1931, he practiced law in Minnesota for over 20 years.\n  In 1953, President Eisenhower appointed him as an assistant U.S. \nAttorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Division. Three \nyears later, he was placed on the Court of Appeals for the\n District of Columbia Circuit. In 1969, President Nixon elevated him to \nthe High Court to succeed retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren. The \nSenate overwhelmingly approved Chief Justice Burger on June 9, 1969, \nafter a judiciary committee hearing that reportedly lasted but an hour \nand 40 minutes, something that is hard to imagine happening today.\n\n  As Chief Justice, Warren Burger was tough on criminal defendants, but \nhe was neither a hard-line conservative nor an activist willing to \nreverse rulings of the Warren Court. After he retired in 1986, he spoke \nregularly at judicial conventions. He wrote a recent book, ``It Is So \nOrdered: A Constitution Unfolds,'' in which he narrated in detail 14 \nmajor Supreme Court cases.\n  From 1987 until 1991, the former Chief Justice headed the commission \non the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, a job he pursued with \ngreat passion, energy, and intensity. While he believed the \nConstitution to be a living document, allowing for the evolution of \nnational governmental institutions, he also believed in following the \nletter of \n\n[[Page S 9336]]\nthe law in reaching decisions. He once told an interviewer, ``If you \nfollow your conscience instead of the Constitution, you've got 1,000 \nconstitutions, not one. A judge must decide cases quite often in a way \nthat he doesn't like to decide them at all.''\n  Of course, Chief Justice Burger wasn't ignoring the role of one's \nconscience in interpreting the Constitution, for that is an important \npart of deciding cases.

CARL E. MUNDY, JR., U.S. MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, Gen. Carl \nE. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps since 1991, will \nsoon be retiring.\n  I have had the personal pleasure of knowing General Mundy as a close \nfriend and fellow Marine for several years. He has enjoyed an \noutstanding career and has compiled an impeccable record with the \nMarine Corps.\n  I like to think of General Mundy as a native son of Alabama. He was \nborn in Atlanta, but moved to the State Capital of Montgomery as a \nyoung boy. He graduated from Sidney Lanier High School and went on to \nattend Auburn University. Following his graduation from Auburn, he \nreceived his commission as a second lieutenant and began his \nillustrious military career.\n  As I have said on previous occasions, I know my Senate colleagues \nfrom Georgia disagree with me over the issue of General Mundy's state \nof allegiance. I suppose we can correctly say that he was born in \nGeorgia but that Alabama is proud to consider him an adopted son.\n  General Mundy is a highly decorated officer and a graduate of the \nMarine Corps Command and Staff College and the Naval War College. He is \na recipient of the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, \ntwo Navy commendation medals, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.\n  Carl Mundy rose through the ranks from his early service in the \nSecond Marine Division, aboard the aircraft carrier Tarawa and the \ncruiser Little Rock, to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as \nthe Marine Corp's top soldier. In between, he served numerous tours of \nduty in Vietnam, including stints as operations officer and executive \nofficer of the Third Battalion, 26th Marines, and Third Marine \nDivision. He was also an intelligence officer with the Third Marine \nAmphibious Force Headquarters.\n  Prior to being named as a brigadier general in 1982, General Mundy \nserved as aide de camp to the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps; \nas commanding officer, Second Battalion, Fourth Marines, Third Marine \nDivision; as chief of staff, Sixth Marine Amphibious Brigade; and as \ncommanding officer, Second Marines, Second Marine Division and 36th and \n38th Marine Amphibious Units.\n  He quickly climbed the Marines' career ladder, advancing to major \ngeneral in April 1986 and lieutenant general in March 1988. He was the \ncommanding general of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Marine Force when he \nbecame commandant 4 years ago after the retirement of his also-renowned \npredecessor, Gen. Al Gray.\n  Among the most endearing qualities of General Mundy--one of which \nmost of his colleagues and subordinates are not fully aware--is that of \nhis family life. I know he has a loving wife Linda, a wonderful \ndaughter, Betsy, and that he has had a great influence on his sons, who \nhave followed in his footsteps. Like their father, both Carl III and \nTimothy graduated from Auburn University and now serve as Marine Corps \nofficers. They have both adopted his unyielding dedication to the \nMarines. General Mundy lives and breathes the Marine Corps, both in the \nfield and at home.\n  In living and breathing the Marine Corps for many years, Gen. Carl E. \nMundy, Jr., has served his country with great distinction, pride, and \nhonor. He has been an outstanding commandant who has guided the Marines \nthrough some difficult times. On behalf of the Senate, we thank him and \nwish him a long, happy, and healthy retirement. At the same time, we \nhope that we have not seen the end of his public service. ``Semper \nFidelis.''\n  I have a copy of an article which appeared in the summer 1994 edition \nof Auburn Magazine entitled ``First Among The Few.'' It gives a \ndetailed account of General Mundy's life and career and captures the \nessence of this consummate Marine and military leader. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Auburn Magazine, Summer 1994]\n\n                          First Among the Few\n\n                        (By Mary Ellen Hendrix)\n\n       ``Semper Fidelis.'' Always faithful. He wanted to drop out \n     of high school to go fight in Korea. Why stay in school? \n     After all, he'd known he wanted to be a Marine ever since he \n     was five years old and the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He'd \n     grown up absorbing the aura of a nation which hailed its \n     Marines for bravery in a world blanketed by war. Wake Island, \n     Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima. The names echoed in the movies the \n     youth's father carried his only son to see. John Wayne may \n     have glamorized the boy's dreams on the big screen, but the \n     real stories of real Marines became the genesis of the young \n     patriot's tunnel-visioned goal.\n       By the time Carl E. Mundy, Jr. reached high school, Korea \n     was the war of the day and the would-be Marine determined he \n     would trade his schooling for defending his country. His \n     mother, who was from a family of 13 children, and his father, \n     who was one of seven, determined otherwise. They had not \n     achieved college degrees; they were adamant that their only \n     child continue his schooling. The two generations struck a \n     deal--one year of college, then the younger Mundy could \n     choose his own path.\n       If Mundy couldn't go to Korea, he tried for the next \n     closest thing--military school at The Citadel. Before his \n     senior year in high school, however, his parents had moved \n     from western North Carolina to Montgomery, Alabama.\n       ``The Citadel was enormously expensive,'' Mundy said. \n     ``Auburn was land-grant, in-state, 60 miles up the road; I \n     could work for my meals and be a dorm counselor to cut down \n     on college expenses. So, initially, coming to Auburn was an \n     economic move. But it only takes your first 10 days at Auburn \n     to realize there's nowhere else like it, and that's where you \n     really wanted to be in the first place. I quickly became a \n     very happy rat on the plains of Auburn. After one year of \n     college, the war ended and Auburn was a pretty good place, so \n     I stuck around.''\n       Mundy left Auburn in 1957 with a degree in business \n     administration and an ROTC commission as a second lieutenant. \n     Thirty-seven Marine years later, Mundy has completed his \n     third year as Commandant of the Marine Corps over a total \n     active force of nearly 174,000. A four-year appointment, the \n     command of the service branch carries with it a seat on the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       Mundy's office in the Navy Annex less than a mile down the \n     road from the Pentagon is elegant--stately, as one would \n     expect. The grown-up boy with a dream of being a Marine \n     climbed single-mindedly to the pinnacle of the Corps, and the \n     weighty charge fits him well. Sabers and silver and family \n     portraits mingle with the fine furnishings and flags--and an \n     Auburn football presented to Mundy from Coach Bowden last \n     year.\n       ``I had a lot of fun while I was at Auburn,'' reminisced \n     Mundy with a smile, ``and managed also to graduate. It was a \n     formative time an education in values and an education in \n     friendships, many of which persist today. There was a spirit \n     at Auburn that said much to me about loyalty to an \n     institution, which is very much a part of being a Marine.\n       ``The Southern values I had grown up with, patriotism if \n     you choose to call it that, loyalty to friendships, honesty, \n     all those things were well manifested at Auburn. Those four \n     years helped me form and reinforce my own views of the \n     future.''\n       Mundy's four years on the plains were filled with \n     activities he loved squeezed amongst his classes--the Marine \n     Corps reserve, ROTC, commanding the Auburn Rifles, Chewacla, \n     Phi Kappa Tau (which he called his second fraternity because \n     ROTC was his first), drilling on the parade field. ``I have \n     always been fascinated by and bound toward military life,'' \n     he said. ``That was reflected in my readings, studies, \n     associations, and role models. Vince Dooley was one of those \n     role models and still is a good friend. He was a senior when \n     I was a freshman and, of course, was a campus hero. He went \n     into the Marine Corps for his two years, came back as a \n     lieutenant, and was my reserve platoon commander at Auburn my \n     senior year.''\n       Thus, Mundy crafted a Marine life of his own at Auburn--and \n     away from Auburn during the summers when he attended training \n     sessions. Once he graduated, he said, ``the Marine Corps was \n     nothing but excitement and absolute joy and fulfillment.'' \n     (He also \n\n[[Page S 9337]]\n     married in 1957 the former Linda Sloan of Waynesville, North Carolina, \n     whom he had known since fourth grade.) Talking about his \n     career now, more than 35 years later, Mundy still carries \n     that same purity of admiration for his Marine Corps, even \n     under the potentially disillusioning clouds of post-Cold War \n     military downsizing and D.C. politics.\n       This consummate Marine, naturally a team player, downplays \n     his individual accomplishments. But even a glance at his \n     resume impresses. After early assignments with the 2nd Marine \n     Division, he pulled duty abroad the aircraft carrier Tarawa \n     and the cruiser Little Rock, then served as an instructor at \n     Marine Basic School and as Officer Selection Officer.\n       Vietnam was ``his'' war, and he served there 1966-67 as \n     operations officer and executive officer of the 3rd \n     Battalion, 26th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, and as an \n     intelligence officer in the Headquarters, III Marine \n     Amphibious Force. in the mid-seventies he was among the \n     troops evacuating Saigon. Most of Mundy's decorations \n     resulted from his time in Vietnam--two of them, a Bronze Star \n     and Purple Heart, from an engagement at Conthien. He was \n     wounded in the leg when a mortar shell hit his base near Khe \n     Sanh; after an aid-station patch-up and a little limping, he \n     was on his way.\n       ``I was a battalion operations officer in those days,'' he \n     said. ``I remember some nights nearly being overrun up around \n     Conthien. There were a few tight moments there, but that \n     comes to all of us who experience combat. Wehn someone is \n     shooting at you, or incoming artillery rounds are hitting \n     around you * * * there are many, many brave men who performed \n     very well who still wished their mama was right there with \n     them from time to time.\n       ``Combat has been characterized as days and hours of sheer \n     boredom broken by moments of sheer terror. And that's \n     probably right. Vietnam was an infantry war, a jungle war, at \n     close range. You usually saw the people you were shooting at, \n     and they saw you, and sometimes you would physically engage \n     them.\n       ``Close combat is an adrenaline endeavor. It's win or lose, \n     kill or be killed.''\n       Mundy doesn't shy away from the grim realities. ``We train \n     people how to kill because that is our business. As \n     unappealing as that may be to those who say it's revolting to \n     think of killing another human being--and, indeed, it is--\n     that is why you have us. We train people, if you will, in the \n     art of killing. That means we train gun crews, machine \n     gunners, riflemen; we train you how to fight with a bayonet, \n     in hand-to-hand combat, all those things. But there is no way \n     of conditioning somebody to kill somebody else. At that \n     point, it becomes an instinctive, kill-or-be-killed \n     situation.\n       After Vietnam, Munday's climb through the ranks paralleled \n     his breadth of assignments, including: Commanding Officer, \n     2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division; Chief of \n     Staff, Sixth Marine Amphibious Brigade; and Commanding \n     Officer, 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, and 36th and 38th \n     Marine Amphibious Units.\n       After promotion to brigadier general in 1982, he served as \n     personnel procurement director; Commanding General, Landing \n     Force Training Command, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; and as \n     Commanding General, 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade. After \n     promotion to major general in 1986, he was Director of \n     Operations at Marine Headquarters before being named \n     lieutenant general in 1988.\n       Following were assignments as Deputy Chief of Staff for \n     Plans, Policies and Operations at Headquarters and Operations \n     Deputy to the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Commanding General of \n     the Fleet Marine Force Atlantic, the II Marine Expeditionary \n     Force, the Allied Command Atlantic Marine Striking Force, and \n     designation to command Fleet Marine Forces which might be \n     employed in Europe; and promotions to general and present \n     duties in 1991.\n       By the time of Desert Storm, Mundy was providing forces \n     instead of fighting with them. Among the troops sent to the \n     desert was one of Mundy's three children, Tim, ``to the \n     chagrin of the older brother and the father who sat back and \n     watched the baby of the family go off to war.''\n       Mundy's other children are Betsy and Carl, III (Sam). Sam \n     and Tim are both captains in the Marine Corps, with Sam \n     selected for promotion to major in the next year. Also like \n     their father, they're both Auburn graduates; Sam is the Class \n     of 1983 and Tim 1987.\n       One of the wars Mundy fights these days is a war of \n     numbers. ``I think the biggest challenge I have or will face \n     is being able to maintain a viable Marine Corps in the face \n     of the drawdowns that we have experienced in the U.S. \n     forces,'' the Commandant said. ``The amount the American \n     taxpayer is spending on defense right now is the lowest it \n     has been in 45 years; percentage-wise, defense expenditures \n     are pre-World War II.''\n       Mundy arrived to the Commandancy on the heels of the \n     Pentagon's Base Force proposal, which he called ``a rather \n     unanalytical decision to take about 25 percent off the top of \n     all the services.'' He immediately went about proving the \n     analysts wrong, overseeing a bottom-up review of his sacred \n     Corps which asked the key question, ``What do we have to do?\n       They had to do a lot as it turned out. They had to train, \n     they had to guard the 140 embassies and consulates around the \n     world, etc. ``We built ourselves from the bottom up,'' said \n     Mundy. ``Then I went to see General Powell, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and took it to the Congress and said, `You're \n     cutting the Marine Corps too dramatically.' That worked.''\n       Mundy's review concluded that the Corps needed about \n     177,000 Marines to continue its duties. They now stand at \n     approximately 174,000, a cut of about 22,000 since Mundy took \n     over in 1991. While that number is much better than the \n     original target of 159,000, he still feels the strain on his \n     budget and his people. ``Out of every dollar, 77 cents is \n     spent to pay or take care of people. When you're trying to \n     operate on 23 cents out of every dollar, it's very difficult \n     to maintain equipment, training, and facilities and to take \n     care of Marines and their families to the degree that you'd \n     want.''\n       The full seriousness of Mundy's statement comes through \n     especially in light of events in recent years. Last year \n     Mundy ordered a flight suspension for 48 hours to review \n     safety and training procedures after a series of fatal \n     mishaps with six Marine helicopters and a fighter jet that \n     resulted in the deaths of 12 servicemen.\n       In addition to taking care of equipment and training, Mundy \n     has attempted to deal with supporting Marine families--which \n     was his intent with last year's media-labeled ``singles \n     only'' order. The directive's focus, he said, was to counsel \n     new recruits on the stress of deployment, which averages 12 \n     months of the first four years of active duty, and to help \n     the young Marines assess their readiness for marriage. The \n     order, which was reversed, initially would have capped \n     married incoming Marine recruits to about five percent.\n       But the Commandancy is no stranger to politics, and Mundy \n     recognizes and deals with that part of his job. Even the \n     political hornet's nest of gay rights in the military is met \n     with a philosophy of historical perspective. ``The military \n     services are a microcosm of society,'' he said. ``The nation, \n     at the present time, is focused on a number of issues that \n     pervade the military as well. We've faced societal changes, \n     integration, for example, in the military that have worked \n     out fine. In fact, the Armed Forces are way ahead of society \n     in general in terms of cultural diversity.\n       Whatever the politics of the day, Mundy's motive of \n     management has always been the good of the Corps. He cares \n     fiercely for his people and defends their mission. ``The \n     Marine Corps consumes in total about five percent of the \n     Department of Defense budget. You don't save anything by \n     taking down the number of Marines and you lose a lot. We are \n     the force of economy in all of our arsenal.\n       ``The Marine Corps has long been a crisis response force. \n     It can fight in major land operations but, by and large, we \n     send smaller organizations of Marines around the world to \n     take care of the brush fires, if you will.''\n       With the many ``hot spots'' in the world--Haiti, Somalia, \n     Bosnia, North Korea, etc.--the Marines don't seem slowed down \n     by the lack of a Cold War. When asked whether intervention \n     for humanitarian reasons really makes a long-term difference, \n     Mundy said, ``In some cases I would answer `yes,' in some `we \n     hope so,' and in one or two `probably no.' After a typhoon \n     swept through Bangladesh in 1992, we swung some Marines who \n     were on their way back from the Gulf War through there and \n     did some nation building. We helped them re-establish their \n     nation. Yes, that is a very worthwhile involvement of \n     military forces.\n       ``That generally was a focused, specific goal. Panama has \n     returned to a relatively stable situation, and, in five \n     years, we'll be passing over the Panama Canal to that \n     government. In Somalia, if you get outside Mogadishu, which \n     is the center of the clan conflict, you'll find crops are \n     growing and people aren't starving where before they were. So \n     the intervention there will have to be measured in a longer \n     period of time as we watch what occurs with the various \n     factions in Mogadishu.\n       ``You can only help so much and then the leadership has to \n     be seized by the nation itself. So, there are some true \n     success stories and some that were not as successful.''\n       Although Mundy's term runs out in July 1995, he said his \n     plans are only to ``make it until July of '95. This is a \n     consuming job, and I owe it to you and everybody else who \n     pays my salary to focus on this job until the finish line.'' \n     In a job in which one would expect every day to be a new \n     crisis, he said there is a routine of sorts. ``I wear two \n     hats. I wear the hat of a service chief, as the Marine \n     Commandant, and my responsibilities are to recruit, train, \n     organize, and equip the Marine Corps. I also wear a hat as \n     the Marine member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is a \n     national security position as an advisor to the Secretary of \n     Defense and the President.''\n       The Joint Chiefs meet two to four times a week and take \n     priority over other duties. Any crises, Mundy said, result \n     from national security situations such as the Haitis, Koreas, \n     Bosnias, or Somalias. ``In my day-to-day job as a service \n     chief, the crises tend to be much fewer.''\n       Having entered his final year as a Marine, Mundy still \n     shuns talking about any personal glories when asked to \n     reflect on his career. ``I have never really focused upon an \n     image, a legacy. If I could be remembered well by the people \n     with whom I've served and as a good Commandant, that would be \n     good enough for me. I'd just like to be remembered as a good \n     Marine.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9336-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 9338]]\n\n\n                THE RETIREMENT OF MARINE GEN. CARL MUNDY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Gen. Carl Mundy, \nwho retires this Friday after 38 years of service to our Nation.\n  Carl Mundy has made his career around a title that we as Americans \nhave held sacred for over 200 years: leader of Marines. He was \ncommissioned in 1957, at the height of the cold war, and served a tour \nin Vietnam, where he was wounded and decorated for bravery.\n  Carl Mundy has had the difficult job of leading the corps during the \ndifficult transition out of the cold war and into the uncertainties of \ntoday's world. But under his leadership, as the Marines have reduced \ntheir forces, they have maintained the professionalism and esprit that \nhave been demonstrated throughout our history.\n  On Carl Mundy's watch, Marines participated in dangerous operations \naround the world that were executed with such quiet excellence that \nmany Americans barely notice. The mission in Somalia was fraught with \ndanger, and from the initial intervention to the recent quiet \nwithdrawal of U.N. forces, General Mundy's Marines were there.\n  The Haiti invasion was equally dangerous, and our Nation's Marines \nwere up to the task of bringing democracy back to that poor nation.\n  Most recently, Marines showed their flexibility and bravery by \nrescuing downed Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady from hostile Bosnia, an \nextraordinary feat that demonstrated why I call the Marines our 911 \nforce--they are the ones you call in the middle of the night and who \nare ready to go.\n  Throughout it all, Carl Mundy's determined leadership was there, \nextending from the halls of the Pentagon down to the fresh privates who \nmarch with that unique Marine swagger off the famous drill fields of \nParris Island, SC. I know, because my son Mark was one of those young \nprivates.\n  The life of a Marine is difficult, and when Marines are gone for \nmonths at a time doing dangerous\n work, no one bears that burden more than the families who are left \nback at home. They are the unsung heroes of our military, and I want to \npay special tribute to Carl's wife Linda, and his children Elizabeth, \nCarl III, and Timothy. I know that Carl is proud that both his sons \nwear the Marine uniform, and that serves as further testimony to the \nsense of duty that pervades the Mundy family.\n\n  Carl may come across as the prototypical square jawed Marine, but I \nknow him as a man with a sense of humor and the confidence to laugh at \nhimself. I also have it on good authority that he has a secret life as \nCarl Mundy, the country and western songwriter who can work a mean cut \nbucket bass and can sing every verse of ``Mountain Dew.''\n  Mr. President, I have gotten to know General Mundy in the last 4 \nyears through my work on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nhave found him to be a vigorous advocate for the Marine Corps and, I am \nproud to say, a friend. On behalf of many of us here in the Senate, I \nwant to extend my sincere thanks to Carl Mundy for a career of service \nto our Nation, and offer our best wishes to the Mundy family for a \nfulfilling and well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9338-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9338-S9339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LAWYERS, GARDEN SLUGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to read a \ncommencement speech given on May 21, 1995 by my long time friend, the \nHon. Loren Smith, chief judge of the United States Court of Federal \nClaims, to the graduating class of the John Marshall Law School, in \nAtlanta, GA.\n  The title of the speech is ``Lawyers, Garden Slugs, and \nConstitutional Liberty,'' and its theme deals with the relationship of \nthe lawyer in our society to the concept of constitutional liberty. \nChief Judge Smith makes some significant points that I think are worthy \nof consideration by my colleagues, and I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Lawyers, Garden Slugs and Constitutional Liberty\n\n                          (By Loren A. Smith)\n\n       A couple of years ago, I spoke at another law school's \n     commencement on the topic of our Constitution. Now this may \n     sound like a somewhat weighty topic, perhaps even an overly \n     academic one. After all, this day marks the end of your law \n     school career; not some guest lecture during the second year. \n     However, I thought it was an appropriate speech because the \n     Constitution is both the base and pinnacle of the legal \n     system in which you will spend the rest of your legal \n     careers. Every law you will ever deal with must be consistent \n     with the Constitution's commands. How's that for some heavy \n     thoughts on what will otherwise be a happy and well-earned \n     day of celebration?\n       Well, I hope this speech will strike you as just right. And \n     what do I mean by just right? I am thinking of the Colonel \n     who gave his orderly a bottle of scotch for Christmas. After \n     the holiday he asked the orderly how it was. The orderly \n     replied: ``Just right.'' ``That's kind of a funny \n     expression,'' the Colonel responded, ``what do you mean?'' \n     The orderly noted: `'Well, if it had been any better you \n     wouldn't have given it to me, and if it had been any worse I \n     wouldn't have been able to drink it!''\n       I hope my speech is not ``just right'' in that sense. \n     However, you have to drink it and for that I hope I won't \n     have to apologize to you.\n       I believe that as important as the Constitution is as the \n     foundation of our legal system, it is far more important for \n     the central significance it has to American life. That \n     significance lies in the fact that the Constitution makes us \n     Americans. It is the very basis of our nationality.\n       We the people of this land are not defined by race; we are \n     black and white, brown and yellow. We are not defined by \n     religion; we are Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and also \n     Moslem, Hindu and Orthodox. We are not defined by national \n     origin as all of our ancestors immigrated to this continent \n     from somewhere else. Even the first Americans crossed the \n     Bering land bridge from Asia. We are men, women and children, \n     English speakers, Spanish speakers and speakers of a thousand \n     other tongues. What makes us Americans, however, is a simple \n     concept expressed in a few words: we uphold, support and \n     defend Our Constitution. In\n      no other Nation, past or present, has such a nationality \n     existed. All one has to do to be considered an American is \n     take an oath to support and defend the Constitution.\n       This idea is a fitting topic for a law commencement speech \n     because each graduate joins a profession whose duty is to \n     give life to the rights, responsibilities, and promises found \n     in our Constitution and the laws enacted under it.\n       Thus, it would be easy for me to read the same speech I \n     delivered in 1993, as I assume only a particularly weird \n     masochist would put his- or herself through two law schools, \n     and there isn't likely much faculty overlap with over 165 \n     U.S. law schools. However, I won't give the same speech. On \n     this your last day of law school, you are entitled to \n     something new, after three years of reading used precedent \n     that is based upon even more used precedent.\n       Thus, I have crafted two profound topics--Would you believe \n     stimulating? Would you believe the subject of possible \n     college term papers? Okay.\n       Topic One: Why does the general public seem in recent years \n     to have the view that lawyers are somewhere on the \n     evolutionary scale between pond scum and garden slugs?\n       Topic Two: What do we mean by liberty?\n       Of course, you also want to know what is the relationship \n     between these two topics.\n       With respect to the first topic, there has been a profound \n     change over the past 25 years in the way society views \n     lawyers. In the 1950s and 60s and for many earlier decades \n     lawyers were social heros. They were the trustees, who could \n     be trusted. They were the advocates of just causes who sought \n     and more often than not achieved justice. They were the \n     guardians who faithfully guarded our liberties.\n       Lawyers were at the forefront of struggles for economic \n     liberty, for civil rights, for fair government, and for \n     protecting the rights of the unpopular as well as the \n     popular. They made the criminal justice system achieve \n     justice whether by convicting the guilty or acquitting the \n     innocent. And perhaps overlying all of this they were the \n     wise and practical counselors of our society. Prudence or \n     practical wisdom was their province. Calling someone a good \n     attorney meant they were a person of character.\n       On TV they were the heros whether as Mr. District Attorney \n     or Perry Mason. President John F. Kennedy's book ``Profiles \n     in Courage'' is replete with lawyers. Lawyers crafted the \n     Constitution, achieved its ratification, and played a \n     critical role in the survival of our republic. Abraham \n     Lincoln was a very successful practicing lawyer, as were John \n     Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Alexis de \n     Tocqueville saw lawyers as America's aristocracy. And \n     Americans on the whole agreed with this view for most of our \n     history.\n       What has happened to change this in the last 25 or so\n        years? And when thinking about that question remember the \n     OJ trial has not been going on that long, but only seems \n     like it has.\n       Here is perhaps where the second topic is related to the \n     first. What is the nature of liberty? It seems to me that the \n     proper definition of liberty must be contrasted with \n     government. Simply put, liberty is the state of \n\n[[Page S 9339]]\n     being left alone by government. Now, this means more than not having \n     the government be able to bother you. It means having a \n     legitimate expectation that government will not interfere \n     with you as long as you meet some minimal conditions--such as \n     not interfering with other people's rights to be left alone. \n     In this sense liberty is an exclusively negative concept. It \n     is not a claim on government. It is not a right to have \n     government do something you want it to do. It is a ``right'' \n     to engage in the pursuit of happiness free from government \n     restraint except as already noted.\n       The Framers of our Constitution talked about life, liberty \n     and property as fundamental, indeed natural rights. What they \n     meant by this was not three separate interests. Rather they \n     were referring to the fundamental integrity of the human \n     person. James Madison, perhaps the most influential figure in \n     our Constitution's birth and development, made this clear \n     when in 1792 he wrote, in an essay entitled, ``Property''.\n       ``This term in its particular application means `that \n     dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external \n     things of the world, in exclusion of every other individual.'\n       ``In its larger and juster meaning, it embraces every thing \n     to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and which \n     leaves to every one else the like advantage.\n       ``In the former sense, a man's land, or merchandize, or \n     money is called his property.\n       ``In the latter sense, a man has property in his opinions \n     and the free communication of them.\n       ``He has a property of peculiar value in his religious \n     opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by \n     them.\n       ``He has property very dear to him in the safety and \n     liberty of his person.\n       ``He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties \n     and free choice of the objects on which to employ them.\n       ``In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his \n     property, he may be equally said to have a property in his \n     rights.''\n       Life, liberty and property for the Framers meant the \n     protection of the fundamental integrity of the human person \n     against government. It sometimes meant that protection must \n     be maintained against the democratic majority. Liberty was \n     opposed to arbitrary power whether legislative, executive or \n     judicial. The system established by the Constitution was not \n     designed for efficiency, but precisely the opposite purpose, \n     to contain and control, to check and limit what was seen as a \n     very real threat to human happiness: government.\n       This is not to suggest that the Framers were anarchists. \n     They were wise and practical people (and lawyers) who \n     perceived that fallen humans at times need the restraining \n     hand of government to protect them from one another. However, \n     they saw this as a purely negative role. While government \n     might prevent some unhappiness, it could never create \n     happiness.\n       Now let me try to tie my two themes together. When lawyers \n     serve in the traditional mode as officers of the legal \n     system--and this means guardians of constitutional liberty--\n     they are heroic figures. They keep the dangerous yet\n      necessary leviathan of government within its proper sphere. \n     This is a role that gives dignity to the profession. It is \n     also what I contend has been responsible for the \n     extraordinarily good image the profession has had for most \n     of our history.\n       This, of course, is a simplification. There have been \n     notorious examples of bad lawyers and judges throughout the \n     American past. In fact, like any group of human beings, most \n     lawyers and judges never lived up to the ideal. Of course, \n     very few human beings ever live up to their ideals, which is \n     the reason why real saints and heros are in short supply even \n     in free market economies. However, the ideal was a very real \n     part of our culture for much of our history. It ennobled the \n     profession and gave individuals something to strive for. \n     Lawyers had the role of guardians of the citizens' liberty \n     and property. Both lawyers and citizens accepted this role.\n       Today, however, that image has changed. Beginning in the \n     later part of the 19th century, as has been noted by Dean \n     Anthony T. Kronman of Yale Law School in his book ``The Lost \n     Lawyer,'' the idea took shape and developed slowly through \n     the 20th century that lawyers were social engineers or power \n     brokers or the mediators between private and public \n     ``rights.'' The names changed with the years but the concept \n     was that the legal system's purpose was to reform and improve \n     society.\n       No longer were lawyers the guardians against power, they \n     were the apparatchiks, to use a Soviet term, or the henchmen \n     of power. They had become the sorcerer's apprentices. \n     Increasingly, lawyers' incomes and economic prospects became \n     attached to the operation and growth of the administrative \n     state. Lawyers increasingly became the functionaries of that \n     state. To be sure, their ideal goal was to make that system \n     relatively fair and efficient. Still, they were no longer the \n     guardians who kept it in check or the knights-errant who \n     fought against it when necessary.\n       This fundamental shift in the relationship of the lawyer to \n     constitutional liberty is, I would submit, the principle \n     reason for the drastic decline in the public's view of \n     lawyers over the last quarter century. The people have never \n     liked the king's agents, even when they have liked the king. \n     To manipulate power is not an ideal. In many ways it is a \n     curse. A hundred new model codes of professional conduct, \n     backed up by a thousand disciplinary boards, will not restore \n     the profession's sense dignity, status and self worth. \n     Stature comes not from self-regulation but from self-\n     definition. And the choice of self-definition is fairly \n     simple: user of power or defender of liberty against \n     government.\n       I should add, lest there be any confusion, this is not an \n     attack upon government attorneys. In fact, they are the \n     frontline guardians of liberty against government. Whether in \n     recent decades or before, their commitment to liberty against \n     government has been no worse, and sometimes better, than \n     nongovernment attorneys. Those in government often know best \n     the blessings of limited government and most clearly \n     understand the dangers of the leviathan state.\n       What is to be done? That really is the challenge you face. \n     There are no immutable laws of history or culture as the \n     recent transformation of Russia has proved. Daily in this \n     nation and abroad we see what several decades ago was thought \n     impossible in science, medicine, economics or politics become \n     the facts of the nightly news. The historical junkyard is \n     littered with the ruins of many so-called ``laws of \n     history,'' which decreed how inevitable were their bleak and \n     sterile visions of the future.\n       Each generation has the power to restore true values, and \n     more importantly each individual has the ability to determine \n     his or her own destiny and path toward salvation. The values \n     you hold and the goal of your life are within your power to \n     create and achieve. It's up to you. On this your graduation \n     day, as Holmes said--Sherlock that is, not Oliver Wendell--\n     ``The game's afoot.'' May God speed and bless that game for \n     each of you. And may you each treat that precious degree, \n     stained with sweat and tears, and possibly highlighter and \n     beers, if not blood, as your sword and shield to guard, \n     defend and further liberty.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9338-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9339-S9343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE 1995 BASE CLOSURE LIST\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nthe 1995 base closure list and to urge the President to reject the Base \nClosure Commission's recommended hit list.\n  In this base closure round, the Commission voted to close or realign \n9 out of the 12 military bases in California that were reviewed, many \nagainst the recommendation and advice of the Secretary of Defense.\n  In addition to the adverse national security impact of the \nCommission's action, the economic impact on California--particularly \nthe cumulative economic impact--will be enormous.\n\n\n                    Economic Impact of Base Closures\n\n  California is being hit disproportionately hard by base closures. In \nthree previous rounds, 22 major bases in California have been slated \nfor closure or realignment--more than double any other State.\n  California is home to only 15 percent of all Defense Department \npersonnel. Yet, California has lost more than 82,000 of the nearly \n120,000 net direct jobs--military and civilian--lost nationwide since \n1988 as a result of base closures alone.\n  All total, these actions have resulted in the loss of more than \n200,000 direct and indirect jobs and $7 billion in annual economic \nactivity in California.\n  I do not believe it is appropriate to proceed with another base \nclosure round when the full impact of previous base closures has not \nyet been felt. In California, bases slated for closure in 1988 are just \nnow starting to close their gates, and few are having success in reuse \nand redevelopment efforts.\n  If the current base closure round goes forward, 58,000 additional \ndirect and indirect California jobs will be impacted--7,900 direct \nmilitary and 19,000 direct civilian personnel. Major bases in \nCalifornia which the Commission has targeted include:\n  McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento;\n  Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Los Angeles County;\n  Onizuka Air Station in Sunnyvale;\n  Oakland Army Base in Alameda County;\n  Sierra Army Depot in Lassen County; and\n  Fort Hunter Liggett in Monterey County.\n  With the addition of defense industry layoffs in California--which \nhave claimed 250,000 jobs in just the past few years--California stands \nto lose more than half-a-million jobs as a result of base closures and \ndefense downsizing.\n  And, defense industry downsizing is expected to continue through the \nend of the decade with the loss of another 250,000 jobs. Enough is \nenough.\n  By law, economic impact must be considered by the Commission when \ndetermining what bases to recommend \n\n[[Page S 9340]]\nfor closure or realignment. The inclusion of economic impact as a \ncriteria is for good reason: to prevent the piling on of base closures \non one single community or State.\n  Yet, it is clear to me that the Commission disregarded the economic \nimpact of currently proposed and previously announced base closures on \nCalifornia when it made its final recommendation to close or realign \nnine California bases.\n\n\n                      California's Fragile Economy\n\n  The California economy cannot take additional base closures at this \ntime. California was once the land of golden opportunity, where good \npaying jobs were available and investments in real estate resulted in \nhigh-paying dividends. Today, that dream of golden opportunities has \ndisappeared.\n  California's unemployment rate is nearly 3 percent higher than the \nnational average. More than 1.28 million Californians are out of work. \nIn fact, California has 17 percent of all the unemployed workers in \nAmerica.\n  As cuts in jobs, both military and civilian, loom on the horizon, \nconsumer confidence has dwindled. Consumers are unwilling to move into \nhomes and purchase durable goods as long as the State's economic \nprospects remain dim.\n  ``Disappointing, disturbing, and traumatic''--those are the words \nused by the president of the California Association of Realtors to \ndescribe the current challenge of being a real estate agent in \nCalifornia.\n  The facts about the current real estate market in California are \nstartling. Home sales dropped 21 percent in California during the first \nquarter of 1995. In Los Angeles County alone, home prices dropped 23 \npercent from January 1991 to January 1995. Prices fell another 3 \npercent in March of this year.\n  The crisis of confidence in California's economy extends well beyond \nthe real estate market and the sheer number of unemployed residents. \nPeople are simply unsettled about the State's economic future.\n  Orange County filed bankruptcy, and just this week, while hoping to \nearn $30 million in a real estate auction, had to settle for $15 \nmillion. Bill Lange, who conducted the auction, remarked, ``On a scale \nof one to 10, it's about a five. It'd be an eight or nine if the real \nestate market wasn't in the tank.'' In any case, it is still a small \nfraction of the county's $1.7 billion in investment loses.\n  Los Angeles County, the largest in the Nation, is faced with the \nprospect of eliminating a $1.2 billion deficit. Laying off more than \n18,000 employees--one out of five county workers--seems inevitable. \nClosing the County-U.S.C. Medical Center is another likely budget-\ncutting measure that will be implemented.\n  Twelve months ago, California's leading indicators were running \nslightly above the national trend. Six months ago, California dropped \nto next to last among all States. In a 3-month moving average of \nleading indicators--as compiled by the WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, \nPennsylvania--California comes in dead last.\n  If California continues to suffer blow after blow, not only will this \nslow our economic recovery, but could set it back. I cannot predict the \ntotal consequences of further devastating cuts.\n  This is the Nation's largest State, and a weakened and uncertain \neconomy here can lash like a chain reaction through our national \neconomy and our balance of trade. Closing California's military bases \ncan only make matters worse. Our economy, simply put, will continue its \nsteep downward spiral with no end in sight.\n\n\n                Base Closures Cost More Than Anticipated\n\n  Base closures have turned out to be a lot more expensive than \noriginally estimated, primarily because environmental costs are not \nincluded in closure estimates. As history indicates, costs for closing \nmilitary bases in California have sky-rocketed:\n  BRAC 88 clean-up costs were originally estimated at $126 million in \n1990. By 1994, the costs had quadrupled to $598 million;\n  The costs to clean up bases from BRAC 91 were originally estimated at \n$389 million. Now, these costs have risen to $1.3 billion.\n  Clean-up costs for BRAC 93 bases were originally estimated at $230 \nmillion in 1990. By 1994, these costs had risen more than five-fold, to \n$1.4 billion.\n  The costs to clean up and close California's bases for the first \nthree rounds alone is nearly $3.5 billion, up from the $745 million \nthat was originally estimated and budgeted. California bases alone \ncould absorb all of the funds appropriated for clean-up in all the BRAC \naccounts from fiscal year 1990 through 1995.\n  And the total costs to clean up BRAC 95 bases that were originally \nrecommended for closure or realignment is estimated at more than $1 \nbillion--and these are just initial estimates. If history is any \nindication, then these costs will increase two-, three-, four-, or even \nfive-fold. McClellan Air Force Base's environmental costs alone will \nmore than double the original estimated clean-up costs for BRAC 95.\n  Mr. President, I would like to discuss some specific details on the \ntwo largest bases in California that were targeted by the Commission: \nMcClellan Air Force Base and Long Beach Naval Shipyard.\n\n\n                       Mc Clellan Air Force Base\n\n  McClellan Air Force Base was targeted for closure by the Commission, \nagainst the recommendation of the Secretary of Defense and despite \nprotests by the Air Force's military and civilian leadership. McClellan \nis northern California's largest industrial employer, with nearly \n15,000 mostly civilian workers.\n  I believe that the Commission's action to target McClellan for \nclosure will adversely impact U.S. national security and drain needed \nfiscal resources from higher priority programs and initiatives in the \nPentagon budget.\n  The Air Force has stated that the cost to close one Air Logistics \nCenter is estimated at $500 million, excluding environmental clean-up \ncosts. These prohibitively high closure costs would be greater than the \ntotal cost the Air Force has budgeted over the next 6 year for all of \nits base closures and realignments nationwide.\n  According to a recent letter from Air Force Chief of Staff General \nFogelman and Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall, the \nCommission's action will:\n\n       Cost the Air Force hundreds of millions of additional \n     dollars (in excess of $1 billion in environmental and \n     military construction costs) during the next five years; \n     disrupt military readiness because of the total restructuring \n     of the Air Force logistics and depot system; preclude the Air \n     Force from carrying through on vital readiness and \n     modernization programs; and have a devastating impact on as \n     many as 25,000 DoD employees in Texas and California who \n     would lose their jobs or have to relocate to other Air Force \n     installations at great personal and public expense.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter, as well as \na letter from General Moorman, the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have visited McClellan several times over the last \nfew years. McClellan is an excellent base with superb, state-of-the-art \nfacilities and is one of the most advanced installations in the entire \nmilitary.\n  McClellan has its own one-of-a-kind industrial nuclear reactor, a \nnondestructive aircraft inspection facility, logistics retrofit \nengineering capabilities, and a technical laboratory with specialized \nlogistics facilities. McClellan is truly a unique asset to our Nation's \ndefense.\n  Finally with regard to McClellan, if economic impact--particularly \ncumulative economic impact--is going to be considered, then the impact \non the northern California region must be considered when looking at \nMcClellan.\n  Already in the Sacramento area, Mather Air Force Base and the \nSacramento Army Depot have been slated for closure, resulting in the \nloss of nearly 7,000 direct jobs. And, in nearby Vallejo, the closure \nof Mare Island Naval shipyard will result in the loss of an additional \n9,000 direct jobs.\n\n\n                       Long Beach Naval Shipyard\n\n  I do not believe that the Pentagon's recommendation to close Long \nBeach Naval Shipyard makes sense. In 1993, the Base Closure Commission \naddressed the issue of whether to close the Shipyard, and the \nCommission recognized the vital role that Long Beach plays in support \nof the Pacific Fleet and kept it open.\n  Long Beach Naval Shipyard is strategically located in southern \nCalifornia--\n\n[[Page S 9341]]\nnear 70 percent of the Pacific Fleet in San Diego--and has a large dry-\ndock capable of docking every class of ship in the U.S. Navy's \ninventory, including large aircraft carriers. Other Naval shipyards are \nlong distances from the west coast mega-port: Puget Sound is located \n1,135 nautical miles from San Diego and Pearl Harbor is located 2,600 \nnautical miles away.\n  Long Beach is also the most cost-effective shipyard in the Navy. It \nis the only one of the eight Navy shipyards that operates in the black \nwith annual retained earnings. In just the last 6 fiscal years, Long \nBeach has been consistently under budget and $102.7 million has been \nreturned to the Navy budget.\n  The closure of Long Beach Naval Shipyard will also have a devastating \neconomic impact. 13,000 jobs and $539 million in annual economic \nactivity will be lost if Long Beach closes. Los Angeles County has \ntaken the brunt of the State's defense downsizing and Long Beach \npreviously suffered from a large base closure: Long Beach Naval \nStation.\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell may have \nprovided the best defense of Long Beach when he said in 1991 that the:\n\n       closure of Long Beach Naval Shipyard would seriously \n     degrade the dry dock capability for all large ships in the \n     Southern California area. Alternatives in Hawaii and \n     Washington simply could not provide the services found at \n     Long Beach.\n\n  General Powell was right. Long Beach Naval Shipyard should not be \nclosed.\n\n\n                          Onizuka Air Station\n\n  Onizuka Air Station has existed in Sunnyvale since the mid-1950's and \nwas created to provide a place where the Air Force satellite control \nmission and other classified Defense Department tenants could function \nin collocation.\n  While the Air Force has proposed realigning Onizuka and shifting many \nof its functions to other bases outside California, the Air Force's \nproposal actually amounts to a stealth closure of this state-of-the-art \nbase. In the short-term, nearly 3,000 jobs will be lost as a result of \nOnizuka's realignment. In the long term, Onizuka's closure will cost \nseveral thousand additional jobs.\n  In addition to the economic impact on the northern California region, \nI believe that Onizuka's realignment could have an adverse impact on \nU.S. national security, particularly with regard to the Nation's \nsatellite control and communication network. I also question the cost-\neffectiveness of Onizuka's proposed realignment in light of the long \npay-back period--7 years--and the fact that the base will continue to \noperate well into the next century.\n  I am also concerned that the recommendation to realign Onizuka could \nhave been tainted by a 1993 internal Air Force study on the closure of \nOnizuka. This study was conducted outside of the official BRAC process \nand estimated the true cost to close Onizuka at hundreds of millions of \ndollars more than originally estimated by the Air Force. Unfortunately, \nthe existence of this study--which was originally denied by the Air \nForce--was uncovered late in the BRAC process, thus impeding its full \nutilization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the copy of a 1993 Air Force letter, \nwhich initiated a study of Onizuka Air Station's closure outside of the \nofficial BRAC process, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n\n\n                           Oakland Army Base\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Once again the Commission rejected the recommendation \nof the Secretary of Defense, as well as the pleas of the Army's \nmilitary and civilian leadership, and targeted Oakland Army Base for \nclosure. In addition to being vital to U.S. national security, Oakland \nArmy Base's closure will have an adverse impact on a region still \nfeeling the brunt of previous base closures.\n  The Oakland Army Base's mission is to support the rapid deployment of \nmilitary equipment and other large cargo in times of peace and war. As \nthe only exclusive use, Army-owned secure access facility on the west \ncoast, the Oakland Army Base is crucial to the Pentagon's strategy of \nbeing able to fight and win two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts.\n  The senior Army leadership closely reviewed Oakland Army Base when \npreparing their 1995 base closure recommendations. The closure of the \nOakland Army Base was flatly rejected by Secretary of the Army Togo \nWest on operational grounds because there simply are insufficient \ncommercial port facilities on the west coast to support the Army's \nmilitary requirements.\n  I personally spoke with General Sullivan, the Army Chief of Staff, \nwho said he strongly opposes the closure of the Oakland Army Base. In a \nrecent letter to me, General Sullivan wrote that:\n\n       its loss represents an unacceptable risk. Oakland is \n     essential for the deployment of our CONUS-based forces to \n     respond to any national security threats which would emerge \n     in the Pacific. . . . The Army needs this critical facility \n     to support the rapid deployment of equipment during peace and \n     war.\n\n  In addition to its adverse impact on U.S. national security, the \nclosure of Oakland Army Base will result in the loss of at least 700 \njobs in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area hard hit by previous base \nclosures. As you may recall, the 1993 base closure process claimed more \nthan 30,000 jobs with the closure of Alameda Naval Air Station, Mare \nIsland Naval Shipyard, Treasure Island Naval Station, and other \nfacilities. The bay area's economy simply cannot take another major \nblow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of General Sullivan's \nletter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n\n\n                          Fort Hunter Liggett\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In addition to the strong military and fiscal \narguments for keeping the TEXCOM Experimentation Center at Fort Hunter \nLiggett, the realignment of the base will have an adverse economic \nimpact on an area already suffering the consequences from one of the \nbiggest BRAC actions in the county: the closure of Fort Ord. Monterey \nCounty's already fragile economy cannot afford the realignment of \nanother major base.\n  Fort Hunter Liggett provides a total test and experimentation package \nto the Department of Defense. TEXCOM's isolated location provides \nunequaled access to extremely versatile training areas with a wide \nvariety of weather and terrain conditions, controlled airspace to \n24,000 feet, a 360-degree high energy laser testing area, isolation \nfrom ambient light and minimal radio frequency interference.\n  While Fort Hunter Liggett was evaluated in the BRAC process only as a \ntraining area, the base performs vital test and evaluation functions. \nThus, the recommendation to realign Fort Hunter Liggett and move \nTEXCOM--a test and evaluation asset--is based on a flawed analysis that \ndid not take into account TEXCOM's unique capabilities. The Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation at the Defense Department has stated \nthat moving TEXCOM would be a ``show stopper.''\n  Finally with regard to Fort Hunter Liggett, I do not believe that the \nproposed realignment is cost-effective. Information presented to the \nCommission staff by Monterey County officials regarding one-time costs, \nreturn on investment, and accumulated savings showed that the \nrealignment of Fort Hunter Liggett is not cost-effective. However, I \nunderstand that this new information was not utilized by or presented \nto the Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a letter from Mr. Phil \nCoyle, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, California has been hit \ndisproportionately hard by base closures once again. While California \nis willing to do its fair share of base closures and defense \ndownsizing, this base closure round is simply not fair to the State. \n\n[[Page S 9342]]\n\n  It is my contention that if this round of base closures goes through \nas proposed by the Commission, the cumulative economic impact of base \nclosures on California will have a devastating impact on California and \naffect the State's recovery from the recession.\n  Just after three base closure rounds, it is apparent in California \nthat when base closures are combined with on-going large-scale defense \ndownsizing, there is a substantial impact on jobs for working people. \nTherefore, a worker who loses a job in the defense industry or on a \nbase, loses retirement benefits, health insurance and a good salary. \nSimilar replacement jobs are simply not available.\n  I strongly urge the President to reject the 1995 base closure list \nbecause of the devastating economic impact--including the cumulative \neconomic impact--of base closures on California.\n  In addition, several of the Base Closure Commission's recommendations \nare opposed by the Secretary of Defense, as well as our military and \ncivilian leadership at the Pentagon, because of their adverse impact on \nU.S. national security. Surely our military leaders know what is best \nfor the Nation's defense.\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Alan J. Dixon,\n     Chairman, Defense Base Closure, and Realignment Commission, \n         Arlington, VA\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Air Force approach to the depots is \n     prudent because it saves money for the taxpayers and protects \n     military readiness. it is also the product of exhaustive \n     analysis by military professionals and senior leadership who \n     have been working the proposal for over a year.\n       Our depot proposal is simple. Building on the personnel \n     reduction that have already been taken from the Air Logistic \n     Centers and depots during the last five years (over 26,000 \n     people), the pending Air Force proposal would reduce and \n     realign the depots by an additional 1,987 jobs (with a net \n     present value of $975 million). While there would be some \n     disruption, the business of the Air Force--flying combat and \n     transport aircraft, and maintaining our command and control \n     and space network--would continue unimpeded. This total Air \n     Force depot reduction of 28,000 jobs is almost two and a half \n     times the total depot reduction achieved by all other DoD \n     components in all four BRAC rounds combined.\n       On the other band, the staff generated BRAC proposal \n     described to us will cost the Air Force hundreds of million \n     of additional dollars (in excess of $1 billion in \n     environmental and military construction costs) during the \n     next five years; disrupt military readiness because of the \n     total restructuring of the Air Force logistics and depot \n     system; preclude the Air Force from carrying through on vital \n     readiness and modernization programs; and have a devastating \n     impact on as many as 25,000 DoD employees in Texas and \n     California who would lose their jobs or have to relocate to \n     other Air Force installations at great personal and public \n     expense.\n       Most importantly, the essential business of the Air Force--\n     operations, logistics and budget dollars that are critical to \n     future modernization--would be greatly disrupted. Since the \n     end of the cold war, the Air Force has reduced its budget by \n     more than $20 billion and reduced personnel by over 200,000 \n     people. Some further reductions and savings are necessary; \n     however, they must be taken in a way that permits the Air \n     Force to continue to carry out its essential mission. The \n     Department of Defense proposal does that; the Commission \n     staff alternative does not.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ronald R. Fogleman,\n       General USAF, Chief of Staff.\n     Sheila E. Widnall,\n       Secretary of the Air Force.\n                             Exhibit No. 2\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                               U.S. Air Force,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC 20510\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This responds to your request for \n     my views on McClellan Air Force Base, California, pertaining \n     to that base's consideration by the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission. Given our limited fiscal resources, \n     the Air Force views the budgetary impact of a closure of any \n     of the depot installations as inconsistent with other budget \n     priorities. The estimated one-time cost of a closure of \n     McClellan AFB, not including environmental restoration costs, \n     is more than $500 million. Incurring these costs would be \n     harmful to our efforts in modernization, readiness, and \n     quality of life initiatives. The Air Force strongly opposes \n     the closure of any of our depot installations, including \n     McClellan AFB.\n       I understand the Commissioners were impressed during their \n     recent visit to McClellan AFB with the quality and scope of \n     the work performed there. As you know, McClellan AFB \n     possesses several Air Force maintenance centers of excellence \n     and was recommended as a Technical Repair Center receiver \n     location for a number of commodities in the Air Force \n     proposal to downsize Air Force depots. These commodity \n     workloads include such vital areas as composites and \n     plastics, hydraulics, injection molding, and electrical/\n     mechanical support equipment. The approval of our \n     recommendation in the BRAC process will clearly establish the \n     Sacramento Air Logistics Center as Air Force Materiel \n     Command's number one provider of these commodities for the \n     future.\n       The skilled workers and leadership at McClellan AFB are \n     essential to the Air Force proposal. The Commission's \n     recognition of their deserved reputation for quality, \n     efficiency, and pride in their work will commend the approval \n     of the downsizing initiative. I trust this information will \n     prove helpful and please let me know if you would like to \n     discuss.\n                                           Thomas S. Moorman, Jr.,\n                               General, USAF, Vice Chief of Staff.\n                             Exhibit No. 3\n\n                                                        U.S. Army,\n\n\n                                           The Chief of Staff,\n\n                                                   May 24, 1995.  \n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As we discussed by phone yesterday, \n     the Army's position regarding the recent decision by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to consider \n     the closure of Oakland Army Base remains unchanged. The Army \n     studied the feasibility of closing the port at Oakland and \n     concluded its loss represents an unacceptable risk. Oakland \n     is essential for the deployment of our CONUS-based forces to \n     respond to any national security threats which could emerge \n     in the Pacific.\n       Although our initial analysis indicated some financial \n     benefit, the resulting operational risk is unacceptable. The \n     Army needs this critical facility to support the rapid \n     deployment of equipment during peace and war. Its closure \n     would leave the Army without a port facility on the west \n     coast.\n       While it has been difficult for the Army to identify the \n     excess infrastructure necessary for divestiture, we clearly \n     understand the impact of BRAC on our fellow Americans. Our \n     choices for realignment and closure are the right ones and \n     balance requisite infrastructure with the warfighting \n     capability needed to forge the Army into the 21st century.\n       We will make certain the Commission clearly understands the \n     Army's position on Oakland Army Base. I appreciate your \n     personal interest in and support of the Army.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,\n                                               General, U.S. Army.\n                             Exhibit No. 4\n\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                  Headquarters U.S. Air Force,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1993.\n       1. During his visit to Onizuka AFB in 1992, Gen McPeak \n     asked about the cost and operations impacts of closing \n     Onizuka. This alternative is being considered by the Space & \n     C31 Resource Allocation Team [RAT] as a possible cut during \n     upcoming budget exercises. Request a joint study be initiated \n     to assess the impacts of such a closure, document the \n     development and support impacts of such a closure, and \n     determine if the mission of the AFSCN could continue while \n     meeting operational and User requirements.\n       2. I recently received an AFSCN status. It described the \n     current Network, the acquisition methodology, and provided \n     detail on the planned Improvement and Modernization programs \n     essential to maintaining the AFSCN infrastructure, and \n     providing User support. These efforts must continue and may \n     provide the architecture that will allow a closure of Onizuka \n     that minimizes operational impacts and improves operational \n     efficiency in the future.\n       3. All these considerations should be taken into account in \n     this study. The primary output of this study should be a \n     briefing and report fully defining the AFSCN mission in light \n     of the current world environment, updating the operational \n     and acquisition impacts of a closure, and fully describing \n     what must be done to accomplish the AFSCN mission in the \n     future. As you are aware, the AF will have to respond to \n     budget actions resulting from the new administration as well \n     as prepare for the FY 96 POM (the effect on the space \n     community will exceed $1.5B in FY 96). We need to be certain \n     all current and planned missions of the AFSCN are well \n     understood, and the operational impacts of a closure of \n     Onizuka include all AFSCN Users. Initial output of this study \n     should be a plan, to include a schedule, with interim \n     milestones, and a final briefing and report. We would like \n     the AFSCN PEMs in SAF/AQSL and AF/XORS to participate in this \n     study and would like to have access to the interim data to \n     support any on-going exercises. Please provide your plan and \n     schedule by 5 Mar 93.\n                                               Sanford D.

Of those \n     in the attachments, two are considered to be major \n     showstoppers (regarding Dugway Proving Grounds and Fort \n     Hunter-Liggett), and another a minor showstopper (Tunnel 9 \n     inclusion in the White Oak closure). The remainder are \n     considered incomplete requiring additional alternatives to be \n     analyzed before we can agree to them.\n     Philip E.

Burt,\n       Director, Test, Systems Engineering, and Evaluation.\n                                 issue\n\n       The Army's proposal to move its Test Battalion from Fort \n     Hunter-Liggett (FHL) to Ft. Bliss would de facto ``close'' \n     FHL and remove its capabilities from operational test use.\n\n\n                               rationale\n\n       1. The TEXCOM Experimentation Center (TEC), located at Fort \n     Hunter-Liggett, California, has the unique capability to \n     provide a total test/experimentation package. TEC's isolated \n     location provides unequaled access to extremely versatile \n     training areas with a wide variety of weather and terrain \n     conditions, controlled airspace to 24,000 feet, a 360 degree \n     high energy laser play area, isolation from ambient light, \n     and minimal radio frequency (RF) interference.\n       2. The terrain at FHL resembles Korea and is unlike that in \n     any of the desert test ranges. Its diverse terrain features--\n     mountains, hills, rivers, creeks and lakes--were the reason \n     FHL was selected as a field laboratory site in 1957 and FHL \n     remains a unique asset today. For example, operational \n     testing prior to the final IOT of the SGT YORK was at Ft. \n     Bliss where only flat terrain was encountered. In the IOT \n     at FHL the valley walls caused ground clutter breakthrough \n     which rendered the radar useless. Also, FHL has a unique \n     capability--a natural 360 degree ``bowl''--and the necessary \n     state permits--to test high power military lasers. Recent \n     Longbow Apache tests at FHL required this capability, \n     revealing important limitations in modeling and simulation.\n       3. By moving to Ft. Bliss a further test restriction would \n     be created. Radio frequency jamming essential to creating a \n     realistic test environment in a location that is close to \n     large metropolitan areas, international airports, and an \n     international border will be difficult to recreate and will \n     increase risks of not having an adequate test environment.\n       4. Operating temporarily at FHL with mobil assets will be \n     more expensive. Just four years ago in March 1991, all of \n     TEC's command staff and operational functions were \n     consolidated at FHL because operating in temporary duty \n     status was too expensive. The projected savings reflected in \n     the Army's submission, the reduction of 17 military and 5 \n     federal civilians, would be trivial when considering giving \n     up this valuable and important operational test capability.\n\n\n                             recommendation\n\n       Army withdraw proposal to move its test Battalion from Fort \n     Hunter-Liggett to Ft.

WOLFENSOHN: BRILLIANT LEADERSHIP FOR THE KENNEDY CENTER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to James Wolfensohn who is stepping down as \nchairman of the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center to accept \nPresident Clinton's appointment as the new chairman of the World Bank. \nJim is a well-known and widely respected investment banker. During the \ncourse of his brilliant career, he has also earned an outstanding \nreputation as a persuasive advocate for the arts. So it was no \ncoincidence that the Kennedy Center turned to Jim 5 years ago to become \nthe chairman at the center. Despite his many commitments, Jim accepted \nthis major responsibility and did a magnificent job.\n  The Wolfensohn years brought the center into its own in fulfilling \nits intended role as a national performing arts center. Jim \nWolfensohn's leadership developed a clear vision for this mission, and \nput the center on a sound financial basis. He improved and expanded the \nscope of its programming, and reached out to new audiences in the \ncommunity. He has placed special emphasis on education programs. He has \nbeen instrumental in developing new dance initiatives for young people, \ncommissioning new productions, and, most recently, establishing an \ninternational arts fellowship exchange program.\n  The Kennedy Center is vastly improved as a result of Jim's \nchairmanship, and more Americans than ever from across the country will \nhave greater opportunities to enjoy the impressive programs and \nproductions that have resulted from Jim's work. I'm sure that President \nKennedy would be proud of the new vitality and energy that Jim has \nbrought to my brother's memorial here in Washington, and so are all of \nus in the Kennedy family.\n  I know that Jim will bring the same excellence of vision and \nleadership to his new responsibilities at the World Bank, and I wish \nhim well.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am so very pleased to join with my fine \ncolleagues in paying tribute to one great fellow, my friend, James D. \nWolfensohn, as he takes on the tremendous task of being president of \nthe World Bank. That is a capacity he is well suited for--it truly \nmerges his vast expertise in finance, his marvelous capability in \npublic service, and his generous and caring nature. I have no doubt at \nall he will be a good and powerful force at that institution. But he \nwill certainly be deeply missed at the Kennedy Center.\n  I have the richest and soundest respect for Jim Wolfensohn. He has \nworked doggedly on behalf of the Kennedy Center for the past 5 years--\nand he loved it and he did it for free. His staff is aggressive and \ncompetent and under his very sharp eye and supervision--they have \ncultivated and nurtured the Kennedy Center into its original status as \na first-class arts institution of rare and abiding quality.\n  Jim truly stands head and shoulders above the rest--and above the \nfray. His splendid leadership will be sorely missed by those of us in \nthe Senate who remain committed to ensuring the future of an appealing \nand vibrant Kennedy Center.\n  God bless Jim and his bright and gracious wife Elaine as they embark \non this new and vitally important mission.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I join with several of my colleagues \nin paying tribute to the outgoing chairman of the board of trustees of \nthe John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Mr. James D. \nWolfensohn. As many in the Senate are aware, Mr. Wolfensohn is leaving \nthe Kennedy Center to become chairman of the World Bank.\n  The Kennedy Center, a national monument and living memorial, could \nnot have been blessed with a more talented and resourceful steward than \nJames Wolfensohn. Mr. Wolfensohn came to the center more than 5 years \nago with superb credentials and many remarkable accomplishments--so it \nis no surprise at all that he leaves the institution in far better \ncondition than it was when he arrived.\n  As the Washington Post editorialized on June 5, 1995,\n\n       The Kennedy Center went looking for a new chairman in 1989 \n     who could straighten out a place burdened with debts, \n     artistic confusion and a wobbly relationship with its own \n     trustees. Five years later, all those things have changed for \n     the better--in large measure because of the man the trustees \n     tapped--investment banker and former Carnegie Hall chairman \n     James Wolfensohn.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more with this assessment. In fact, \nI'd like to identify another area that Mr. Wolfensohn has worked hard \non for the betterment of the Kennedy Center and numerous communities \nacross the country--education and outreach. One of Mr. Wolfensohn's \nproudest achievements is the Kennedy Center's enhanced series of arts \neducation programs.\n  Under James Wolfensohn's leadership, the Kennedy Center is now making \nuse of cutting-edge computer and telecommunications technology by \nworking with the National Endowment for the Arts, the Education \nDepartment, teachers, schools, and parents across the Nation to \nestablish an interactive arts information network. This and other \ncomputer-based projects will now link schoolchildren and adults alike \nto the enriching study and performance of fine arts.\n  Locally, Kennedy Center staff and performing artists have increased \ntheir exposure to public schools in and around Washington, DC, by \nhelping to integrate arts into the curriculum and by conducting more \nthan 200 special performances for children and students.\n  These are but a few examples of the Kennedy Center's desire to play a \nrole \n\n[[Page S 9344]]\nin the continuing effort to improve education. I want to credit Mr. \nWolfensohn for placing such a high priority on the education side of \nthe center's existence.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I have come to be familiar with another Wolfensohn project--\nreversing the decay and neglect of the Kennedy Center building. I am \nconvinced that many in the Senate and around the country would be \nalarmed to know of this facility's physical condition.\n  The Kennedy Center has welcomed more than 70 million people since it \nwas opened in 1971. It is terrific that so many people from around the \nworld have had the opportunity to visit the site--but much wear and \ntear has resulted. Many of the structure's mechanical systems have \nexisted beyond their useful life--and have been rendered primitive by \nadvancements in technology. In addition, numerous interior and exterior \nfurnishments have fallen into severe disrepair. Why has this happened? \nIn large part, because of an unclear division of responsibility.\n  Until last year, the Park Service split responsibility with the \nKennedy Center Board for operations, repairs, maintenance, and \nsecurity. Now, as a result of Mr. Wolfensohn's 4-year efforts, the \nKennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994 assigns these responsibilities \nand federal funding directly to the board of trustees. This legislation \nwill now give the people closest to the problems, the board of \ntrustees, the opportunity to solve them. This sensible allocation of \nduties would not have been possible without the diligence of James \nWolfensohn.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to thank James D. Wolfensohn for his \nmany contributions. From reconciling a debt--to expanding education \nprograms--to attracting new world-class performing artists--Mr. \nWolfensohn has been a tremendous Kennedy Center chairman. I wish him \nwell in his new position at the World Bank and hope that he is able to \ncontinue an involvement with the John F. Kennedy Center for the \nPerforming Arts.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as a member of the Kennedy Center Board \nof Trustees, I am pleased to extend my thanks and best wishes to James \nD. Wolfensohn as he prepares to leave the chairmanship at the close of \nthe year.\n  The vision of Jim Wolfensohn when he came to the Kennedy Center 5 \nyears ago was to see the center become the national center for the \nperforming arts. Since l990, the Kennedy Center has developed into one \nof the strongest artistic presences in the country and continues to \ngain prestige throughout the world.\n  Jim has secured for the center the artistic expertise of Leonard \nSlatkin and Placido Domingo. He has heightened the profile of the \ncenter through a vast array of educational programs operated through \nthe center. He has worked diligently to stabilize funding for the \ncenter at a time when budgets in the private and public sectors are \nstrained. The energy, enthusiasm, the wealth of knowledge and interests \nJim Wolfensohn has brought to the Kennedy Center have all contributed \nto its rejuvenation for the benefit of the entire Nation.\n  While the guidance of Jim Wolfensohn will be difficult for the \nKennedy Center to replicate, the bittersweet timing of his departure \nwas fortunate in one important regard. Jim was chairman long enough to \nsee fully implemented during his tenure the Kennedy Center Fellowships \nof the Americas program.\n  The program, envisioned and developed by Jim Wolfensohn, will provide \n20 fellowships annually to artists from central and South America to \nstudy at institutions across the United States. The first award \nrecipients will be announced this fall. With the continued input of the \nprogram's founder, the distinguished program will no doubt gain \ninternational acclaim.\n  Jim Wolfensohn will prove to be a stellar head of the World Bank. \nAssuming his new post will involve sacrifices for Jim, with time away \nfrom his family perhaps the most trying. But he took the position \nbecause, quite simply, he wanted to help people. I have no doubt he \nwill succeed.\n  Mr. President, a true leader inspires others to service through his \nown conduct and example. Jim is a superior leader and an extraordinary \nman. I am honored to call him my friend and wish him well in the years \nahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9343-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9344-S9345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    IN HONOR OF THE 85TH BIRTHDAY OF WILLIAM O. FARBER, JULY 4, 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on July 4, 1995, family, friends, \ncolleagues and students past and present will join Dr. William O. \nFarber of Vermillion, SD, to celebrate his 85th birthday. Dr. Farber, \nprofessor emeritus of political science at the University of South \nDakota [USD], is a mentor and respected friend of mine. I would like to \ntake this time to pay tribute to a man who has been influential in the \nlives of thousands of students of public policy.\n  It is fitting that Dr. Farber celebrate his birthday on the same day \nwe celebrate the birth of this great Nation. He exemplifies many of the \ncharacteristics upon which our country was founded: hard work and \ndedication, honesty and compassion, and the love of and commitment to a \ndemocratic society.\n  The June 20, 1995 issue of the Sioux City Journal contained an \narticle entitled, ``Retired Professor Still Serving.'' The story \nhighlighted many of Dr. Farber's philosophies and attainments. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be placed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Farber began his teaching career at USD in 1935 after \nreceiving his Ph.D. in political science from the University of \nWisconsin, at Madison. As many of my colleagues know, Wisconsin was--\nand continues to be--one of the elite schools in political science.\n  While at Wisconsin, Dr. Farber had the opportunity to study and learn \nhis craft under the best educators in the field. These professors would \noften host student-initiated debates in their homes. Dr. Farber brought \nthis practice with him to South Dakota. He would invite students to \nparticipate in Sunday discussion groups at his house. Here students \ncould deliberate and express their opinions on given topics.\n  Dr. Farber has a long list of notable accomplishments and I would \nlike to mention a few of them. He taught government at the University \nof South Dakota from 1935 until 1976. Prior to his retirement, he \nserved as chairman of the USD Department of Government for 38 years. \nDuring his tenure at the university, he was active in many other public \nservice endeavors as well. In 1964, he served as president of the \nMidwest Political Science Association. He also was instrumental in \nestablishing the South Dakota Legislative Research Council [SDLRC], \nserving as its director from 1951 until 1955. To this day, the SDLRC is \nthe principal staff arm of the South Dakota Legislature.\n  Some of Dr. Farber's other achievements include creating the \nGovernment Research Bureau and the Indian Institute, both at USD. He \nadvised former U.S. Senator Karl Mundt, and was inducted as an honorary \nmember into the National Academy of Public Administration.\n  Perhaps Dr. Farber's greatest accomplishment is his uncanny ability \nto motivate students through the vigorous drive he exhibits. He was \nwilling to help students in any way possible. It was through Dr. \nFarber's advice and encouragement that I sought and became a Rhodes \nscholar.\n  As I stated before, the classroom lecture was just one tool Dr. \nFarber used to educate his students. He included students in the \nvarious research and other government-focused projects he conducted. \nStudents were invited to accompany him on trips across the country and \noverseas. Dr. Farber often served on a placement officer, helping \nstudents secure internships in South Dakota, Washington, DC, and \nwherever else a student's interests might be directed.\n  Although he officially retired almost 20 years ago, Dr. Farber has \nnot lost interest in the lives and education of students at the \nUniversity of South Dakota. After his 1976 retirement, an internship \nand travel fund was established in his name. Through private donations \nfrom former students and colleagues, Dr. Farber uses the fund to \n\n[[Page S 9345]]\n\npay for travel and other expenses incurred when students travel to \ninternships and attend political science functions. In fact, this past \nMay, Dr. Farber accompanied 15 students to Washington, DC, for an \nannual study tour, and once again I had the privilege to meet with him.\n  As long as I will know Bill Farber, I will forever remember the \ninspiration he has given me and so many others. I dare say the world is \na better place because of the advice and inspiration thousands of \nstudents have received from Dr. Farber. Certainly, it would be even \nbetter if all could benefit from his wisdom.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I would like to convey the attitude Bill \nFarber has taken toward his career by his quote from a Sioux City \nJournal article. He stated, ``I am the luckiest person alive to have \nbeen able to do what I love to do--I love to read, I love to write, I \nlove to talk. A professor does all this.''\n  I sincerely hope all Americans will have a safe and happy Fourth of \nJuly, especially Bill Farber on his 85th birthday. My wife Harriet \njoins me in wishing him many more.\n                                Exhibit\n\n              [From the Sioux City Journal, June 20, 1995]\n\n                    Retired Professor Still Serving\n\n                        (By Beverly G. Merrick)\n\n       Vermillion, S.D.--William O. Farber apparently decided \n     there could be no better life for a Yankee Doodle Dandy born \n     on the Fourth of July than to be a political science \n     professor in public administration.\n       At 84, he has served the University of South Dakota longer \n     than anyone. He has taught about and served in local, state \n     and national government since 1935, when the Phi Beta Kappa \n     from Geneseo, Ill., arrived on campus with a newly minted \n     doctorate.\n       The professor emeritus officially clocked off the job in \n     1976, just days short of his 66th birthday. However, students \n     past and present continue to make pilgrimages to Farber \n     House, across the street from the office of the university \n     president, in search of knowledge and advice.\n       The octogenarian says he has had the most fortunate of \n     lives as a teacher: ``I am the luckiest person alive to have \n     been able to do what I love to do--I love to read, I love to \n     write, I love to talk. A professor does all this.''\n       He has worked with Regents, college presidents, faculty and \n     faculty organizations. He has served in many university \n     service posts, including being the chairman of the planning \n     committee of the I.D. Weeks Library. He also played a key \n     role in establishing the Indian Institute on campus.\n       Farber says he has learned the lessons longevity brings, \n     especially having a positive outlook and believing in \n     possibilities.\n       ``If you survive until your 80s, people will forgive you \n     for just about anything,'' he says. ``But I am getting pretty \n     close to the edge of the cliff and wonder when I am going to \n     go over.''\n\n\n                      he serves in variety of ways\n\n       From 1969 to 1976, Farber served on the state's \n     Constitutional Revision Commission, in which 17 articles were \n     revamped and seven were passed by the Legislature.\n       He calls South Dakota a place of reluctant change, \n     primarily because of great distances to travel in a land with \n     a low-density population.\n       Karl Mundt, a former United States senator from South \n     Dakota, used Farber as a consultant on government projects \n     until the end of his career in public service in 1972.\n       In the early 1940s, he was the state pricing administrator \n     for the Office of Price Information, but he was drafted into \n     the Air Corps shortly after that.\n       As for his views on government, he likes home rule. Through \n     working on a local government study commission, he came to \n     believe that small governmental units could operate more \n     efficiently and effectively by simplifying structures and \n     unifying efforts among town, township and county.\n       One of his disappointments was that the populace could not \n     be convinced, he says.\n       ``This effort would have resulted in fewer and larger units \n     of government,'' he says, ``But how does one convince people \n     less is more?''\n       Speaking again of government, Farber says an understanding \n     of history is one of the differences between managers and \n     true leaders.\n       ``Can a manager lead? We could be raising a generation of \n     managers when we need leadership to guide us through a time \n     of uncertainty,'' the professor says.\n       Farber says that today there are more challenges to public \n     administration than there ever have been because of new \n     technology.\n       ``The political, social and environmental problems are at \n     once local and global, and the solutions need to be \n     interdisciplinary,'' he says.\n\n\n                            Travel important\n\n       Farber says he has done as much as he can to encourage \n     students to travel. The Farber Fund for student travel and \n     internships was established at his retirement dinner.\n       ``I think it important for students to travel and see the \n     world, to broaden one's education by extending one's \n     horizons,'' he says.\n       In the late 1950s, Farber went to Korea with a USD group, \n     where he studied the 23 levels of bureaucracy of the \n     governmental system.\n       ``Koreans value history,'' he says. ``While in Korea, I \n     obtained a new perspective on everything that involved \n     values.''\n       He also viewed programs in public administration in \n     Vietnam, Japan, Thailand and the Philippines. In Saigon, he \n     was entertained at a country club and visited a cathedral.\n       ``It just breaks your heart to know what came later,'' he \n     says.\n       At the end of the study tour, he says, ``At the least, we \n     Americans ought to be very humble. Travel gives one the sense \n     that the world is not the same it has always been. Travel \n     helps one understand what we are to each other on a \n     fundamental level. Travel helps us discover how one can make \n     a difference.''\n       Farber visited Cuba at a time when Fidel Castro was \n     beginning to come into power. While there, Farber was \n     arrested by a soldier with Castro sympathies when he took a \n     picture at a church in Havana. The magistrate, who was \n     appointed under the old system, took him aside and told him \n     to protest mightily. Farber says that was not difficult for \n     him to do given\n      the prospect of a jail term.\n       ``The magistrate took the film, but left me the Nikon, \n     which satisfied the soldier,'' Farber says.\n       He also has a personally autographed photo of former \n     Yugoslavian President Tito.\n       In 1974, Farber traveled with the Rev. Robert Schuller to \n     the Holy Land. The trip helped him understand the Bible as a \n     historical document.\n       In 1978, he went to China, where auto theft was virtually \n     non-existent because only government officials were allowed \n     vehicles.\n       ``If someone stole a bicycle, the perpetrator had to meet \n     with neighbors and talk about how bad it was,'' he says. \n     ``Communities tried to work out problems at the local level . \n     . .''\n       He once took a tour of the Nile River, and he saw the \n     Pyramids in Egypt.\n\n\n                            he stays active\n\n       Farber says he was brought up to be tolerant, but that the \n     idea of tolerance is not a uniform standard: ``What is right \n     for Bill Farber to do is not what is right for everyone else \n     to do.''\n       He once asked writer Arnold Toynbee how he could explain \n     the Holocaust in that one of the most civilized of cultures \n     carried out one of the most barbaric acts ever.\n       ``Toynbee says that you must always remember there is a \n     thin veneer on civilization and when it is scratched the man \n     becomes the brute,'' Farber says.\n       He is in his 40th year with the Vermillion's Lion's Club. \n     He is one of the oldest members of the American Associaton of \n     Political Science, having joined the organization in 1939. \n     For five years he served as president of the Midwest \n     Political Science Society.\n       On May 8, 1975, he was honored at a USD retirement dinner \n     called ``The Wide, Wide World of Farber.'' His many students \n     noted his accomplishments.\n       Nearly a score of years has passed since then, yet Farber \n     is still going strong. Recently, he was off to Washington, \n     D.C., with two faculty members to show 18 students government \n     close up.\n       ``Growing old is like a passing dream,'' he says. ``It \n     comes upon us so quickly, the winter of our years. The change \n     is so gradual that the better things become the best things \n     of life. We live on. We are not old.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9344-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mrs. Bickle was recently honored as the myth buster of the \nyear by the Research, Education, and Endowment Foundation of the \nMontana Stockgrowers Association.\n  Mr. President you might ask, ``what is a myth buster?'' Well Mr. \nPresident, a myth buster is a person, a volunteer, who promotes the \nbeef industry in Montana. During this time, a year in which Congress \nmust write a new farm bill, thank goodness we have people out there who \nnot only know and understand agriculture, but are willing to educate \nothers about its importance. I should mention however, that this is \nSheila's second job. Sheila and her husband Bill raise cattle near \nIsmay, MT.\n  Mrs. Bickle was instrumental in getting a science video produced with \nbeef checkoff dollars into the fall catalog of CTN educational TV \nnetwork, used by 106 San Francisco Bay area schools.\n  Mrs. Bickle also was the motivation behind a recent project by the \nMontana Cattle Women designed to educate third graders about beef \nnutrition.\n  Every time we educate our urban citizens about agriculture, we have \nhelped bring the country closer together. When a person volunteers to \nhelp educate our children, like Sheila, our country and society is \nbetter for it.\n  Thank you Shelia, thank you for being a myth buster, for helping \npromote agriculture in our home State and in one of our largest urban \nareas.

Mr. President, Donna Sitz and her adult children--son Bob \nand his wife Jennipher, son Jim, and daughter Sherrie and her husband \nMark Stokman were recognized for enhancing the natural resources and \ncontributing to wildlife diversity on their ranch. Their registered \nAngus seedstock operation in the Madison Valley of southwestern Montana \nis nationally recognized for excellent cattle. And now they've been \nrecognized for their stewardship as well. The Montana Stockgrowers just \nawarded the Sitz family their Montana Environmental Stewardship Award.\n  Among the many projects they completed to enhance the Montana \nenvironment include:\n  They planted thousands of trees along streambanks to help stabilize \nriparian areas.\n  They obtained a grant from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, \nand Parks to enhance spawning habitat for trout on their private land. \nThe project has made significant improvements in three major spawning \nareas, increasing fish numbers and enhancing water quality.\n  They have improved the vegetation of their grazing lands by using a \nrest rotation grazing system, intensive grazing, controlled burns, and \nweed spraying.\n  It's always an honor for me to recognize Montanans who stand for \neverything we all should be doing, working hard and doing all you can \nto improve your local environment. One of the well known environmental \nslogans states ``we should think globally and act locally''. The Sitz \nfamily is doing exactly that, improving their local water quality and \nwildlife habitat, and by their actions they improve not only their \nranch but the environment under Montana's big sky. What a wonderful \nexample for all of our ranchers and farmers all across the Nation.\n  Donna Sitz credited her late husband Bob Sitz, who was tragically \nkilled in a tractor accident in 1989 for the family's commitment to \nstewardship. Donna said, ``Bob was a strong conservationist. I want the \nkids to be like their father, to run an honest outfit, and to leave \nthings better than they found them.'' But let's also credit Donna for \ncarrying on her husband's legacy, saving the ranch, and obviously \nraising an outstanding family to carry on.\n  I congratulate Donna and her family, for being recognized for this \nstewardship award. And I thank them for the shinning example they set \nfor all of us to follow.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9346-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO IRVINE CRAIG PORTER, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to my friend Irvine \nCraig Porter, Jr., a longtime Alabama attorney and community leader who \npassed away recently.\n  Irvine was active in numerous professional and civic organizations \nthroughout his life. He was a member of the Birmingham, AL, and \nAmerican Bar Associations and was the city attorney for Homewood and \nIrondale, both Birmingham suburbs, for many years. He was secretary, \ntreasurer, and general counsel for The Club; a member and chancellor of \nAll Saints' Episcopal Church; and the chaplain of the Homewood Lions \nClub.\n  Irvine was awarded the Selective Service Medal in 1946, the Alabama \nCommendation Medal in 1968, and the Army's Distinguished Rifleman Badge \nin 1962. He also served as president of the University of Alabama \nNational Alumni Association and of the board of directors of the \ndowntown YMCA.\n  Irvine Porter was born on May 22, 1910 in Florence, AL. He attended \nthe public schools in Florence and Birmingham, graduating from Phillips \nHigh School in 1926, Florence State Teachers' College--now the \nUniversity of North Alabama--in 1928, and the University of Alabama \nSchool of Law in 1932.\n  Irvine was a thoughtful and honest adviser during the many years I \nhad the pleasure of knowing him. He had a keen legal mind, and always \nseemed to have his finger on the pulse of the people and what they were \nthinking.

Mr. President, this debate is about priorities, fairness, \nand choices, and I am talking about the debate on the budget that we \nare on today. I guess we will be voting on it a little bit later this \nafternoon.\n  It is not just about numbers. This debate is about, really, the \nchoices we will make as a society, how we deal with the fundamental \nissue of fairness, being fair to people in our country, and on what we \nwill choose to spend the tax dollars that we collect from our hard-\nworking citizens. We all agree on the bottom line. We agree on \nbalancing the budget and bringing deficit down. I voted that way. But, \nunfortunately, how we get there is really what we are debating.\n  If you take a look at the national budget, what you see are pages and \npages of numbers, numbers of statistics. But on every page and behind \nevery number there are real people, there is a real individual \nsomeplace. So this budget debate is not just about numbers, it is \nabout, as I said, choices and priorities, and about people and how \npeople are going to be affected in their daily lives in this country.\n  All through this year I have listened to people in meetings I have \nheld across my State. Iowans have shared their thoughts and concerns \nabout the budget. Everywhere I have gone I have heard the same message: \nYes, we want to balance the budget; yes, we want to bring the deficit \ndown; but let us do it responsibly and let us be fair about the way we \ndo it. So the question we have \n\n[[Page S 9347]]\n\nto ask ourselves is how fair and how responsible is this budget? How \nfair or responsible is it to cut and gut the investments that we have \nmade in education?\n  The previous speaker, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, I think laid \nit out very well. What will we say? What will our children and \ngrandchildren say 50 years from now--he said 100, I do not think it \nwill even be that long; 25 to 50 years from now--when we find an ill-\neducated society; when we find we cannot compete in the world \nmarketplace because we just did not invest in education in this \ncountry?\n  As a Nation, how can we deal with the growing number of children who \nwill grow up to be burdens on our society instead of being productive \ntaxpaying citizens? How can we deal with that when, No. 1, we are going \nto eliminate the in-school interest subsidy?\n  What this is, Mr. President, is we are levying a tax. There is a new \ntax in this budget on college students. And it is going to amount to \n$3,000 or more on about 4 million college students and their families. \nIt is an additional tax burden they are going to pay that they do not \nhave to pay right now. One million college students can lose their \ncollege aid or have it drastically reduced because of cuts in Pell \ngrants. We are going to cut as much as half a million preschoolers from \nthe Head Start Program. We are going to gut the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools Program.\n  Again, let me talk a little more about this tax we are levying on \nstudents. Some people say, ``Why should we, as taxpayers, support the \nsons and daughters of sometimes middle-income wage earners in this \ncountry to go to college? After all, when a young person goes to \ncollege that person stands to gain and make more money during his or \nher lifetime, so why should we foot the bill?''\n  I think to look at it that way is to look at it very narrowly, too \nnarrowly. The more young people who get through college and become \nbetter educated, the better off we are as an entire society. So we have \nan interest in education. We are better off if we fund education for \nyoung people. We had the GI bill after World War II; this was not even \nloan money. We just gave money to young people to go to college. We did \nnot even ask them to pay it back. But they paid it back a thousand fold \nover in increased earnings, increased taxes, and increased productivity \nfor our entire Nation. So it is a national responsibility that we \nensure that our young people have affordable quality education.\n  How responsible or fair is it to break our contract with seniors and \nimpose the largest cuts in Medicare and Medicaid in history, socking \nseniors with perhaps as much as $900 more every year in out-of-pocket \ncosts, and burdening families who are struggling to take care of their \nailing parents? The original Senate budget resolution cut Medicare by \n$256 billion. This conference goes from bad to worse by slashing \nMedicare by $270 billion.\n  Just think about that, we are slashing Medicare $270 billion, \naffecting one of the most vulnerable parts of our society, seniors, the \nelderly. How responsible or fair is it to these seniors? To students? \nTo families? While we lavish tax cuts on a privileged few, the upper 1 \npercent of our income earners?\n And we refuse to even consider the swamp of waste in the Pentagon. \nThis budget actually increases military spending by $36 billion in just \nthe first 4 years by $7 billion next year alone. We are giving money to \nthe Pentagon for programs which even the Pentagon does not want. The \nPentagon does not want the B-2 bomber, but we are going to say, ``You \nhave to take more; you have to have more.'' So we are throwing money at \nthe Pentagon when they do not even need it.\n\n  Mr. President, I have used this chart a few times in the past. I want \nto refer to it again today in the budget debate to give you a graphic \nillustration of what we are talking about in defense spending. Right \nnow the United States is spending about $206 billion for the Pentagon. \nI have along the bottom here all of our potential enemies in the world. \nThere is Russia, China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and \nCuba. You add them all up. The total they spend is about $54 billion \nnext year on their defense, their military spending. So right now we \nare spending about five times more in this country than all of our \npotential enemies put together.\n  But then when you add the United States and our allies together, we \nare spending over $500 billion, a half a trillion dollars. That is \nalmost 10 times more than what our potential enemies are spending. Yet \nwe are being told that we have to spend more; this is not enough; we \nhave to increase Defense Department spending next year.\n  So is it fair, or is it responsible when we throw money at the \nPentagon to buy items that they do not even want? Yet, we take food \naway from hungry people, we increase taxes on our college students and \nmake them pay for their college education, we cut down on Medicare and \nhealth care for the elderly, we cut Medicaid and health care for the \npoorest of our citizens? Is this fair? Of course, it is not fair. It is \nnot fair at all.\n  So in simply human terms, what does the budget say? Forget about the \nnumbers. What does it say? It says if you are a part of the privileged \nfew, this is your lucky day. It is going to be Christmas in June. If \nyou are in the top 1 percent of the income earners, you are going to \nstuff your stocking with a brandnew credit card with thousands of \ndollars of new credit.\n  But guess what? You do not have to worry about paying, this budget \nresolution says. We will send that bill to the students. We will sock \nthem with another $3,000 for their college education. We will send the \nbill to the seniors who depend on Medicare. They are going to pay \nanother $900 per year. They will pay the bill. We will send the bill to \nthe family farmers and the working families making the minimum wage. \nThey will pay the bill.\n  This budget, in simple human terms, says that one child in Waterloo, \nIA, who needs a Head Start Program will be forced to pay more through \nbudget cuts than the entire Pentagon. One senior living in Dubuque, IA, \non a fixed income, one family farmer struggling in Albia to get by this \nyear, one student in Storm Lake working their way through college, one \nfamily in Mason City who has lifted themselves up from welfare to work, \neach one of those will be forced to pay more for deficit reduction than \nthe entire Pentagon. Talk to me about fairness and responsibility. That \nis what is lacking in this budget--fairness and responsibility. What \nhappened to the notion of shared sacrifice, responsibility, and \nfairness?\n  Mr. President, this budget is about priorities and choices. This \nbudget chooses the Pentagon over hungry kids. It chooses tax cuts for \nthe top 1 percent of wage earners over health care for seniors. It does \nnot close the corporate tax loopholes, but it does tighten the family \nbudget for those trying to pay for a college education.\n  Some call this resolution a compromise. They are right about that. It \ncompromises the promise of good, reliable health care for our seniors. \nIt compromises the opportunity for middle-income families to afford a \ncollege education. It compromises our commitment to the family farmers \nwho feed the world.\n  Yes, we need to balance the budget for the good of our Nation and our \nfuture. But, plain and simple, this is not the way to do it. Let us \nscrap this plan and do what the American people want us to do; that is, \nwork together not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as concerned \nAmericans. That is what we are going to do with the rescissions bill. \nThe Senate passed it 99-0. It went too far to one side in conference. \nNow it has been reworked. I think we have an excellent chance of \npassing it.\n  So now let us craft a responsible budget, a fair budget that does not \ntax seniors, students, and families. Let us craft a responsible budget \nthat recognizes that the cold war is over. We can do it if we work \ntogether, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as responsible \nlegislators adhering to the concepts of justice and fairness and \nequality for our people. So we can do it. We ought to surprise the \nAmerican people and do it right for once.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is no accident that the United States \ntoday has the cleanest air and water we have had in decades, perhaps \nthe cleanest in the world. We have the safest and most affordable food \nand the safest, most advanced, and most effective drugs. American \nworkplaces are safer than they have ever been before. Our national \nproductivity is the envy of the world. In short, our regulatory system \nis achieving the goals we have set. There is no justification to scrap \nit or trash it.\n  We can improve the current system, especially to streamline it, and \nreduce redtape, bureaucracy and delays. But I will not support a bill \nthat carves gaping loopholes in the current system.\n  We all know what is going on here. The extremist Republican majority \nin Congress has given the keys of the store to profit-sharing business \nlobbyists and an unholly collection of special interest groups.\n  We know that many well-heeled enterprises have no use for Government \nregulations that cramp their profits or protect the public interest. \nThere is no love lost for regulations that make them clean up pollution \nthey cause, or that prohibit them from marketing dangerous or unhealthy \nproducts, or that make them spend part of their profits to protect the \nhealth and safety of their workers.\n  Are the costs of this kind of regulation way out of line? Have we \nspent too much safeguarding health and safety and protecting the \nenvironment? On the whole, we have not. We heard estimates yesterday \nabout the cost of regulations. But we heard nothing about the benefits \nof those regulations.\n  It is no surprise or wonder that those who care about the environment \nand public health and public interest are deeply concerned about this \nbill. We can only hope that the cost-benefit analyses mandated by the \nbill will be more balanced than our debate about the costs and benefits \nof regulation. If the Congress does not protect the public interest, \nwho will?\n  In fact, there is good evidence that the estimates cited yesterday \nare greatly exaggerated. In the first place, about half of the entire \nregulatory burden comes from a single agency--the Internal Revenue \nService--which is not even covered by the bill.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, and environmental regulations \ngenerally, are said to be the next biggest culprit. But the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics has been surveying businesses about the causes of \ntheir layoffs for years, and the businesses themselves attribute only \none-tenth of one percent of their layoffs to the burdens of \nenvironmental laws and regulations. If environmental regulations caused \nthe kind of impacts that the supporters of this bill claim, we would \nexpect the businesses themselves to be aware of them.\n  We have all heard stories of regulatory excesses, and a small number \nof them are true. There have been regulators who have overreached and \nmade unjustifiable decisions, such as the inspector who cited a company \nfor a violation when employees violated OSHA standards to rescue the \nvictim of a trench cave-in.\n  But honest, accurate examples of regulatory excess are relatively \nrare, considering the size and complexity of the economy. We hear the \nsame handful of anecdotal examples over and over again. But we hear \nless about the benefits of our regulatory system, which are taken for \ngranted and are undeniable. We have never had a Chernobyl or a Bhopal \nor a thalidomide tragedy in the United States. We should be proud of \nthat record--and cautious about making changes that could make \ntragedies more likely.\n  The reckless practices that led to dangerous workplaces, to American \nrivers catching fire, and to the near-extinction of the bald eagle have \ngiven way over the past quarter century to rules which help ensure that \ntoday's children can look forward to safe and healthy places to work \nand a clean environment that reflects the best of our heritage. We need \nto keep these priorities in mind and in perspective as we consider this \nbill.\n  We also need to remember that we are not writing on a clean slate. \nCongress and the President have recently made important changes to \nimprove the regulatory process, and other sensible changes are on the \nway. In March, President Clinton signed the Unfunded Mandates Act, \nwhich requires all rules that have an impact on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more to have a cost-benefit analysis and a risk assessment. \nThe President's executive order on regulation, signed last year, has \nsimilar requirements.\n  The Senate has passed the Nickles-Reid bill, which requires every \nregulation to lay over for 45 days before becoming effective, in order \nto allow Congress to block regulations that do not make sense or which \nimpose excessive costs. We need that kind of oversight of the \nregulatory process, and it is being put in place and should be given a \nchance to work.\n  Unfortunately, much of the pending bill is overkill. The Dole-\nJohnston draft is an improvement over the Judiciary Committee bill. But \nwithout additional, significant changes, it could severely undermine \nthe health of large numbers of American families, leave major areas of \nthe environment ravaged by pollution, and threaten the health and \nsafety on the job of millions of American workers. In too many ways, \nthe Dole-Johnston is still, like the bill reported from the Judiciary \nCommittee, a blueprint to paralyze the regulatory process.\n  Rulemakings under the Occupational Safety and Health Act would have \nmore than 20 new steps, making an already slow process much slower. \nOSHA's 5-year-long rulemaking on cadmium, which causes cancer and \nkidney disease, would have become a 10-year ordeal.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has proposed a rule requiring label \nwarning statements and single-dose packaging on certain dietary iron \nsupplements, which cause about 10,000 poisonings of children a year. \nIron tablet overdoses can cause intestinal bleeding, shock, coma, \nseizures, and death in children. Because of the bill's retroactive \neffective date, FDA will have to redo its risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis to meet the rigid, one-size-fits-all requirements of \nthe bill. This will create unnecessary costs, and delay a rule that \nwill save children's lives and prevent $250 million a \n\n[[Page S 9349]]\n\nyear in medical, litigation, and other costs.\n  The State of Illinois had a very negative experience with this kind \nof one-size-fits-all regulatory reform. The Illinois law's mandated \ncost-benefit analyses did nothing to improve the quality of regulation. \nBut according to a story in the Chicago Tribune, the requirement added \nas much as 42 months of delay to every rule. In 1992, after 14 years of \nexperience, Illinois repealed the law.\n  The Wall Street Journal, which supports regulatory reform, admitted \nin one of its editorials that the bill is designed to ensnare the \nbureaucrats in redtape. But creating redtape is not the answer to any \nregulatory problems the American people want solved. It will not in any \nway expedite the approval of needed drugs and medical devices. It will \nnot focus regulation on the worst problems, and it will not allow \nagencies to rely on common sense. In fact, it will do just the \nopposite.\n  By creating multiple, overlapping, and uncontrollable petition \nprocedures to review all existing regulations, the Dole-Johnston bill \nwill tie up so many resources that agencies will be forced to abandon \ntheir examination of new issues, new problems and new solutions. That \nis the clear and obvious purpose of the petition process, and it is \nunacceptable.\n  Without substantial additional budgets and personnel, agencies like \nthe FDA will be forced to shift resources, and will not have enough \npeople to work on approving new products. The Federal work force has \nbeen cut by 75,000 workers, and another 125,000 will be cut in the near \nfuture. Yet the Dole-Johnston bill piles on new procedural requirements \nthat will cost the agencies hundreds of millions of dollars a year and \nrequire more staff, not less.\n  Compounding the problem, the Dole-Johnston bill literally gives every \nregulated business the right to compel every agency to examine each \nseparate regulation and decide whether each individual business should \nbe exempted from it. This is a radical, extremist proposal that \nfundamentally undermines the rule of law. A more honest approach would \nbe to simply repeal the workplace safety, environmental, and public \nhealth laws. The Dole-Johnston bill repeals them indirectly through a \nkind of stealth process.\n  A sausage maker, for example, who decided he no longer wanted to \ncomply with food safety laws and worker safety laws could petition the \nFDA and OSHA for exemptions from every applicable regulation. The \nagencies would be compelled to respond in writing to each factual and \nlegal claim within 180 days, although the bill provides no standard for \nthe decisions they would have to make.\n  The agencies would be totally overwhelmed if just one-tenth of one \npercent of the 6 million regulated businesses petitioned for exemption \nfrom a single regulation, let alone from multiple regulations. Because \na denial of the petition would be immediately reviewable by the courts, \nthe agencies would be forced into an explosion of litigation--or else \ngrant the petitions.\n  In these and other ways, the bill is a veritable gold mine for \nlawyers and lobbyists. On issues ranging from securities law, to \nproduct liability, to medical malpractice, the effort in Congress has \nbeen to reduce litigation in our society, not encourage it. But now, \nwhen big business is the plaintiff, the authors of this bill want to \nwiden the courthouse door.\n  This bill has many other problems. It would make it extremely \ndifficult to protect crops from imported pests, since extensive, peer-\nreviewed risk analyses would have to be performed before quarantine \norders could be issued.\n  Environmental regulations such as those put in place under the Clean \nAir Act of 1990, which are removing more than a billion pounds of toxic \nemissions from the air each year, would be subject to reopening by any \nregulated business. EPA could be forced to redo its cost-benefit \nanalysis of these enormously successful regulations in order to examine \nsuch foolish alterations as making the standards voluntary.\n  Regulations on veterans benefits suffering from gulf war syndrome \nwould be delayed until cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments could \nbe completed. Drug-testing regulations for truck drivers and \ncongressionally-mandated standards for mammograms would be delayed. FAA \nair-worthiness and air safety rules would be subjected to cost-benefit \ntests and the additional paperwork of risk assessments and peer \nreviews.\n  Finally, the bill contains a provision that as a practical matter \nrepeals the Delaney clause, the provision in the Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act that protects the American people from cancer-causing \npesticides and additives in food. I agree that the 37 year-old Delaney \nclause should be modernized in light of modern scientific knowledge \nabout the risks of chemicals. But the sweeping and extremist approach \nin this bill poses a grave threat to all Americans, especially children \nwhose diet and metabolism render them especially vulnerable to cancer-\ncausing chemicals in their food.\n  Our water and air are not too clean. Our workplaces are not too \nhealthy. Our air traffic and highway systems are not too safe. Our \nchildren are not too protected from dangerous products. This bill will \ndelay further progress and undo much of the progress we have made. \nWithout major changes, I cannot support it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9348-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since February, I have repeatedly voiced \nmy concern over the Clinton administration's bailout of Mexico. Today, \nI am releasing a comprehensive report and chronology of the Mexican \neconomic crisis.\n  Since January, the Senate Banking Committee has held three hearings \nto examine this crisis. This report and chronology is based on \ntestimony from these hearings and from information contained in \nnumerous internal administration documents. It brings together for the \nfirst time a full description of the United States Government's \ninternal and external communications regarding Mexico.\n  My office will have available the complete report and chronology. We \ncleared the releases and declassification of many internal documents \nfor use in this report. It does not include or refer to any classified \ndocuments.\n\n[[Page S 9350]]\n\n  It does include the background of the Mexican economic crisis; the \nadministration's monitoring of the crisis; the contradictions between \nthe administration's rosy public statements about Mexico during 1994 \nand the private, far more negative, views the administration and \nofficials had; the failure of the administration taxpayer-funded \nbailout; and we conclude that the administration should not--the \nadministration should not--send another $10 billion of taxpayers' money \nto Mexico.\n  The report and chronology culminates weeks of work and a review of \nhundreds of documents and testimony. I appreciate the cooperation of \nSecretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan in producing the documents used \nto prepare this report and chronology.\n  Mr. President, on February 7, 1995, I spoke in this Chamber about the \neconomic crisis in Mexico. I asked the question: What did the \nadministration know about the situation in Mexico and when did they \nknow it? After reviewing the information, the answer is clear.\n  The administration's own records indicate that key officials, \nincluding Under Secretary Summers, knew about the deteriorated economic \ncondition of Mexico as early as February 1994. Administration \nofficials, however, repeatedly painted a rosy public picture of the \nMexican economy.\n  Again, sadly, this will appear as a pattern of this administration. \nIt has a history of not leveling with the American public. This report \nand the chronology and the administration's own internal documents \nsadly demonstrate that this has taken place over and over and over \nagain.\n  The administration's repeat of public praise of the Mexican economy \nduring 1994 stands in stark contrast to the looming signs of economic \ndisaster reflected in internal administration documents. The underlying \ndocuments demonstrate that the administration was aware that Mexico was \non the road to economic disaster, but the administration did not tell \nthe truth to the American people.\n  That was wrong. The administration did not tell the truth to the \nAmerican economists. And that was wrong. The administration has placed \n$20 billion of American taxpayer dollars at risk to bail out the \nMexican Government. The Mexican Government is using these dollars to \nreward local speculators who bought high-interest-rate short-term \nMexican Government notes or tesobonos. The administration has already \nsent $10 billion to Mexico and beginning on July 1--July 1 we will be \nout of session--the administration will begin to send another $10 \nbillion to Mexico.\n  Now, Mr. President, the administration and the Mexican Government \nofficials repeatedly assured Congress and the American people that the \nsecond $10 billion would not be needed this year. But again, they have \na pattern of saying one thing and doing another, painting one picture \nand then discovering another.\n  The Mexican Government financial plan expressly states, ``The second \n$10 billion of the U.S. Government funds is not''--is not --``intended \nto be used in 1995, but will be available for unforeseen \ncontingencies.''\n  This Senator said a long time ago that you are kidding the people. \nThat $10 billion is gone. The next $10 billion is gone. You will have \nthe same disastrous result. The administration should not sink the \nUnited States and the American taxpayer any deeper into this Mexican \nquagmire. The first $10 billion has not solved the economic crisis. The \nonly people who benefited are speculators. Global speculators, not the \nMexican people, not the Mexican economy. In July and August Mexico \nfaces a payment bubble of more than $6 billion to pay off tesobonos \nthat are coming due. Now, where is that money going to come from? \nGuess. The United States taxpayer. That is where. The U.S. taxpayers' \nmoney to Mexico to pay off, who? Private speculators, private investors \nwho bought high-risk, high-return investments. And now we are going to \npay that off. The United States does not do that for our own citizens. \nWhy should we do this for private speculators who support Mexican \ntesobonos? Mexico's basic economic problems have not been solved. It is \nclear that the administration's bailout has not benefited the Mexican \npeople. The Mexican people are worse off because of the austerity \nmeasures demanded by the administration.\n  Middle-class Mexicans and small business owners have been devastated. \nAnd in the past few months inflation in Mexico has skyrocketed to \nalmost 80 percent. Mortgage interest rates have risen to 75 percent. \nConsumer credit card interest rates increased from 90 percent to 100 \npercent. The peso 6 months after the administration bailout stands at \n6.28 to the dollar, still near record highs. Last month Mexican \ncitizens and business leaders told the Banking Committee that the \nMexican bailout is a failure and that the Mexican economy is in \nshambles. When the Clinton administration first tried to sell the \nMexican bailout to Congress they told us they would commit $40 billion \nin loan guarantees to help Mexico through its short-term liquidity \ncrisis. They reassured Congress that taxpayer funds would not be at \nrisk. After Congress refused to support a bailout, the administration \nthen unilaterally decided to give Mexico $20 billion through the United \nStates exchange stabilization fund, an unprecedented and legally \ndoubtful use of this fund.\n  The problems with the Mexican economy are not new. They are well-\nknown to administration officials. Throughout 1994, as the documents \nand the chronology demonstrate, over and over again, the administration \nofficials were alerted to unmistakable signs of economic distress in \nMexico. Yet throughout the year the same administration officials \ncontinue to issue glowing public statements about the Mexican economic \ncondition and strong support for the Mexican economic policies. The \nrecord is clear. Let me give you a few brief highlights.\n  On March 24, 1994, Under Secretary of Treasury Summers informed that \nthe Mexican Government ``is looking for some comforting Treasury words \nto soothe the press.'' Secretary Bentsen then issued a statement \nsaying: ``We have every confidence that Mexico is on the right economic \npath.'' Mr. President, clearly again, a pattern of the administration \nnot leveling with the American people, not leveling with the Congress.\n  In a news conference that same day President Clinton said, ``Mexico's \ninstitutions are fundamentally strong * * * they have a great future \nand we do not expect any long-term damage.'' Mr. President, clearly the \nstatement is at variance with the facts in the record. Again, a pattern \nof not leveling with the American people.\n  Again on April 26, 1994, Under Secretary Summers said publicly, \n``Mexico is fundamentally sound and has a fundamentally sound \ncurrency.'' Earlier that same day however in an internal memo, the same \nday that he talks about a sound economy, a sound currency, Summers \ninforms Secretary Bensten that the Bank of Mexico had been intervening \nto support the peso and that ``Mexico's dependency on the financing of \nits large account deficit from largely volatile investment remains a \nserious problem.'' Again, a pattern of deception of saying one thing \nwhen the facts are clearly different.\n  Now, how can you come and say that the economy is fundamentally \nsound, publicly, when at the same time you are informing the Secretary \nof the Treasury that there are severe problems? In the fall of 1994 the \nMexican Government policies were the cause of concern among \nadministration officials. In an internal memo on September 27, Under \nSecretary Summers questioned the Mexican Government's decision to \nmaintain a highly overvalued peso. And November 18, 1994, another \nTreasury Department memorandum discusses the weakening of the peso and \nthat Mexicans commitment of their dwindling resources to prop up the \npeso. Nevertheless, on the same day, the United States Ambassador to \nMexico, Jim Jones, told a group of American investors that those \njournalists who were predicting financial problems in Mexico were \nalarmists. Again, a pattern of deception. Just wrong. Just wrong.\n  Despite the administration's obvious internal concerns and knowledge, \non November 21, 1994, Under Secretary Summers said ``Mexicans would \nvery much like for Bentsen to make a statement today.'' Summers told \nthe Secretary that he ``has worked out'' a proposed press statement for \nhim for the \n\n[[Page S 9351]]\n\nGovernment of Mexico. Why were officials of the United States \nGovernment working on public relations for the Mexican Government, and \nI might add, putting out false information, aligning themselves to \nfalse information being circulated?\n  The letter to the Washington Post, my colleagues, Senators Specter \nand Kerrey, advised, ``We believe--based on a reading of United States \nanalysis since last spring, that policymakers were adequately \nforewarned of Mexico's declining financial position and of domestic \npolitical pressures that made it difficult for the Mexican Government \nto take timely action in the economic sphere.''\n  Mr. President, internal administration documents make clear that \nUnder Secretary Summers and other treasury officials were not \nforthcoming to the Congress and the American people. I agree with A.M. \nRosenthal of the New York Times who wrote on April 4, 1995, in a column \nentitled ``Cover-Up Chronology,'' ``Real concern for Mexico would have \nmeant public warnings from Washington as soon as trouble was \ndiscovered. Legitimate confidentiality does not include deceiving the \nworld.''\n  I think that bears repeating: ``Legitimate confidentiality does not \ninclude deceiving the world.'' That is what we have a pattern of, \ndeception.\n  There are vital lessons to be learned from the handling of the \nMexican crisis. The American people and their elected representatives \nwere entitled to the truth about Mexico's precarious and deteriorating \ncondition during 1994. Mr. President, the official reports by the \nMexican Government and the positive public statements made by the \nUnited States administration were completely contradictory to the true \ncondition of Mexico's economy. The American taxpayers should not be \nforced to bear further financial risk. U.S. dollars should not be used \nto bail out private investors who gambled on high-risk, high-return \ninstruments. We should not be sending another $10 billion in American \ntaxpayer dollars based upon a web of half-truths, distortions, and \nconcealments. That is wrong. The American people have a right to be \noutraged that their tax dollars are going to bail out local speculators \nand not improve the plight of the Mexican people.\n Congress should be outraged as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me this opportunity \nto make this report to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9349-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9351-S9352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we now resume consideration of S. 343, the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, and in doing so, I am \nreminded of an ancient story. When Hercules was tested, one of his \ntasks was to slay the Hydra, a nine-headed serpent. Yet, for every head \nof the Hydra that Hercules cut off, two more grew in its place. It \nseems that regulations have become the 20th century Hydra, the only \ndifference being that at least the Hydra was mythical and regulations \nare not.\n  For hard-working, middle-class Americans, trying to cope with \nthousands upon thousands of regulations is indeed a Herculean task. \nToday, a small business person needs a law firm, an accountant and a \ndoctor in order to cope with the regulations and barriers they impose. \nWhy a doctor? First, for the headaches he or she will have trying to \ndecipher all of the gobbledygook, and later for the heart attack when \nthe agency issues citations for violations he or she did not even \nrealize were violations.\n  I recall testimony the Labor Committee received back in 1981 when we \nwere considering legislation to revamp the CETA Program. I remember it \nbecause I was so impressed with the specific numbers cited to \ndemonstrate the regulatory burden of the then Federal program. The \ntestimony from the county job training official in Ohio pointed out \nthat CETA regulations ``cross-referenced 75 other laws, Executive \norders and circulars. The Department of Labor has issued an average of \nover 400 field memoranda, more than 1 per day, including Sundays and \nholidays.''\n  This is not how Government is supposed to work, and it has to stop. \nThe problem is that the bureaucracy is replacing democracy, and it is \nimposing high costs on private citizens and impinging on private rights \nand productivity. This bill remedies that by imposing common sense, \nrational decisionmaking on agencies. When any rational person is trying \nto make a decision, he or she weighs the cost of the action and the \nbenefits that the action will bring. Now that is just simple common \nsense. That is what this bill does.\n  There are some who will say, ``Oh, we are going to do away with clean \nwater and clean air'' and all the other regulations they claim are so \nimportant to all of us, and they are important. No, we are not going to \ndo that. We are just going to make sure there is common sense in these \nregulations, and they have to meet a cost-benefit analysis and some \nrisk-assessment matters as well.\n  I just have to say the Federal bureaucracy in this country does not \nhave common sense, and we are in danger of losing our country. Nobody \never contemplated that the bureaucracy would become the fourth branch \nof Government, but it is now the fourth branch of Government and it may \nbe more powerful than the other three that are constitutionally set \napart.\n  Under current law, when the bureaucracy considers making another \nrule, it often considers only the benefits and not the costs. It comes \nas no surprise that everything looks like a good idea if you have to \nonly look at the benefit side and you do not have to pay for it.\n  I am reminded of the headline in the Wall Street Journal not too long \nago that spoke volumes. It read something like: ``If you're buying, \nI'll have sirloin.'' All this bill seeks to do is to make sure the \nagencies look at the cost side as well. I cannot believe that anyone in \nthis body would find that objectionable.\n  Let me briefly explain how the bill works. The Comprehensive \nRegulatory Reform Act of 1995 is aimed at stopping regulatory abuses \nand curbing excessive costs. The bill embodies the most basic notion of \ndecisionmaking: Justify the costs. That is all the American people ask \nof their Government, that it justify the costs of its actions.\n  Indeed, it is only common sense that when an action would produce \nmore harm than good, it should not be taken. Accordingly, the \ncenterpiece of the bill is the requirement for cost-benefit analysis of \nproposed rules. Right now, agencies are notorious for only looking at \nthe benefits of rules and ignoring the cost to society. This bill \nforces the agencies to put both costs and benefits on the table.\n  This provision is eminently reasonable and sensible. For one thing, \nit applies only to major rules which are defined as those having an \nannual effect on the economy of $50 million or more. In general, the \nagency must set out the costs and benefits and identify the reasonable \nalternatives. The agency then selects the best option in conjunction \nwith requirements in the underlying statute.\n  Significantly, the cost-benefit provisions of this bill work in \nharmony with the particular statutes that the Federal agencies \nimplement. The cost-benefit criteria do not override specific statutory \ncriteria for agency decisionmaking. Instead, they supplement those \ncriteria to fine tune the regulatory process.\n  Complementing the cost-benefit analysis is a risk-assessment \nprovision. This sets out guidelines for how various risks are to be \nevaluated. Right now, agencies sometimes regulate for minuscule risks \nbut at a tremendously great cost to the country. If, for example, we \napplied the same test to driving an automobile as we do to marketing of \nsome food additives, drugs or medical devices, no one would be driving \na car in this country. You could not afford to do it and you would not \nbe able to.\n  Also, agencies sometimes evaluate the risks based on questionable \nscientific techniques. By requiring a risk assessment and by \nestablishing standards for scientific quality, this bill will ensure \nreliable results when agencies \n\n[[Page S 9352]]\n\ndetermine the costs and benefits of regulation. It will also improve \nthe consistency and risk assessment across Federal agencies.\n  In a related vein, the bill modifies the much-criticized Delaney \nclause of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Delaney clause \nrequires that no processed foods, products containing a color additive \nor animal drug may be sold unless they do not contain even trace \namounts of materials that have been demonstrated to cause cancer to \nhumans or animals. That may have sounded good in the abstract, in \nreality it has become a burdensome rule that does not further the \nhealth and safety goals that it was designed to address.\n  Let us take food, for example. Given modern technology, it is \npossible to detect the smallest amount of chemicals in food. When \nDelaney was enacted, it was parts per thousand. Today it is parts per \nquadrillion that we can actually determine. Under the Delaney clause, \nthose materials cannot be included, the smallest amounts of chemicals \nin food, if they are carcinogenic, in any amounts or under any \ncircumstances, even though there is basically no risk in eating the \nfood.\n  The problem is that many materials may be carcinogenic only if given \nin extraordinarily large doses and may be carcinogenic in animals for \nreasons for which there is no comparable reaction in humans. In this \nway, the Delaney clause has irrationally forbidden the inclusion of \neven trace amounts of materials in foods, even when scientists \nunanimously agree that there is absolutely no harm to humans from its \nconsumption.\n  The scientific evidence has shown us the Delaney clause, despite its \nlaudable goals, does not really work in practice. That is why we must \nmodify it in this bill. In addition to the substantive reforms, this \nbill also includes several review provisions to ensure openness and \naccountability in the regulatory process.\n  The congressional review process, for example, provides Congress with \nan ability to stop a proposed rule if it disapproves of that rule. This \ngives Congress the opportunity to examine those rules before they take \neffect and do the harm. If within 60 days of the rule's adoption both \nHouses vote to disapprove the rule, and the President agrees, the rule \nwill not be effective.\n  The effective dates of major rules are also held off for those 60 \ndays during the congressional review period. This provision maintains a \ncongressional role in the regulatory process and adds another guarantee \nthat regulators will be held accountable for their actions.\n In addition, a separate type of review is involved to ensure that \nagencies conduct their own periodic review to fix outdated and \ninsufficient or inefficient regulations.\n\n  Agencies, it seems to me, have an obligation to keep their \nregulations current. Under this provision, agencies would promulgate a \nlist of existing regulations that the agency feels are appropriate for \nreview, along with a schedule for agency review of those regulations, \nover a 10-year period. The agency must apply the cost-benefit analysis \nto the rule and then decide whether to extend, modify, or rescind the \nrule. Any rules in the schedule that are not acted on in accordance \nwith the agency schedule would automatically expire.\n  In addition, the bill includes a petition process, whereby any \ninterested party may seek to get a major rule review. An agency must \ngrant the petition. If the agency finds a reasonable likelihood that \nthe rule would not meet the cost-benefit test to ensure correct \ndecisionmaking, the agency's decision is then subject to judicial \nreview. Through these processes, a petition can be filed to challenge \nan existing rule to ensure that it satisfies the cost-benefit and risk-\nassessment standards.\n  The agency itself also has the duty to ensure that its current rules \nsatisfy those standards. This keeps the agency accountable to the \npublic, gives the American people a role in the process, and ensures \nthat all rules continue to be justified.\n  Finally, accountability of Federal regulators is further guaranteed \nthrough a judicial review. Perhaps the most important provision in the \nbill is the provision permitting judicial review of agency action. By \nallowing courts to enforce the requirements of the bill, the \nbureaucrats will be accountable in court for their actions.\n  Unfortunately, the way things stand today, the bureaucracy is out of \ncontrol. Those who churn out regulations day after day should, just \nlike every other American, be accountable for their actions. Without \nthis important judicial enforcement mechanism, and without the other \nreview provisions, this bill would be a little more than a weak \nstatement of policy. The added review makes this bill a powerful tool \nto reshape the Federal agencies.\n  Now, Mr. President, in spite of everything, there are still those who \noppose this bill and defend inefficient, irrational agency regulations. \nThe opponents of this bill have only one weapon with which to attack, \nand that is fear. I expect that opponents of the bill will lay out a \nlitany of unknown horrors that, according to them, only unbridled \nbureaucracies will somehow be able to handle.\n  These scare tactics are nothing more than that, tactics to derail \nthese needed reforms. They have nothing to do with the reality of the \nbill and everything to do with preserving big Government.\n  The fact is that this bill will only change inefficient regulations \nand require that rules be updated so that they remain efficient. Let me \nbe perfectly clear that this bill will not prevent agencies from \nprotecting Americans from unsafe drugs, unsafe workplaces, polluted air \nand water, or discrimination. It will not prevent agencies from \nresponding to disasters when and where the Government's help is needed. \nRules that truly add to society are completely secure under this bill.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me just say that too much of \nanything, even a good thing, is bad. Federal regulation has reached \nthat point. The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 is the \nresponse to a bureaucracy run wild.\n  It is the response we must make to a bureaucracy that no longer sees \nthe American taxpayer and American business, especially small business, \nas clients to whom Federal agencies should be accountable. It is the \nresponse we need to restore the balance between costs and benefits, \nbetween protection and freedom.\n  Those rules that truly provide a benefit to the country will remain \non the books. This bill does not backdoor repeal a host of other \nstatutes, many of which I voted for, by preventing agencies from \nissuing regulations.\n  But the senseless regulations that create more problems than they \nsolve must either be fixed or scrapped.\n  The neighborhood grocer in south central Los Angeles, the rural Utah \ncounty landowner, the farmer in Kansas, the auto manufacturer in \nDetroit, or the university in Pennsylvania, have all just had it up to \nhere with regulation and with overregulation. All Americans are united \nin their frustration with an unresponsive, inflexible, inefficient and \noverweight Federal bureaucracy.\n  If the 1994 elections told us anything, it was that the American \npeople are fed up. The number and scope of Federal regulations are just \nadditional indications that Government has gotten too darn big.\n  This bill is as direct an answer as we can give to their pleas that \nwe can, in fact, control the Federal Government, not be controlled by \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan, \ncommonsense initiative. I thank my colleague from South Carolina and my \nfriend from Delaware for being patient as I delivered these few \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9351-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9352-S9356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the suggestion has been made on this floor \nearlier today that regulatory reform is primarily a matter of trying to \nsatisfy the needs of special interests. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I think it is fair to say that is recognized on both sides \nof the political aisle.\n  I was pleased to note that the distinguished ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and former chairman, Senator Glenn from \n\n[[Page S 9353]]\n\nOhio, in his opening statement noted that\n\n       . . . when the press writes about what happened on the \n     floor today, they [should] get away from the idea that this \n     is the ultimate in confrontation, which seems to be what the \n     questions lead to when we go out of the Chamber--talking \n     about regulatory reform--because, today, I would hope the \n     message would go out that we are united in the Senate of the \n     United States, Democrat and Republican, on one thing: We need \n     regulatory reform.\n\n  Those words are echoed by the distinguished senior Senator from \nMichigan, who is also a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nin his remarks yesterday on the floor of the Senate. He said:\n\n       Let me commend all those involved in this effort. It is a \n     very complicated effort, and most importantly perhaps, an \n     essential and bipartisan effort.\n\n  He goes on later in his statement to say that:\n\n       We need regulatory reform. We must have cost benefit \n     analysis. We need risk assessment. But we also need to be \n     sure that what we are achieving protects, in a sensible way, \n     the environment and the health and the safety of the people \n     of the United States.\n\n  With that, I can strongly agree. And I would agree with those who \nhave said that our air is cleaner, our water is cleaner and safer, and \nour environment is better because of many of the regulations. But, at \nthe same time, there has been recognition by many that the regulatory \nmaze does not work in the best interests of environmental protection or \ngood government generally.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I stood to speak on behalf of the Dole-\nJohnston compromise. I outlined how this legislation, S. 343, the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, is a real and workable \nsolution to the overbearing Government regulation that threatens \nAmerica's future.\n  I cited the costs of such regulation and the need to restore balance \nto the regulatory process.\n  And I explained that I support this legislation because it will make \nthe Federal Government--our regulatory agencies--more efficient and \neffective in carrying out their responsibilities.\n  The simple fact is, Mr. President, that if we reduce Government waste \nand inefficiency, we ultimately will improve, not hinder, Government \nprograms, including environmental protection efforts. If we reduce the \ncosts of regulation, we have greater resources to do more good than \nbefore.\n  For example, it has been estimated that a reallocation of resources \nto more cost-effective programs could save an additional 60,000 lives \nper year at no additional cost, or the same number of lives we are \ncurrently saving could be saved for $31 billion less. So I think it is \nonly fair to say that there is plenty of room to improve our regulatory \nsystem.\n  I personally could not support an effort to gut environmental \nprotection. But strong reform is something I can support. To say that \nthe benefits of regulation should not justify its costs is to argue for \nirrational and wasteful regulation.\n  Senator Dole's compromise bill broadly defines benefits and costs. It \nis not a black-box approach that reduces everything to dollars and \ncents. This bill allows agencies to consider nonquantifiable benefits \nand costs. And the definition of benefits expressly includes favorable \nenvironmental and social effects. The agencies are given leeway to \nconsider all of the benefits and costs that are relevant to making a \nresponsible regulatory decision.\n  Mr. President, there is another important reason why I support this \nlegislation. I support it because I am concerned that the rising costs \nof regulation are undermining the faith of the American people in \nGovernment; I believe these overbearing costs are, in a very real way, \nundermining support for the environmental movement. Americans treasure \nthe beauty of this country; they value a clean environment.\n  But in last November's elections, the American people also clearly \ndemanded a government that is balanced--a government that is dedicated \nto common sense and workable solutions in achieving environmental \nprotection and economic security. In short, they demanded a government \nthat is efficient and effective.\n  I believe our countrymen are right to demand this fundamental change, \nand all of us involved in the current debate must respond to their \nrequest. We must recognize that we cannot regulate a totally risk-free \nworld or remove every last molecule of pollution.\n  But we can, and should, use our resources wisely to achieve the \ngreatest benefits at the least cost. We can, and should, continue to be \na world leader in environmental protection while still having a healthy \neconomy and a high standard of living.\n  We have reached a point where there is broad and bipartisan support \nfor regulatory reform and the tools to achieve it. In his thoughtful \nbook, ``Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Effective Risk \nRegulation,'' Justice Stephen Breyer analyzes our regulatory system and \nconcludes that it badly prioritizes the health and environmental risks \nwe face.\n  In the June 1993 Carneigie Commission Report, ``Risk and the \nEnvironment: Improving Regulatory Decision Making,'' a distinguished \nand bipartisan panel of experts concluded that the Nation must develop \na more comprehensive and integrated decisionmaking process to set \npriorities and regulate risks.\n  President Clinton's chief spokesperson on regulatory reform, Sally \nKatzen, the Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs, submitted a statement to the Governmental Affairs Committee on \nFebruary 7, 1995, saying:\n\n       Regrettably, the regulatory system that has been built up \n     over the past five decades * * * is subject to serious \n     criticism * * * [on the grounds] that there are too many \n     regulations, that many are excessively burdensome, [and] that \n     many do not ultimately provide the intended benefits.\n\n  My friend, George McGovern, a well-known liberal throughout his \npolitical career, also testified before my committee about the urgency \nof regulatory reform. George recounted his experience as a small \nbusinessman running an inn after he retired from the Senate.\n  He described how a venture as harmless as running an inn was so \nburdened by a multitude of complicated and irrational regulations that \nit failed. he concluded:\n\n       Doubtless most of these regulations that we chafe under \n     have some benefit. They do benefit somebody; either the \n     public or someone benefits from them in some way. But the big \n     question is are those benefits more than equal to the costs \n     and burdens they place on business, especially small \n     businesses.\n\n  Justice Breyer, the Carnegie Commission, the Clinton administration, \nand George McGovern are only a few of the authorities that have \nrecognized the need for regulatory reform. Others include Resources for \nthe Future, the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, the Brookings \nInstitution, the American Enterprise Institute, and other think tanks, \ncommissions, and independent scholars throughout the country.\n  Without significant reform, the costs of regulatory will only \ncontinue to grow. As has already been mentioned on the floor, the total \nannual cost of Federal regulations has been estimated by Prof. Thomas \nHopkins at $560 billion in 1992; it is expected to rise another $100 \nbillion by the year 2000. About 75 percent of that cost increase is due \nto new risk regulations.\n  These rising regulatory costs have a serious impact on America and \nthe quality of life of our families, businesses, and communities. Let \nme give you an example: under the Clean Air Act, the State of Delaware \nwas required to implement an enhanced inspection and maintenance--or I/\nM--program this year.\n  EPA mandated this program, stating that it would result in \nsignificant pollution reductions. However, Delaware environmental \nofficials ran their own data and found that this program would do \nlittle to improve air quality in our State. The small reduction in \npollution would be overshadowed by high costs and consumer \ninconvenience at the auto inspection lanes. Delaware has come up with \nan alternative test that meets the Clean Air Act requirements but is \nmuch less costly.\n  This regulatory reform bill would prevent the EPA from mandating \nburdensome requirements such as the I/M test to the States without \nmaking sure that the benefits justify the costs.\n  The problem is, these costs have not been adequately scrutinized in \nthe past. No doubt one reason for this neglect is that these regulatory \ncosts were not constrained by a budget. The decisions to create new \nregulatory programs typically do not include the kind of serious debate \nabout cost that \n\n[[Page S 9354]]\n\nis required to create new on-budget programs.\n  Another reason why we have neglected regulatory costs is that most \nregulations are imposed directly on businesses and governments. This \ncreates the perception that regulatory programs provide free benefits \nto the public--in contrast to tax-and-spend programs.\n  But the costs of regulations are not simply absorbed by businesses \nand governments. These costs, of course, are passed on to the American \nconsumer, wage earner, and taxpayer in the form of higher prices, \ndiminished wages, increased taxes, or reduced government services. It \nis not just big corporations that are being hurt by red tape and \nbureaucracy; it also is the Federal Government, State, and local \ngovernments, small business, and the American public. As I have said, \nFederal regulations cost the average American household about $6,000 \nper year.\n  Equally important, we never see the factories not built, the products \nnot made, ah entrepreneurial dreams not realized because, as in the \ncase of George McGovern, they were drowned in the sea of regulatory \nprocess. Without a doubt, rising regulatory costs, limited resources, \nand a desire to preserve important protections and benefits all \nnecessitate a smarter, more cost-effective approach to regulation.\n  Early in this session, I emphasized the need to achieve bipartisan \nconsensus on reforming the regulatory process. I congratulate the \nmajority leader for forging that consensus around his bill with \nSenators Bennett Johnston and Howell Heflin.\n  Back in February, when I chaired a series of hearings on regulatory \nreform, Senator Dole came to the first hearing to express his strong \ndesire to restore some common sense to the regulatory process. The \nleader's commitment to that goal has been critical to the consensus \nthat this bill represents. I also want to thank my other colleagues for \ntheir efforts--including Bennett Johnston, Orrin Hatch, Howell Heflin, \nFrank Murkowski, Kit Bond, Don Nickles, and many others for their \nsignificant contributions.\n  The Dole-Johnston compromise bill is aimed at restoring common sense \nto the regulatory process. I share this goal, along with many Members \nof the Senate on both sides of the aisle. Indeed, there have been a \nnumber of recent initiatives in the Senate to reform the regulatory \nprocess. I introduced S. 291, the Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, early \nin this Congress. S. 291 was a good proposal for regulatory reform, and \nwas unanimously endorsed by the 15 members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Senator Murkowski also introduced S. 333, a risk assessment \nbill, that was approved by the Energy Committee.\n  This floor vehicle is an amalgamation of Senator Dole's S. 343, which \nSenator Hatch guided through the Judiciary Committee, with S. 333 and \nS. 291. Indeed, as the author of S. 291, I can tell you that the major \nprovisions of S. 291 are reflected in the Dole compromise bill. These \nprovisions include:\n  Cost-benefit analysis: The benefits of a regulation must justify its \ncosts, unless prohibited by the underlying law authorizing the rule.\n  Market-based mechanisms and performance standards: Flexible, goal-\noriented approach are favored over rigid command-and-control \nregulation.\n  Review of existing rules: Old rules on the books must be reviewed to \nreform or eliminate outdated or irrational regulations.\n  Risk assessment: Agencies must use sound science to measure and \nquantify risks to the environment, health, or safety.\n  Comparative risk analysis: Agencies must set priorities to achieve \nthe greatest overall risk reduction at the least cost.\n  Reform of the Regulatory Flexibility Act: The Regulatory Flexibility \nAct is strengthened to make agencies more sensitive to the impact of \nregulations on small businesses and small governments.\n  Congressional review of rules: Rules will not become effective until \nthey are reviewed by Congress. Congress can veto irrational or \nineffective regulations.\n  Regulatory accounting: The Government must compile the total costs \nand benefits of major rules.\n  Like S. 291, the pending Dole-Johnston amendment has limited judicial \nreview so agency rules will not be invalidated for minor procedural \nmissteps. However, it also improves upon S. 291 by having a more \nfocused cost-benefit test. Regulators must directly set regulatory \nstandards so that the benefits of a rule justify its costs, unless \nprohibited by the law authorizing the rule.\n  This bill does not override existing law. If the underlying statute \ndoes not allow for a regulation whose benefits justify its costs, the \nDole-Johnston compromise merely asks the regulator to select the least-\ncost option among the alternatives allowed by the underlying statute.\n  This should not be a radical idea. I do not believe that the American \npeople think it is radical to ask that the benefits of regulations \njustify their costs.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Dole-\nJohnston compromise to put common sense back into our regulatory \nprocess. Our goal in crafting reform should be to strike a balance that \nis strong but workable. We should keep that goal in mind as the final \nvote approaches. The floor vehicle may not be perfect, but it is a \ncrucial step forward. I congratulate all those who have played a \nbipartisan role on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who seeks recognition? The \nSenator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham].\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to urge my colleagues to seize the \nhistoric opportunity we now have to reform the regulatory process. In \nmy judgment, we can and must reform this process so that we may reduce \nthe regulatory burden on American businesses and consumers.\n  Certainly, we can all agree that some regulation is needed to protect \nhuman health and safety and preserve the environment. But all too often \nthe cost of regulation far exceeds the benefits. Too many regulations \nimpose huge costs on our economy and people while providing little if \nany benefit.\n  Excessive regulation constitutes a hidden tax on America. It adds to \nthe price of everything from paint to potato chips and, by increasing \ncosts for our State and local governments, ends up raising direct taxes \nas well.\n  Mr. President, the tide of regulation in this country is high and it \nis rising. If left unchecked, it threatens to drown our economy in a \nsea of red tape.\n  Consider the following:\n  First, excessive regulation imposes an enormous burden on our \neconomy.\n  A recent GAO analysis of existing academic literature found that \nregulation in 1994 cost $647 billion. According to Wayne Crews, of the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute:\n\n       Looked at differently, that is more than the entire \n     economic output of Canada or more than the combined GNP's of \n     Australia and Mexico.\n\n  Or, put another way, an amount greater than all U.S. pretax corporate \nprofits combined, which were $456.2 billion in 1993.\n  In other words, the cost of regulation in 1994 was estimated to be \nmore than all of the corporate profits of every corporation of this \ncountry. Here on the floor of the Senate, we often hear talk about \ncorporate profit taking, corporate profiteers, and so on. I think this \nputs in perspective how costly regulations have become in our country.\n  The second point that needs to be made is the size of Government \nbureaucracy has increased to record levels under the current \nadministration. According to the Center for the Study of Americans \nBusiness, the number of bureaucrats devoted to implementing regulations \nwas 124,648 in 1995, an all-time record. The center has also calculated \nthat the amount of Government spending on regulatory programs was $11.9 \nbillion, the highest amount ever spent to run the regulatory apparatus.\n  Third, the number of pages in the Federal Register, the document in \nwhich all new regulations are published, was 64,914 in 1994, the \nhighest since 1980.\n  Fourth, and perhaps most disturbing of all, the cost of Government \nregulation per American family is now $6,457 a year. Combined with the \ncost of taxes per household, the total cost of Government per family \ntoday is almost $20,000.\n \n[[Page S 9355]]\n\n  Now, according to the Americans for Tax Reform, in 1994 the average \nAmerican had to work full time until July 10 to pay his or her share in \nthe combined cost of Government taxes and regulations, a week longer \nthan was the case in 1990. And that is not the only issue. Like any \nother tax, regulations raise the cost of consumer goods and services, \nlower wages, and increase unemployment. Regulations dampen investment \nand reduce technological innovation.\n  But the facts and theory do not tell the entire story. So let me \nshare with you a few stories from my State of Michigan that illustrate \nthe problem with Washington's excessive and overreaching regulatory \nsystem. Take, for example, the impact of the EPA's recent regulations \ngoverning the use and removal of lead-based paint on bridges. Because \nof this regulation, the toll on cars to cross the Mackinac Bridge in \nthe Upper Peninsula of Michigan--and this connects the Upper and Lower \nPeninsula--is currently $1.50, one-third more than it would otherwise \nbe.\n  There is a story behind this as told by Burton Fulsom of the Mackinac \nCenter for Public Policy:\n\n       For nearly 30 years after the Mackinac Bridge was completed \n     in 1957, it was painted with a lead-based paint. Every 9 \n     years or so, it was sandblasted and repainted. . . .To comply \n     [with the EPA's paint regulation], the Mackinac Bridge \n     Authority will soon be removing the bridge's paint by a \n     process called ``enclosure,'' whereby the structure is \n     cleaned with a tent-like covering to keep paint chips from \n     falling into the water or blowing onto populated areas. The \n     cost of the ``enclosure'' is staggering: Nearly $50 million, \n     which the Authority wants to pay for by budgeting $2.2 \n     million each year for the next 21 year. . .. Unfortunately, \n     this ``enclosure'' scheme is a huge--\n\n  Huge and very questionable--\n\n     spending of money.\n       No one has ever documented any harm caused by paint chips \n     falling off the Mackinac Bridge. The greater risk, in fact, \n     may be to workers [who will be within the enclosures] \n     inhaling the paint particles or having accidents during the \n     enclosure process.\n\n  Mr. Fulsom further notes that the expenses and risks of EPA's \nmandated paint removal process are being undertaken despite the fact \nthat the health risk from lead has been dramatically reduced.\n  For example, the Department of Health and Human Resources reports a \nsevenfold drop in national levels of lead in human blood in the last 25 \nyears. Further, Lakes Michigan and Huron are up to four times cleaner \nthan they were 25 years ago. And finally, as Mr. Fulsom has pointed \nout, most of the lead paint problem was from paint inside buildings, \nnot outside, and especially not from the bridges.\n  Mr. President, this is a prime example of a rule promulgated by \nWashington bureaucrats that is too far reaching and that will produce \nlittle if any environmental gain but still will impose great costs on \nthe citizens and businesses of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Sometimes \nregulatory agencies actually demand that more dangerous procedures be \nused merely in order to protect the agency's power and authority.\n  To take another example from Michigan: The sediment on the bottom of \nLake Michigan's Manistique Harbor contains quantities of PCB's. These \ncontaminants can be cleaned either by capping them with a layer of clay \nor by dredging them up and out of the harbor. Capping would cost about \n$3.5 million. Dredging would cost nearly $15 million. Separate studies \nconducted by the EPA and private parties both concluded that capping \nwould protect the environment better than dredging, which necessarily \nwould stir up and release the PCB's into the harbor. Because capping is \nobviously the most cost-effective remedy, Michigan's Governor, John \nEngler, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the \nManistique local government, State representatives, and our \ncongressional delegation all expressed support for capping rather than \ndredging the PCB's in the harbor.\n  Yet, for months on end, the EPA indicated it would require that the \nharbor be dredged. The EPA generally prefers dredging over capping, and \nan internal EPA memorandum states that allowing the harbor to be capped \nwould set a ``risky precedent.'' Adherence to this position would \nbankrupt the Manistique economy, putting many people in the community \nout of work; all this while actually increasing PCB contamination.\n  Fortunately, it now appears that the EPA will allow the harbor to be \ncapped, but this comes only after Manistique businesses incurred \nenormous legal fees and after I and the other members of the Michigan \ndelegation repeatedly expressed our vehement opposition to dredging the \nharbor. Absent those extraordinary circumstances, there is no doubt \nthat the EPA would have required that the harbor be dredged. Here then \nwas one near miss in terms of regulatory overreach. But even if the \nregulations and their interpretations were rational, the cost of \nconforming with EPA paperwork requirements would still be staggering.\n  In yet another example, Kent County, MI, recently spent $300,000 on \nEPA-ordered work at a closed landfill. Of that amount, $80,000 was \nstrictly for the cost of preparing reports for the agency. This means, \nMr. President, that the taxpayers of Kent County, MI, paid $80,000, \nmore than a quarter of the full cost of compliance, merely for \npaperwork filing. Nationwide, individuals and businesses spent about \n$200 billion to process paperwork and to pay legal and accounting fees, \naccording to economist Thomas Hopkins from the Rochester Institute of \nTechnology.\n  Mr. President, the need to lift the excessive red tape burden on \nAmerica's small businesses--which are engines of job creation in our \neconomy--is perhaps the most compelling reason for regulatory reform. \nBecause of huge administrative and paperwork costs, regulation is \ndisproportionately a burden to small- and medium-sized businesses. \nSmall businesses simply do not have the resources to absorb the direct \ncosts of regulation or hire lawyers, consultants, lobbyists, and \naccountants to comply with paperwork requirements. Indeed, complying \nwith Government regulation has replaced making a profit or a better \nproduct as the primary concern of many of America's small business \npeople.\n  According to a recent Arthur Andersen survey of 1,000 midsized \nbusinesses, 52 percent said Government regulation was their biggest \nchallenge, while only 18 percent said turning a profit.\n  Mr. President, it seems clear, in my judgment, that regulations often \nunnecessarily distort business decisions. They make business people put \ntheir resources into filing paperwork instead of making profits. This \nincreases product prices, reduces consumer choice, lowers quality, and \neven causes some businesses not to hire new workers. The Center for the \nStudy of American Business provides real world examples of the negative \nconsequences of regulation on job creation. Dr. Murray Weidenbaum of \nthat center reports that:\n\n       World Class Process Inc., a new and growing Pittsburgh \n     processor of flat-rolled steel coils, has increased its work \n     force to 49. According to the company's chief financial \n     officer, ``We are going to keep it at 49 as long as we can,'' \n     in order to avoid being subject to the 50 or more employees \n     threshold for coverage under [various programs such as the \n     Family Leave Act.]\n\n  Similarly, other studies indicate that firms are using 50 employees \nor other similar numerical limits as a basis to avoid various paperwork \nrequirements of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, this does not help our economy. I submit we no longer \ncan afford to ignore the concerns of small businesses. I understand \nthat there will be amendments offered to our regulatory reform bill by \nSenators Domenici and Bond to ensure that the needs and certainly the \nproblems of small business are adequately represented in the regulatory \nprocess.\n I will certainly support those efforts and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n\n  Mr. President, we have already begun to act with a new awareness to \nsolve the problem of overregulation. Our legislation, in regard to \nunfunded mandates, which was passed and signed into law earlier this \nyear, is a case in point. Through it, we recognized that Federal \ndemands bring costs with them, and that these costs do not necessarily \nrepresent the best use of a city's, State's, or business' money.\n  But the most important step we can take to stem the tide of \nregulation, in my view, is the regulatory reform bill we will be \ndebating. This bill will require rules to be cost-effective and require \nagencies to use sound science in assessing dangers to the public. It \nwill \n\n[[Page S 9356]]\n\nhelp prioritize risks, thereby targeting the use of our resources \ntoward those activities and substances that pose the greatest risks. It \nwill see to it that agencies take all pertinent information and all \nviable options into account before increasing the regulatory burden on \nthe American people.\n  When combined with the unfunded mandates law, this regulatory reform \nbill will do much to free the American people from unnecessary \nregulations. In this way, it will increase consumer options, lower \nprices, increase productivity and, most important, increase the amount \nof freedom enjoyed by the American people.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to congratulate the majority leader \nand Senators Hatch, Roth, Nickles, Murkowski, Johnston, and others for \ntheir efforts in putting together this compromise measure. I believe \nthere are provisions in this bill that could have been much stronger, \nsuch as the decisional criteria, judicial review, and sunset \nprovisions, but I believe we have worked very conscientiously and in \ngood faith on both sides to move us to the point of completing a very \nimportant piece of legislation, and I applaud those who have been \ncentral to those discussions.\n  It is my hope that ultimately we will have the kind of strong bill \ncome out of our final deliberations and conference that will create the \nproper balance between the necessary health and safety and \nenvironmental needs of the American people, on the one hand, and the \nfreedom and liberty that we all seek for our country on the other.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9352-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9356-S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow begin controlled debate on the budget conference report, and when \nthe Senate receives the conference report, the time consumed be \nsubtracted from the overall statutory time limitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, and the time I consume not be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. 983 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, are we on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are debating the conference report. \nThe Republicans have 2 hours 18 minutes. The Democrats have 2 hours 42 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment to the \noffices of our Republican Senators. We have 2 hours 18 minutes and, \nhopefully, we are going to vote on this around 5 o'clock. I would even \nlike to yield back some of our time. I will not do that until we have \nexplored that with our Senators.\n  Senator Coats is going to speak now. The Senators that have asked me \nto speak--and I will confirm this now and if they or their \nadministrative assistants would let us know if they will--are Senators \nNickles, Stevens, Murkowski, Snowe, Helms, Coverdell, Hutchison, Lott, \nBond, Gorton, and DeWine. Are there any others who would like to speak? \nAnd of these that I mentioned, could they call and tell us how much \ntime they would like? Senator Thomas is on the list now, too. I would \nlike each Senator not to take more than 10 minutes. Does the Senator \nfrom Indiana need 15 minutes?\n  Mr. COATS. I do not think I will need more than that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first, I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich and the budget \nconferees for producing a historic blueprint that reprioritizes our \nFederal spending. It is a monumental piece of work, and they deserve a \ngreat deal of congratulations for the tireless efforts they put into \nproducing this document.\n  Finally, Congress, under the leadership of Republicans, has delivered \non a solemn promise made to the American people to balance the Federal \nbudget. I am particularly pleased that the conferees recognized that \nthey were able to balance the budget and provide family tax relief and \neconomic growth incentives. These were once described as ``mutually \nexclusive goals.'' We have demonstrated by the budgets brought forth in \neach body, and resolved in conference, that they are not mutually \nexclusive goals. Meeting these objectives will ensure that our economy \ncontinues to thrive and our families find real relief, even as Federal \nspending is restrained.\n  Mr. President, there is courage in this budget--courage that I do not \nbelieve we have seen for decades, courage that makes this a historic \nmoment. But I think if we are honest, we have to admit that it is \ncourage without alternatives. The status quo may be comfortable for the \ntime being, but it is not sustainable. The road that we have been \nmarching down for these last several years has been wide and has been \neasy and has been politically pleasing; but that road ends with a \nprecipitous drop into an abyss, from which this country may not \nrecover. I think there has been a recognition of that, and that \nrecognition has produced this document which we are debating today.\n  The figures are familiar, but they have not lost their power to \nshock. Our national debt currently stands at $4.8 trillion, which \ntranslates into $19,000 for every man, woman, and child in this Nation. \nAnd that figure as projected, if we do nothing except retain the status \nquo, will jump to $23,000 for every man, woman, and child by the year \n2002. If we ignore this crisis, if we ignore this reality, a child born \nthis year will pay $187,000, or more, over his or her lifetime just in \ninterest on the national debt. That is unacceptable. We have recognized \nthat as unacceptable, and we now bring forth a plan designed to address \nthat very problem.\n  This argument for immediate change and immediate restraint is simple. \nIt is one of the highest moral ideals and traditions in this Nation for \nparents to sacrifice for the sake of their children. It is the depth of \nselfishness to call on children to sacrifice for the sake of their \nparents. If we continue on the current path, we will violate a trust \nbetween generations, and we will earn the contempt of the future, and \nwe will deserve that contempt.\n  What we are doing is wrong. It has been virtually immoral. It has \nviolated a fundamental tradition and value that, I think, most Members \nhold to.\n  Now, there is no doubt that we need cuts in Government to balance the \nbudget. But there is another reason. We need cuts in Government because \nGovernment itself is too large--too large in our economy, too large in \nour lives. Even if the books were balanced today, even if we faced no \nbudget deficit, we would still need to provide a sober reassessment of \nthe Federal Government's role and reach in our businesses, in our daily \nlives. This is not just a matter of money alone. We require cuts in \nGovernment because endless, useless, duplicative programs should not be \nreinvented, as the administration defines it. They should be \neliminated.\n  We reject the vision of a passive Nation, where an arrogant \nGovernment sets the rules. We want to return not only to an affordable \nGovernment, but to a limited Government. Those limits will help unleash \nlimited potential of our economy and of our people.\n  Now, the votes that we will make, or have to make in implementing \nthis budget through the appropriation process and the reconciliation \nprocess, will likely be some of the toughest votes that any elected \nMember of Congress has ever been asked to cast.\n  If we are honest, again, most of those votes would not be tough calls \nfor the people that we represent. They would not be tough calls for \nmost Americans, though they seem momentous here as we look at it and \ntry to weigh the political consequences.\n  But that is not what I find as I travel through Indiana. When I talk \nto the men and women of Indiana, they see what we are doing as a \nminimal commitment to common sense. A minimal commitment to doing what \nwe should \n\n[[Page S 9357]]\n\nhave done a long time ago. A minimal commitment to doing what we are \nrequired to do or should feel we were required to do.\n  Changes made by this budget are bold, but they are not radical. They \nare ambitious, but they are not dangerous. It is a careful plan to meet \na specific need. Listen to some of the facts: Under the budget \nresolution, Government spending will rise from its current legal of \n$1.5 trillion to $1.9 trillion by the year 2002. This is an increase of \n30 percent. So all the doomsayers and the political rhetoric that is \nfloating around this town and floating around the country, that we are \nundermining the very foundation of Government services, is simply not \nthe case. It will be a 30-percent increase in Government spending over \nthe next 7 years.\n  The difference is that increase is going to be a lot lower than what \nit would have been if we leave everything the same. We are going to \nincrease spending at a slower rate. That increase at a slower rate is \ngoing to produce the savings necessary to bring our budget into \nbalance.\n  A good example, if we take a family currently making $45,000 a year, \nif the income grew at the rate we allow Government to grow under this \nplan, that family would be making $63,000 into the year 2002, 7 years \nfrom now. Surely, a family could construct a budget to meet this higher \nlevel of spending. The Federal Government is being asked to do the \nsame.\n  Now, there are honest disagreements about the merits and priorities \nof many of these reductions. I expect we will continue to have an \nhonest, hard-fought, debate. We must not allow these deliberations to \nbe ruled by half-truths or distortions. We will not allow, we cannot \nallow, political charges which are simply untrue, to remain unrebutted.\n  Every American, no matter what their age, has an interest in a \nstrong, viable, Medicare System. But Medicare faces an impending \ncrisis. The President's own commission concluded that Medicare will be \nbankrupt in 7 years.\n  The Republican budget ensures that this will not happen, that \nMedicare will remain a viable program. But we have no choice but to \nreduce the rate of growth, hopefully through reforms in the system, \nthat can continue to provide a central medical care to our elderly and \nhave a fund available to do that for those that will be approaching \nretirement age some time in the future.\n  It is important to note that Medicare will continue to increase at a \n6.4-percent annual rate, to ensure the solvency of that program. That \nis down from its current double-digit growth rate of a little more than \n10 percent.\n  But it is absolutely necessary to do this or we lose the whole \nsystem. It is the President's own commission and the President himself, \nnow, who has acknowledged that this is the step that we must take, to \nensure the solvency of Medicare and to assure that this program is \navailable in the future.\n  As promised, Social Security remains untouched. Spending will \nincrease in Social Security from the current annual total of $340 \nbillion to $480 billion in 2002. One of our central goals here has been \nto protect the integrity of the Social Security System. We have done \nthat. Social Security benefits must be preserved for the retirees who \nhave paid into that system and count on that system. We have done that.\n  I firmly support this budget. It tackles not only our unsustainable \nbudget deficit but also the needs of our families. America's deficit \ncrisis concerns not only our budget but also a deficit in the resources \nof families to care for their own.\n  This deficit has been widened by ever-increasing taxation, and a \nsteady erosion of the personal exemption. Many families are in current \nrecession directly caused by Government policy.\n  A balanced budget and family-oriented, growth-oriented tax relief are \npart of the same movement in America, a movement to limit our \nGovernment on the one hand, and empower our people on the other. One \nidea implies and requires the other.\n  When we reduce public spending, we should increase proportionately \nthe resources of families to meet their own needs. If Government no \nlonger is going to provide and meet those needs or attempt to meet \nthose needs, I should say, because as well-motivated and as well-\nintended as some of the Government programs are to reach family needs \nand reach social needs in this country, they have been a dismal \nfailure, eaten up by administrative costs and simply not achieving \ntheir goals.\n  The results are beginning to address the problem. As we downsize the \none, we increase the capability of the other. We give families, we give \nindividuals, we empower communities, we empower nonprofit \norganizations, with the ability to reach out and address those needs in \na much more effective way.\n  That is a good investment. That is a sound investment, because $1 \nspent by our families is far more useful than $1 spent by Government.\n  It is time to admit when our families fail, so does our society. \nTheir financial crisis is as urgent and as important as any other \npriority in this debate. Now, Mr. President, another priority of mine \nhas been to ensure that the Nation is represented to defend its \ninterest and ideals in the world. The administration has pushed us to \nthe razor's edge of readiness, through dangerous defense cuts, while \nextending our military commitments beyond our national interests. It is \na recipe for disaster.\n  This budget ends that hemorrhaging. Even though it does not restore \nus to full strength, it stops the hemorrhages and begins to move toward \na path of correcting the problems. For that reason, I am grateful as we \nmarkup, today, the defense bill for the next fiscal year, we are \ndealing with many of these difficult issues about what is necessary for \nour preparedness, what is necessary to provide an adequate, sound, \ndefense.\n  Nobody can argue that is not a priority of the Federal Government. \nThere is a role for Federal Government and this is, perhaps, its \nprimary role.\n  Our decisions today in the Armed Services Committee, meeting as I \nspeak--and I will be back there as soon as I am done--is easier today \nbecause of the decisions that the Budget Committee made in their \nconference. They have given the tools to address more readily some of \nthese problems. We are thankful for that, although we did not get all \nwe wanted.\n  Mr. President, we have come to the beginning of the end of deficit \nspending in America. Let me repeat that: We have come to the beginning \nof the end of deficit spending in America.\n  We have come to this place because there is no alternative for us. \nThe work before us is not a task for the timid, but it is nothing more \nthan what most Americans expect of us. We have come to a time that is \nunique and historic, an authentic moment of decision. It is a moment to \nact--worthy of our words--and keep faith with the future.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the time and for his \ndiligent efforts in this entire task, and again congratulate him for \nthe magnificent work he has accomplished in this past year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coats for his remarks \ntoday and for his steadfast support of us getting to a balanced budget \nand his willingness to take some very, very hard stands with reference \nto getting there. In particular, I thank him for his kind remarks this \nmorning.\n  We yield the floor on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to advise all Senators on this \nside, and I think I probably speak for my colleague on the other side, \nwe are trying to compact time as best we can and yet give everybody at \nleast a chance to make remarks they think are appropriate and very \nimportant. There are a lot of Senators who have indicated to me on this \nside, and I believe to Senator Domenici on that side, that they want to \ntalk.\n  We need you here to talk. We cannot have you talking unless you are \nhere to talk. So I certainly extend the invitation to all the Members \non this side of the aisle who wish to talk; this will be a good time to \ncome over here. Or, very likely, we will begin to be yielding back some \ntime, if I can make an arrangement to that effect with my colleague \nfrom New Mexico.\n  With that, I yield 7 minutes to my colleague from Washington.\n\n[[Page S 9358]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this conference report takes a bad budget \nand makes it worse. No one disputes the fact the deficit must be \nreduced. For the past 2 years, we worked--with common sense--to slash \none-third of the deficit we inherited in 1993. We made tough choices. \nWe eliminated hundreds of programs, and cut hundreds more.\n  The new majority in this body has built upon our good record of \ncutting spending. I commend my friends on the other side of the aisle--\nthey have responded to a call for smaller Government, and reduced \nspending.\n  But, they have gone too far. They are misunderstanding the needs of \naverage Americans. The revolution has certainly come to Washington, DC, \nMr. President, and, let us see who wins and who loses in the battle.\n  The richest Americans win, Mr. President. This conference report \noverflows with tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Households who earn \n$200,000 per year win--they get a nice tax break for their kids. What \nabout families at the lowest end of the income scale? they are not even \neligible for this tax break. And, what about the kids of middle-class \nAmericans? They lose in the revolution, Mr. President. Ten billion \ndollars is slashed from student loans. And, children of low-income \nfamilies will see their health insurance cut. Despite the fact the \nSenate voted unanimously for my amendment to protect impact aid from \nthe budget ax, children who rely on this program are put in jeopardy.\n  And, what happens to the kids of our family farmers? They lose, too. \nThis revolution will drive small family farmers out of business. This \nbudget cuts $13 billion out of commodity programs over the next 7 \nyears. There is no hope for them to inherit their family farms, and \nrural America will be changed forever by this budget resolution.\n  And, what happens to my generation--the children of elderly parents? \nWe lose, too. Medicare--the safety net for our Nation's elderly--is \npulled away from our parents, by a $270 billion cut. In this \nrevolution, Mr. President, the children of America lose. The elderly \nlose. Farmers lose. And, veterans lose. Average Americans, trying to \nraise their kids, go to work, run a business, and care for elderly \nparents--they all lose.\n  Our Nation's precious environment is a loser in the revolution. This \nbudget clear-cuts funding for environmental and natural resources \ninitiatives. It proposes the leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. It cuts environmental spending by 30 percent by the year 2000.\n  My friends and neighbors in Washington State know I will fight to \nmaintain funding to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. With this \nbudget, funding will be difficult to find. But, I refuse to turn my \nback on Hanford.\n  Of course, ultimately, our economy loses. This plan will place our \neconomy at risk. Since the new majority has been in place, consumer \nconfidence has been dropping and the economy has been slowing down. \nAmericans feel embattled. Everyday people feel there is no hope. This \nbudget does nothing to restore hope.\n  Mr. President, I will do all in my power to give hope to average \nAmericans. To maintain the high standard of life we enjoy in this \ncountry. That is why I supported amendments in the Budget Committee and \nhere on the floor last month--amendments that would have restored some \nMedicare and Medicaid cuts without increasing the deficit; amendments \nto lower the proposed taxes on America's working families. It is plain \nand simple--by cutting the earned income tax credit, this budget will \nraise taxes on 224,000 taxpayers in my home State alone.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, these attempts to restore some fairness \nand common sense to the budget were rejected.\n  But, this is just one step in the process. We have 13 appropriations \nbill, and a reconciliation bill, which must come before us--and go \nacross the President's desk--before these cuts become reality. It is \ngoing to be a long, hot summer, Mr. President. As a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I know the real work is yet to come. And, I \nwill be working to make sure we retain programs that are important to \naverage Americans.\n  As we see today, the budget that emerged from the House-Senate \nconference is too radical. It gives Goliath an advantage. I \ncongratulate my friends on the other side of the aisle. This is their \nday. It is the day for the wealthiest among us to celebrate. But, it is \na sorry day for average Americans.\n  I oppose this conference report, and urge all colleagues to vote \nagainst this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWashington for a very excellent statement. She is a very valuable \nmember of the Budget Committee and I hope her remarks are taken to \nheart.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank also the distinguished colleague \nfrom Delaware. I will be brief.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Mark Twain stated many years ago that, \n``The truth is such a precious thing, it should be used very \nsparingly.''\n  Therein, of course, is the approach that we use in our budgetary and \nfiscal concerns here and problems and responsibilities in the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  I want to talk of the fraud that this particular budget, which we \nwill vote upon, is exacting upon the American people. It is very \nstriking and ironic that we have spent the past week talking about \nfraud on the investors, defrauding the taxpayers, and everything else. \nBut the greatest fraud to be perpetrated is going to occur right here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate later today. It is, once again, the so-\ncalled ``balanced budget plan.'' We have been lying about that balanced \nbudget plan for some 15 years.\n  In that context, I think of my friend Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia. \nThe late Senator from Washington, Senator Jackson, and myself had a \nunique opportunity. We were told in Prague, ``When you go out and see \nthis dissident, you will be trailed.'' We went out in the residential \narea, and we sat down in a bedroom and waited to make sure that we were \nnot followed. After about a half-hour, they said all was clear. Out of \nthe closet door in the bedroom came Vaclav Havel. He had been in there \nfor the last half-hour while we were waiting.\n  Trying to impress Mr. Havel with respect to the United States' \ncommitments to getting these dissidents out, Senator Jackson mentioned \nJackson-Vanik. Mr. Havel said, ``Jackson-Vanik?'' Jackson said, ``Yes, \nthat is where we bring economic pressure so that we can get you out of \nCzechoslovakia.'' I will never forget Havel. He said, ``Mr. Senator, \nCzechoslovakia was raped in 1938, in 1958 and in 1968.'' He said, ``If \nI and my generation do not see it through here and stay in \nCzechoslovakia, the world will never know Czechoslovakia as we have \nknown it.'' He said, ``We have no idea of leaving. We are not \ninterested in Jackson-Vanik.''\n  On the way to the airport, I broke the silence and said, ``Scoop, \nthat fellow is very courageous, but he is not going to see a free \nCzechoslovakia, and we are not going to see it in our lifetime.'' But \nof course, Czechoslovakia is now free. I was very interested in Havel's \nremarks after taking over as the President of Czechoslovakia. He said:\n\n       For 40 years, we have been lied to. For 40 years, we have \n     grown sicker, saying one thing and believing another. I \n     assume you did not elect me to continue this 40 years of \n     lying. We have to deal with our problems, and no one else can \n     solve them but us.\n\n  In a parallel situation, Mr. President, that is exactly the way this \nSenator rises--as a member of the Budget Committee since its \ninstitution, as former chairman of that Budget Committee, as a Senator \nwho voted for a balanced budget under Lyndon Johnson, and who, as \nchairman of that Budget Committee, reduced the deficit back in 1981 \nunder President Carter with the first reconciliation bill, as a Senator \nwho worked with the then majority leader, Howard Baker of Tennessee, on \na freeze that we could not enact, and as a Senator who worked on a \nbipartisan fashion again with Senators Gramm and Rudman on not only a \nfreeze but cuts in Government spending,\n then, as the Senator who appeared 5 years ago before the Finance \nCommittee saying, \n\n[[Page S 9359]]\n\n\n``Of course we need the freeze, the cuts, and the taxes,'' recommending \na value-added tax.\n  I have been in the vineyards for quite a while and hate to see this \nfraud perpetrated. The fraud and the lie, Mr. President, is that they \nhave no idea of balancing the budget.\n  Turn to page 3 of the conference report, and you will see under the \nword ``Deficits,'' for the year 2002: $108.4 billion. There is no \npresumption that the budget is going to be balanced.\n  Let me point out now by turning to page 4, the true deficit. Page 3 \nshows the amounts that we will owe Social Security, but the figures on \npage 4 include borrowed monies from the other trust funds that must be \nrepaid. We all know about building airports, building highways; all of \nthe other trust funds are used to obscure the size of the deficit in \nthis fraud. We all participate in it.\n  There on page 4 where it says ``debt increase,'' we find in fiscal \nyear 2002, the debt will increase by $185.1 billion.\n  After all the eliminations of the Department of Commerce and other \ndepartments, getting rid of public broadcasting--whatever--that is \nwhere we end up 7 years from now if we use the most favorable \nassumptions.\n  But when those assumptions do not come about, like a house of cards, \nif one falls, the whole thing will come apart. That is what will \nhappen. I will make the bet. Give me the odds and give me the amount. I \nbet we will borrow over $185.1 billion. I have made this point ad \nnauseam since January when we started on this task with a new Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nthe realities on truth in budgeting.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

Mr. President, what really happens is that there is a \ntotal disconnect in the American people. Over the years, we have led \nthe American public to really believe that all we need to do is \neliminate foreign aid, cut welfare, get rid of public broadcasting and \na few of the subsidies for the farmers--and that if we can get rid of \nthose things, we will have a balanced budget.\n  Not at all. No chance whatever. The bigness of Government that we all \ncomplain about, and we all say Government is too big, is the interest \ncost on the national debt. The interest cost on the national debt jumps \nthis year for a total amount of $340 billion. When we balanced that \nbudget, as I referred to, under President Johnson, the interest cost on \nthe entire debt for 200 years of history--the revolutionary world, \nWorld War I, World War II, Korea, all the wars--the interest on the \nnational debt was only $4 billion. Today, this fiscal year, it is \nestimated at $340 billion.\n  We are like Alice in Wonderland, to stay where you are, you have got \nto run as fast as you can; to get ahead, you have to run faster. We \nneed freezes, yes; the cuts, yes; the loophole closings, yes; and yes, \nthe taxes. We do not tell the American people the truth, and that is \nthe source of the disconnect.\n  What we have is this particular budget that has no idea, really, of \nachieving balance. The scheme adopted by our friends in the House is to \nappear traumatic and race around and say, ``Get rid of Energy, \nEducation, Housing, the Department of Commerce, do it all, those \nfriends over in the Senate will save us. They will not get rid of all \nthese departments. While we have their attention up here, down here we \nwill give them a tax cut. We will get the White House next year, and \nget credit for a balanced budget plan. Then we can say that the reason \nit did not work is those tax and spend liberals who held it up.''\n  Now, that is the fraud being perpetrated. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post \neditorial lauding this budget as an enormous service, and my response.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1995]\n\n                       The Republican Long March\n\n       At every step along the way, the prediction has been that \n     the congressional Republicans would falter in their drive \n     toward a balanced budget. So far it hasn't happened. The \n     astonishing spectacle instead has been of a party doing \n     pretty much exactly what it said it would. What a breach of \n     the rules that is.\n       House and Senate conferees have now agreed on a plan to \n     eliminate the budget deficit in seven years and, once the \n     necessary spending cuts are made, to enact a tax cut as well. \n     The president and other Democrats say the spending cuts would \n     be too deep, in Medicare and Medicaid especially, and carry \n     the risk of recession. But the president himself has proposed \n     a plan that he says would get to balance over 10 years. \n     They're arguing not over whether to shrink the government, \n     but over how much and how fast. That's the Republicans' \n     accomplishment.\n       The budget resolution that has emerged from the conference \n     committee is an outline only. The hard part of filling in the \n     blanks--making the specific cuts in specific programs that \n     will be required to carry the good intentions out--has yet to \n     come. That's what the president and the Republicans are going \n     to be disputing all summer. What are some of the principles \n     that should guide them?\n       (1) A balanced budget is a useful political beacon but \n     otherwise an artificial goal. The important thing is not so \n     much achieving balance as getting the deficit down to a \n     manageable level. Interest costs were a tenth of the budget \n     at the start of the Reagan administration. They've become a \n     seventh today. The more that has to be spent to service the \n     debt, the less that remains . . . the kudzu has to be cut \n     back.\n       (2) A tax cut now remains a bad idea. If the deficit is the \n     problem, why begin by compounding it? Nor should cuts be made \n     in health care and other programs for the poor in order to \n     finance a tax cut, some large part of which will be of \n     principal benefit to the better-off.\n       (3) The Republicans are trying to balance the budget on too \n     narrow a base. By taking Social Security off the cutting \n     block (together with defense and interest on the debt), \n     they've left themselves less than half the budget with which \n     to work. That's why they've had to propose such deep cuts in \n     the health care programs; the cuts they've set out for \n     Medicaid in particular would do great social harm. The \n     program for the poor and near-poor now covers a seventh of \n     the population. Savings can be had, but nowhere near the \n     savings the budget resolution suggests without adding greatly \n     to the number of uninsured in the society. Surely there's no \n     gain in that. The budget-balancing process ought to extend \n     across the board. We've suggested an indexation holiday--a \n     one-year suspension of indexation of Social Security and \n     other retirement benefits and the indexed features of the tax \n     code--as one method. There are others.\n       But in writing the resolution that they have, the \n     Republicans have performed an enormous service. If the \n     deficit comes down substantially this year, it will be \n     because they forced it to. You can argue all you want that it \n     was their party that mainly drove it up in the 1980s and that \n     resisted the deficit-reducing steps that Mr. Clinton proposed \n     earlier in his term. That was then; this is now.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                       Senator Hollings' Response\n       The Washington Post's muddled praise Sunday of the \n     Republican budget plan proves that, when it comes to budget-\n     balancing, if you are not confused, you are not paying \n     attention. Here are the three budgetary myths to which the \n     Post unfortunately gave credibility:\n       First, Republicans complain long and loud that big \n     government has produced big deficits. Nonsense. We have had \n     big government with deficits and without deficits. We also \n     have had a country with and without big government. History \n     suggests that big government is a fact of life if we want a \n     high standard of living--superhighways instead of winding \n     State roads, safe landings at big airports instead of private \n     puddle-jumpers, insured bank deposits instead of shocking \n     runs, benefits for veterans instead of a mere thank you, and \n     heart surgery if necessary instead of unknown on the death \n     certificate. Name any other country that has our standard of \n     living and less government--you can't.\n       The second myth is that the Republican plan is a budget \n     balancing plan. No, it is a tax cut plan for a Republican \n     constituency. Budget conferees had a knockdown fight to \n     provide tax cuts big enough to satisfy certain constituents \n     in next year's elections. Other budget items for the sick \n     elderly and children were then cut to fit the tax cut goals.\n       The third myth is that this tax cut plan represents \n     government reform. More accurately, it is a phenomenon known \n     in sports as the buddy pass--a player trapped by an on-\n     rushing opponent makes a quick pass to a near-by buddy, who \n     then gets crushed instead. In this case, Congress will invite \n     the 50 Governors and thousands of mayors to cut welfare and \n     Medicaid $282 billion. Also fantastically large Medicare cuts \n     will be suggested by a future Commission and then rejected by \n     a bipartisan Congress. while this interesting charade plays \n     itself out, the Republican Congress will hand out the above-\n     mentioned capital gains cut. If this process produces a \n     balanced budget or a reformed government instead of \n     devastation for hospitals and cities, I will eat my hat.\n       These myths hide the central truth of recent budget \n     history: Skyrocketing costs for interest on the debt are the \n     main cause of apparent big government. Since 1980, we have \n     added an extra $275 billion in creditor payments for \n     government debt service to the taxpayer's bill. In other \n     words, taxpayers have bought an extra Defense Department or \n     Medicare program--take your pick. Without having it \n     delivered. Last year, interest costs rose $44 billion; \n     Medicare rose $16 billion--which one is being attacked? The \n     Republican plan to hand out a certain huge tax cut and \n     unrealistic program cuts will continue to result in a \n     continued Reagonomic interest spiral. By now, the Post should \n     know that this is not an enormous service.\n\n[[Page S 9361]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then why is the budget not real, Mr. President? Simply \nspeaking, it calls for $499 billion in cuts. All along Republicans have \nbeen carping that it was entitlements that were the problem. But now to \nfinance a tax cuts, massive reductions must be required in programs \nlike biomedical research and education that will never occur.\n  Mr. President, I tried for half the level of discretionary cuts back \nduring Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. But when we got to the short rolls in \n1990, we bugged out and repealed the fixed deficit targets of Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings. I raised the point of order at 12:40, on October 19, \n12:41 a.m, and Senator Gramm and Senator Rudman voted to repeal it. \nThis Senator did not. I raised a point of order. If we could not do it \nthen, how are we going to do it now?\n  The next thing, of course, Mr. President, is the $270 billion in \nMedicare. The President tried his first year and we finally compromised \nwithout a single Republican vote, cutting $57 billion. That is what we \nhad the compromise down to. Last year the President proposed another \n$120 billion as part of comprehensive health care reform, and they \nrebuffed him, ridiculed his wife, and said, ``No way.''\n  Now they come with a totally unrealistic figure of $270 billion, and \nbecause they do not want to endorse any specific cuts, they give it to \na commission. What a copout. Talk about ``Where's Bill,'' and all these \nsigns on the floor--where is the Congress' responsibility? Give it to a \ncommission--come on.\n  Then they cannot find $182 billion in specific cuts for Medicaid. \nThat is not going to happen. So they give that to the States. Also, \n$100 billion in welfare cuts. They do not want to do it, give that to \nthe States.\n  Then they come around with the greatest gimmick of all, what they \ncall the interest or fiscal dividend--the interest bonus of $170 \nbillion.\n  Now, Mr. President, we tried that in 1990. I am going to insert in \nthe Record the exact figure. Here it is: The fiscal year 1991 budget, 5 \nyears ago. Under that plan, the deficit in 1991 was supposed to go down \nto $64 billion, and in 1992 down to $8.9 billion; 1993, we were to have \na surplus of $44.8 billion; 1994, $108.5 billion; 1995, this fiscal \nyear, Mr. President, imagine that--here we have a document that said \nthis year we are going to have a surplus of $156.2 billion.\n  We got that using the fiscal dividend. We had all these bonuses--how \nthe interest costs were going down and everything else, so we have been \nthrough this 5 years ago. If you read Time magazine, the cover says, \n``First Balanced Budget Presented in Decades.'' False, we presented a \nsurplus just 5 years ago.\n  Look at these plans. Sober up. Tell the truth to the American people. \nNo chance of that welfare cut, that Medicare cut, that Medicaid cut, \nand the program cuts. Other Members know it and I know it. So the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee comes over on the Senate \nside and says, ``No, no, no, wait a minute. We want the cuts before we \nget the tax cut.'' See, the $170 billion is used for a tax cut.\n  I want everyone to turn to page 89, going quickly. ``The conferees \nagree that the $245 billion net tax cut represents an appropriate \nbalance between accommodating the tax cuts in the House-passed Contract \nWith America and the need to put the deficit on a declining path to a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002.''\n  What balanced budget? Turn to page 4; it says a $185 billion deficit. \nBut here on page 89, now, the Senate has yielded to the House and they \nhave in here--all you have to do is give your assumptions to CBO and \nthe CBO says yes, with those assumptions that will happen. And with \nthat assumption verified just by giving it to them--not the actual \ncuts, not the actual votes for it--then you give it to the Finance \nCommittee and they authorize for a $245 billion tax cut.\n  And therein, again, is the conspiracy, the conniving conspiracy going \ninto that conference, where they did not invite this Senator, I can \ntell you. We had opening statements when we had the communications \nbill. When they finally agreed, they came to my staff and said, ``Does \nSenator Hollings want to sign the conference report?\"\n  He said, ``He hasn't even been to a meeting. You would not even let \nus come to a meeting. But he could maybe sign it. Let us look at it and \nsee it.''\n  He said, ``No, we cannot give you the details. You either sign it or \ndo not sign it.''\n  So we did not sign it. Because they knew good and well I can read, \nand I have been reading them for 20-some years now. This is an absolute \nfraud on the American public. What you have now is a tax cut. You are \ngoing to have bigger deficits. You are going to have the interest costs \ngoing from $300 billion at least, to $500 billion by the year 2002. And \nwe have the same act, the same scene.\n  In conclusion, let me just read, so we get a historical perspective \nhere, and the historical perspective is what was stated by our friend, \nDavid Stockman, who handled all of these budgets in years past. \nStockman said 5 years ago:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability, a noisy faction of Republicans \n     that willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance \n     and their own culpability in it ever since. Instead, they \n     have incessantly poisoned the political debate with a \n     mindless stream of antitax venom, while pretending that \n     economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit. It ought to be obvious by now that we cannot grow \n     our way out.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. They do not give this to CBO. They do not \ngive it to the Democratic colleagues. They do not have it scored. They \njust come in here with a quick, ``We got 5 hours more left. Let's just \nvote it up or down and, whoopee, we will go home for the Fourth of \nJuly; we have a balanced budget.''\n  We are lying to the American people and it should stop.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I see no one on the floor so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, with the time being equally charged. Which is \nanother way of saying to anyone who wishes to speak, the longer the \nquorum call is in effect, the less time you will have to talk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise again on what I think is a \nmomentous day in which, for the first time in many years, this Congress \nis going to agree to balance the budget. I think clearly that message \nhas been delivered by the voters in the country; more specifically, in \nthe last election in November. When I say clearly, the people said the \nFederal Government is too large, it costs too much, that it continues \nto grow, and it continues to be more predominant.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is the delivery on some of the \npromises that have been made, made by this party, made to some extent \nby this Congress. But I am very proud of this budget that has been \nbrought forward by the majority party.\n  So it seems to me that we have delivered on the promise to balance \nthe budget for the first time in over a generation. The Congress will \npass a blueprint to bring a balanced budget in the year 2002. It means \na dropping of interest rates of up to 2 percent, the creation of 6 \nmillion jobs in 10 years, increasing per capita incomes, and over 7 \nyears the Federal Government will spend $12 trillion instead of $13 \ntrillion. Spending will increase at a rate of 3 percent instead of 5 \npercent.\n  I think the majority party is, and those who support this budget \nproposal are, delivering by not using smoke and mirrors. I think it is \nfair to say that, over the years, there has been an awfully lot of \nsmoke and mirrors on financial matters, saying things that feel good \nsomewhere out in the future. Somehow those future years never come. But \nthis budget resolution relies on the estimates of the Congressional \nBudget Office which President Clinton in 1993 insisted be used as a \nyardstick.\n  So I think we are delivering on the idea of no smoke and mirrors, \ndelivering on the idea that the figures can be counted on. I believe \nsupporters of this \n\n[[Page S 9362]]\n\nresolution are delivering on their promises to cut taxes. As you will \nrecall, this administration hardly waited to unpack its bags before \nraising taxes $251 billion in 1993.\n  One of the steps involved in this proposition, however, is to give \nAmerican families a tax refund, $245 billion that will relieve the \nburden on families, that will allow potentially for the per child tax \ncredit for families, capital gains reduction, marriage penalty relief, \nAmerican dream savings, new IRA's, senior citizens tax relief, and \nprogrowth economic tax incentives. But a very important aspect of it is \nthat, in order for those tax reductions to be made available, there has \nto be a certification by the Congressional Budget Office that the \ngrowth reductions will yield a dividend to do this, that will yield a \ndividend to allow for tax reductions.\n  Supporters of this resolution are delivering on their promise to \ndownsize Government. It started right here in the Congress. It started \nthis year--reduce some of the expenditures of the legislative branch. \nForeign aid is being reduced, overall discretionary spending is down by \n$190 billion, and the Commerce Department phased out.\n  Supporters will be delivering on their promise to strengthen the \nNation's defense. The conference report restores more than $33 billion \nof President Clinton's $150 billion defense cut over the next 7 years, \ndefense being certainly a priority issue, a priority function of the \nFederal Government.\n  Supporters of this budget are delivering on their promise to preserve \nand protect and strengthen Medicare. We have been over this. Clearly, \nif nothing is done, Medicare is bankrupt; without a reserve fund in 2 \nyears, bankrupt in 7 years. Nobody wants to see that happen. But you \nhave to make some change. We organize the delivery of services and \nreduce that level of spending from 10 percent a year to 7 percent a \nyear. Spending will increase on a per capita basis from $4,800 a year \nnow at the end of 7 years to $6,400 a year, which includes growth in \nthe numbers.\n  Supporters of this resolution are delivering on their promise to \nimprove Medicaid. Bureaucracy is eliminated in favor of allowing States \nto decide. I can tell you that there is a lot of difference in the kind \nof delivery program that is necessary in Ten Sleep, WY, than in \nPhiladelphia. There needs to be that kind of flexibility to do it. The \nFederal Medicaid spending will grow, however, from $89 billion this \nyear to $124 billion. We heard all of this talk about cuts. That is the \nkind of growth.\n  Supporters of this resolution will keep their promise to protect \nSocial Security. During the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nyou will recall that the opposition continued to say they were going to \nbalance the budget on the back of Social Security.\n That is not true. Social Security is not a part of this balanced \nbudget.\n\n  Also, the supporters of this resolution keep their promise in \nreforming welfare. This conference report contemplates a savings of \nnearly $100 billion in welfare, again by moving these kinds of \ndecisions to the States.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is not only a remarkable day in terms \nof the fact that for the first time in many years we will agree to \nbalance the budget, but I think maybe more importantly in a republic, \nin a democracy, it is vital that you and I as voters are given \ninformation that is valid, are given information that is true, \ninformation that we can depend on.\n  So I think the supporters of this budget conference report have \ndelivered on these promises, and I am very pleased and very proud to be \na supporter of this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes in combination between \nthree Senators who wish to discuss this very important matter, the \nSenators from Connecticut, Washington, and Wisconsin. I will allow them \nto divide the 15 minutes among themselves as they see fit.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Nebraska. I do \nnot yet see our colleague from Wisconsin. I know he may be on his way \nover here, so we will do the best we can.\n  First of all, Mr. President, let me commend the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, for doing a good job. I have strong disagreements with the \nconference agreement, but I say to my colleagues that the efforts made \nby our colleagues on the Republican side here are certainly vastly \nsuperior to what our Republican colleagues on the House side were \nproposing. They have managed to pare back the House proposal. But I am \nstill deeply concerned about the direction, the agenda, and the \npriorities included in this budget.\n  So I thank them for the work they have done, but, frankly, it was not \nsuccessful enough, in my view. It asks seniors, students and working \nAmericans to get out and pull the wagon by themselves--while those best \nable to do the work sit back comfortably and enjoy the ride.\n  My concern is that with this budget, no matter how you cut this, no \nmatter how you sort it out, at the end of the day, does the following \nthings: It slashes Medicare substantially and, in my view, and \nunnecessarily. It goes after education in this country. It slashes \ncollege opportunities, a critical issue for working families in this \nNation. And it goes after wages of working families as well.\n  I might point out that the tax cuts go far beyond what I think ought \nto be part of a budget resolution that has as its underlying goal to \nachieve a balanced budget, and distribute responsibility and sacrifice \nfairly in this country.\n  Mr. President, despite the efforts of our friends on the other side \nof this Chamber, the fact is this budget still is unfair, no matter how \nyou look at it.\n  Mr. President, let me just point out, if I can, a couple of things. \nMy colleague from Washington is here, and I am going to ask her to join \nme in this discussion. The fact is the Medicare savings in this \nbudget--despite all of these charts, no matter how they try to engage \nin the old shell and pea game of moving the numbers around quickly--are \ngoing to have a very significant impact on older Americans--35 million \ntoday. They are going to have their out-of-pocket Medicare costs go up \nroughly $3,400 over the life of this budget proposal. Presently, \nAmericans over the age of 65 are paying about $3,000 in out-of-pocket \nexpenses. In my State, it is higher because it is a higher cost State, \nbut roughly $3,000.\n  Now, I want my colleagues to keep in mind these numbers. Of the 35 \nmillion people who are on Medicaid, about 95 percent of them have \nincomes of $50,000 or less. 8.8 million--of the 35 million have incomes \nof $10,000 or less. The median income of a Medicare recipient is \nroughly $17,000 a year.\n  Today, you have $3,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, and if this budget \nis adopted, over the life of this budget, those out-of-pocket expenses \nwill increase by $3,400. Now, if you are making $17,000 a year and on \nMedicaid, and you have those kinds of out-of-pocket expenses, I do not \ncare how you try to sell this, that is a heavy, heavy burden to bear.\n  So I ask my colleagues--and I see them both here--from Wisconsin and \nthe State of Washington, I do not know exactly what the numbers are in \ntheir States, but I ask them whether or not this is going to also hit \ntheir elderly population as strongly as it is going to hit those in \nConnecticut. I ask my colleague from Washington if she would care to \ncomment on this.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Connecticut. He has hit \nexactly why I am so saddened and concerned by this budget proposal that \nobviously has the numbers and will pass this Congress this week.\n  He has pointed out to us who is going to be hurt in this budget, and \nit certainly is middle class, average Americans. And they are going to \nsee it everywhere. It is for people like me before I came to this body, \nwho are responsible for raising their kids and taking care of their \nparents and earning middle-income salaries, who are going to feel the \neffects. Their kids will not be able to go to college; they will not be \nable to afford it. Programs in their schools will be gone. Goals 2000, \nthe one hope we have given to kids that we were going to try to improve \ntheir education, parents will see that removed for their children.\n  The young families who are worried about their aging parents on \nMedicare not only have to worry about the costs to their parents going \nup by $3,200, as my colleague has pointed out, but those families that \nare trying to rush \n\n[[Page S 9363]]\n\nto work and care for their kids and worry about their education are \ngoing to receive increased calls from their parents saying: Can you \nhelp me out? I cannot get to the doctor today. I just cannot afford it. \nThat burden and that stress is going to come out in every walk of our \nfamilies' lives.\n  And who will bear the real brunt of that stress as we go through this \nwill be the children. So much we hear about children on this floor and \nwhy they need a balanced budget. Well, the stress that is put on our \nkids, the loss to them is really going to be felt, and I think it is a \nsad day.\n  I think my colleague from Connecticut would agree with me.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask my colleague from Wisconsin if he would care to \ncomment on this as well.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleague. I have had a very nice week here, \nmeeting some of my constituents from Wisconsin, my home State, a lot of \nkids with farm backgrounds, rural backgrounds, kids from Future Farmers \nof America and 4-H. These are all groups that have helped produce the \nbackbone of our State throughout our history and it continues today, \nwith the very hard times of farm families.\n  The interesting thing I noted was that the concern was consistent \nwith regard to the rural kids and the urban kids. Their question was, \nwhat is this budget going to do to my opportunity to go to college? \nWhat is this going to mean in terms of student loans, in terms of Pell \ngrants?\n  It is bad enough as it is. Families even before we started looking at \nthe Republican budget were worried sick about paying for college \neducation, even at a State institution such as the University of \nWisconsin. When I went to the University of Wisconsin, a 4-year \neducation with all the trimmings, the apartment, everything, the food, \nthe whole thing was only $10,000.\n  We thought that was quite a bit of money in those days. Now you \ncannot even get a year at most institutions--maybe just tuition--for \nthat.\n  So they asked me: What is going to happen in the budget? And I had to \ntell them that there were three areas that were being completely \nprotected by the Republican budget, a small portion of which would have \ntaken care of all those issues having to do with student loans and a \nlot of other things that the Senator from Washington has mentioned.\n  Let me just mention what I like to call three sacred cows, because I \ncome from a State where cows are very important, but these are sacred \ncows. And the first sacred cow is a $245 billion tax cut\n that has been sealed in this budget resolution. As the Senator from \nConnecticut has pointed out, $245 million just dwarfs the amount of \nmoney that is needed to restore some of the family issues we are \ntalking about. These cuts are proven to be not necessary in most cases \nby the very reality that the Republicans feel compelled to deliver a \nhuge tax cut at the same time when this horrible sacrifice is being \nasked of our young people who are just asking for a decent future and \nthe opportunity to come out of college without being hopefully in debt \nor maybe not being able to go to college.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I put up this chart for the benefit of my colleagues. The \nSenator talked about the equity of approving this $245 billion tax cut \nwhile we are asking seniors and students to sacrifice greatly. Today, \nif you are 45 years of age and you have a parent who is maybe 65 and \nyou have a child around 10, you are looking at a train wreck in your \nfamily as that child reaches the age of 18 and your parent reaches the \nage of 70 or 75, when their health care problems are going to become \nmore pronounced and your child wants to go get an education. You are \nlooking at an incredible increase in out-of-pocket expenses for tuition \nand health care.\n  Then look at who gets the $245 billion tax cut. Now, if you make \nbetween zero and $30,000, you can expect a $124 tax cut. That is a \ngreat tax cut you get. If you go to the other end here, and you make in \nexcess of $350,000, you get a $20,000 tax cut. Now, I ask my colleagues \nfrom Washington and Wisconsin, would they explain the fairness of this \nto me? Why would we give a tax cut, 51 percent of which goes to the top \n10 percent of income earners in this country? Why are you going after \nMedicare and education? Can anyone explain to me what the logic of that \nis? Where is the balance in that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, \nthere is no fairness in it. And the only way they are getting away with \nit is if the American people do not find out what is being done here. \nWe found out what we have to do on the floor of the Senate. We have to \nsay it over and over again on the floor of the Senate. That is what we \nare going to do. I have done that since last December, when I found out \nwhat the plans were for the crown jewel of the Republican contract: To \ndeliver this tax cut even though the American people are not falling \nfor it and even though it is totally unfair.\n  Mr. DODD. Are those the Senator's words, ``the crown jewel''?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No, Mr. President, I believe they are the words of the \nSpeaker of the other House. That is the most important provision--not \nbalancing the budget, not regulatory reform, not term limits, not \nschool prayer. The most important thing, the crown jewel, is delivering \na tax cut for upper-income people. All the American people should be \naware of that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, can the \nSenator from Connecticut tell us how much money you will get back if \nyou earn, say, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, under this tax cut?\n  Mr. DODD. I said from zero to $30,000, you get $124. If you make \nbetween $30,000 and $75,000, you get $760. You divide that by 10 or 12, \nyou get some idea. You are talking about $70, $80 a month as opposed to \nthose--look at the $200,000 category; $11,000 back. I mean, I am dying \nfor someone to explain what is the justification of that kind of \nimbalance--why you go after Medicare, go after education, and go after \nthe earned-income tax credit--the tax credit we offered to lower-income \nworking people in this country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, what really is \nunfair is those people who are only going to get $760 back are the ones \nwho are going to see all of the impacts to their family. Their kids \nwill not be able to go to college. Their out-of-pocket expenses for \nhealth care are going to go up dramatically. They are going to see \nreal-life costs to them. They are not going to see $760. They will have \nto pay more for doctors visits and more for their kid's education. They \nare going to see more costs to them. And then they are going to turn \naround to their neighbors, wealthier neighbors, and see them benefit \ndramatically from this budget proposal.\n  Mr. DODD. When the Senator mentions that, I presume $30,000 to \n$75,000 is thought of as middle-income in this country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. They do not qualify for Pell grants. If you are very poor, \nyou get some assistance in that education. If you are very affluent and \nget that kind of a tax break, you do not need it. God help you if you \nfall into the middle, where you foot the bill on your own. Here you get \nabout a $75-a-month tax break, while you are watching $3,000 increases \nfor one child over the life of this budget, and God help you if you \nhave a parent you are helping to take care of. That is an additional \n$3,400 over the life of the budget coming out of your pocket, I \npresume, given the category of these people. There is $760 for you in a \ntax break, while those at the upper-income levels--God bless them, I do \nnot fault them. The people of my State who fall into this upper-income \ncategory are scratching their heads. They have said to me over and over \nagain: Why are we getting a tax cut? You know, with all due respect, we \nare doing well. If deficit reduction is the name of the game, why did \nyou not scrap this tax cut idea and get about the business of deficit \nreduction and minimize the hardship to working families?\n  I never had one wealthy person yet say they are dying for that tax \ncut.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This is the same experience I have had in Wisconsin. I \nlike to think the people in Wisconsin have the best common sense of any \nState in the 50 States. It sounds as if this common sense is \neverywhere. It does not matter if I go to the Rotary Club or a United \nFarm Workers hall or to a farm or the city, everybody is saying the \nsame thing: We do not need this tax cut. Business people, the leading \nCEO's of my State, are against the tax cut. These are the people who \nhave been the \n\n[[Page S 9364]]\nleading advocates many times for tax cuts. But they have the \nrealization, because they have to meet the bottom line in their \nbusiness, that it is not the right time from any point of view, \neconomic or from the point of view of fairness, to do this.\n  The analogy I like to use is this is kind of like a family that \nrealized it cannot make the house payment. Things are tight. They sit \ndown together and they figure out what they have to do to balance their \nhome budget. They get it done, and they are happy. This is like going \nout an hour later and buying $10,000 worth of new furniture. That is, \nin effect, what this is. That is why these CEO's agree with our blue-\ncollar people. This does not make any sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Wisconsin has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DODD. I would ask that we have 1 additional minute to give the \nSenator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Washington a chance to \nrespond.\n  Mr. EXON. I compliment my three colleagues for the excellent \npresentation. I yield them an additional 5 minutes, and ask them to \ndivide that up. I am only doing this because we are running out of \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. My colleague from Washington--I said \nabout $75 or $80 a month. I notice she has done the math. The Senator \nfrom Washington is probably a lot better as a student of math. What \ndoes this actually work out to be for the people in that middle-income \ncategory?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Someone earning between $30,000 and $75,000 will get \nback $14.62 a week. I have to tell my colleagues that I have had a \nnumber of families say to me: I know I have to pay my taxes, but I want \nsomething in return. And what I want in return is to know that my kids \nare going to get a good education, to know that my parents are going to \nbe taken care of when they are sick and elderly and dependent on me. I \nwant a quality of life. For $14.62 back, I will give that back to the \nGovernment.\n  But we are not giving it back to them. We are taking everything \naway--their education, their care for their parents, and their \nsecurity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues as well, because this is \nnot a debate about whether or not we ought to reduce the deficit or \nwhether or not we ought to balance the budget, but what path we should \nfollow and what priorities we should set to represent best the diverse \npopulation of our country. We are all committed to achieving a balanced \nbudget. But the question is, how can we achieve this goal over a \nsimilar period of time without imposing this kind of burden on the very \npeople who fight the wars and pay the taxes, and raise their families?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I believe \nthat the budget could be balanced earlier than the Republicans say they \nwant to balance it if we do not do this tax cut. I mentioned two other \nsacred cows. If we do something about the exponential growth in \nloopholes, tax loopholes, a 24-percent growth. There are hundreds of \nbillions of dollars available there if we simply slow the growth--the \nsame language the Republicans use when they talk about slowing the \ngrowth in Medicare and Medicaid. What about slowing the growth in \ncorporate loopholes?\n  Third, the Republican budget not only does not touch defense, it \nincreases the Defense Department. So that is the question of priorities \nthat the Senator from Connecticut is pointing out, and the Senator from \nWashington. We have here protecting defense, protecting loopholes, and \nprotecting tax cuts as the three sacred crows that come ahead of kids \nand seniors and families. And that is what this budget is all about.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as I stated many times, we are all in \nthis body working to get to a balanced budget. I spent 2 years on the \nBudget Committee doing that. It was difficult, but we were moving \ntoward it.\n  I say to my colleagues, $245 billion in tax cuts, if we took that \nback, would go a long ways in helping kids get education and caring for \nour senior citizens.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleagues' comments on all of those \npoints. Again, to sort of reiterate where we are in all of this, Mr. \nPresident, we are not making up these numbers. These are the \nassumptions we are told will be the case.\n  Seniors' Medicare costs up $3,400 over the life of this budget. That \nis in addition to what they are presently paying. And they are not in \nthe upper-income categories. The median income is $17,000.\n  We are going to watch elementary and secondary education cuts hit 65 \nmillion children. We are looking at veterans who are going to get \nserious cuts. My colleague, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nhas talked eloquently about what happens to veterans here.\n  We are going to watch student loans go up $3,000 a year over the life \nof this budget and, again, that may not seem like much to the people \nwith sharp pencils in this town, but it is a great deal to the millions \nof middle-income families that struggle every year to make ends meet. \nLike fingernails on a blackboard, they hear about a $245 billion tax \ncut, the bulk of which goes to people who, frankly, do not have these \nkinds of problems, and will be the first to tell you so. These families \ndo not have a Medicare problem. They do not have a student loan \nproblem. They do not have a problem trying to hold down a job. And they \nare the ones, if they were in this Chamber, who would tell you, \n``Senators, scrap your tax cut; get about deficit reduction and make \nthis a shared burden.''\n  Mr. President, we urge this budget be rethought. The President has \nput a proposal on the table. He has asked the distinguished majority \nleader, and others, to consider his offer. Frankly, there has been \nnothing but silence in response to it, after all the clamoring about \nhow the President suggested we get to balance. He gives a response, and \nnow there is silence on the other side.\n  We need to come together on these issues and find a commonsense \napproach that would minimize the burden--not eliminate it. We all know \nthat burdens have to be borne--but they can be minimized if we share \nthe pain equally among those across the spectrum of this country who \nmake this a great and vibrant Nation. Average, working families must \nwonder sincerely why it is, once again, they are being asked to bear \nthe heaviest part of this burden; why we reward, we absolutely reward, \nthose who are in the least need of relief.\n  So we urge the rejection of this budget, and we hope that there will \nbe some rethinking of spending priorities as the appropriations and \nreconciliation process proceeds.\n  I thank both of my colleagues for their comments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer some comments on the \nconference report of the concurrent budget resolution.\n  After several months, the blueprint for the 1996 fiscal year budget \nis before us.\n  Though the specifics of that budget will take a good portion of the \nrest of the summer to be revealed, the budget outline before the body \ndoes give us a good idea of what the priorities of the Republican \nleadership are for our country.\n  Mr. President, I share the goal of a balanced Federal budget.\n  That has been my highest priority since first coming to the Senate.\n  But other priorities as provided in this budget are deeply flawed, \nand even the broadly shared goal of a balanced Federal budget is very \nmuch at risk because of the fundamental defects of the resolution.\n  Others have made eloquent statements about who will be shouldering \nthe burdens imposed by this budget resolution, and the evidence is \ncompelling that working families will bear the brunt of the cuts \nproposed by this budget.\n  But perhaps as revealing of this budget's priorities as identifying \nwhere the cuts fall is to examine where they do not.\n  While this budget cuts almost every area of the Federal budget, as it \nshould if we are to achieve a balanced budget, three items--three \nsacred cows--are off the cutting table, exempted from the shared pain \nthat is necessary to balance the budget.\n  The first is defense spending. Far from cutting an already bloated \ndefense budget, this resolution actually provides a $58 billion \nincrease.\n\n[[Page S 9365]]\n\n  This lavish level of spending comes despite the end of the cold war, \nand despite the massive reductions that are being made to the programs \nthat provide health care to the elderly, poor, and disabled--Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  Second, this budget fails to adequately address what may be the \nfastest growing entitlement program in this resolution--the tax \nloopholes that often benefit the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations in this country.\n  While this budget squeezes savings out of programs for veterans, \nfarmers, students, and the disabled, it seems that the explosive growth \nin spending done through the Tax Code for the rich and powerful--\nalready $400 billion annually--is to remain virtually unchecked.\n  Mr. President, the third area--the third sacred cow--is the $245 \nbillion tax cut included in the budget.\n  With annual budget deficits of $200 billion staring us in the face, \nthe tax cut can only be described as reckless and fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  The political calculus that produced this monstrosity could only have \ntaken place in the murkier regions inside the Washington beltway.\n  Certainly my constituents in Wisconsin do not buy it, and this \nskepticism is shared across the Nation.\n  Poll after poll show that the American people strongly feel that \nreducing the deficit is more important than a tax cut.\n  The authors of the tax cut seem to have a poor opinion of the \nAmerican people.\n  They reason that the Nation needs a bribe in order to accept the \nsevere cuts to Medicare and other provisions of the Republican agenda.\n  The American people want a budget that cuts fairly, that shares the \npain fairly.\n  They rightfully resent being treated like children who are promised \nice cream if they eat their spinach.\n  Mr. President, more than any other feature of this budget, the $245 \nbillion tax cut jeopardizes our ability to reach a balanced Federal \nbudget.\n  This Nation has been asked to make great sacrifices in order that we \nmight finally get our fiscal house in order.\n  And the American people are ready to make those sacrifices.\n  Mr. President, the American people are willing to accept cuts in even \nthe most popular programs because they recognize the need for shared \nsacrifice in order to balance the Federal budget.\n  But when they see a budget resolution that includes a $245 billion \ntax cut, they will rightly ask if they are being asked to sacrifice to \nprevent our enormous budget deficits from burdening their children and \ngrandchildren, or to provide politically motivated tax cuts--tax cuts \nthat will almost certainly be distributed disproportionately to the \nrichest in our society.\n  The great tragedy of this resolution is that it may very well \nsquander the greatest asset we have in the fight to eliminate the \ndeficit, namely, the willingness of the American people to share in the \nsacrifices needed to balance the budget.\n  Sometimes I am amazed at the strength of character of our Nation.\n  After the social upheaval of the 1960's, after the assault made on \nour Constitution during the Watergate era, after the fiscal self-\nindulgence of the 1980's, after the gridlock of the early 1990's, and \nafter the failed promise to finally achieve comprehensive health care \nfor everyone that could never be taken away, the American people are \nstill willing to endure significant burdens to achieve a balanced \nbudget.\n  After all that has happened during the last 30 years to undermine \ntheir trust, they are still willing to follow leaders who ask the \nentire community for sacrifice.\n  The tax cut and this budget betray that trust.\n  It is a return to the politics of division, selfishness, and greed--\nthe politics of the past.\n  I very much hope to support the individual appropriations and \nreconciliation bills that will come to the floor.\n  It is through those bills that the real work of deficit reduction is \ndone, and I want to support efforts that move us toward the goal of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I also recognize that the budget resolution before us is only a broad \noutline of how we will proceed, that nothing binds the committees to \nany specific action.\n  To that end, I especially look forward to working with many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to stop this irresponsible tax \ncut.\n  But I must also say that we have missed a great opportunity in this \nbudget resolution to provide the American people with a package of \nspending cuts that is fair, and that achieves a balanced Federal \nbudget, even before the year 2002 at which the authors of this budget \nare aiming.\n  The flaws in this resolution are real, and they may well be \ninsurmountable.\n  The budget sacrifices are not distributed fairly, and the budget \nwindfalls are given to a privileged few.\n  The inequities are obvious and will be keenly felt.\n  Mr. President, it need not have been that way.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 30 seconds on my \ntime?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield for 30 seconds on his time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to compliment my colleagues, \nSenator Dodd from Connecticut, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, and \nSenator Murray from Washington, for an excellent presentation. I hope \nthat Senators heard their presentation so that they will cast their \nvotes the way I would like to see them cast their votes sometime this \nafternoon. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the profligate spending party of the past 40 \nyears is over. What we are talking about today is fiscal responsibility \nto assure our children's future. This will be a debate today on a \ncritical piece of legislation, the blueprint which will lead this \nNation to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  I never really thought I would see the day that I would have the \nopportunity to vote for such a balanced budget, but here it is today. \nAnd that is what really is at stake here. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to take advantage of this unprecedented agreement between the \nHouse and the Senate and fulfill this promise to the American people. \nDemocrats and Republicans should vote for this, and I ask you to think \nabout it: Do you want to be on record against the first opportunity in \nmore than a generation to put the Federal Government on a path toward \nfiscal responsibility and a balanced budget? I hope the answer is that \nyou would want to be for that effort.\n  Before I get into responding to some of the things that have just \nbeen said and making some other comments, I must, once again, commend \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici. He showed, once again, his wise New Mexico wisdom. He was \npatient. He was diligent. He had to make some changes, some concessions \nhe did not always support, but he always did it in a very responsible \nand honest way. We would not be here today with this resolution, this \nhistoric resolution, without the leadership of Senator Domenici, and I \ncommend him for it.\n  Congressman Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee in the \nHouse, has been a dynamic force, an energetic force. The two of them \ntogether have moved this process forward. They have shown real \nleadership. I think their names will go down in history as the great \nleaders that turned this country around and headed it toward fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  It was just stated a moment ago that there had been criticism of the \nPresident's original budget. Yes, there had been, because it allowed \nfor $200 billion deficits or more as far as the eye could see, and \nthere were a number of other problems with it.\n  But then when his second plan came in, it was suggested that there \nhas been silence. As a matter of fact, there has not been silence. Many \nRepublicans pointed out, rightfully so, that this was his second plan \nof the year; that his numbers were not based on CBO analyses, as he had \nsaid in the State of the Union Address a year ago that he would always \ndo, although I understand now he has come around to saying, yes, we \nwill go with CBO; and also the fact of the matter is his 10-year plan, \nwhich goes out 3 years farther than this resolution, still would not \n\n[[Page S 9366]]\nget us to a balanced budget. We would still have deficits after 10 \nyears of an estimated $200 billion or more.\n  But, the noise you heard on this budget, as a matter of fact, did not \nreally come from this side of the aisle; it came from the other side. \nThere was screaming about the fact that the President validated the \nfact that we should be working together for a balanced budget, No. 1. \nHe validated the fact that we can get a balanced budget while giving \nthe people some tax relief, some needed and justified tax relief, and \nhe also validated the fact that we have to do something to preserve and \nprotect Medicare.\n  That is what the President did, and we commended him for validating \nthose three very important points. But the screaming has been coming \nfrom the same people who are now saying, ``Oh, we don't want this \nparticular budget resolution.''\n  It is very simple: Do you want to get to a balanced budget or not? Do \nyou want fiscal responsibility or not? If you do, you have to make some \ntough choices. Surely, we could all go down the list and say, ``Don't \ncut anything that affects my State. Don't cut anything that would \naffect me or my mother or maybe even my children.'' You could say, \n``Oh, we can't make any changes in education.''\n  And what about veterans? As a matter of fact, the number that is in \nthis budget resolution is the same number requested by the President of \nthe United States. Same number.\n  They do not want to make improvements and corrections in the solvency \nproblem for Medicare. They do not want to touch Medicaid. I have a \ncouple of differences with this resolution--one is I would like to \nmaybe soften the blow to agriculture. But I am voting for it. This \ndifference is not stopping me. Opponents of this resolution, though, \nare trying to find little disagreements to excuse not supporting the \nresolution.\n  The bottom line is, they do not want to do anything about controlling \nspending. They want to continue the same old stuff that we have been \ndealing with for years in Washington, and that is spending more and \nmore and more of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  What I heard in the discussion a moment ago is, ``Oh, what we need to \nbe doing is close the tax loopholes.'' In Washington, when the people \nare allowed to keep their own money, it is called a tax expenditure, \nand when you want to raise taxes you say, ``Let's close tax \nloopholes.'' Do not forget that that is what closing a tax loophole is, \nthat is raising somebody's taxes. I would like to ask you, which tax \nwould you propose to increase? Medical deductions? No, you would not \nwant that. Would you want to eliminate the home mortgage interest \ndeduction? ``No, no, we didn't mean that.'' Are you talking about \nresearch and development?\n  There is a long list of good and worthy opportunities for the people \nto keep their own hard-earned tax dollars that some people call tax \nloopholes.\n  My tax cut would maybe be somebody else's tax loophole, and vice \nversa. We already tried the tax increase side. That was done 2 years \nago, over my objections and a lot of others. We have already had a \nwhopping tax increase. Now it is time we face the music and deal \nresponsibly with controlling the rate of growth in spending, and that \nis what this resolution does.\n  It has been said on the other side this morning that this balanced \nbudget plan slashes Medicare. The President's own Medicare board of \ntrustees came up here and said if we do not do something, there is \ngoing to be a solvency problem, including his own Secretary of HHS. I \nthink three of the trustees were from the President's own Cabinet.\n  What we are talking about here is preserving and improving and \nprotecting Medicare. We are talking about controlling the rate of \ngrowth. We are concerned about the shaky state of Medicare. So what we \nwould do over the period of years is have some reforms, give our senior \ncitizens some greater opportunities for choices on their own, while \nallowing Medicare to grow up to a gross figure of $345 billion over the \nnext 7 years.\n  Where I come from, when it grows over 7 years by $345 billion, that \nis not a cut. But still, the numbers are so big. Let us put it in \npersonal terms. What does it mean for an individual? Our resolution \nwould allow each Medicare beneficiary to have their benefits for \nMedicare grow from $4,816 in 1995 to $6,334 in the year 2002. That is a \n40 percent increase over 7 years.\n  So we are going to make some changes in Medicare and Medicaid. We are \ngoing to try to control the rate of growth in Medicaid. We are going to \ntry to improve those programs. But it is blatantly unfair to say that \nwe are going to slash Medicare. It is not true.\n  Now, about the statement that was made here a few moments ago that \nour kids will not be able to go to college because of this balanced-\nbudget plan. The changes in the loan program do not even apply to \nundergraduate students. It would only be applicable, under the \nassumptions in this resolution, to graduate, law, and medical students.\n  Kids will be able to go to college. I worked for 2 years for a \nuniversity in placement and financial aid. I worked with low-income and \npoor people, because that is all we have in my State of Mississippi. We \nare going to have grants available to these students, two or three \ndifferent kinds of loan programs, such as the direct loan, NDSL, as \nwell as the GSL loan program. There will still be funds for work study \nand for scholarships. We want to encourage this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some \ninformation on college costs, how they would be impacted by this \nresolution along with some charts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         College Costs Reduced Under Balanced Budget Resolution\n\n       Here are the facts! Under the Conference agreement, \n     students will receive $26.6 billion in loans in 1996. The \n     level of available loans will continue to rise to $33 billion \n     in 2000. Over the next five years $151.4 billion in student \n     loans will be available.\n       The Conference agreement will not limit access to student \n     loans. According to CBO, availability of loans for students, \n     at much lower costs than what they could receive in the \n     consumer market, will not be limited in any way under this \n     agreement.\n       In 1995, the federal government will pay in-school interest \n     costs for loans totaling close to $15 billion. Approximately \n     87 percent of these loans go to undergraduates. Under this \n     budget plan, the federal government will continue to pay \n     these interest costs--no changes.\n       Under this agreement, there will be no changes from current \n     law regarding caps on student loan interest rates, loan \n     limits, federal guarantee of loans, repayment options, or \n     conditions for deferral of repayment.\n       For the typical graduate, professional--medical and law \n     students who may have increased costs under this plan, none \n     will see increases greater than $1 dollar a month on average, \n     in their repayment.\n       Less than 10 percent of the reforms will affect \n     undergraduates while they are in school. For undergraduates, \n     their repayment costs may increase $1 per month, on average, \n     as well.\n\n    UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT BORROWS A TOTAL OF $10,000 OVER 4 YEARS IN    \nSUBSIDIZED STUDENT LOANS AND REPAYS ACCORDING TO A STANDARD 10-YEAR PLAN\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Senate              \n                                        Current    balanced             \n                                          law       budget    Difference\n                                                  resolution            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal principal amount borrowed...    $10,000     $10,000           0\nAmount used to pay fees..............        400         450       +$100\nAmount, available to pay education                                      \n costs over 10 yrs...................      9,600       9,500        -100\nOriginal principal amount at                                            \n repayment...........................     10,000      10,000           0\nAccrued interest during 6-month grace                                   \n period..............................          0         330        +330\nTotal principal amount at repayment..     10,000      10,330        +330\nRepayment at standard 10-year monthly                                   \n payment.............................        123         124          +1\nCummulative repayment................     14,702      14,844        +142\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  MEDICAL STUDENT BORROWS A TOTAL OF $30,000 OVER 4 YEARS IN SUBSIDIZED \n STUDENT LOANS AND REPAYS ACCORDING TO A STANDARD 10-YEAR PLAN OR A 20- \n                           YEAR GRADUATED PLAN                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Senate              \n                                        Current    balanced             \n                                          law       budget    Difference\n                                                  resolution            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal principal amount borrowed...    $30,000     $30,000           0\nTotal principal amount at repayment..     30,000      35,033    +$85,033\nRepayment at standard 10-year monthly                                   \n payment.............................        368         399         +31\nCumulative repayment.................     44,160      47,824      +3,444\nRepayment at 20 year, graduated plan                                    \n monthly payment.....................    \\1\\ 267     \\1\\ 268          +1\nCumulative repayment.................     63,829      64,395       +566 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Average payment.                                                    \n\n  Mr. LOTT. There are a couple of points I should make here. Again, \none, it would not apply to undergraduate college students. Second, for \nthe typical graduate student, who may have increased costs under this \nplan, none will increase greater than $1 a month, on average, in their \nrepayment, which does not even begin until they graduate. Now, most law \nstudents and \n\n[[Page S 9367]]\nevery medical student, when they graduate, could afford to pay back \ntheir loans, which they should do, with a little more responsibility \nwith the in-school interest.\n  Now, if I had my choice, would I have included that? No. But \neverybody has to be able to ante up and kick in a little bit here. You \nhave to do your part. You cannot say, do it in Nebraska, or do it in \nNew York, or do it somewhere else, do not affect me. You have to make \nthe tough choices. But you get something in return. When you talk about \ncollege students and being able to help your children go to school, \nwhat is the best thing you can do? Pass this resolution, show fiscal \nresponsibility, give some tax relief, and do you know what will happen? \nThe Fed will lower interest rates. The quickest way to help senior \ncitizens living on a fixed income, or parents that want kids to go to \ncollege, is to be able to get the money they need at a lower, \naffordable interest rate. We are talking about real help in the future \nby controlling spending and by taking actions that will lead to \nresponsibility in the way our programs are run, and will also lead to \nlower interest rates.\n  I think this is a real vision for the future. We are not talking \nabout draconian cuts. We will still have $12 trillion spent over the \nnext 7 years. We are cutting $1 trillion. When I try to explain to the \npeople in Pascagoula, MS, or Hazelhurst, MS, $1 trillion, what is it? \nHow much is it? That is what happens to us around here. We start \ntalking billions and trillions, and it is not even real it is so big. \nWe are talking about controlling that rate of growth. We will spend \n$894 billion less by controlling wasteful Government spending.\n  Let us talk about this tax cut item a little bit. First of all, \nsometimes I wonder who among us speaks for the working, tax paying \npeople in this country--in my State, the shipyard worker, International \nPaper worker, the farmer, the small businessman and women. Everybody \nsays, ``We do not need to give tax relief.'' When I was growing up, we \ndid not even have any rich people in my home county. One guy had a \nCadillac. I am the son of a blue-collar shipyard working, pipe fitting \nunion member. I am worried about that guy, and my mother, by the way. I \nwill not go down the list here. Everybody says, ``We do not want tax \ncuts.''\n  Which one of these tax cuts do you not want that is assumed in this \nbill? How about a spousal IRA? How about letting the working mother in \nthe home be able to have a little opportunity for an individual \nretirement account when she gets old, or maybe when her husband is \ndeceased? Is anybody against that? No. You will not rise against that. \nAnd then how about getting rid of the marriage penalty. Can anybody \nexplain to me why, when you get married, a couple pays more taxes, even \nthough they make the same income? I have been hearing for 10 years in \nCongress that we are going to get rid of the marriage penalty. It is \nstill in there. Does anybody want to stand up and speak against that \nfairness change in the Tax Code?\n  How about a little help for families with children? The $500 per \nchild tax credit. Let the parents choose how they should spend money on \nclothes, food, or education. How come our maternalistic government in \nWashington can decide what should be best for you in education, or all \nthese other decisions involving your children. How about letting the \nparents make that choice? That is one way we can help with education. \nLet the parents keep their own money for a change, for Heaven's sake.\n  And there is one other way that we can reduce this deficit. It is \ncalled growth, incentives that create jobs, and opportunities. Again, \nin my State, you cut the capital gains tax rate on timber and watch \nwhat happens. Yes, some of the big landowners get some benefit, but you \nknow who will get the first benefit? That guy driving a raggedy old \npulpwood truck that has slick tires on it and probably not even a tag \nbecause he gets to get the timber out of the woods. It will turn things \nover in the county. People will buy and sell. Again, it will have a \npositive impact on interest rates, and it will create the jobs we need.\n  How about senior citizen relief? All the worrying about trying to \nimprove Medicare--how about if we let people that are 66 years of age \nthat want to keep working be able to do it without a tax penalty, or \nwithout a penalty by taking away Social Security benefits?\n  So go down the list and come over here and tell me you do not like \nthese tax cuts that are fair and will provide growth and development \nand activity in our economy.\n  So I think the number we have in terms of tax relief is not as much \nas I would like to have, but it is enough that we can go up to that \n$245 billion and provide this relief I have just talked about.\n  I would like to have more in this budget resolution for defense. I am \non the Armed Services Committee. I serve with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I do not really like the defense number. I want more. \nBut let me emphasize this. In this budget resolution, over the next 7 \nyears, defense spending continues to go down, and over 7 years will go \ndown $19 billion. But defense also made its contribution. I will \nconclude, since my time is expiring.\n  We are talking about balancing the books. This resolution will do it. \nLet us pass it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes of our time to my fine \ncolleague from the State of Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I rise in opposition to this budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, the conference report on House Concurrent Resolution \n67, the budget resolution, proposes close to $1 trillion in deficit \nreduction over the next 7 years. Substantial deficit reduction is the \nright objective, in part, because of another large number, $4.8 \ntrillion in national debt.\n  The Federal Government cannot continue on its current path. Unless we \nface our budget problems, by 2030 the Federal Government will consume \nover 37 percent of our total gross domestic product. Unless we change, \nby that year, budget deficits would amount to 18 percent of our overall \neconomy. And unless we change, by that year, more than $1 out of every \n$4 the Federal Government spends will go to paying interest on the \nnational debt.\n  We must face our budget problems, and we must act now. That is the \nonly way to meet our obligation to our children and to the future. We \nhave no right to leave future generations of Americans a legacy of \ndebt. We have no right to send them the bill for what we have already \nconsumed. Most of all, we have no right to leave as our legacy a future \nof impaired economic growth and diminished opportunities for individual \nAmericans and for our Nation as a whole. I supported the balanced \nbudget amendment for this reason.\n  There is now bipartisan agreement in the Congress on the need for \nsubstantial deficit reduction. There is no dispute between the Congress \nand the President on the importance of that objective. Despite the \nconsensus on making deficit reduction our top priority objective, \nhowever, there is not universal, bipartisan, support for this budget \nresolution.\n  The principal reason for that, of course, is the priorities this \nbudget sets are the wrong ones. This resolution trumpets deficit \nreduction, but, in the details, goes on to hamstring that goal by \nproviding for $245 billion in tax cuts over the next 7 years. A tax cut \nnow, however, is just fiscal foolishness. Tax cuts can not reduce \ndeficits. Tax cuts can not stop the explosion of our national debt that \nhas already driven it from the $1 trillion level to $4.8 trillion in \njust the last 15 years. And tax cuts do nothing to reverse the fiscal \ntrends that are driving us towards fiscal bankruptcy and eventual \neconomic collapse.\n  Anybody who is paying attention to our budget situation knows that a \ntax cut now works against achieving lasting, meaningful deficit \nreduction. As the Chicago Tribune put it in a recent editorial, ``this \nis filling the hole by digging it deeper.''\n  The tax cut, however, is not the only reason to question this \nresolution's commitment to real deficit reduction. It sets priorities \nthat do real harm to our national interest.\n  How we bring back fiscal discipline makes a real difference. If we \ncare about our children, if we care about our future, if we care about \nour Nation and ensuring an opportunity for every American to achieve \nthe American Dream, we cannot abandon our commitment to education, to \naccess to \n\n[[Page S 9368]]\nhealth care, and to creating economic opportunity.\n  Deficit reduction that does not reflect these priorities is not real \ndeficit reduction at all. It amounts to accounting gamesmanship. It is \nhiding the deficit by, in effect, moving it off budget. But the deficit \nis still there. It may come off the books of the Federal Government, \nbut it has simply been placed on the backs of the American people.\n  The budget resolution's education proposals illustrate how misplaced \nits priorities are. Under this resolution:\n  Four million college students from working American families will \nhave their college costs increased by over $3,000 because they will now \nhave to pay interest on their loans even while they are in school; \nanother one million college students could lose their college aid or \nhave it drastically reduced because of cuts in the Pell Grant Program; \n550,000 preschoolers could be dropped from the Head Start Program; and \n3,000 American schools will lose funding they need to prepare our \nstudents to meet and beat the ever-increasing international competition \nwe are facing.\n  Think about the impact these cuts will have on American families. Do \nyou think they would prefer a tax cut, or that they would prefer that \ntheir children have the opportunity to get the education they need? Do \nyou think they would prefer spending scarce public resources on more B-\n2 bombers that have no real mission and that the Defense Department has \nsaid are not needed, or do you think they might prefer to avoid \nimposing $3,000 in additional college loan expense on each of their \nchildren who attend college? Do you think they will agree that real \ndeficit reduction has been achieved and that we have met our obligation \nto the future if their children are denied educational opportunity, and \nare less able to achieve the American Dream?\n  The answer to all of these questions is obvious. Education, like the \nrationale for deficit reduction, is all about the future. American \nfamilies know that education is the key to a better life. They know a \ncollege graduate earns almost twice as much annually as a high school \ngraduate, and that students who earn a professional degree have an \naverage income that is six times higher than students who do not finish \nhigh school. And those higher incomes do not just benefit the students; \nthey benefit the entire country. Because the fact is that we are all \nlinked together. A better educated work force works smarter and \nproduces more. The economy is therefore more productive, and generates \nhigher economic growth. And the result of that is that the United \nStates competes more effectively in world markets.\n  Education is clearly an essential investment in our country's future, \nas well as the future of our children. Laura Tyson, in her hearing \nbefore the Banking Committee when she was nominated to be chairman of \nthe Council of Economic Advisors, said that a country's only real, \nenduring assets are its people. Failing to invest in our people by \ncutting our investment in education is neither in our national interest \nnor in the interest of\n Americans individually. It is simply wrong, and it has no place in \nthis budget proposal.\n\n  Medicare and Medicaid are another illustration of the misplaced \npriorities reflected in this resolution. The proponents of this budget \nmake much of the fact that, even with the cuts of $270 billion in \nMedicare, and $182 billion in Medicaid, Medicare spending will grow \nfrom $178 billion this year to $274 billion in 2002, and Medicaid \nspending will grow from $90 billion this year to over $124 billion in \nthe year 2002. They argue that they are therefore not cutting Medicare \nor Medicaid at all; rather, they are simply reducing the growth rate of \nthese two programs.\n  However, that argument is more than a little disingenuous. There is \nno question that senior citizens and many other Americans will have to \nspend substantially more out of their own pockets for health care--or \ngo without care--because of this budget resolution. If the cuts are \nevenly distributed between health care providers and beneficiaries, \nAmerican seniors would face an additional $860 in out-of-pocket health \ncare costs in the year 2002, and the typical senior citizen would have \nto pay $3,345 more over the next 7 years. That certainly sounds like a \ncut to me.\n  Medicaid would be turned into a block grant, and turned over to the \nStates. The growth rate in Medicaid spending would be cut from its \ncurrent 10.5-percent level to around 4 percent. And what that means is \nthat States would likely have to reduce the number of people helped by \nMedicaid by an average of 7.6 percent. That, too is a real cut.\n  The truth is that the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid are clearly \ncuts when you look at them from the viewpoint of individual Americans, \ninstead of a Government balance sheet. Again, deficits are not really \neliminated; they are simply moved from the Federal balance sheet to the \nbalance sheet of American families.\n  Medicare and Medicaid must be reformed, but this budget does not \nprovide that reform. This budget does nothing to cut health care \ninflation, which would help Americans and save the Federal Government \nmoney. It does nothing to preserve access to health care, or to \npreserve the quality of care. And it does nothing to ensure that people \nare able to continue choosing their own doctor. What it does do is to \ngive the American people just what the proponents of this resolution \nsaid that they opposed last year when they filibustered comprehensive \nhealth care reform on the floor--less health care at higher cost, lower \nquality care and less choice.\n  Americans know that reducing budget\n   deficits has to affect them. They don't expect it to be cost-free. \nThey do, however, expect it to be fair; they do expect every American \nto do their part.\n\n  Achieving real deficit reduction must be based on shared sacrifice, \nbut that's not what this budget proposes. Instead, Americans earning \nover $350,000 annually--less than 1 percent of our population--would \nreceive a $20,000 tax break, while Americans earning less than $28,000 \nwould see a tax increase. Instead of a budget that brings us together, \nAmericans see a budget that divides them from one another, a budget \nthat designates some Americans as ``winners'' deserving of tax breaks, \nand others as ``losers'' who will see their access to health care and \nnursing home care reduced, their children's access to education \nreduced, and their out-of-pocket costs increased. Instead of a budget \ndesigned to help every American achieve the American Dream--a budget \nthat would help create opportunities for every American to live better \nthan their parents did--this budget's design represents a return to the \nshort-sighted approach of trickle-down economics. That approach failed \nin the 1980's, and it will fail now.\n  Instead of helping to create a better life for every American, it \nwill exacerbate the increases in income disparities that have arisen \nsince the 1980's, and that makes the economic future for almost all of \nus more precarious. We can do better--and we must.\n  I am strongly for deficit reduction, Mr. President. I cosponsored and \nvoted for the balanced budget constitutional amendment because I know \nwe must reduce budget deficits. I served on the Bipartisan Commission \non Entitlement and Tax Reform because I know that the entitlement \narea--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other retirement \nprograms--is where the money is, and that there is no way to achieve \nsignificant deficit reduction if this area is off limits. Deficit \nreduction, however, is not just about numbers. If it is to be more than \njust a shell game, we have to be mindful of our obligation to the \nfuture, and to reduce deficits in a way that does not undermine our \nability to make the essential investments the future demands.\n  Moreover, budgets are about people. If we are to meet our obligation \nto the American people, including Americans who need our help the most, \nwe have to reduce Federal deficits in a way that addresses their needs, \nand that meets their priorities.\n  Unfortunately, this budget does not meet those tests. It is not a \nbudget for our future, nor for our present. It does not put the \ninterests of the American people first.\n It does not invest in the future. It fails the first test of any \nbudget because it does not recognize that we are all in this together, \nand that we are all better off if every American has the opportunity to \nparticipate in our economy and in our society to the fullest extent of \ntheir abilities.\n\n[[Page S 9369]]\n\n\n  We cannot succeed as a country by failing our people. Our future \neconomic well-being is inextricably linked to the kind of society we \ncreate. We are all diminished, and our future as a country is \ndiminished, if we fail to make essential investments in all of our \npeople. On the other hand, our future will be brighter if we recognize \nour obligation to one another, and recognize that our future success \nultimately depends on people--on human capital. As we work to reduce \nbudget deficits, therefore, we have to do so in a way that keeps the \nAmerican people's concerns paramount, and in a way that does not stint \non the essential investments in human capital on which our future as a \npeople ultimately depends.\n  Making these essential investments does not mean sacrificing deficit \nreduction as an objective. Both objectives must be national priorities, \nand both can be achieved. We can reduce Federal deficits, while making \nthe necessary investments in our future if we set the right priorities. \nWhat is important is to recognize that the fundamental purpose of both \nis the same--achieving a brighter future for our country, and ensuring \nthat every American has the opportunity to live the American Dream. \nThat fundamental purpose cannot be achieved unless we reduce budget \ndeficits, but it also cannot be achieved unless our society--our \npeople--have the tools they need to meet the challenges the future \nholds.\n  But this budget does not help achieve the kind of future prosperity \nwe all want. It does not help enhance the ability of our children to \nhave a better life than their parents did. Our parents ensured we had \nthe chance to do better than they did. We owe our children--and their \nchildren--no less.\n  This budget is supposed to be designed to save money, but it costs \nus. It costs us opportunity, and competitiveness, and economic growth, \nand security. It diminishes our future, and endangers our community. I \ncannot support it. I urge the Senate to reject this conference report.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIllinois for the excellent statement.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes from the \nmajority's time.\n  Mr. President, this is a watershed day for America. Finally we are at \nthe crossroads. The question is simple: Do we put America on course for \na healthy, prosperous future? Or do we once again, as we have done year \nafter year after year in this Congress, mortgage our future, our \nchildren's future, and our country's future with more and more debt?\n  America has prospered because our parents and grandparents saved \ntheir money and invested it in businesses and farms to create jobs and \nto give their children a better life. We can pass the American dream on \nto our children by saving for tomorrow--not by spending and borrowing \nfor today.\n  America is finally going to have the promises kept. We promised in \n1994 that we would be different, and we are keeping our promise.\n  The old Congress never proposed a balanced budget. It was always tax, \nborrow, spend. If that did not work, they taxed some more.\n  The taxers and spenders think that if they can just squeeze one more \ndollar out of the taxpayers of this country, that Americans will \nsomehow be better off. It is time for Congress to look to the future \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  The deficit will be over $200 billion a year again, unless we change. \nUnder President Clinton's first budget, the debt would grow to $23,000 \nfor every man, woman, and child in America by the year 2002. The \nCongressional Budget Office said the President's second budget was a \nlittle better, but not much, and it continued deficit spending.\n  We have a chance for change now, with a budget that does some very \nimportant things. It saves Medicare from bankruptcy. It keeps a safety \nnet with more money for Medicaid, school lunches, and food stamps.\n  This budget shrinks big Government. We start that very tough process \nby cutting overhead and bureaucracy, by cutting Congress' budget, and \nby freezing Congress' pay. The budget terminates outdated programs. It \nprotects the taxpayers from the excesses of past Congresses and the \nPresident.\n  This plan does not cut overall spending. It does not cut overall \nspending. Spending rises at the rate of inflation. That is what we try \nto do in our homes. That is what we try to do in our businesses. If we \nare lucky enough to get pay raises or more sales, we often spend the \nincrease on inflation just to stay even. And that is what we must do in \nthe Federal Government.\n  Then, after we have done the first work of cutting the budget, we are \ngoing to give the profits to the American people, the taxpayers. We are \ngoing to give the tax cuts to the American family, for homemakers to \nhave IRA's, because their work is every bit as important as anyone \nelse's work in this country. It is about time that they were recognized \nfor their efforts with their own opportunity to save for retirement \nsecurity.\n  There will be other savings for people, too. Because if we balance \nthis budget, interest rates will go down so your home mortgage interest \nrate will be lower. Your car loan will be lower. It will help small \nbusinesses borrow so they can continue to prosper and create new jobs \nto keep this economy going.\n  The people, not the Government, built this country. We must stop \nspending the people's money and their children's money and their \ngrandchildren's money if we are going to keep the prosperity that our \ngrandparents gave us and our parents gave us.\n  Thomas Jefferson said it is immoral for one generation to rob the \nnext by spending more than it has today. It was wrong in his time and \nis wrong today.\n  We have the chance to be responsible leaders in this country, and \nthat is exactly what the majority party is doing. Look at this budget \nresolution. Do you agree with everything in it? No. Do I agree with \neverything in it? No. I would like to have had more spending for \ndefense. There are some important programs that I would like to expand \nfurther.\n  But, just like we do in our families, we have to make priority \nchoices. That is what this budget resolution does. We have taken the \nfirst responsible step of leading. We have done something very \ndifferent from Congresses of the past by keeping our promises. If you \ndo not agree with everything we have done, we understand that, but look \nat the big picture. Look at the long term.\n  Think of our parents, who said we are going to do what is right, even \nsometimes when it is harder for our families to make ends meet. That is \nwhat my father always did. That is what he taught me. Even if it was \nnot in the best interest of his small business, he would act for the \ngood of the community because he knew in the end a healthy community \nwould be better for all of us.\n  I hope my colleagues will put aside their partisan differences, put \naside the small differences that we might have on the specifics of this \nbudget resolution. Let us do what is right for America. Let us do what \nis right to give to our children and grandchildren the same kind of \nAmerica that we have been able to grow up in and have the benefit of--\nand that we love. That is our responsibility. That is the crux of the \nvote we are about to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, of the minority time, I yield myself 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is interesting to sit here and listen to \n``we are here for change.'' Change? You know, the more things change, \nthe more they stay the same. This budget is not for people. It is \nagainst the elderly, the students, the young people, and for the \nwealthy. So the Republicans have not changed one iota from the time I \nstarted growing up until today. It is the same. Change, only a small \ndifference--small difference. The small difference is, if you are rich, \nyou get a tax break. If you are poor, you get a tax increase. If you \nare a student trying to go to school, they reduce the amount of your \nability to get an education. So the more things change, the more they \nstay the same.\n  Years ago, when I grew up I heard someone say that ``Christmas is a \ntime when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. While \ndeficits are when adults tell the Government what they want--and their \nkids pay for it.'' Thanks to this Republican budget resolution, we can \nnow add that tax cuts \n\n[[Page S 9370]]\nare when well-off adults tell the Government what they want, and the \nelderly will have to pay for it.\n  I have an editorial today from the Kentucky Post. I will read just a \nlittle bit from it.\n\n       True, the Congressional Budget Office must certify in \n     September that the lawmakers are meeting their spending \n     targets-- but those targets are only for fiscal 1996, when \n     the cuts are comparatively mild. (Like most budget plans, \n     this one saves the hardest hits for later years.)\n\n  The tax cut up front, the increase in the latter part of the budget \ncycle. We went through that under President Reagan. We gave the big tax \ncuts. We never cut spending for Government. And what happened? We kept \nright on increasing the deficit and increasing the debt.\n\n       We have been down this road too often: [this editorial \n     says] Tax cuts now, with the promise of spending cuts later; \n     somehow the spending cuts never come and the nation goes \n     deeper into hock. Moreover, tax cuts in an election year tend \n     to pick up irresistible momentum.\n       Tax cuts are fun and popular. Enacting the rest of the \n     resolution will be neither.\n       The congressional Republicans say they're prepared to fight \n     to get spending under control. It would be a shame to see \n     that resolve thrown away on an ill-considered tax cut.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Do the Hard Work First\n\n       The House and Senate have reached a compromise on a budget \n     resolution which, if Congress sticks by it, could reasonably \n     be called historic.\n       The resolution also requires that Congress show restraint \n     on an election-year tax cut--and that would be historic, too.\n       The plan calls for a balanced budget--and even an embryonic \n     surplus--in 2002. This goal would be achieved by holding the \n     federal budget's annual increase to 3 percent, about the rate \n     of inflation, meaning there would be little ``real'' growth. \n     Still, federal spending, now $1.5 trillion, would be close to \n     $1.9 trillion in 2002.\n       The GOP-drafted resolution will shortly be passed, over \n     near-unanimous Democratic opposition, and will then become \n     Congress' blueprint for funding the government.\n       The resolution is realistic, if draconian, but it has one \n     big pitfall; a $245 billion tax cut to begin taking effect \n     next year when Republicans hope to take the White House and \n     tighten their grip on Congress.\n       True, the Congressional Budget Office must certify in \n     September that the lawmakers are meeting their spending \n     targets--but those targets are only for fiscal 1996, when the \n     cuts are comparatively mild. (Like most budget plans, this \n     one saves the hardest hits for later years.)\n       We have been down this road too often: Tax cuts now with \n     the promise of spending cuts later; somehow the spending cuts \n     never come and the nation goes deeper into hock. Moreover, \n     tax cuts in an election year tend to pick up irresistible \n     momentum.\n       Tax cuts are fun and popular; enacting the rest of the \n     resolution will be neither.\n       The congressional Republicans say they're prepared to fight \n     to get spending under control. It would be a shame to see \n     that resolve thrown away on an ill-considered tax cut.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Last fall, Republicans campaigned on the notion that all we \nhad to do was cut wasteful spending and we could both eliminate the \ndeficit and have tax cuts. What they did not tell voters is that by \nwasteful spending the Republicans meant programs affecting seniors, \nlike Medicare and Medicaid; and that by tax cuts they meant cuts for \nwell-off Americans.\n  The more things change, the more things stay the same for the \nRepublican Party.\n  Look at the numbers. Whenever that tax cut for the well-off goes up, \nso do the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Is that just a coincidence? I \ndo not think so. The bigger the tax break, the more they gouge out of \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  A $245 billion tax break, where the majority of the benefits--the \nmajority of the benefits--go to those making over $100,000 a year, and \na $452 billion cut from Medicare and Medicaid--that is the Republican's \nnotion of a middle-income tax break and that is the Republican's notion \nof cutting waste.\n  Make no mistake, this has nothing to do with the health of the \nMedicare trust fund. Just like someone has to pay for gifts from Santa, \nand just like someone has to pay for the deficit, someone has to pay \nfor this tax cut for the well off.\n That someone turns out to be America's elderly, and America's middle-\nincome families are right behind them.\n\n  Because those cuts hit middle-income Americans not once, but twice. \nThe obvious hit comes when families have to pick up the costs that \nGovernment no longer provides. That is no small task when you consider \nthat before Medicare was created, at least half of all seniors went \nwithout health insurance and nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. Today, \nless than 1 percent go without health insurance, and 88 percent of our \nseniors have incomes above the poverty level.\n  But the second hit comes from the failure to address the causes for \nhigh Medicare expenditures. Without critical changes, from cracking \ndown on fraud to lowering costs to market reforms, providers will \nsimply shift costs, raising premiums and making it that much harder for \nmiddle-income families to obtain insurance and employers to provide \ninsurance.\n  Everyone in this Chamber agrees that we cannot keep telling \nGovernment what we want, and then simply let our children pay for it. \nBut, by instituting these irresponsible tax cuts for America's most \nwell-off, we are sending our children the bill just as surely as we did \nwith deficit spending.\n  Of the top 140 institutions of higher learning in the world, 127 of \nthem are located in the United States. Yet, instead of making these \ninstitutions more accessible and our children better prepared to \ncompete in the global economy, this budget makes $10 billion in \nunnecessary cuts to education. For many of the students in my State, \nthat cut could mean the difference between continuing their college \neducation or settling for a minimum wage service job.\n  There is no question that if they cannot get the education and \ntraining they need, they will be paying for that tax cut in lost wages.\n  So, do not kid yourself about who is paying for that tax cut--\nAmerica's elderly and America's children.\n  When we go from converting the numbers in this budget plan to the \nactual changes in specific programs necessary to achieve these numbers, \neverybody knows this budget is going nowhere because we all know about \nvetoes and we can all count votes.\n  I believe the American people deserve better than this. This budget \nwas put together behind closed doors by one party. The American people \nclearly want to see a bipartisan effort to craft a budget that calls on \nall of us to contribute equally to the solution.\n  Mr. President, I will ask a couple of questions. How does the \nRepublican budget conference report cut more in Medicare and Medicaid \nthan the original Senate-passed budget, yet still produces less deficit \nreduction?\n  Think about that for a minute.\n  The answer: Because it increases tax breaks for wealthy Americans by \nan even greater amount, from $170 billion to $245 billion.\n  Ask this question: If the Republican plan produces a true balanced \nbudget, then why on page 3 of the conference report that we have heard \nabout all day today, and no one has given an answer, does it show a \ndeficit in the year 2002 of $108.4 billion?\n  Answer: Because the Republican plan does not really balance the \nbudget. It produces a fiscal year 2002 deficit of $108 billion.\n  It is only when you count the projected $114.8 billion off-budget \nsurplus in the Social Security Trust Funds that you can claim a \n``balanced budget'' by 2002.\n                         financing for the faa\n\n  Mr. President, the budget proposal before us today does not provide \nin detail how we will finance one of Government's most important safety \nagencies--the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  This budget plan does, however, propose to cut transportation funding \nfor highways, Amtrak, the Coast Guard, and aviation by an additional \n$10 billion beyond the President's proposal.\n  That tells me one thing--someone is going to feel the squeeze--and \naviation is a prime target. What we are looking at is a budget that \ncould undermine the safest air transportation system in the world. That \nis wrong.\n  My colleagues will not be surprised to learn that the demands on the \nFAA are greater today than ever before and they are expected to grow.\n  FAA operates the world's largest air traffic control system, handling \nan average of two flights per second, every minute, every hour, 365 \ndays a year.\n  Their safety, security, and airport safety professionals conduct \nnearly 1,000 inspections on an average day.\n\n[[Page S 9371]]\n\n  Their maintenance technicians every day keep 30,000 pieces of complex \nsafety equipment across the Nation operating with an almost perfect \nreliability record of 99.4 percent.\n  No other transportation system is as safe as American aviation.\n  The question is--can it be even better? Absolutely.\n  Under the current leadership of Administrator Hinson and Deputy \nAdministrator Daschle, the agency has established a new safety goal of \n``zero accidents''. The agency is taking aggressive steps to reach this \nnew goal and I wholeheartedly support their efforts.\n  But the real challenge for the FAA is that they are pursuing their \n``zero accident'' objectives at a time they are being asked to absorb \never increasing budget cuts.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I am worried that this budget \nresolution marks a retreat from that important safety objective.\n  FAA should not be and has not been totally immune from budget cuts. \nOver the past 2 years, the agency has seen its budget decline by 6 \npercent-some $600 million--while at the same time experiencing a 6-\npercent increase in air traffic.\n  The FAA has been able to do more with less by eliminating programs no \nlonger needed, overhauling others, and by reducing their nonsafety work \nforce by nearly 5,000 employees. That's progress. But we can not, and \nshould not let this budget resolution undermine the FAA's mission.\n  Those savings were achieved through strong management and thoughtful \nand tough decisions. I worry that our budget decisions are exactly the \nopposite. We do not want to make aviation cuts with no rhyme nor \nreason.\n  It is my hope that after the bickering and posturing end on this \nbudget, we will return to what I have always valued, a bipartisan \nconsensus on the importance of a safe and efficient aviation system. \nThe administration also must understand that its proposal for a \ncorporation has no support. They can sit and watch as the reform \nmovement goes on, if they so choose, but that is their choice. I will \nwork with my colleagues here on meaningful reform that moves the \naviation system forward. We must begin with looking at how to reform \nthe FAA. Senators Inhofe and Burns have put forward a proposal, and I \nknow the Commerce Committee is seeking a bipartisan approach to FAA \nreform.\n  We must also make a real commitment to providing the necessary funds. \nIf we do not, I am afraid they will redo that old country saying--\n``that dog don't hunt''--to ``that plane don't fly.''\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting listening to the latest statements \nmade by the other side that the American people deserve a better plan \nthan this. If so, where has it been? Where is the plan that has been \nproposed by the minority? They talk about these Republican cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid. Let me say that the President of the United \nStates recently had the fortitude and the courage to measure up to the \nproblem confronting Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are going \nbroke. The trustees of the Medicare trust fund have reported that it \nwill be insolvent in 6\\1/2\\ to 7 years. I suppose we could just put \nthat off until after the next election and not deal with it. But six or \nseven years from now there will be no payments made to any hospital or \nto any doctor on behalf of anyone. President Clinton at least has had \nthe courage to face up to the challenge facing us and say that he has a \nplan--a 10-year plan versus the 7-year plan, but at least he has a \nplan. I did not hear anybody over there endorse it. If they had an \nendorsement I suppose it would be forthcoming now.\n  So I take some challenge or question about the notion that somehow \nthis is a Republican design simply to inflict pain and suffering upon \nthe elderly. I think there is a legitimate issue to be raised about \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid. But at least the President of the United \nStates has faced up to it. He deserves a good deal of credit for having \ndone so.\n  Insurance market reforms, portability, malpractice reforms--all of \nthat has been proposed on a bipartisan basis. Action has yet to be \ntaken. I do not have the time to go into who has held up those kind of \nreforms in the past. But nonetheless, they are there. And I think they \nare there for the taking if there is a bipartisan spirit to do so.\n  This is a blueprint, as has been described by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. It is not faultless. It is not flawless. But I \nbelieve Senator Domenici deserves a great deal of credit at least for \ntrying to come up with something that is not made of smoke and mirrors, \nthat has not been a ``triumph of politics,'' as David Stockman wrote in \nhis book, but something that has some real numbers behind it. It is not \na ``free toss,'' as the critics of the balanced budget amendment \nsuggested when we debated that issue before and lost by one vote. The \ncritics said that individuals could vote for a balanced budget \namendment but would never measure up when the budget comes through.\n  I think this conference report is adequate rebuttal. Those who \nsupported a balanced budget amendment also are committed to producing a \nbalanced budget for the consideration of this Congress.\n  I am one who has questions about the level of taxation included here. \nI think the tax cut is too high. I have told that to the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee personally and I reiterate it again today. I think \nit applies or could apply to those who are not in need. I intend to \nraise such issues when we come to authorization, appropriations, and \nreconciliation.\n  So I am not fully committed to each and every detail contained in \nthis particular blueprint. I hope to change it. I know there are a \nnumber of colleagues on this side who share my views, that we are not \ngoing to support some of the provisions in this particular blueprint. \nBut let me say that this at least comes to grips with the entitlement \nissue.\n  Several years ago Senator Domenici and Senator Nunn offered an \namendment on the floor dealing with entitlements. There were only 28 \nvotes; 28 people who were willing to face up to the fact that we must \ncurb the growth in entitlement programs. Today's blueprint represents a \nmajority, not 28.\n  So I want to give Senator Domenici credit for his persistence in \ncoming to grips with the difficult problem that we all have known about \nbut have been unwilling to face.\n  There have been, in my opinion, cuts too deep in the field of \nbiomedical research, education, and nutrition. Again, I have made that \nvery clear to my friend from New Mexico, that I intend to support \nefforts to reverse some of those proposals.\n  But, Mr. President, I listen again and again to the attacks against \nthis proposal coming from those who say: We have a better idea.\n  I have not heard it. Not one has come forward with a balanced budget \nplan. I have listened to speeches this afternoon saying, ``I am for a \nbalanced budget. But not this one.'' It is much like St. Augustine \nsaying, ``Dear Lord, give me chastity, but not yet'' when I hear them \nsaying, ``Give us a balanced budget, not this one, not now, sometime in \nthe future, but not yet.''\n  So, in spite of my reservations that I have expressed privately to \nSenator Domenici and to others, I believe that it is important for the \nfirst time since my service in Congress to go on record in favor of a \nbalanced budget before this Congress, to approve it in spite of the \nfact that I have reservations about the tax cuts; approve it in spite \nof questions about the level of funding for research.\n  My Aging Committee had hearings just this week, which pointed out \nthat we are being penny-wise and pound-foolish; that, if we invest a \nsmall amount of money in medical research, we can save as much as $70 \nbillion by delaying for 5 years the onset of Alzheimer's, or a stroke, \nor Parkinson's. Those are the kind of investments we ought to make, and \nthose are the kind of investments I am going to support when the time \ncomes to vote on the authorization and the appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, I want to go on record as saying I do in fact favor a \nbalanced budget. This is a proposal. It is the only one before us. \nUntil I hear a better one, I intend to support the Senator from New \nMexico.\n\n[[Page S 9372]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the conference \nreport?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 hour and 20 \nminutes. The Senator from Nebraska has 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me once again on my time say to the Republican \nSenators, I do not want to cut anybody short. We have 1 hour and 20 \nminutes. I hope those who want to talk essentially agree to a minimum \namount of time. I do not think I can give anybody more than 10 minutes \nand most 7\\1/2\\. Having said that, we are trying to make a list and get \npeople in order.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, Senator Cohen, from the \nState of Maine, first of all, from the very beginning of my efforts in \nthis regard, one of the stalwarts--there is a lot of talk of who is \nconservative, who is moderate, and who is liberal. From the very \noutset, Senator Bill Cohen of Maine has been for reining in the Federal \nGovernment and he has not been kind of a rainy day guy. He has been \nthere when you try to get at the entitlement programs that are making \nit so there will not be any money for research in the National \nInstitutes of Health on the dreaded diseases he is so concerned about. \nHe has been there starting 4 years ago when Senator Nunn and I began \nthe first idea of capping entitlements. We did not have anybody around. \nHe surprised many people, Bill Cohen of Maine. The Senator from Maine \nwas there with a tiny few of us.\n  Now, today, he expresses his enthusiasm again for getting to a \nbalanced budget for the future of our country, if I understand him \ncorrectly.\n  Now, he is entitled to come to the floor of the Senate and say there \nis no other plan and I am going to vote for this one, and he is right. \nThe President's plan did not come close even after he goes to all the \neffort of trying again. There is none from the other side. And so he is \nsaying he is going to vote for it because of that.\n  On the other hand, he is entitled to say he is not going to be 100 \npercent for each and every assumption here, as it works its way through \nappropriations. He may argue that he wants less money for \ntransportation, and more for cancer research. He may want to argue that \nhe wants more money in education and less money in the Economic \nDevelopment Administration or Appalachian Regional Commission. I read \nhim that way.\n  Am I reading the Senator right?\n  Mr. COHEN. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And he is saying on some of the entitlements, look, \nthere may be a better way than to take the subsidy away from \npostgraduate students in college. This resolution assumes they will pay \na little more of the subsidy Americans are generously giving to them. \nHe does not like it that much, and he may want to change it as a \nSenator from Maine, this process works.\n  Mr. COHEN. And I may wish to cut back on the level of tax reduction \nas such to alleviate cuts in some of the programs we just talked about.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In which event everybody understands; budget \nresolutions and the product thereof are a little different from average \nlegislation. The good Senator knows how onerous and difficult it is to \nchange a reconciliation bill, but he stands before us committed to the \ngood of this country, and for our children and our future he is voting \neven for some things he is not quite sure that he will support in their \nfinal form. And he is at liberty to do that. I thank him and \nacknowledge that that is, in my opinion, a very forthright and \nacceptable level of support, and I appreciate it.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator. I simply wanted to indicate to him \nthat there will be times as we go through this process that I will put \nmy colleagues on notice that I do not share the assumptions contained \nin the resolution and will work to modify them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I just complete these remarks?\n  I think everybody should understand that is the case. There may be \nSenators on that side of the aisle who, as this reconciliation process \ngoes forward, support some of the propositions. I would not think they \nwould be against each and every one. Some on this side are not going to \nsupport each. But let me suggest that in the final analysis we will \nhave tax cuts for the American people only when we get a balanced \nbudget. That is the premise of this budget resolution. We will have \nbills before us ready to be enacted that will get a balance before the \ntax cuts will be viable. I think the Senator from Maine knows that.\n  So to the extent we cannot balance the budget, we are putting at risk \nthe tax cuts. And I think for some that will be a very important issue \nand a very important event. For others, it will not be that important. \nBut it seems that everybody is saying it is important to get a balanced \nbudget. That is how I see it and how I read it.\n  Mr. COHEN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. COHEN. I think it is really important that we try to move away \nfrom this debate on class warfare, that once again it is Republicans \nsimply bailing out the rich and it is the Democrats standing up for the \nelderly and the young and the poor. Senator Lott is the son of a \nshipyard worker, a blue-collar worker, a union worker from Mississippi. \nI am the son of a small-town baker in Bangor, ME. My father does not \nhave very much in the way of material goods. He works really hard--my \nmother and father both. He is 86 and still works 18 hours a day. And \nall he has is what he makes, period, each day.\n  I take offense that supporting this budget is somehow akin to bailing \nout the rich. I will tell you what I am concerned about. I have two \nsons, both married, both starting out, and they have a future that is \npretty bleak. They have a future that is bleak because of what we have \nbeen doing. We have been eating their seed corn, their food and then \nasking them to pay the bill.\n  When I look at their futures in terms of what they will have to pay \nin interest payments on the debt, unless we change our ways, then I \nhave real apprehension for their future. They are not rich. They are \nnot wealthy. One has gone back to graduate school after being out of \ncollege for 10 years, and another has decided to go into college after \nbeing away. So I have two now, one in graduate school and one in \nundergraduate school. It is not easy. They are going to have a tough \ntime. But they are going to have a much tougher time unless we change \nthe way we have been dealing with their futures.\n  So that is the reason I support a balanced budget, not because of any \ninterest in bailing out the rich or passing out benefits for the \nwealthy. What I want to do is make sure we start curbing our appetites \nso that we do not simply eat away their future. As Thomas Jefferson \nstated, ``whenever one generation spends money and then taxes another \nto pay for it, that first generation is squandering futurity on a \nmassive scale.'' That is what we are doing; we are squandering our \nchildren's future on a massive scale. In my judgment, that amounts to \nfiscal child abuse and we have to stop the beating and stop the \nbleeding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me once again thank the Senator for \nhis very articulate, sound statements regarding this effort in the \nChamber of the Senate. I am very pleased to lead this effort because of \nthat very set of concerns.\n  Mr. President, I do not think I want to once again state how I came \ninto this world, but I will share it with you. I am the son of \nimmigrant parents and my father never went to school and never learned \nhow to write English. He was a success, however.\n  In fact, I say to my friend, if I have a liking for small business, \nit is because my dad had a little grocery store and when they bought a \nnew truck, it was not just an event in business; it was an event of the \nfamily. He brought the truck home to show that his hard work was \ngetting something and there was a new truck to deliver goods, and he \ncould perhaps support us better.\n  I am not supporting this balanced budget because I feel I wish to \nvote for a tax cut for the very wealthy in this country. To be \ntruthful, to be truthful, that issue will be decided by the Senate. \nAnybody who wants to talk about where it is going to be, the Senate is \ngoing to vote on that issue. So if the other side wants to continue \nwith the rich and the poor and wants that fight to go on forever while \nwe try to help \n\n[[Page S 9373]]\neverybody with a balanced budget, have at it.\n  The truth of the matter is there is nothing in this budget resolution \nthat says the Senate is on record, off record, assumptions, nothing \nthat says we know how this tax cut is going to be put through by our \nFinance Committee and this Senate.\n  Now, let me make one other point, I say to the Senator. He made it, \nand let me make it and then yield to him for a moment. He made an \nexcellent point.\n  Whenever you try to balance the budget, it is very easy for those who \ndo not want to join your team to say, ``We are for it but.'' And then \nlet me suggest if we kept a litany of the ``but,'' or ``however,'' or \n``I wouldn't do this,'' if we would have kept that list, we would be \nback out of balance and we would not be in balance until the year 2020 \nbecause everything that is difficult somebody on the other side of the \naisle says, ``We would not do that.'' Now, not everyone on that side, \nbut a host of Senators with a litany of, ``I wouldn't do that; it will \nhurt the seniors; it will hurt the poor.''\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, when are we going to balance the \nbudget? You know what we ought to put up here when they put that \npicture up and Senator Lautenberg says, ``Whose side are you on?'' We \nshould have a picture of every main street and every shopping center in \nAmerica. That is what we should have, I say to Senator Cohen, with \nthousands of Americans, some of them wearing a cowboy hat, some of them \nboots, some of them swank clothes, and we ought to say, when he asks \nthat question, ``We are for all of them. All of them.''\n The poor, the rich, the old, the less than old, the kids and even the \nunborn kids. I do not know how we would put them up there, but maybe a \nspace over on the side and say, let your imagination carry you on a \nlittle bit. Because a balanced budget is even for the unborn Americans \nwho, if we do not fix this fiscal policy, will be paying our bills and \nhave nothing left over for themselves. That is the issue as I see it.\n\n  How much more do we want to ignore our adult responsibility? How many \nmore years? How many more years do we want the excuses? It is easy to \nmake excuses. You can have excuses by the thousands. You can even find \nan economist, perhaps one that works for the President, who will tell \nyou it is not the right time.\n  Well, I say one more time, when will it ever be the right time? If it \nis not the right time when you can do it, then it will never be the \nright time. If it is early in a business cycle when everything is going \ngood, Oh, do not harm that growth. Right? Do not do it now. Let it \ngrow. You get it in the middle of the business cycle, Oh, you might be \na little early. Now like maybe the waning tip of the business cycle, \nNot right now. That is what is wrong with us--on both sides of this \naisle. We wait around for our time. And much of that turns out to be \npolitical time. Our time, meaning what is best politically.\n  Well, I submit we took some real risks here. And we are going to \ndefend it across this land. And we believe that when it all turns out, \nwe are not asking for credit. We are just asking that the people of \nthis country reserve their antagonism toward this or their sense of \nurgency, or concern, about what we are doing, reserve it for a while, \nand let us see how much better America will be when we decide to pay \nour own bills instead of letting our children do it.\n  Mr. COHEN. If the Senator would yield. You mentioned one of the \nPresident's economic advisers. Let me repeat what I said earlier. I \nthink President Clinton deserves a good deal of credit for coming \nforward with his second budget proposal saying, let us do it in 10 \nyears, not 7.\n  By the way, he recognized what his trustees in Medicare told him--the \nsystem is going bankrupt. Starting next year the payments going out \nunder Medicare will exceed the revenues coming in. Then it goes into a \nsteep decline in the year 2002 and it is broke. President Clinton had \nthe courage to change and recognize his mistake in the first budget and \nto say now that we have got to fix it.\n  Now, we may disagree in terms of what level of funding is necessary, \nbut at least he faced up to the responsibility; he did not try to \nexploit the issue, saying it is Republicans trying to do in the old \nfolks. We have got to save the fund. We have got to save the Medicare \nfund. He seems willing to do it. We are willing to do it. There ought \nto be a way to work it out. But I have not heard any suggestion on the \nother side. I have heard no resolution being offered, or even being \ncontemplated, endorsing President Clinton's second budget. I heard none \nforthcoming.\n  If I could have one more comment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  Mr. COHEN. On this class warfare issue, we have been through this \nyear after year after year. When the tax debate took place several \nyears ago, many on the other side said it is time to tax the rich. We \nhave to go after the fat cats. Let us put a luxury tax on furs, on \njewelry, on yachts, on cars. And what happened? They aimed at the rich, \nand whom did they hit? The working men and women. We lost jobs in my \nState. You know why? Because the rich bought their boats elsewhere. \nHinkley Boat Yard, one of the finest shipbuilders in the country----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Went broke?\n  Mr. COHEN. Did not go broke, but it had real serious problems for \nseveral years thereafter. Those on the other side said, ``We made a \nmistake. We tried to get the rich. We got the working men and women.''\n  We have got to stop the notion that somehow only Democrats preserve \nthe interests of those who are working and we are just protecting the \nrich. What we are trying to do is generate an economy in which \neverybody benefits.\n  So I must say this notion, this dangling conversation that never \nseems to end, that the Democrats are the only ones concerned about \nworking men and women, it does not correlate to the background that I \ncome from. It is not the background that the Senator from New Mexico \ncomes from.\n  My folks do not have anything. They do not have any retirement plans, \nnothing but Social Security and what they are able to produce day in \nand day out from their hard labor. So the notion that somehow I am out \nhere advocating programs for the rich really strikes me as offensive. \nAnd so I want to commend the Senator from New Mexico once again. The \nconference report to House Concurrent Resolution 67 is not a perfect \nplan; it is one that I will disagree with in some instances in the \nfuture with regard to the details, but I think he has done an \noutstanding job. And I wanted to rise and advocate my support for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me close these remarks by saying, \nobviously when the Senator from New Mexico alludes to this side of the \naisle being Republican and that side of the aisle being Democrat, I \nwant to make it very clear that I do not paint every Republican in one \npicture. I do not think they all agree on the same things. And what I \nsaid about opposition to this budget does not fit every Democrat in the \nsame way. There are many Democrats that, I believe, with two or three \nchanges, would probably support what we are doing in this budget \nresolution. It may very well be one would put off tax cuts for a while. \nThat is their prerogative. But I submit that there are a number of \nDemocrats who are just as willing to take on the entitlement packages, \nthe entitlement problems of this country, as we are. Anything I said in \nmy remarks about it is never the right time and never the right \nprogram, certainly I did not intend that to apply with a brush to \neveryone on the other side, because it is not so. I yield the floor. I \nthank Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I listened with great interest, and I was \nwondering if we could agree now when I finish my very brief remarks \nthat I could have two Senators from this side speak, given the fact \nthat the majority side has taken considerable time. I intend to yield 4 \nminutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, and then, following that, 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Vermont. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Let me make very brief remarks. There have been a lot of \nquestions asked and charges made talking about class warfare. The \nquestion has been asked, when are we going to balance the budget?\n  Well, in the first place, Mr. President, I do not stand here--I stand \nhere proud of the fact that the people on \n\n[[Page S 9374]]\nthis side of the aisle are going to say very loud and they are going to \nsay very clear that we tell the truth about the tax policy that came \nout of the conference, that is, there are $245 billion of tax cuts in \nthis horrible piece of legislation before us, and if we point out that \nthat the benefits are going to the rich, it is because that is the \ntruth. I do not like class warfare, but the truth never hurt anybody.\n  When are we going to balance the budget? I think we can get together \nand balance the budget as soon as the majority gets off the kick that \nthey are on, a $245 billion tax cut that basically helps the rich. That \nis the time when those of us on this side of the aisle are prepared to \nmarch shoulder to shoulder. In the meantime, we will not. We think it \nis unfair. We think it is wrong. We think it is ill-advised and ill-\ntimed and it could not be worse.\n  Just let me point out, Mr. President, that under the bill that came \nout of the conference, as nearly as we can understand it, while I would \nagree that the final details have to be worked out in the Finance \nCommittee and then with the comparable committees on the other side of \nthe Hill, that basically, under this bill families with incomes of over \n$200,000--that is about 2.5 percent of all the families in the United \nStates of America--those families would get an average tax break of \n$11,266 a year, while on the other hand, other Americans not so \nfortunately situated, those taxpayers with incomes below $30,000 a \nyear, which represents about 40 percent of the taxpayers in the United \nStates of America, they would get an average tax break of $124 a year;\n $11,266 a year for the 2.5 percent of our citizens that make over \n$200,000, and $124 for those who make under $30,000.\n\n  We are not going to be part and parcel to that type of an \narrangement, however much it is clouded, however much we are accused of \nplaying class warfare. We are not going to saddle up to that kind of a \nplan.\n  I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from the State of Wisconsin. When \nhe finishes, 2 minutes to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I am pleased to be here \nto say a couple of words about this budget proposal we are voting on \ntoday.\n  I am voting against it. Like Senators Cohen and Domenici, I am also \nthe son of immigrant parents and worked most of my life in the private \nsector. I have been very fortunate. I am among the most wealthy and \nwell off in our society. Mr. President, I would be embarrassed to go \nback and tell the people I represent in Wisconsin that the balanced \nbudget amendment that I voted for asked nothing from me, zero, and I \nvoted for it. It asks a lot from middle-income people, lower-income \npeople, students, from everybody in our society except the well off.\n  This balanced budget proposal I voted for asks nothing from the well \noff, and it is not inadvertent and it is not an accident and it is not \nsomething that we should hold out to the American people as something \nof which we are proud and endorse. We should not say now, ``Well, we'll \nchange it later.''\n  Why do we not have a consideration for what I just suggested in this \nbalanced budget proposal that we are discussing? We have a situation in \nthis country today in a way which is more skewed than any society in \nthe world. The wealthiest 1 percent controls 40 percent of our assets \nin this country, and the most well off 20 percent control 80 percent of \nthe assets in this country, and it is going in the wrong direction.\n  Here we come up with an economic proposal which does not take that \ninto consideration at all. In fact, for those most well off, they will \ncome out of this with an economic benefit--a tax cut. They will be \nasked not to do one thing to help to balance our budget. If this \nrepresents fairness, then everything that I have been taught about what \nis fair in the years that I have lived on this Earth does not make any \nsense at all.\n  There was an opportunity that Senator Cohen and Senator Domenici had \nto vote for a balanced budget proposal that did contain fewer tax cuts, \nand those tax cuts were aimed at people in the middle-income brackets \nthat needed them the most; that did contain fewer cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid and nutrition programs and student loan programs. Senator \nCohen and Senator Domenici did not vote for those proposals. So they \nare talking now about a balanced budget proposal, in Senator Cohen's \nwords, that is more fair in the ways he just described which are \nexactly like some of the proposals we made early on in the process: \nSenator Bradley's proposal, Senator Conrad's proposal. Senator Cohen \ndid not vote for it.\n  So now we have just one proposal to consider, and that is this \nproposal which is, in my judgment, most unfair and it is not a way in \nwhich we should go to the American people and ask them to support our \nconcept of a balanced budget proposal. So I have to vote against this \nbalanced budget proposal. I am very regretful, Mr. President, because I \nam a supporter of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I recognize having been in business all my life how important it is \nnot to spend money you do not have. I am a supporter of a line-item \nveto. I am convinced we have to come up with a balanced budget \nproposal, and I hope before this process is over this year I will be \nable to vote for a balanced budget proposal.\n  But, Mr. President, it has to be fair. It has to be something that \nthe American people can look at and say, this represents equity in the \nquest to balance our budget.\n  So I must say I cannot support this proposal. I am looking forward to \ncontinuing the dialog. I very much hope before October rolls around \nthat we will come up with something that I can support out of fairness. \nIn my judgment, this proposal is not fair. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I want to pose a \nquestion to my friend from Wisconsin. I do not wish to embarrass him, \nbut I think it is a good time for me to make the point, once again, \nthat I have been making.\n  Since I know the Senator from Wisconsin very well, he is a very \ntalented Member of this body, a very humble soul. I think it would be \nsafe to assume, and I would like to ask, if I would not embarrass my \nfriend from Wisconsin, I just guess that the Senator from Wisconsin \nvery likely might be in the category that I referenced earlier, the 2.5 \npercent of the families in America that would receive an average \n$11,266 a year in tax cuts. Is that the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield whatever additional time I need.\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, that is true, I say to the Senator. As I said in my \nearlier remarks, I would be flatout embarrassed to go on back to \nWisconsin and tell people that I voted for a balanced budget proposal \nthat is going to cost them money out of their pockets, money that they \nreally need, and for myself I voted a tax cut. I mean, this is not \nfair, and if we do not represent fairness, then what do we represent?\n  Mr. EXON. Does the Senator from Wisconsin feel that I am practicing \nclass warfare against him by putting out the fact which he agreed to?\n  Mr. KOHL. I want to point out to the Senator from Nebraska that it is \njust the opposite. It is the inequitable distribution of wealth that \nhas been occurring the other way year after year for a decade or two. \nWhenever people get up and talk about trying to distribute more \nequitably the wealth we have in our society, the other side is saying \nyou are practicing class warfare. It is just the opposite. They are the \nones who are doing it with their policies that are more and more \nconcentrating wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people, and when \nsomebody brings it up, they point a finger and say, ``class warfare.'' \nIt just is not fair.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n  Senator Leahy is next to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment my friends on the other side \nof the aisle for their strong support of a balanced budget. I just wish \nthey had that same strong support during the eighties. Instead, they \nstrongly supported President Reagan as he tripled our national debt. If \nthey did not give strong support then, we would not have the difficulty \ngetting a balanced budget today.\n  Mr. President, I fear the Republican congressional leadership and the \nPresident are heading for a train wreck on \n\n[[Page S 9375]]\nthe budget, a wreck that is going to force the entire Government to \nabruptly stop this fall.\n  I think a bipartisan summit of the budget is needed, something \nbuilding on the spirit of cooperation we saw in New Hampshire with \nPresident Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich on taxes, welfare reform, \nentitlement reform, spending reductions and the time it is going to \ntake to get a balanced budget. It will be a tough and difficult summit, \nbut it would be worthwhile.\n  I think both Republicans and Democrats agree we have to consolidate \nunnecessary Government programs, reform welfare, control Medicare and \nMedicaid spending. We may disagree on the details, but we know it has \nto be done.\n  In 1990, a President and the Congress of a different party failed to \nreach an agreement, and we had to shut down the Federal Government for \nalmost a week. Social Security recipients, students, farmers, millions \nof others were hurt by it. Nothing was accomplished. The same thing is \ngoing to happen this fall if we do not get together.\n  I think it is time to put our political differences aside and come \ntogether on a budget summit before the crisis. I think once we get the \nbudget on solid footing, then let everybody run for President.\n  Just a few weeks ago, we saw a brief glimpse of bipartisan \ncooperation. In New Hampshire, President Clinton and House Speaker \nGingrich actually sat down together to discuss their differences on a \nwide range of important issues--without 15-second sound bites aimed at \nscoring cheap political points.\n  And 2 weeks ago, President Clinton laid out a 10-year blueprint to \nbalance the budget and called for bipartisan cooperation to reach some \ncompromise with Republican congressional leaders.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican congressional leadership rejected the \nPresident's offer to a bipartisan solution to balancing the Federal \nbudget. This budget conference agreement completely ignored all of the \nPresident's recommendations.\n  This deal makes a bad budget even worse. It is not a compromise, but \na much more extreme budget than the Senate-approved resolution.\n  Nearly 60 percent of the total projected savings of this so-called \ncompromise plan come from cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. These Medicare \nand Medicaid cuts will pay for a tax cut package of $245 billion--$75 \nbillion more than the Senate-approved budget--over the next 7 years.\n  This tax cut package includes a $500- per-child tax credit for \nfamilies making up to $200,000 a year. But this credit is not available \nfor poor families that do not make enough money to pay taxes.\n  This agreement cuts Medicare by $14 billion more than the Senate-\napproved budget over the next 7 years.\n  This means Vermont will lose over $350 million in Medicare funding \nover this time.\n  Split equally between beneficiaries and providers, the average \nVermont senior will pay about $2,000 more out-of-pocket over the next 7 \nyears.\n  This budget deal also makes deeper cuts in Medicaid, which provides \nmedical care for our most needy citizens. The so-called compromise \nwould cut Vermont Medicaid funding by over $300 million over the next 7 \nyears.\n  These cuts come at a time when Vermont is working on a plan to cover \nmore uninsured Vermonters through expanded Medicaid coverage. As a \nVermonter, I am afraid these cuts could jeopardize Vermont's plan. \nVermont is moving in the right direction while this budget deal takes \nthe country in reverse.\n  I fear that the Republican congressional leadership and the President \nare heading for a train wreck on the budget--a wreck that will force \nthe entire government to an abrupt halt this fall.\n  An immediate bipartisan summit on the budget is needed, building on \nthe spirit of cooperation established by President Clinton and Speaker \nGingrich in New Hampshire.\n  For a summit to succeed, everything must be on the table: Taxes, \nhealth care reform, entitlement reform, further spending reductions, \nand the time it will take to get to a balanced budget.\n  Such a summit will be a grueling, sometimes acrimonious encounter. \nBut anyone who has studied the various blueprints can see the outlines \nof an agreement--providing there is the political will.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that we must consolidate \nunnecessary Government programs, reform welfare, and control Medicare \nand Medicaid spending. We may now disagree on some of the details for \naccomplishing these goals, but that is why we need a bipartisan \nsummit--to hammer out the details of a compromise.\n  Until now, both sides share the blame for the fix we find ourselves \nin. This year's budget debate has been just partisan bickering.\n  Congressional Republicans did not seek cooperation from the \nDemocrats, and Democrats in turn, almost unanimously opposed the budget \nresolution. Party-line votes, unfortunately, are nothing new in \nWashington budget debates.\n  When Democrats controlled the majority, the same thing happened. \nDemocrats did not reach out to Republicans, and not a single Republican \nin the House or Senate voted for the 1993 budget bill.\n  In 1990, a President and Congress of different parties failed to \nreach a bipartisan agreement on the budget.\n  The result was a shutdown of the Federal Government for almost a \nweek: This hurt Social Security recipients, students who relied on \nFederal loans, farmers who relied on Federal support programs, and \nmillions of others.\n  Luckily, the Government shutdown did not last long enough to imperil \nour air traffic control system or meat inspections.\n  I foresee the same thing happening this fall--but with the potential \nfor a far longer and more acrimonious stalemate.\n  Before adopting a more conciliatory tone in New Hampshire, Newt \nGingrich was issuing partisan ultimatums.\n  He recently told Business Week, his strategy of forcing President \nClinton's hand: ``The appropriations bills--if you don't sign them, \nthere is no government. Which of the two of us do you think would be \nmore worried by that?''\n  Just yesterday, House Budget Committee Chairman Kasich said that a \nGovernment shutdown this fall ``would give the best explainers on \nCapital Hill'' a chance to make the case for the Republican budget \nplan.\n  Shutting down the Government is an attempt to score political points \nwill only bring more scorn of our political system.\n  It is time to put our political differences aside and come together \nin a bipartisan budget summit--before the crisis.\n  I still hope that Democrats and Republicans can work out a more \nreasonable plan than the budget before us. A budget that would cut out \nagricultural subsidies for wealthy absentee farmers, cut out wasteful \nprojects like the space station and B-2 bomber, but out tax loopholes, \nand look at entitlement reform.\n  Once we get the budget on a solid footing, there will be plenty of \ntime for a Presidential campaign next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont, with whom I \nhave had the pleasure of serving for 17 years, for his help, his \nsupport and thoughtfulness. I also would like to take a moment to thank \nmy talented colleague from the State of Wisconsin for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, I have two more speakers, but it is the turn of the \nother side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, Senator Snowe, we \nhave the time to allow her 10 minutes to speak. I yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman for yielding \nme 10 minutes. I want to commend him for the effort that he has \nundertaken to put this budget proposal together.\n  Mr. President, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's famous remark, I \nfeel we finally have reached the ``end of the beginning'' of what I \nhope will eventually be known as the first 7-year budget to reach a \nbalance in over a generation.\n I say the ``end of the beginning'' because we still have a tremendous \namount of work lying ahead of us over the next few months.\n\n  While this resolution moves Congress forward light years, rather than \nleap years, in our quest to achieve a balanced budget by 2002, we still \nhave a \n\n[[Page S 9376]]\nchallenging reconciliation process to overcome.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I know that has been a tough \ntarget to reach, but it has been a goal well worth fighting for.\n  I have had concerns about this conference proposal, not necessarily \nbecause it has some tax cuts, not necessarily because of some spending \ncuts, but I believe a careful balance has been tilted in a manner that \ncould put at risk the very goal of this entire process.\n  This afternoon, I would like to offer some constructive words and \nviews to this very important process--a process for whose goal I have \nbeen fighting throughout all of my years in the Congress, including \nwhen I served for 16 years in the House of Representatives.\n  Getting us closer to balancing the budget has not exactly been a \n``walk in the park'' for those of us who worked hard and diligently to \nunlock the fiscal handcuffs that have bound our country.\n  I speak especially of the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, our distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDole, and all of the Senate members of the conference committee who \nrepresented the views of this body and the American people with a \nfirmness of resolve and commitment to our goals.\n  Those are goals that even the President has finally agreed to--after \na considerably long leave of absence--that we should reach by a date \ncertain, the most important of which is the total elimination of the \nbudget deficit.\n  Let it be known that while we on this side of the aisle had the guts \nfrom day one to forge a 7-year fiscal vision about where we wanted to \ntake America, there are those in this institution, on the other side of \nthe aisle, who never had it in their hearts to fight for a balanced \nbudget, and never had the stomach to make it a bipartisan fight.\n  A balanced budget is not only making the Federal Government \naccountable to sound fiscal policy, but it is also a commitment to \ncompassion and common sense that must be made in the process.\n  It is said that ``every rose has its thorn,'' and this historic \nbudget proposal is no different. That ``thorn,'' as it turns out, \nstemmed from wide-ranging differences between the House and Senate \nbudget numbers, and specifically on the issues of tax cuts. When this \nbudget was reported out of this Chamber on its way to the conference \ncommittee, an agreement was reached among Senators regarding the size \nand scope of proposed tax relief. The House gave a $345 billion tax cut \npackage. From here, it was agreed that a total of $170 billion would be \nheld in reserve to be used if--and only if--two things happened. First, \nthat we had an economic dividend over 7 years, and, second, that the \nCongressional Budget Office would actually certify that a balanced \nbudget would occur by the year 2002.\n  Let us be clear right up front about one thing: The entire purpose of \nthis balanced budget process was not to craft and produce tax relief in \nsum totals that were unrealistic or inconsistent with achieving balance \nin a fair and rational manner.\n  The singular goal of our efforts from the outset has been this, and \nonly this: To sensibly and carefully craft a 7-year plan to reach \nbalance by the year 2002, without being sidetracked by other goals and \nproposals.\n  In our plan, we identified a potential for a $170 billion dividend \nthat would be held in reserve to be used for tax relief. But in the \nconference committee, a final figure of $245 billion was reached.\n  I happen to consider the original Senate plan a fair and reasonable \napproach: Taxpayers who have been asked to make sacrifices to reach a \nbalanced budget could receive the dividend of reaching balance in the \nform of a tax cut.\n  I credit Senator Domenici as chairman of the committee for having \nreached, I think, a very fair and reasonable proposal in addressing \nsome of these issues with respect to a tax cut plan.\n  The compromise agreement from the budget conference, however, allows \nfor the possibility of an additional $75 billion in tax cuts.\n  From this point, there are three ways to proceed: Offsets may be \nchosen from the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee; higher deficits \nmay be called for in the first years of the plan to absorb the high \ncost of this tax cut proposal; or we can simply reduce the size of the \ntax cut reported by the Finance Committee. The budget only stipulates \nthat the tax cut not exceed $245 billion; it does not say that it must \nbe $245 billion.\n  My point is that I do not think we want to hinder the progress of the \nbalanced budget caravan by attaching a larger-than-necessary bulky \ntrailer to its hitch.\n  To this Senator, it is one issue to return the economic dividend \nderived from balancing the budget to taxpayers in the form of a tax \ncut, but it is quite another to ask them to absorb additional cuts in \nprograms to support further tax cuts of larger-than-life proportions.\n  As we move forward, other issues concerning the budget resolution \nwill also be addressed in reconciliation--issues of tremendous \nimportance to me and to other Senators, such as maintaining adequate \nlevels of funding for education and student loans. When we talk about \nthe goal of the balanced budget for our children, nothing could be as \nimportant as investing in the education of our children's future, and \nwe must see to it that this investment is maintained.\n  We must also fight to ensure that the Medicare system is not only \nsolvent, but a healthy provider of quality service as well. We must \nfight to protect biomedical research, funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, and nutrition programs--again, in the sole \ninterests of protecting and providing for America's children.\n  I believe we can maintain these priorities and maintain the moral \nimperative of a balanced budget which must come first and foremost.\n  I know that this is the price and the cost for righting 26 years of \nwrong in America--26 years of budget deficits, 26 years of allowing \nCongress to treat the budget like a charge card, 26 years of adding \nunceremoniously to our national debt.\n  We are not going to treat the Federal Government like an ATM machine \nanymore. We are basically going to revoke its credit-card privileges, \nand it is about time we do so.\n  In the final analysis, my hope is that we can look upon this document \nfor what it is--a ``binding blueprint.'' Its parameters have been drawn \nand set, but its contents have yet to be fully shaped. The opportunity \nfor further imprints is, for many of us, one of its shining qualities, \nand reconciliation will be its end result.\n  This document gives committees the opportunity to meet these balanced \nbudget targets. And we must accomplish this without harming the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Mr. President, with these caveats in mind, and with the knowledge \nthat we are merely at the ``end of the beginning,'' I am concluding at \nthis stage of this historic process that the momentum forward toward a \nbalanced budget should not be stopped.\n  We are, in the end, finally tilting the fiscal scale to balance.\n  In this proposal for a balanced budget, we reach our goals by cutting \nFederal spending, by eliminating waste and unnecessary bureaucracy in \nGovernment, by saving Medicare from bankruptcy, by not taking a dollar \nfrom the Social Security system, by cutting over $900 billion from the \ndeficit over 7 years, and without raising taxes.\n  In a final note, I want to assure my colleagues that I intend to do \neverything I can to work diligently and constructively throughout this \nprocess, with as much resolve and vigor as I entered into it with, to \nensure that we have a balanced budget. I want to work to ensure that we \nhave fairness and reasonableness in this process.\n  I want to make sure that the working Americans and working families \nare treated fairly, and that we have middle-class America facing relief \nin the future from the enormous debt that has been certainly hampering \ntheir economic security. And we have to look at single parents who \noften work two jobs to make both ends meet, as well as those trying to \neducate their children in this uncertain time. We also have to look at \nthe young Americans whose future and financial security is already at \nrisk.\n  In this budget we have asked Americans to contribute in some form or \nanother to our bold effort to balance the \n\n[[Page S 9377]]\nbudget. Already, we have asked them to make difficult choices. Already, \nwe have joined with them to make our mark on history. So, once again, \nwe ask for their trust and confidence as we take the next step forward.\n  I hope that although we have not had a strong, bipartisan effort to \nbalance the budget--we have not had a plan from the other side--I think \nit is important from this point forward that we have set the goals for \na balanced budget, that we work in unison and harmony to fashion the \nmost fair and reasonable approach possible, to ensure that we provide \nthe economic security that Americans deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we will continue as best we can. I would \nlike just a moment to recognize the Senator from Florida, who has been \nwaiting patiently. Following Senator Graham, depending on the flow of \nwhat speakers are available--I would like to at this particular time \nyield to the Senator from Florida 10 minutes; followed by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, 12 minutes; followed by Senator Boxer, the Senator from \nCalifornia, for 10 minutes, in that order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield so I may \nrespond to Senator Snowe, then we will proceed with your side.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to say to Senator Snowe, we would not be \nhere with a balanced budget but for her participation in the Budget \nCommittee. When she was selected, I do not think any of us knew we were \ngoing to have this kind of job ahead of us, nor that we were going to \naccomplish this much. Whether we like every single piece or morsel of \nit is another issue, but the Senator was a very active participant in \nour budget markups and our floor debate.\n  I thank her for that. I want to say, I did not know her very well, \nbut she has a lot of what some of us call ``guts.'' ``You are tough.'' \nFrom me, that is a great compliment and I hope my colleague takes it \nthat way.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I certainly do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It has been very exciting to have her on the committee. \nWe had a great committee. They did their job, and the Senator from \nMaine was one of them.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman for the work he did on the committee \nto bring us together to make this day possible. And it is a historic \nmoment, to think this is the first time in 26 years we have established \na balanced budget resolution. But it is due to the chairman's credit, \nhis demeanor, and to his approach to the committee to bring this \nforward, that we cut a trillion dollars from the next 7 years. Without \nthe chairman's efforts and input and his experience as chairman of the \nBudget Committee, this day would not be possible.\n  So, I thank my colleague and look forward to working with him in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Exon for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I, too, wish to join those who have \ncomplimented our colleague, Senator Domenici, and also the ranking \nmember, Senator Exon, for their outstanding work on behalf of the U.S. \nSenate and our goal of bringing the U.S. Federal budget into balance. \nThey have taken on a very difficult, challenging task. They have \nperformed their task with great skill.\n  I want to say that I stand shoulder to shoulder with others in this \nChamber who are committed to the goal of balancing the Federal budget \nand doing so as rapidly and surely as possible. I am proud to wear the \nlabel of being a deficit hawk.\n  I have supported the constitutional amendment to require us to \nbalance the budget. I hope when that amendment returns, we will have \nthe votes to carry it one step further and that is to be prepared to \nbalance the Federal budget without relying on the Social Security \nsurplus as a means of doing so. By adding that additional component, \nthat is denying ourselves the luxury of balancing by using the \nexpanding Social Security surplus, we will have, in fact, achieved our \ngoal of a sustained, permanent balancing of the U.S. Federal budget and \na cessation of the constant increases to the national debt.\n  I also support the line-item veto as a necessary discipline of the \nexecutive in the process of national fiscal affairs. I supported the \n1993 economic plan of President Clinton which I think history will \ndemonstrate is one of the most important actions that this Congress has \ntaken, in terms of moving beyond rhetoric to actually making the \ndifficult political decisions to balance the Federal budget.\n  I cosponsored, during the debate on this budget resolution, the Fair \nShare plan, which went beyond this budget in terms of what it would \nhave done toward balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002 and \nbeyond. While I admire and appreciate the effort that has gone into the \nbudget plan which is before us this afternoon, I do not believe even \nits most ardent advocates would attempt to say that it is Biblical; \nthat is, that this is the only way, this is the divinely disclosed \nmanner that is necessary in order to achieve the objective of a \nbalanced budget.\n  Balancing the budget is both a matter of commitment and then a matter \nof values, of priorities, of choices. This plan represents values, \npriorities and choices. Frankly, they are not my values, priorities, or \nchoices, because I believe this is not a plan which meets the ultimate \ntest of being fair to all the American people.\n  When one of our colleagues has the courage to stand up on the floor \nand describe himself as being one of the most advantaged Americans, and \nthen to say he is embarrassed about the fact that he is being asked to \nvote for a budget plan that will substantially reduce his taxes while \ndenying services to many other Americans who are substantially less \nwell off--I think that is indicative of the fundamental unfairness \nwhich is a fundamental flaw of this budget plan.\n  I think there are three other flaws in this plan. First, the plan \nignores, in too many critical areas, the consequences on real \nAmericans, on real people. If I could use as an example a meeting that \nI participated in yesterday with the presidents of four, predominantly \nAfrican-American, colleges and universities in my State. One of those \nPresidents was Dr. Oswald Bronson who is the president of Bethune-\nCookman College in Daytona Beach. Bethune-Cookman College has, as its \nfirst name, the name of a great American, Mary McLeod Bethune, whose \nstatue graces Lincoln Park, just a few blocks from where we are this \nafternoon.\n  Those presidents told me that if the cuts in student financial aid \nwhich are contemplated as a result of this budget plan become reality, \nit is not a matter of a few students being economically pressed in \nterms of continuing their education. It is not a matter of a \nsustainable dropoff in admissions to their institutions. It is a matter \nof survival of their institutions. So many of their students are \ndependent upon programs like the Pell grants, that if we make the kinds \nof cuts that we are contemplating, we place those institutions in \njeopardy. That is the impact on real people that this plan will \ninflict.\n  Second, I think this plan is flawed in that it is top down. Big \nnumbers were arrived at without any apparent attempt to determine what \nthose big numbers would mean to the programs that were affected and the \npeople who depended upon those programs. I want to particularly talk \nabout that flaw as it relates to the two big Federal health care \nprograms: Medicare, health care for the elderly; and Medicaid, health \ncare for the poor.\n  Third, I think this plan is unsustainable. We may get some degree of \nglow of accomplishment, should this plan pass today--and I assume it \nwill. But I predict with a high degree of confidence that when the \nMembers of this body and our colleagues in the House begin to look at \nthe actual consequences of this budget, particularly in areas such as \neducation and health care, that we will see them to be what I think \nthey clearly are, and that is inappropriate, adverse to the interests \nof average Americans, and therefore unsustainable.\n  There are some who would suggest, in this health care debate, that we \nhave just opened the scene to an absolutely new stage; that we never \nsaw any of the issues in health care until we came to this budget \nresolution. The fact is, we have known about the status of American \nhealth care for a long \n\n[[Page S 9378]]\ntime. It has been a status which has been declining in some very \nimportant indicators. It has been declining in terms of the number of \npersons covered by effective financing for their health care costs. It \nhas been declining in terms of some important indicators of the health \nof our people, such as the immunization of our youngest children. And \nit has been declining in terms of its economic status.\n  It was no secret that the Medicare program has been in financial \ndistress. That was why the President, in his 1993 plan, made what I \nthink was a courageous proposal, to provide a substantial amount of \nadditional funds for Medicare, which has allowed its impending \nbankruptcy to be deferred for some considerable period of time.\n  We need, now, to have a reform of our health care plans which is \nreasonable, which is in the context of comprehensive health care \nreform, and which will be sustainable.\n  One of the major debates of 1994 was whether health care could be \nreformed program by program or whether these programs are so \ninterrelated that it had to be done on a comprehensive basis. Those who \nargued for the former position won the day; that we did not have to \nhave comprehensive health care reform, that we could do it a different \npath. It is now going to be their challenge to figure out if that in \nfact is true.\n  I personally do not believe it is true. I believe we are going to \nfind that there will be substantial cost shifting as a result of these \ndraconian cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. We will find private insurance \nrates going up. We will find the cost to local governments increasing. \nCircumstances such as just occurred in the largest public hospital in \nLos Angeles--the Los Angeles County Hospital now is on the verge of \nclosure because, in large part, of the impact Federal Government health \ncare policies that have been narrowly focused on that one hospital and \nhave caused or contributed substantially to its collapse.\n  We also are seeing declining coverage. One of the things that is \noccurring is that the percentage of Americans covered by private health \ninsurance is declining. The estimate is that by early in the 21st \ncentury less than half of working Americans and their dependents will \nhave coverage at the point of their employment. And the result of that \nis that the rolls of Medicaid, the safety net for many of those people \nwho have lost their coverage in the private sector, has been growing \nalmost in direct proportion. We are going to continue to see that. Yet, \nwith these cuts, $181 billion below what health care economists both in \nthe previous Republican administration and the current Democratic \nadministration had considered as necessary to maintain the same level \nof coverage and quality, we are going to have $181 billion of cuts \nbelow those levels.\n  Mr. President, while I admire the fact that we are now moving toward \nthe goal of a balanced budget, there has to be a different way to \nachieve that goal. So I must vote no on this plan with full expectation \nthat before this year is over I will have the opportunity to vote yes \nfor a plan which is fair, which is sustainable and in the interest of \nall Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, promises made, promises kept. That's what the \nfiscal year 1996 budget resolution is all about. We promised the \nAmerican people that we would find a way to balance the Federal budget, \nand we did. This resolution puts the budget on a path to balance by the \nyear 2002.\n  We promised that we would protect Social Security, and we did. This \nresolution doesn't touch Social Security retirement benefits or cost-\nof-living adjustments.\n  We promised to protect Medicare, and we did. This resolution allows \nMedicare spending to grow at a sustainable pace.\n  We promised to provide tax relief for American families and \nbusinesses, and we did. This resolution will accommodate 245 billion \ndollars' worth of tax relief over the next 7 years.\n  We promised that we would begin to shrink the size and scope of \nGovernment, and we did. This resolution provides for the elimination of \nthe Commerce Department and numerous other programs, commissions, \nagencies and functions of Government.\n  Promises made, promises kept. That's what this resolution is about--\nkeeping the promises we made to the American people, and keeping faith \nwith future generations of Americans.\n  Now, make no mistake. We'll hear throughout this debate about all of \nthe pain this budget inflicts. Let's put this budget into perspective.\n  Over the next 7 years, the Federal budget will grow from $1.5 \ntrillion to $1.875 trillion. That represents and annual growth rate of \nabout 3 percent. So, total Federal spending isn't being cut at all. \nWe're just not increasing it as much as some in this Chamber and at the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue would like.\n  Take a look at Medicare in particular. Spending will grow from $178 \nbillion this year to $274 billion in 2002. That's an annual growth rate \nof about 6.4 percent. Medicare spending per beneficiary will grow from \nabout $4,350 this year to $6,070 by 2002. Total Medicare spending over \nthe next 7 years will top $1.6 trillion. So, we're not slashing \nMedicare at all.\n  We do heed the warning of the Medicare Board of Trustees and limit \ngrowth to more sustainable levels to prevent Medicare from going \nbankrupt in 2002. That is what is necessary to ensure that seniors do \nnot lose their benefits altogether as a result of bankruptcy in 7 \nyears.\n  Medicaid spending will grow from $89 billion this year to $124 \nbillion by the year 2002. That is an average annual growth rate of just \nunder 5 percent.\n  So, spending on many important programs is continuing to increase, \neven as the budget moves toward balance.\n  What about taxes? We hear a lot of rhetoric about tax cuts for the \nrich. The fact is, a tax bill has yet to be written, so we don't even \nknow what taxes will be cut or who will benefit. If you look at the \nbill the House passed back in April, about 75 percent of the benefit of \nthe $500 per child tax credit would go to families earning less than \n$75,000 per year. Ninety percent of the benefit would go to families \nwith annual incomes of less than $95,000. There is language in the \nresolution before us that says the tax cuts should go to working \nfamilies. In other words, most of the benefits will go to families of \nmore modest means.\n  But even if some of the benefits goes to wealthy individuals, I would \nask, what's wrong with that? People don't hide their money away in a \nmattress. They invest it, and that creates new job opportunities across \nthe country. You don't help job seekers by penalizing job creators.\n  Capital gains reform is a case in point. When capital gains tax rates \nare high, people need only to hold on to their assets to avoid the tax \nindefinitely. No sale, no tax. But that also means less investment, \nfewer new businesses and new jobs, and far less revenue to the Treasury \nthan if capital gains taxes were reduced.\n  According to a study by the Institute for Policy Innovation, the 50 \npercent capital gains exclusions and indexing contemplated in the House \nbill would help lower the cost of capital by about 5 percent, inducing \ninvestors to increase the capital stock by $2.2 trillion by the year \n2002.\n  That larger capital stock, in turn, would create 721,000 new jobs and \nincrease total gross domestic product by almost $1 trillion by the year \n2000. And, of course, that will help increase revenues to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is about promises made, promises kept; \nabout a healthier economy. More important, however, it is about the \nfuture. It's about Casey Crandall, a young scout in Herber, AZ, who \nwrote to me recently to say we shouldn't spend money we don't have; \nthat there is no reason to send this country farther into debt.\n  It is about young Brandon Loos in Scottsdale who wants his \nrepresentatives in Congress working hard to balance the budget and get \nus out of debt.\n  It is the future of these young people that is on the line. The \nnational debt now amounts to about $4.8 trillion--about $18,500 for \nevery man, woman and child in the country--$18,500 apiece for young \nCasey and Brandon in Arizona.\n  If the Federal Government continues to run $200 billion annual \ndeficits, as President Clinton has proposed, Brandon and Casey can \nexpect to pay an additional $5,000 in taxes over their lifetimes. The \n$1 trillion in new debt that \n\n[[Page S 9379]]\nPresident Clinton proposed in his 5-year budget plan represents an \nadditional $25,000 in taxes--an additional $25,000--for every young man \nand woman.\n  And the burden of the national debt doesn't just show up in people's \ntax bills. It also adds a surtax to interest rates that people pay on \ncar loans and student loans, credit cards and mortgages. The estimate \nis that the debt surtax adds about 2 percent to those interest rates. \nOn a $74,000 30-year mortgage, that surtax amounts to over $37,000. By \nbalancing the budget, we can help to eliminate that surtax and make a \nhome purchase more affordable--make it easier for families to send \ntheir children to college.\n  Mr. President, every generation before us has worked hard to ensure \nthat their children and grandchildren has had the chance to lead a \nbetter life. Let's not have ours be the first generation to rob the \nfuture of its chance for a better life just so we can continue to spend \nto excess on ourselves. Let's give Casey Crandell, Brandon Loos and all \nof the other children across the country the chance to work for a \nbetter America for themselves and their children, not just the \nobligation to pay our debts.\n  Mr. President, this is an historic occasion; the first time in nearly \nthree decades that we have a chance to vote on a balanced Federal \nbudget. Let's pass the balanced budget resolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nconference report to the budget resolution. It will have negative \nconsequences for seniors, children, veterans and the people who serve \npeople--our Federal employees. It will also hamper our ability to make \ninvestments in our future for job creation and economic growth.\n  This conference report violates the most basic contract we have with \nthe American people--to provide for a safe and secure future for our \nchildren.\n  Let me make this perfectly clear--I support the goal of a balanced \nbudget.\n  However, I believe that in balancing the budget, we must be guided by \ncertain principles that uphold our commitment to our seniors, our \nchildren, our veterans and our federal employees.\n  This budget resolution upholds none of these principles.\n  This budget resolution could have devastating consequences for \nMaryland. The Baltimore Sun reports that this seven year budget plan \ncould cost the State of Maryland 100,000 jobs over the next ten years. \nThis means that Maryland could be thrown into an economic depression as \na result of this budget resolution.\n  For all of these reason, I am vehemently opposed to this resolution \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, this conference report makes unprecedented cuts in \nMedicare--this is outrageous.\n  The proposed cuts to Medicare send a clear message to the G.I. Joe \ngeneration--the generation that saved western civilization. Thank you \nfor saving humanity, but we are going to cut your health care when you \nmay need it most.\n  On the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, we are turning \nour backs on our veterans. It is shameful.\n  Is this what they fought for?\n  To have their Government turn its back on its senior citizens?\n  Under this budget resolution, our seniors will have to pay more and \nget less--less choice, less coverage and less security.\n  Our seniors deserve better than this.\n  And so do our Federal employees.\n  This budget resolution is a declaration of war against Federal \nemployees.\n  To the people who answered John Kennedy's call to service--NASA \nemployees who put us on the moon, NIH employees who are trying to find \na cure for cancer and FBI and Secret Service agents who risk their \nlives trying to make our streets safer--this Congress decides to cut \ntheir benefits and reduce their retirement.\n  This violates our contract with these employees. It is unfair, it is \nunjust and this Congress should be ashamed for the action it is taking \ntoday.\n  This budget resolution also makes dramatic and potentially crippling \ncuts to student loans.\n  How can we turn our backs on middle class families who are hoping to \nsend their children to college?\n  We are taking away the ladder of opportunity for millions of students \nand the families who have sacrificed for their children.\n  This resolution fails in another fundamental way. It fails to make \nthe investments in science and technology. It fails to create high wage \njobs. It fails to promote economic growth.\n  In my own State of Maryland, agencies such as NASA, NIST and NIH are \nin the forefront of developing new technology. I support this effort. \nBut this budget resolution means less money, less research and less \nbenefits to the economy and the people of this country.\n  Mr. President, with this budget resolution, I believe we are breaking \nour promise to our seniors, our Federal employees, our children and our \nveterans. I find this unconscionable.\n  This Congress must recognize that balancing the budget must be based \non principles that protect our most vulnerable citizens and preserve \nthe ladders of opportunity for the next generation. We must never \nforget the contributions of our Federal employees and the vital role \nthey play in preserving our prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, this Congress has rejected these principles. For this \nreason, I oppose the conference report to the budget resolution and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have been going back and forth. \nSometimes that does not work timewise because somebody speaks 10 \nminutes on one side and 5 on the other. What we will try to do now is--\nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Kassebaum and Senator Murkowski \nproceed in that order, with Senator Kassebaum having 5 minutes and \nSenator Murkowski 3\\1/2\\. Then we will proceed back to the Democrat \nside. What would their pleasure be there?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We ask that Senator Wellstone have 10 minutes, and I \nunderstand that Senator Nickles would like 10 minutes, and then Senator \nKerrey would like to have 5 minutes at that time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we get Senator DeWine at 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what we would like is 15 minutes to the \nside under the control of myself, Senator Robb, and Senator Nunn.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We would have Senator Kerrey for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. DeWine 5, Burns 5, and Coverdell for 5.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I have 10 minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. The Senator will be going immediately after Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Kassebaum.\n  I say to my chairman, I am looking to speak for 10 minutes for myself \nat some point before I have a meeting in the minority leader's office. \nI am wondering whether it would be all right with the chairman if I \nwent before he had used up 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to accommodate the occupant of the chair, who \nhas a time schedule also. Let me say it this way: We have Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Murkowski, then Senator Wellstone for 10, and \nSenator Nickles for 10.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Kerrey for 15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator DeWine for 5.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And if Senator Boxer could go in there for 7 or 8.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine. Then we will come back and see where we are. It \nlooks like Senator Burns and Senator Coverdell will follow thereafter \nfor about 5. We will see how those work out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Has the Senator formulated the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say that is understandable. Let us make that a \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, first, I would like to recognize the \nsuperb leadership on the master plan of this budget, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. I used to serve on the Budget \nCommittee a long time ago. It is not easy putting together a truly \nsubstantive budget, but, indeed, this budget is that. It is putting us \non a path that is going to be \n\n[[Page S 9380]]\na sound and a sensible direction for the future. It may not be what we \nall would like. I am sure there are parts of it that we might not be \ntruly comfortable with in the short term. But it envisions what we can \ndo with the short term, but more importantly, what we will be able to \ndo for the future.\n  Mr. President, I am struck by some of the debate that we heard back \nand forth yesterday and today about the sense of finality that some are \nimposing on this debate. Depending on your perspective, it is as if \nthis resolution, on its own, will either save our economy or wreck it. \nThe fact of the matter is that the vote on this budget will not end the \ndebate on how to restore fiscal responsibility and set priorities. In \nmany ways, the debate--and the work--is just beginning.\n  This budget resolution, like all budget resolutions, provides a \nframework for the tasks that will fill the rest of the year, and years \nahead, as a matter of fact. It does not and cannot prescribe specific \nactions. It paints, in broad strokes, the outlines of Federal spending \nand revenues over the next 7 years. That picture is a good one, because \nit shows a Federal Government that has slowed the rate of its growth \nand trimmed away the excess spending that adds to our national debt.\n  The details of the picture, however, will be painted by the \nauthorizing and appropriating committees with jurisdiction over \nindividual programs and policies. The budget requires only that we stay \nwithin the lines of the resolution that is before us. As difficult as \nit has been to produce this outline, producing the finished picture \nwill be much more challenging.\n  For example, I will mention one that was mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe. I am very concerned about the magnitude of \ncuts this budget would have us make in Federal student loan programs. \nDuring the recent debate on the Senate resolution, we rejected the idea \nof stripping away loan subsidies for college students. Senator Snowe's \namendment gave 67 of us the opportunity to make ourselves very clear on \nthat point. Yet, the budget resolution assumes we will cut $10 billion \nfrom the program in 7 years. This was worked out through the compromise \nwith the House and the Senate, and it is now before us.\n  I think it will be very difficult for the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources--and the full Senate, for that matter--to agree to the \ncuts the budget resolution assumes we will make to meet its \ninstruction.\n  As chairman of that committee, I can only say that I will do the best \nI can. And, obviously, it is very important that indeed we achieve that \ngoal.\n  I also am not convinced that the mechanism this resolution sets up \nfor certifying spending cuts and triggering a $245 billion tax cut will \nbe effective. Nor am I convinced that a tax cut of that size is wise \nwhile we are still running deficits. That has been a concern of a \nnumber of us. Even if CBO certifies that our planned spending \nreductions are sufficient to cover the lost revenues, we still could \nbalk when the time comes to follow through with the spending cuts. \nSeven years is a long time. Before I vote for any tax cut this fall, I \nwill have to be convinced that we have locked in real spending cuts.\n  And that is, indeed, the responsibility of the authorizing and \nappropriating committees.\n  I also have to mention that I do not agree with some of the \ndiscretionary spending assumptions this budget makes. A good example, I \nthink, is spending on public health and basic research. I remain \nconcerned about the funding reductions for the National Institutes of \nHealth and other programs in the U.S. Public Health Service. The budget \nresolution assumes a 1-percent reduction in NIH funding in 1996 and \nthen a 3-percent reduction for each year thereafter. That does not seem \nlike a lot. But I think it takes away from that budget some very \nimportant funding that is necessary for us in the future.\n  And I am worried about the detrimental impact of any NIH budget \nreduction. I believe that biomedical research advancement and \nbreakthroughs could slow dramatically, and I think this is a concern we \nall share. We want to make sure we can do it the right way. However, I \nam pleased that the conference agreement would allow for a 1-year \ntransition period before the full impact of any reduction would occur. \nThis is necessary because the National Institutes of Health will need \ntime to plan for the discontinuation of some ongoing research projects \nto fund new initiatives. As chairman of the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources, I am committed to working with NIH to find ways to \nachieve these budget reductions without harming basic biomedical \nresearch. In fact, we will explore these options when the committee \ntakes up the NIH reauthorization next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If I may just have 2 more seconds to finish.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two additional minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Just 1 minute will do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One additional minute to the Senator.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Let me just add this, Mr. President, and I realize \neverybody has time they want to use. Throughout the debate on this \nbudget, much has been made of the idea of shared sacrifice. And this is \nalways tough. But let me just tell you when a student who is worried \nabout a student loan reduction will say to me, ``So what is going to \nhappen to you?'' I think in order to accomplish the goal of balancing \nthe budget and restoring sound fiscal policy, all of us have to be \nwilling to do our part.\n  That is why I consider it essential that those of us in Congress take \naction to freeze our own salaries until our budget is in order. Already \nthis year we have made significant cuts in legislative branch spending, \nand the budget calls for more cuts next year. The conference report \ndoes not explicitly say that we will freeze our salaries but that we \ncan. We should enact legislation soon to implement that freeze. I \nbelieve, Mr. President, while saving $72 million is not large in the \ncontext of our entire budget, it is a step we must take.\n  I strongly support this budget because I believe that it outlines and \npoints to fiscal responsibility, and I congratulate again the chairman \nand those who have worked hard to make this possible.\n  I yield back my time. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in commending the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for \ndeveloping a foundation for this truly historic budget resolution \nconference report. This resolution commits this Government to finally \nending the nearly four decades of deficit spending that have brought \nour Nation's Government to the very verge of bankruptcy.\n  Starting in 1961 and in every year but one, we have run an unending \nstring of deficits and debt. During the past 34 years, our national \ndebt has grown by 1700 percent, from $298 billion in 1961 to nearly $5 \ntrillion, and we have done nothing--we have done nothing, Mr. \nPresident--that is adequate. And if we continue to do nothing, interest \non the debt, currently at $235 billion, will approach $300 billion in \nnearly 4 years and interest costs will exceed Federal spending for \nnational defense in 1997.\n  Mr. President, in the face of these massive, unending deficits, our \nPresident has failed to present anything close to a credible plan to \nbalance the budget. In February, the President submitted his budget. \nWhen the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] analyzed his budget, they \nfound that he had cooked the books down at the White House. The \nPresident's budget was out of balance by more than $1.2 trillion and \nhis deficit projections were off by 40 percent. Not a single Member of \nthis body supported the President's budget, which was defeated 99 to \nnothing last month.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the President went on national television \nto announce that he had finally developed a 10-year plan to balance the \nbudget. If one looks at that plan, all the cuts are in the last 3 \nyears, and even then according to CBO, the budget would be out of \nbalance by more than $200 billion a year.\n  Let there be no misunderstanding, Mr. President. The only plan that \nwill \n\n[[Page S 9381]]\nbring about a balanced budget is the plan crafted by the House and \nSenate budget conferees, and there is simply no other choice available. \nThat is why I will support this budget resolution.\n  Finally, let me address the issue of tax cuts in this resolution, and \nlet me be very clear on the issue. I do not believe we ought to be \ncutting taxes in 1995 and 1996 while we simultaneously run deficits of \nmore than $170 billion. Although this budget resolution slows the \ngrowth in our interest bill, the fact is that all Federal borrowing \ntoday and for the foreseeable future is simply to pay interest on the \ndebt. This is the clearest indicator I know of how broke we are in \nWashington. And when you are broke, it is no time to go out and declare \na dividend.\n  I am a member of the Finance Committee, Mr. President. The committee \nwill consider tax cuts in September. I hope I can convince my \ncolleagues that all savings, or a considerable amount of those savings, \nshould be used to reduce the carrying costs on the interest and thereby \nreducing the accumulated debt. In other words, we simply ought to be \nusing savings to reduce the debt, not for tax cuts.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues for the time. I wish \nthem a good day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe under the unanimous consent agreement Senator \nWellstone has 10 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the views of my \ncolleagues, but there is no shared sacrifice in this budget proposal. \nWhen the conferees came out of conference committee, tax cuts for \nwealthy people and very large and profitable corporations, tax cuts \nwhich go overwhelmingly to very wealthy people, ballooned from about \n$170 to $245 billion. Under this budget, if you have an income of over \n$350,000, you get a break of $20,000 a year. If you do not, you are \npretty much out of luck. In fact, under this budget, on average, \nworking people will pay a very large price.\n  Mr. President, at the same time that we are putting into effect these \ntax cuts which flow disproportionately to the wealthiest citizens in \nthis country, we are calling for draconian cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, \nchild nutrition programs, and student loans.\n  At the same time that we have a $20,000 a year break per person in \ntax cuts over the next 7 years, we are asking Medicare recipients to \npay about $3,200 per person. By the year 2002--oh, yes, the cuts are \nbackloaded, so it gets steeper--they will pay about $900 additional \ndollars per year for Medicare.\n  Mr. President, without system-wide health care reform, reform of the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs will not work. We have had this \ndiscussion in the Chamber before, and I have challenged my colleagues \nto debate this. With Medicare, we are talking about $270 billion in \ncuts and Medicaid $182 billion--in my State of Minnesota, about $4.7 \nbillion in Medicare and over $2 billion in Medicaid.\n  First of all, let us consider the average income profile of people on \nMedicare. Let us stop assuming that elderly people are greedy geezers, \nas some critics have said. The median income for male beneficiaries is \nabout $16,000 a year; female, about $8,000 a year. Households with \npeople 65 years of age and over pay about four times more in medical \ncare costs right now than those under 65 years of age.\n  What we are going to be doing with $270 billion in Medicare cuts is \ncalling on the beneficiaries--and that is what it is, an insurance \nprogram for elderly people--to pay more out of pocket in copays and \ndeductibles, and for many people they will not be able to, and will \nhave to go without care. But above and beyond that, make no mistake \nabout it, this will lead to major cost-shifting. We went through this \nbefore, I say to my colleagues, when we debated health care policy, and \nthe cost shifting will go on like this just as it has.\n  In the metropolitan areas, where the providers can shift the cost to \nthe private health insurance, they will do so because Medicare will not \ncover the reimbursement for the cost of delivering care, and then \nprivate health insurance companies raise the rates of those who receive \nprivate health insurance, and then employers have more trouble covering \npeople, and then we continue the trend of employers dropping people \nfrom coverage. That is precisely what is going to happen. This is a \nshell game. Someone is going to pay for this.\n  Second, Mr. President, in rural Minnesota--and I come from a State \nwhere rural communities matter and count--many of our care givers will \nnot be able to continue to operate, because 75 and 80 percent of their \npayment mix right now is Medicare,\n because of the disproportionate number of elderly people, disabled \npeople, low-income elderly people, that live in our communities.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I come from a State where with Medicare we go \nthrough the HMO's. A Medicare per-person reimbursement over $350 goes \nto RHMO's, whereas in Kings County, NY, it is $600 per enrollee. I am \nspeaking as a Senator from Minnesota. We have cut the fat. We kept the \ncosts down in Minnesota, and now we have this slash-and-burn approach \nto health care policy? The effect of this will be severe in my State. \nAnd the effects of this will be cruel to Minnesota's elderly.\n  Mr. President, let us talk for a minute about another major problem \nwith this budget, and that is the $182 billion of cuts in Medicaid. Let \nus talk about Medicaid. Actually per person, which is the way we ought \nto do it in terms of the number of people who are beneficiaries, we are \ngoing to go from about 7 percent per year increase to about 1.3 percent \nper person. Seventy percent of Medicaid, I say to my colleagues, is for \nnursing home expenses. And people are not in nursing homes and \nreceiving Medicaid unless they are, by definition, low income. Who is \ngoing to pick up the cost? How are these nursing homes going to make up \nthe difference? Are there going to be fewer staff? Are we going to \nprovide people with even less care? Or is it going to be our county \ngovernments and our State governments that pick it up? And who is going \nto pick up the cost for covering children? Medicaid happens to be an \nimportant safety net program that covers many children within this \ncountry, children who would otherwise go without care.\n  Mr. President, this budget also hits farmers disproportionately hard. \nIt instructs the Agriculture Committee to effect $48.4 billion in cuts \nover 7 years; from the commodity programs we are talking about $12 \nbillion a year. So I am assuming we are talking about $35 billion of \ncuts in nutrition programs in 7 years, food stamps, school lunch, \nschool breakfast, and the Women, Infant and Children program.\n  Mr. President, I had an amendment on this floor that said that the \nSenate will take no action that would increase hunger or homelessness \namong children. Three times I lost. The fourth time it was passed by \nunanimous consent. I guess I am going to have to bring this amendment \nback on the floor.\n  Why do you think we expanded the Food Stamp Program? It is the most \nimportant safety net program in this country. Yes. There are \nimperfections, and some reform might be necessary, but the fact of the \nmatter is, we expanded the food programs after we saw the hunger and \nmalnutrition in the late 1960's and we saw children with scurvy and \nrickets and distended bellies. And the Food Stamp Program has been \nenormously successful in removing that hunger and malnutrition. Are we \ngoing back to that again? How generous we are sometimes with other \npeople's suffering. And I am told that this is shared sacrifice? I do \nnot buy it.\n  Mr. President, I was a college teacher before I ran for the Senate. \nAnd I am saddened, and angered, that now some in this body are moving \nto cut the student financial program. This budget would slash about $10 \nbillion in student loans. Students in Minnesota, I say to my colleague, \nin Minnesota, some of whom sell plasma at the beginning of the semester \nto buy textbooks. I meet students who work 35 and 40 hours a week while \ngoing to school. That is why it takes them 6 years. Now we want to \neliminate part of the exemption on the loans? Mr. President, I do not \nsee the shared sacrifice.\n  I see huge amounts of tax cuts, $245 billion, in the main, going to \nthose people in our country who already have the economic resources. I \ndo not see any real effort to take on corporate \n\n[[Page S 9382]]\nwelfare. We have got a joint tax committee, Mr. President. We have got \na joint tax committee that tells us that we have, roughly speaking, \nover 400 billion in what are called ``tax expenditures,'' some of which \nare justified, like the mortgage interest and charitable contribution \ndeduction, both of which serve important public purposes, but others of \nwhich are loopholes and outright tax giveaways. Is it too much to ask \nthat we might look at some of those giveaways as sources of deficit \nreduction? Tobacco companies, pharmaceutical companies, insurance \ncompanies, oil companies. Are we going to ask any of those large \ncorporations and financial institutions to be a part of this tightening \nof the belt? I do not see any standard of fairness here.\n  Mr. President, at the same time that it calls for slashing Medicare, \nMedicaid, and student loans, this budget calls for increases of about \n$58 billion over the next 7 years in the Pentagon budget, an increase \nof $58 billion over the next 7 years, in the post-cold-war period. I \nwas in a debate the other night with a colleague in the House who said \nwe needed to eliminate legal services for the poor, all in the name of \ndeficit reduction. The total cost of legal services for the poor is \n$400 million. It is not even 40 percent of the cost of one B-2 bomber. \nMr. President, I do not see the standard of fairness.\n  What we have done here is we have massive tax cuts, with almost all \nthe benefits flowing to the most affluent citizens. We have draconian \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid which will not work on good health care \npolicy. And, in addition, we cut financial assistance for students for \nhigher education, and we cut into nutrition programs for the most \nvulnerable citizens. But we do not touch corporate welfare or ask \nmilitary contractors to be a part of this at all. And when it comes to \nhealth care, we do not have any health care reform, any system of wide \ncost containment.\n  Mr. President, I will introduce a resolution soon which will then be \nrecrafted as an amendment to the first appropriate legislative vehicle \nto express the sense of the Senate that by the end of the 104th \nCongress the Senate should pass health care legislation to provide all \nAmericans with coverage at least as good as what the Senate provides \nfor itself. That sounds familiar because we are back to health care. \nThis does not meet the Minnesota standard of fairness. And I hope \nbefore it is all over we get back to some shared sacrifice. This budget \nI believe is unconscionable. It signals an outrageous and historic \nabandonment of our commitment to vulnerable Americans, our commitment \nto farmers, our commitment to the elderly and to children and to \ncollege students. It signals a rejection of our commitment to the \ncommon good of all, not the special interests of the relatively few in \nAmerica who are wealthy and powerful , and who will benefit enormously \nfrom the tax breaks in this budget. It is an abandonment of our \ncommitment to some modicum of economic and social justice, and it \nshould be roundly rejected by this body. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I wish to join my colleagues in complimenting \nSenator Domenici for his stewardship of this budget because this is \ntruly a historic budget. I have been in the Senate 15 years. We never \npassed a budget that anyone could really credibly call a balanced \nbudget. This one we can. The Congressional Budget Office says this is a \nbalanced budget. This is truly an historic occasion.\n  This is the first budget I have voted for that will curtail the \ngrowth of entitlements. Every other budget, including those under the \nReagan administration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton \nadministration never attempted to reduce the rate of growth of \nentitlement programs. In this budget we have done just that.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership, \nand also Senator Dole, as well as our colleagues in the House, because \neveryone has been a contributing partner in this budget. The House is \npassing the budget right now. And my hope is that we will pass it in a \ncouple of hours.\n  Mr. President, I think we are making history. I think we are making \nthe right kind of history. The American people have asked for a \nbalanced budget. And we are finally going to start delivering.\n  When we debated a couple months ago on the floor of the Senate \nwhether or not to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, many people on both sides of the aisle said we should balance \nthe budget regardless of whether or not we have a constitutional \namendment. And I agreed with that statement. However, we have to vote \nyes today in order to achieve that balanced budget. I hope our \ncolleagues on both sides will support this budget resolution because it \nis the only resolution that leads towards a balanced budget.\n  President Clinton, during his campaign talked about balancing the \nbudget. The budget that he proposed in February of this year was not a \nbalanced budget. As a matter of fact, the deficit under this budget \nincreased every single year, from $200 billion to almost $300 billion.\n  The budget that he introduced very late in the game, just a few weeks \nago, would balance the budget over 10 years according to his estimates. \nBut according to CBO he did not balance the budget. CBO says the \ndeficit under the President's new plan would stay in the $200 billion \nrange forever. So it is not a balanced budget. He has suggested \nbasically a perpetual deficit of a couple hundred billion dollars.\n  The only budget proposal that will get anywhere close to a balanced \nbudget is the one that we have before us. The compromise between the \nHouse and the Senate calls for a balanced budget by the year 2002. Some \npeople, said why did you pick the year 2002? That was the date proposed \nin the constitutional amendment. Sixty-six senators agreed to balance \nby that date. That is what we have done in this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I will insert in the Record three or four charts that \nshow the facts, because I heard my colleague from Minnesota say that \nthis budget did not do very much, or it cut too much in some areas. I \nwant to give people the facts.\n  First, I just want to compare this budget agreement to President \nClinton's latest budget in June. You will see in this chart that our \nbudget has a steady decline in the deficit. Every single year under our \nbudget we have a steady decline in deficit figures to where we get to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2000. In the President's budget, the \ndeficit stays in the $200 billion range. These are the figures. These \nare the facts. I will put these numbers in the Record. I think people \nare entitled to their own opinion. I do not think they are entitled to \ntheir own facts.\n  I heard my colleague from Minnesota say we are slashing Medicare, we \nare slashing Medicaid and slashing student loans and slashing several \nother programs. Mr. President, I do not consider those comments to \nrepresent the facts. When you talk about these programs, you have to \nconsider how much money we are spending this year and how much money we \nare spending next year. If we are spending more money next year, I do \nnot consider that slashing a program. I will put another table in the \nRecord which compares what we are going to be spending under this \nbudget compared to if we actually froze spending. We are going to \nincrease spending in Social Security compared to 1995 levels, $556 \nbillion. Under Medicare we are going to spend $355 billion more than \nthis year.\n  In other words, every single year we will spend more. I am going to \nprint those facts in the Record.\n  Medicare, for example: Spending in 1996 goes up $13 billion compared \nto 1995; 1997, $24 billion; 1998, $36 billion; 1999, $48 billion. All \nincreases over the 1995 level--and I could go on --we will spend a \ntotal of $355 billion more in Medicare than what we would have spent if \nwe had a straight freeze.\n  Under Medicaid, we will spend $149 billion more than we would if we \nfroze Medicaid for 7 years.\n  I heard my colleague from Minnesota say this budget spends billions \nmore on defense. He said the Pentagon. He said we are spending $58 \nbillion more in the Pentagon. Mr. President, that is not a fact, or he \nis using some weird baseline.\n  The facts are, in defense we are spending $270 billion this year. In \nthe \n\n[[Page S 9383]]\nyear 2002, we are going to spend $271 billion, and spending actually \ndeclines in the interim. We are actually going to spend $13 billion \nless. In other words, if we froze defense at this year's level for 7 \nyears, we would spend $13 billion more than we would under this budget.\n  So my colleague said we are spending $58 billion more, but not more \ncompared to 1995. Defense would do much better if we froze it at 1995 \nlevels and left it at that level, with no adjustments for inflation. I \nknow I heard my colleague from Minnesota say we are spending $58 \nbillion more for the Pentagon. Not so. We are going to spend $355 \nbillion more in Medicare, $149 billion more in Medicaid, and spend \nactually $13 billion less in defense.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts. Again, people certainly are \nentitled to their opinion. If you use a baseline, you should use a \nbaseline of what we are spending this year, so if you have an increase \nfrom this year, it is an increase; if you are spending less than this \nyear, that is a decrease, not some hypothetical baseline that is \ninflated for all kinds of things.\n  I will make another comment on Medicare. I hear a lot of colleagues \nsay these are draconian cuts in Medicare. Medicare per capita spending \nin 1995 is $4,816. In the year 2002, it will be $6,734. That is a \nsignificant increase, almost $2,000 more per capita after 7 years in \nMedicare than we are spending today. That is an increase in every \nsingle year.\n  Some of our colleagues say that is a draconian cut. I do not think \nso. I might mention, too, Mr. President, if we do not do something in \nMedicare, we have serious problems. We are walking away from a problem \nbecause Medicare, according to the President's own trustees, is going \nbankrupt; it is going broke.\n  Actually, in the year 1997, the Medicare trust fund starts spending \nmore money than is coming in, and it begins to drain the so-called \ntrust funds. Frankly, there are no magical trust funds, there is simply \nan IOU in the account, and we will have to borrow money to redeem that \nIOU.\n  By the year 2002, the $125 billion IOU is gone. Medicare cannot \nborrow from other trust funds. So we have two options, you either \nreduce the rate of growth of spending in Medicare or you increase \npayroll taxes. Payroll taxes are already pretty high and most of us do \nnot think that is the right solution.\n  Most people say keep the funds solvent by reducing the rate of growth \nof spending in Medicare. Under our proposal, we allow Medicare spending \nto grow by 6.4 percent annually, which is two or three times the rate \nof inflation projected for the outyears. So let us be responsible, let \nus save the Medicare system. It is going broke right now. If we do \nnothing, as originally proposed under President Clinton's budget in \nFebruary, the system will go broke. It will not be able to pay hospital \nand doctor bills, and that is not responsible. That is not an \nacceptable solution.\n  I just hope my colleagues will think a little bit about what we are \ndoing today and remember some of the speeches we make back in our home \nStates before the chambers of commerce and the rotary clubs that we \nbelieve in a balanced budget; we do not think the Government should \nspend more than it takes in.\n  We have a chance today to substantiate that belief. We have a chance \ntoday to say, ``Let us live within our means.''\n  I will say this budget may not be perfect. I heard some other \ncolleagues say, ``I don't agree with each particular part of the \nbudget.'' This budget is just a guideline. The authorizing committees \nare going to have to make the tough decisions. The authorizing \ncommittees are going to have to make decisions about where we are going \nto cut spending, how we are going to allocate it, how we are going to \nreduce the rate of growth in some of these entitlement programs. We do \nnot do that here. That process will occur in a reconciliation bill, and \nthe President will have to sign it.\n  We keep hearing rumors that he will not sign it. I think that would \nbe irresponsible. We have to adopt this budget today, which is a tough \nvote for some, but the tougher votes will be in the reconciliation \npackage.\n  I hope my colleagues stand up and say, ``Let's work together.''\n  I see my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. He, Senator \nSimpson, and others, have talked about significant entitlement reform, \nand I compliment them. Many of us talked at various times in the past \nabout working in a bipartisan fashion to see if we can balance the \nbudget. Let us be responsible. Let us not continue to pile up trillions \nof dollars of debt.\n  Today is the first step. Today we have to pass the budget resolution, \nand sometime probably in September we have to pass a reconciliation \npackage to make it happen.\n  I hope we will show courage today, and I hope we will show courage in \nSeptember to truly get us on a path to balancing the budget in a \nresponsible way; not by taking taxes from hard-working Americans, but \nby reducing the rate of growth of spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the charts to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               DEFICIT COMPARISON                                               \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002   Sum 96-02\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference............................

Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent request, \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska has 15 minutes under his control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise reluctantly.\n  As most of our fellow Senators know, I believe it is critical that \nthis Nation become more fiscally responsible.\n  Accordingly, I joined Senators Sam Nunn and Bob Kerrey in voting for \nthe original Senate budget resolution last month, even though I \ndisagreed with many of the underlying priorities and was fundamentally \nopposed to any possibility of any tax cut before true balance is \nactually reached.\n  I did so because I thought it represented a commitment to serious \ndeficit reduction and deserved bipartisan support.\n  I wanted very much to be able to vote for the conference report we \nare now considering for the same reasons. But I cannot vote for the \nconference report, Mr. President, because the conferees insisted on \nchanges I simply cannot support in good conscience.\n  I differ with many of our colleagues because I believe it is \nessential that we make some very difficult but necessary cuts in our \nprojected spending, and I am willing to take the heat with those who \nhave the fortitude to make them. In fact, when President Clinton was \nkind enough to ask me recently for advice regarding his role in the \ncurrent budget process, I not only urged him to reenter the debate with \nhis own revised proposal, but I also urged him to stick to the 7-year \ngoal the Congress had already established and to abandon his own more \nmodest and better targeted tax cut, because I thought it was paramount \nthat the progress he had begun on deficit reduction in 1993 be \ncontinued. There is no question that his 10-year plan is fairer and \nmore practical than the one we will vote on today, although I wish he \nhad stuck to CBO figures.\n  Mr. President, if this conference report better reflected the \npriorities of the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I would \nstill be prepared to support it, and I believe my colleagues, Senator \nNunn and Senator Kerrey, would as well.\n  Instead, however, as compared with the resolution we passed last \nmonth, the conference report we vote on today is less fiscally \nresponsible in every way. Compared to the original Senate resolution, \nthis resolution increases the deficit every single year before the year \n2002. It increases the national debt. It postpones most of the \npolitically difficult decisions until we are so far down the road that \nwe will not be credible, and it places the burden primarily on those \nleast able to bear it, all to provide a tax cut that would \ndisproportionately benefit those with incomes well above the national \naverage.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, it is now structured in such a way \nthat the tax cut can be guaranteed this year to start taking effect \nimmediately, while most of the savings from which it is theoretically \nderived would not begin to show up until after the turn of the century.\n  Mr. President, that is not credible and that is not conscionable. I \nwill continue to work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmake the tough decisions that lie ahead, and they are going to be far \ntougher than those willing to vote for this conference report are \nwilling to acknowledge at this point. But I cannot be a party to \nguaranteeing a tax cut now that will not be paid for until much later, \nor to endorsing a much less fiscally responsible approach to the \nserious debt and deficit challenges facing this country.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the original Senate budget resolution.\n   But regrettably I will have to vote against this conference report, \nbecause it is less credible, less responsible, and less fair.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I, too, come reluctantly and with \nconsiderable regret to vote ``no'' on this conference report. All of us \nhave come to the floor and talked about the deficit and what it does. \nThere is no question that the deficit reduces savings in America, \nreduces productivity, the standard of living; and perhaps as \nsignificantly as anything, it reduces Americans' confidence and hope \nand reduces the world's confidence in the United States' capacity to \nlead.\n  So I applaud the distinguished chairman of the committee, the \ncourageous Senator from New Mexico, for saying to the United States of \nAmerica, and to this Congress, that we have to change courses and go in \na different direction. That changed course is going to require \ndifferent kinds of attitudes and different kinds of behavior. It is \ngoing to require political courage to do things that will be unpopular. \nIt is going to require hard choices and tough work. It is going to \nrequire deferred gratification, and, most important, it is going to \nrequire us to say to the American people that we are moving in the \ndirection of becoming an entitlement society and we need to start \nmoving in the direction, once again, of becoming an endowment society, \nwhich our country was when my parents' generation was in charge.\n  I regret voting ``no'' on the straw that broke this small camel's \nback, which was the desire, as I see it, to do something that is much \neasier and more popular, that is to cut taxes for some individuals in \nsome businesses. It was done in the name of growth and in the name of \nthe American family. Far better, I must say, in the name of both growth \nand family security, would have been for us to have taken the proposal \nof the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Georgia, Senators \nDomenici and Nunn, for a U.S.A. tax that would have eliminated the \nincome tax altogether and been a powerful incentive for all American \nfamilies to acquire wealth. We have missed an opportunity, in my \njudgment, Mr. President, to produce a truly bipartisan conference \nreport. I was willing to cross and make it bipartisan and to defend \nagainst a tax, and will still, in some key and difficult areas.\n  Mr. President, in addition to deficits growing and debt growing in \nthe United States of America and us moving in the direction of becoming \nan entitlement society, there are two other trends we must face \ndirectly that are bad for free enterprise capitalism and for a liberal \ndemocracy, such as the United States of America.\n  Trend No. 1 is a decline in real wages, salaries, and benefits as a \nproportion of U.S. output. Trend No. 2 is an increased concentration of \nwealth. I argue, Mr. President, that in order to be able to \nconstructively reverse both of those trends, we have to do a number of \nthings. One, we have to fix the cost of entitlements in the United \nStates--our Federal entitlement programs--at some percentage that we \nall decide is an agreeable and appropriate amount, \n\n[[Page S 9385]]\nand then allow the balance of our budget to go for those things that \nwill give us the opportunity of lifting wages, salaries, and benefits.\n  Mr. President, I heard many people come to the floor and say, ``I am \nagainst the cuts in Medicare, cuts in education, but I am for deficit \nreduction.'' It is going to be impossible for us to do both of those \nthings. One of the biggest flaws of this budget resolution is that we \ngo from 34 percent of our budget, going to domestic programs, to 25 \npercent. If you extend it out beyond retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, which begins in 2008, we eventually get to a point where 8 \npercent of our budget is for domestic spending and 92 percent is for \nentitlements. That will require us to do something that very few want \nto do, that is to put retirement on the table. It is our biggest \nspending program. Those who say that the previous generation--the \ngeneration that won World War II and the cold war--is unwilling to \nparticipate in deficit reduction to provide opportunities for our \nchildren, I believe, are misjudging that generation. We are pandering, \nresponding in political fear of what happened in 1985 or 1986.\n  Mr. President, we have to put retirement on the table, or we cannot \nfix entitlements as a percent of our budget, and we will never have the \nmoney we need to invest in education, transportation, infrastructure, \nresearch and technology, and all the things that a majority of \nRepublicans and Democrats acknowledge will, if we get them out there, \nhelp Americans lift their standards of living, wages, salaries, and \nbenefits.\n  Second, on the trend to increase concentration of wealth, again, we \nhave to reform our retirement programs. They are not a savings program, \nMr. President. As a consequence, Americans do not enjoy the benefits of \nthat 12.4 percent payroll tax.\n  Senator Simpson and I have a proposal that would create a 2 percent \npersonal investment plan. Not only does our proposal help fix the cost \nof entitlement programs but, in addition, it generates a trillion \ndollars of new wealth, Mr. President, new wealth owned by 137 million \npeople in the work force. We do not just have to end the course we are \non of deficits and rising debts, but the increasing concentration of \nwealth and decline of real wages and benefits and salaries of American \nworking people ought to alarm anybody who believes that the United \nStates of America needs to continue to lead with our example of free \nenterprise capitalism and liberal democracy.\n  Mr. President, I was going to talk only until Senator Nunn came to \nthe floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, Senator Nunn is delayed and \nwill be here later in the debate. So if the Senator wishes to continue \nfor his full 15 minutes that he has under his control, that would be \nall right.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from California. I will try to \nsummarize in a brief fashion.\n  Again, I believe we need to change courses. This is very much about \nus deciding whether or not we have the capacity in 1995 and the \ndecision to impact our future. Can we change our future? Can we change \nthe way the future looks in America?\n  There is no question that this budget resolution will change the \nfuture in that our deficit will be gone. But, Mr. President, it does \nnot do it in either a fashion that I can comfortably say is fair, \nbecause it reduces, in my judgment, taxes unnecessarily and \ninadvisedly. It does not give us the hope that we are going to have the \ncapacity to reverse another trend, and that is the decline of wages, \nsalaries, and benefits of working Americans, and the trend toward \nincreasing the concentration of wealth.\n  I am prepared to make difficult decisions. I am prepared to join with \nthe Republicans in changing the course of this country, in saying that \nwe are going to do the difficult and not the easy things. I regret very \nmuch that this resolution did not survive as a bipartisan resolution. I \nunderstand that there was great enthusiasm to put an even larger tax \ncut and lock it in.\n  I regret that the conference yielded to that demand, if not threat, \nand produced, in the end, a budget resolution that will have no \nbipartisan support. I think, as a consequence, Mr. President, we will \nhave a much more difficult time persuading Americans that we can change \ncourse and that we need to change course as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. I trust the Senator \nwill yield----\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will he yield it to the manager of the bill rather than \ngive it up, since our time is short?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the remainder of my time to the manager of the \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I know the Senator from Ohio has been \nwaiting for his 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nbudget resolution. With this budget, we begin to deliver on the \npromises that were made to the American people last November. This \nCongress will do what prior Congresses have not done. It will pass a \nrealistic budget for the U.S. Government.\n  The current direction of the United States budget policy is simply \nnot sustainable. Congress has already amassed a $4.7 trillion national \ndebt that our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay \noff. We are already paying over $235 billion a year just in interest on \nthe national debt. By the year 2002, just 8 years from now, spending on \nentitlements and interest will exceed 70 percent of our entire budget. \nTake out defense, that leaves just 15 percent of the budget for all the \ndiscretionary spending on domestic needs--that is 15 percent of the \nwhole budget: 15 percent, for education, for job training, for Women, \nInfants, and Children programs; just 15 percent for all of these \ndomestic needs. That is just if we stay on our present course.\n  Really, it does not get any better after the year 2003. By the year \n2012, just 17 years from today, there will be nothing left in the \nbudget for these social needs--zero. No money for our children. Every \nlast penny in the Federal budget will go for entitlements and interest \npayments. That is the future, bankruptcy on top of a breathtakingly \nhigh mountain of debt.\n  When my parents graduated from high school in the early 1940's, the \ndebt on each child who graduated that year was $360. By the time my \nwife Fran and I graduated in the mid-1960's, it was up to $1,600 on \neach child. When our older children, Patrick and Becky and Jill, \ngraduated in the mid-1980's, that figure stood at $9,000. If we \ncontinue to go the way we have been going, by the year 2012--just 1 \nyear after our grandson Albert graduates from high school, and just 1 \nyear after our daughter Anna enters college--by that year, 2012, that \nfigure will be $25,000. That will be $25,000 in debt for each person in \nthis country and no money at all to pay for urgent national needs.\n  I believe this is much more than a budget question. It is much more \nthan a question of accounting and bookkeeping. It is a fundamental \nmoral question about the kind of people we, as Americans, really are. I \nbelieve we do not have the right--I do not think we have the right to \nleave our children a bankrupt America. They deserve a lot better from \nus than that.\n  Another way of looking at it, when my parents were growing up, back \nin the 1930's, each family in this country had to work until about \nMarch 8 to pay for their taxes. By the time I was growing up in the \n1960's, a typical family had to work until April 16. Today, 1995, \nAmerican families have to work up until May 6, to pay their taxes. We \nhave gone from March 8 to April 16 to May 8. That is simply going in \nthe wrong direction.\n  Last November, the American people decided they were sick and tired \nof this. They demanded a fundamental change of course, and they are \nright. I believe today, with what I hope will be the passage of this \nbudget, we begin to bring about the change the people of this country \nvoted for last November. This budget is based on a simple idea. First, \nwe cut Government spending. Then we have a sensible, realistic tax cut. \nBecause two things are necessary if we want to ensure America's \nprosperity as we move into the 21st century. First, we have to make \nsure Congress does not spend more than it takes in. Second, we have to \ngive some tax relief to American families. We have to let \n\n[[Page S 9386]]\nfamilies keep more of their own resources so they can save for their \nown future and invest in America's future.\n  In conclusion, this conference report I believe is in fact a \nrealistic blueprint for an American future we can be proud to leave our \nchildren. I congratulate Chairman Domenici and Chairman Kasich for \ntheir outstanding work.\n  I intend to vote ``yes'' on this conference report, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe I have 8 minutes. I appreciate \nthe cooperation of all sides here in helping us move this debate \nforward.\n  First of all, I am a little disappointed the Senator from New Mexico \nis not here. I wanted to thank him for one small thing in this budget. \nI disagree with this budget very much, and I am going to explain why. \nBut there was one small part of it which dealt with the Presidio, which \nis a national park in San Francisco. There was a move to sell it off \nand cooler heads prevailed. Republicans and Democrats got together and \nwe have a terrific approach to that park. Now the new conference \nlanguage is we will not sell the Presidio. We will, in fact, try to \nmaximize the revenues from leasing the various buildings and put that \ntoward running the park.\n  So I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Budget Committee for \nthat. And I think that about ends my compliments on this budget. I do \nnot think anyone in the Chamber would be that surprised. As a member of \nthe Budget Committee, I really fought for other priorities and I would \nlike to explain why.\n  First of all, I would like to correct the record. The Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, and a couple of others said this was the \nfirst time the CBO ever said that there would be a surplus.\n  That is not the case. I have here an official document, where the CBO \nshows that in fact there was going to be a surplus. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nHouse Report 101-820--Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year \n                                  1991\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H.

So, this is not the first time the CBO stated we would be \nin surplus.\n  Let me say I listened very carefully to the opening debate on the \nbudget, and there were many points made by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. They feel very good about this budget. I feel happy \nfor them, that they do. But they kept saying this budget is a \ncompromise. This budget they bring before us is a compromise.\n  I asked myself, compromise with whom? Usually, if you have a \ncompromise, you take different viewpoints and you reconcile them and \nyou call that a compromise. Then I realized, it was the Republicans in \nthe House compromising with the Republicans in the Senate. There was no \ncompromise between different ideas. There was no compromise with the \nPresident, who laid out his own ideas. It was a compromise between the \nRepublicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate. And they are \ncongratulating themselves for reaching a compromise.\n  That is like me saying congratulations for reaching a compromise with \nSenator Patty Murray, with whom I agree 98 percent of the time. It is \nlike looking at yourself in the mirror saying ``Nice tie,'' and the \nmirror says ``Nice tie'' back. That is not a compromise. That is a love \nfest.\n  Let us face it, the Republicans are proud of their Republican \nrevolution. They stated clearly what it was going to be. They wanted to \ngive tax breaks to the wealthiest among us, and they did. But they did \nnot have to really compromise. Oh, there were some changes around the \nedges on that. But essentially that is what we have.\n  I want to take a look at this with my colleagues, the chart that we \nhave that shows the impact of these cuts. If you look at the budget--\nhow did they get \n\n[[Page S 9387]]\nthe tax cuts? They talk about deficit reduction, deficit reduction, \ndeficit reduction. I voted for a balanced budget. Bill Bradley had one \nout here. Kent Conrad had one out here. We did not give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest. Do you know what that meant? We did not have to hit so hard \non Medicare and the elderly. We did not have to hit so hard on kids and \neducation. We did not have to decimate environmental programs. No, we \ndid not. Because we do not think the people in the upper income \nbrackets need a huge tax cut.\n  Then, when you bring this up, my friends on the other side say, \n``Class warfare; there they go again, class warfare.''\n  Look, the American dream that everyone has in this country is that \nthey will work hard, play by the rules, and become comfortable--\nwealthy. That is an American dream. And that is fine. We all work \ntoward that--work hard, play by the rules, and be sure we can manage \nour finances and our families.\n  But here, what we are saying in this budget, is the middle class will \npay to give tax breaks to the rich. The children will pay to give tax \nbreaks for the rich. That is the Republican revolution.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. I was on it for many years in the \nHouse. I look at this budget. It is pretty clear to me.\n  Oh, they say, we are not cutting Medicare. We are not cutting it. I \nask you a question. If the demographics are changing and more people \nget old and more people need Medicare, of course you have to increase \nspending. If you do not increase it enough, people will not get the \nprogram. If they wanted to talk about reforms first, I would have been \nright there. We showed you can cut Medicare half as much and save the \nelderly, as long as you do not give that tax break to the upper \nincomes.\n  Look at this chart. If you earn over $200,000, you are in for a \ntreat. You are going to get back $9,000 every year. But if you are \nmiddle class, if you look at the cuts here--to the children, to the \ncollege students, to the elderly--you are going to take a terrible hit. \nThose between $75,000 and $100,000, they are going to be hit by $676; \nand guess what, folks, if you earn less than $30,000, you are going to \nbe hit by $1,183; while those over $200,000 get back $9,000.\n  This is an abomination. This is the Republican revolution. Hear it \nloud and clear. Hear ye, hear ye. The rich get richer and everybody \nelse stays the same. The poor get poorer. The middle class gets poorer.\n  Mr. President, I think the choice is clear for colleagues. They can \nstand up for the middle class. They can stand up for the working poor. \nThey can stand up for the average American, which is what Democrats do. \nThat is the difference between the parties. This is why I like this \nbudget debate. It is why I wanted to be on the Budget Committee. Or you \ncan stand up for the wealthiest. One of my colleagues says he never got \na job from a poor person. Well, I would ask a question. Could the \nwealthy person have ever made money if there were not working people in \nthis country? Let us be fair. This budget is not fair.\n  So to summarize, it seems to me very clear. If you want to slash \nMedicare, vote for this budget. If you want to slash Medicaid, vote for \nthis budget. And by the way, two-thirds of Medicaid goes to old people \nin nursing homes. Vote for the budget if you want to hurt those people. \nVote for the budget. Do you want to hurt the kids? Vote for the budget. \nIt cuts education. It makes it harder to get a student loan.\n  I ask one question. We worry so much about crime, and we should.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we worry a lot about crime, and we should. \nI have not seen a scientific survey on it, though, so if anyone wants \nto correct me, I will stand corrected. But I do not know too many \nburglars, too many robbers, too many drug dealers who have a college \neducation. I really do not. I think a lot of our problem stems from the \nfact that we do not give opportunity. What are we doing here? Cutting \nstudent loans.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have a chance to stand up for what we \nbelieve in. Do I believe in a balanced budget? You bet. I voted for two \nversions. President Clinton authored one. Some people say it did not go \nfar enough. The bottom line is he made the point. You do not have to \ndecimate this country to balance the budget. Vote no on this Republican \nbudget. Vote no, and do it proudly, because when you vote no, you are \nstanding up for the average American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the concurrent \nbudget resolution. But before I do that, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the efforts of Senator Domenici, \nRepresentative Kasich, and the members of the budget resolution \nconference committee in presenting us with a concurrent budget \nresolution which balances the Federal budget by fiscal year 2002. I \nsupport the overall direction that this budget mandates for the \ncountry.\n  For the first time in over a generation, we are about to pass a \nbudget resolution that will--we are not there yet--bring the Federal \nbudget into balance. I do not think anyone will dispute the \noverwhelmingly positive impact that balancing the Federal budget will \nhave on America's economy, and consequently, upon the American family \nstandard of living. By every account interest rates will drop. Per \ncapita incomes will rise. Millions of jobs should be created. More \nmoney will be available for investment. Thus expanded economic \nopportunity. Also, once this budget is balanced, we will finally be in \na position to begin to make meaningful payment to retire the Federal \ndebt. That would reduce our yearly interest payment on the Federal \ndebt, which will, in turn, free up more money in the Federal budget in \nfuture years for other purposes. One thing is certain, though, if we do \nnot take these steps now, we will certainly mortgage our children's \nfuture.\n  I believe that this budget proposal achieves a balance in a \nresponsible way, and that is why I am supporting it. It reduces the \nsize of the Federal Government, streamlines governmental operations, \nand slows the rate by which Federal spending increases.\n  I think most folks agree that the Federal Government has gotten too \nbig to operate efficiently. This budget proposal addresses this problem \nby reducing legislative branch spending by $200 million. I strongly \nbelieve that, if we are going to ask other Federal agencies to tighten \ntheir belts, Congress has got to be willing to accept our share of the \nreductions.\n  This budget resolution also calls for a $1.9 billion reduction over 7 \nyears in spending in natural source management in an effort to \nstreamline Federal land management agencies. As I stated a couple of \nweeks ago. I support such a reduction in spending, so long as it is \ntargeted toward new land acquisitions, new construction, and new land \nuse planning starts. These reductions in spending should not be made in \nresource programs that return positive benefits to the land, to the \nFederal Treasury, and to local economies. Reductions in resource \nprograms, while attractive in the short-run, are bad fiscal policy in \nthe long-run, and I oppose such reductions.\n  This budget resolution also calls for the continued funding of the \ninterest subsidy for undergraduate study which I firmly support. I \nbelieve that such an investment will have long-term benefits that \noutweigh the short-term costs of such assistance. I am, however, \ndisappointed that the TRIO Program, a program that assists \ndisadvantaged students in acquiring the minimum skills necessary to \ncomplete undergraduate coursework, was not specifically provided for in \nthe conference report. I strongly encourage the budget committees in \nboth the House and Senate to influence the authorization and \nappropriations committees to continue funding for this and like \nprograms.\n  You know, we have heard a lot over the past 2 days about how this \nbudget resolution slashes\n Medicare. The numbers just do not tell such a story. You cannot get \naround the fact that total Medicare spending over the next 7 years will \nexceed $1.6 trillion, which is nearly double the amount spent on the \nprogram during the last 7 years. You can't get around the fact that \nFederal Medicare spending will grow from $4,350 per beneficiary in 1995 \nto $6,070 \n\n[[Page S 9388]]\nper beneficiary in 2002. This is a $1,720 per beneficiary increase--a \n40-percent increase. So when you hear people saying that this budget \nresolution is cutting Medicare, what you are really being told is that \nfunding for Medicare didn't increase by as much as we had hoped that it \nwould. Calling that a cut makes sense only inside the beltway. We need \nto get back to defining a cut as a cut, and this budget resolution does \nthat.\n\n  While I generally support the goals outlined in this concurrent \nbudget resolution, this is not to say that I do not have some concerns \nwith some of its details.\n  This budget proposes a reduction of agriculture research by 10 \npercent, which would reduce total outlays to this program by $1 \nbillion. As I explained a couple of weeks ago. I have concerns with \nthis provision. At a time when wheat yields are dropping, we need to \nkeep a safety net out there. Agriculture research gives our farmers and \nranchers the vital tools that they need. Cutting this research now \nwould have a devastating impact on our farm and ranch communities down \nthe road and thus upon the Federal Treasury. I believe that our first \npriority here should be to protect our farm and ranch families, and I \nam opposed to any reduction in this funding. Furthermore, agriculture \nhas taken more than its fair share of reductions in Federal spending in \nthe past. I do not oppose all reductions in agriculture spending; I do, \nhowever, oppose agriculture suffering disproportionate spending \nreductions.\n  This budget resolution also proposes the privatization of PMA's. I \nlikewise have concerns with this provision. PMA's generate substantial \nrevenues for the Treasury. It makes no sense to me to count the revenue \nreceived from the sale of the PMA's and ignore the revenue foregone \nover the long-term due to the loss of the availability of those assets \nfor power sales. Consequently, I believe that the scoring of revenue \nderived from the sale of PMA's is poor fiscal policy, and I am likewise \nopposed to the privatization of PMA's.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the tax cuts proposed in this \nconcurrent budget resolution. While I support the enactment of middle \nclass tax relief and tax incentives to stimulate the economy and \nenhance wages, I believe that our first priority should be to balance \nthe budget. Consequently, I believe that any tax bill should be \ncontingent upon CBO certification that we are moving toward a balanced \nbudget and should be limited to the $170 billion CBO certified \ndividend. I believe that any tax cuts which exceed the $170 billion \ndividend or which are not tied to deficit reduction are irresponsible, \nand I will oppose them.\n  In conclusion, I would like to praise Senator Domenici, \nRepresentative Kasich, and the members of the budget resolution \nconference committee in presenting a responsible budget resolution, and \nI pledge to work with them to develop a policy that works for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I have heard all of the figures here today. Everybody \nhas had an opportunity to hear them in every speech that I have heard \nacross the aisle. ``I believe in a balanced budget. I believe in \ngetting this deficit under control. But.'' We leave that for the \nAmerican people to judge. ``But'' what? This is not the right time? I \nhave to say that. We have to recognize that, and stand for one thing. \nAnd I think the Senator from California hit the nail right on the head. \nI am going to stand for the American dream.\n  If we continue to plunge this Government into debt, the American \ndream is gone. How would you like to be a young person sitting down \nhere that looks at the prospect, whenever they go into the work force, \nof 85 percent of their paycheck going just to pay the interest on the \nnational debt? I do not think that is a very good prospect. I do not \nthink it is very responsible. I think we are immoral to do that.\n  For the first time in this generation, we are about to pass a budget \nresolution that will bring this budget into balance--not this year or \nnext year or the next--by the year of 2002. And we do it with a minimum \nof hurt. Yes, there is going to be some hurt. But everybody in America \nsaid we will participate. We will help you. If you will help us, we \nwill help you. That is kind of what we are doing in this message. \nBecause if we do not, the balancing of the American budget will have an \neffect on the American economy and consequently on the American family, \nwhich is under strain now, and that family's standard of living. By \nevery account, interest rates will drop. Per capita income will rise. \nAnd who benefits from that? The American family. That is who benefits \nfrom that.\n  So we are in a meaningful position right now. Sure, I do not agree \nwith all of it. I signed a letter. I said let us not worry about \ncutting taxes until we get this spending under control. I still stand \nwith that. They put a message into that which says OK, Finance \nCommittee, you cannot cut any taxes until the Congressional Budget \nOffice tells you that you are in balance, that we can still pay our \nbills and give some money back to the American taxpayer, the person who \nis pulling this wagon.\n  That language is in here. It is in this resolution. Remember, this \nresolution does not become law. The President does not sign this. This \nis a blueprint to get us to where we are going. When we pass the \nreconciliation, that is when we start shooting with real bullets, and \nwe will find out who really wants to balance the budget and who does \nnot. So I am going to support this budget resolution. So for the first \ntime since I have been here, we are on the right track.\n  I believe it is getting us there in a responsible way. So I am going \nto stand with all Americans--rich, whatever--all of them because I \nhappen to believe very much in the American dream.\n  I am probably a product of that American dream. I started out on 160 \nacres with two rocks and some dirt. I did not have anything. The \nAmerican dream means something to me. That was back in the days when \nyou worked and you tried to get ahead.\n  So this resolution calls for a $1.9 billion reduction over the 7-year \nspending in natural resource management. We are a resource State. But \nif it is responsible, we can handle that. I will tell you what we have \nto do. We have to make those natural resources available to the entire \nAmerican public, and not just lock it up for a chosen few. We have to \napproach it with a different mindset.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution. The right \nlanguage is in there. Yes, there are some cuts that I do not like. They \nare not in Medicare. They are not in Medicaid. We are not cutting those \nfolks. Those continue to go up. Every year, they go up. Only in this 13 \nsquare miles of logic-free environment does an increase mean a cut. I \nnever figured that out.\n  So basically, we are back at zero-base budgeting to fund those and \nmake us set the priorities of what we should be financing, and what the \ntrue role of Government is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 1004 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the budget deficit this year stands now \nat $176 billion. It is projected to remain roughly at $200 billion a \nyear through the end of the century if we support the position \npresented to us by the President's budget.\n  Our debt is now growing at an astounding rate of $335,000 a minute--\n   $20 million an hour, $482 million a day. I believe we are mortgaging \nour children's future. A young couple just getting started in life now \nwill pay $113,200 in interest on that debt if nothing is done about it. \nI am concerned about this.\n\n  Last year, my youngest son, Ben, and his new wife, Elizabeth, blessed \nme and our family with a new granddaughter. The day baby Suzie was born \nin Anchorage--it was last year--was a happy one for our Stevens family. \nBut I do not think it was such a happy day for baby Suzie if you think \nabout it. Suzie was born owing the Federal Government $18,500. That is \nreally her share of the total national Federal debt. Under the no-\nbalance budget submitted by the President, Suzie's share of the debt \nwill increase by 25 percent in 5 years to over $23,000. Suzie, I think, \nwould not like it too well when she learns that \n\n[[Page S 9389]]\nshe will pay $187,000 in income tax over her life just to pay the \ninterest on the national debt if it stays static, just like it is right \nnow.\n  The Federal debt and the deficit, unfortunately, will grow right \nalong with Suzie. When she buys her first car or buys her new house, \nshe will pay higher interest rates because of the debt and the deficit.\n  Recent estimates show that interest rates are 2 percent higher than \nthey would be if the debt and the deficit were under control. Suzie's \ntaxes will be out of sight based on all local, State and Federal taxes. \nEven President Clinton's budget projects her lifetime net tax rate at \n82 percent. Unfortunately, the more taxes my little granddaughter Suzie \nwould pay, the less she will get back. The benefits, the services of \nthe Federal Government just will not be there. Most of her taxes will \ngo to pay the interest on the debt, about $3,500 every year of her \nlife, and by the time she is 17 we calculate that all of the taxes \nSuzie will pay will be consumed by interest on the debt and the \nentitlements. And when her parents, my son Ben and his wife Elizabeth, \nretire, there will not be a Medicare trust fund. Unless they are \ncareful savers, Suzie will probably have to take her mom and pop in and \ntake care of them. That is the way it was when I was a kid, Mr. \nPresident. I think people forget that those who have the greatest stake \nin what we are doing are the parents of young children now, and they do \nnot want to have to go back and live with their children when they get \nto be of retirement age.\n  The Medicare board of trustees, including President Clinton's Cabinet \nMembers, warn that the Medicare trust fund will be bankrupt in just 7 \nyears. That is when Suzie will start the first grade.\n  Now, as her Senator and, even more importantly, as her grandfather, I \nbelieve I have a duty to join in the action now to try to ensure a \nbrighter future for her and all American children. And that is why I \njoin today with my friend from New Mexico to support the resolution and \nthe conference report on which he has worked so hard. This resolution \nwill put our country on a glidepath to a balanced budget by the year \n2002. We will increase the growth in Federal spending by 3 percent a \nyear instead of 5 percent a year as President Clinton proposed, and, if \nwe did nothing else, we would reach a balanced budget by the time Suzie \nreaches the second grade.\n  This deficit reduction plan starts with the Congress. Let me point \nout again--I am sure others have--this conference report assumes there \nis a 7-year freeze on congressional pay, judges' pay and the salary of \nGovernment's top officials. As one who has been active for many years \nin that area of post office, civil service, Government service, I \nregret deeply that it has to be done, but it has to be done, and I am \npleased to state, as chairman of the Rules Committee, that we have \nalready carried out the instructions we received to cut committee staff \nof the Senate by 15 percent and support staff by 12.5 percent.\n  This budget eliminates over 100 unnecessary Government programs and \nprojects and proposes to do away with at least one major department \nand, as many know, I am working on a plan to consolidate a series of \nFederal departments in the interest of savings.\n  This measure will protect Alaska's sourdoughs, our retired people. It \nallows Medicare to grow at a rate of 6.4 percent to account for \ninflation and the growing aged population. The average Alaskan's \nbenefits will actually increase now from $4,350 a year to $6,070 a year \nunder Medicare. And our State will have the ability to decide how best \nto administer additional funds. Alaskans know what Alaskans need much \nbetter than Federal officials thousands of miles away here in \nWashington, DC.\n  Medicaid spending for the poor will increase from $89 billion a year \nthis year to $124 billion in 2002. That is a 5 percent increase a year, \nand I keep hearing that we are cutting Medicaid spending. We are \nreducing the rate of growth. We are not cutting spending. And not one \npenny will be cut from Social Security. We will keep our promise to \nAmerica's seniors, and we will find some way to assure that Social \nSecurity will be a solvent safety net for them on into the next \ncentury.\n  This resolution calls for a major downsizing of the Federal \nbureaucracy. Discretionary spending will be reduced by $190 billion \nover 7 years. Foreign aid would be cut by another $23 billion. But as \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased to \nnote that under the Budget Committee's actions, our national defense \nwill remain strong under this proposal. The conference report actually \nrestores $33 billion to the proposed cut in defense over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Now, we still are facing a substantial reduction in defense spending. \nThat is the one area which will continue to go down, not up, Mr. \nPresident. But we believe that the budget as planned is one with which \nwe can live. We can learn to do better with less money. We have \ntargeted the increase that is in this conference report to the \nstrengthening of our readiness, which has declined, and to the \nimprovement of the quality of life for our troops.\n  The budget resolution also calls for savings of $100 million in \nFederal welfare programs over the next 7 years. But it does provide \nthat able-bodied Americans will be trained in order that they may work, \nand a safety net will remain in place for those who are disabled or \nunemployable, those who truly need and deserve our help.\n  I am here to say that I am pleased that Alaska and Alaskans will be \ngiven the chance to make a significant dent in this budget deficit. \nThis legislation assumes that the tremendous oil and gas potential of \nthe Arctic coastal plain will be explored and developed. The desolate \ncoastal plain will raise over $2 billion in Federal bonus bids and \nlease payments over the next 5 years, and there will be tens upon tens \nof billions of dollars in royalties and income taxes paid by those who \nexplore and develop the oil in the North Slope. We have proven that we \ncan develop oil in the North Slope without adversely affecting the \nenvironment. Since oil and gas development began in Prudhoe Bay, for \ninstance, the local caribou population there has increased by 600 \npercent, and I constantly hear that we are going to endanger the \nwildlife population.\n  The measure also includes a tax cut. President Clinton socked us with \nthe largest tax increase in the history of this Nation--$251 billion.\n  In striking contrast, this resolution proposes the biggest tax refund \nin history--$245 billion.\n  That includes family friendly tax reductions like the $500 per child \ntax credit, marriage penalty relief, adoption tax credits, and cuts for \nsenior citizen.\n  The tax proposals will also stimulate the economy. They include a \ncapital gains reduction and an American dream savings plan, a new kind \nof IRA.\n  Even with the tax cuts, overall spending will be reduced by a \nwhopping $1 trillion over 7 years.\n  And the deficit will be reduced by nearly $900 billion during that \nsame period. In the year 2002, the deficit will be zero.\n  Alaskans are willing to tighten their belts. They are demanding a \nsmaller government, and we are going to give it to them in this \nresolution.\n  Just as we all sacrificed during World War II to achieve a greater \ngood, we are willing to do it now to save our children and our country \nfrom certain bankruptcy.\n  I commend Chairman Domenici for the brilliant job he has done in \nputting this resolution together.\n  On behalf of Suzie and all Alaskans, I thank him for his leadership \nand pledge my support of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have had two speakers from that side. We \nnow would go to two speakers on this side, if that is acceptable to the \nRepublican manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I use 50 seconds of my time before the Senators \nproceed?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to Senator Stevens from \nAlaska, I listened to his speech here today. I am very pleased that he \nhas done such a good job of analyzing this as it affects his \nconstituents. More than almost any Senator here, this Senator from \nAlaska watches out for his people, and he has analyzed this budget from \n\n\n[[Page S 9390]]\ntheir standpoint. I think that is the way we ought to do it, and I \ncommend him for it. But I also want to thank him for the support. He \nhas been very, very helpful.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am very pleased now to recognize two of my \nclosest friends and associates in the Senate; first, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Nunn from Georgia, for 5 minutes; \nfollowing that, 20 minutes to my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Nebraska. I thank him for his \nleadership on this overall issue of budget deficit reduction. I also \nwant to commend my good friend, Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and his staff. I know how hard they have worked. I \nknow my friend from New Mexico had to make many difficult decisions to \nreach a conference agreement on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report \nreluctantly, because I voted for it in the Senate and I hoped to be \nable to vote for this overall conference report package. It is very \nimportant. The most significant improvement over past attempts to \nbalance the budget is the inclusion of recommendations to restrain \nsignificantly the projected growth of Federal mandatory or entitlement \nspending, which now represents over 50 cents of every dollar the \nFederal Government spends and will continue to increase even with this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I thought the Senate bill represented a credible \napproach to balancing the budget. I did not agree with all of it. But I \ndid support it because I thought it was about as good as could be \nachieved in this climate this year and certainly an improvement over \npast years. In many areas this conference agreement is similar to the \nSenate bill, but in some areas it is significantly different. In one \narea, defense, it is stronger. And I applaud that. I think that the \nmodest increases for defense in this conference report, as well as the \nfirewalls for the first 3 years, are significant improvements.\n  However, Mr. President, this conference report shares one similarity \nwith previous attempts to balance the budget. I think it could be a \nfatal flaw. And that is, its inclusion of very large tax cuts up front. \nI regret the conference report does not reflect the Senate position on \nthis issue when it rejected, by a vote of 69-31, the mandatory tax cut \namendment offered by Senator Gramm.\n  I certainly do not say this as a criticism of the floor manager, \nSenator Domenici. The leadership of the House made it abundantly clear \nthere would be no conference agreement without a very large tax cut. So \nI am under no illusion that there was any real flexibility on this \npoint on the part of the House.\n  But the objection I have with this tax cut is that it is unsound from \na fiscal standpoint and, most importantly, makes the spending cuts \nrequired to reach a balanced budget both larger and much less likely to \nbe implemented as time passes. I will elaborate on that very briefly.\n  A major difference between this bill and the Senate bill was, under \nthe Senate bill, the tax cuts had to come in a separate bill after the \ndeficit reduction was enacted, whereas in the conference agreement \nbefore us now, the tax cuts will be included in the same bill with the \nspending cuts so there will no longer be an opportunity to enact the \nspending cuts and reject or postpone the tax cuts until the spending \ncuts are implemented or until we are confident they will be \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, the Senate budget resolution which we passed out of \nhere made a tax cut possible. The conference report we vote on today \nmakes a tax cut inevitable. I am not opposed to eating dessert after we \nhave taken the caster oil. I am opposed to serving both on the same \nplatter because I have been here awhile. I know what is likely to \nhappen. The Congress is likely to eat the dessert, while pledging to \nswallow the caster oil at a later point.\n  The problem is that most of the spending cuts, or what I call the \ncaster oil, is in the final 2 or 3 years of the 7-year plan under the \nconference report while the tax cuts are up front, and as soon as they \nare made, any attempt to change that if spending cuts have to be rolled \nback will be viewed as a tax increase and will be vehemently opposed. \nThe result of all that is that we are eating the dessert before we are \ntaking the caster oil, and we are pledging to take the caster oil, but \nwe may not be willing to take it when the time comes, which is really, \nin large measure, several years from now.\n  This means that the tax cuts will become locked in and the spending \ncuts, while on the books, are likely to be rolled back in subsequent \nlegislation as the pain begins to be felt. It also means that those of \nus who believe that tax cuts should be reserved until we make sure that \nthe spending cuts stick, because we may have to modify some of those \nspending cuts, with this $170 billion now that will go into the tax \ncuts, we have no way of holding up the tax cuts as a contingency \nreserve should spending cuts be rolled back or moderated.\n  I will close with these thoughts. I think most of us agree that such \na dividend that we are now claiming for tax cuts, which I believe is \n$250 billion now, exists if we balance the budget. However, I still \nbelieve that the most appropriate use of this dividend would be to \napply it to deficit reduction. And that is why I supported the Feingold \namendment. If Congress is unwilling to apply this fiscal dividend to \nthe deficit, then I would prefer to use the dividend to ease the most \nsevere impacts of the spending reduction even if we waited for a while, \nkept it as a contingency fund and determined which are the most severe \nimpacts, because projecting for 7 years and making these impacts before \nwe even know how we are going to modify the health care program is high \nrisk. And we have all been through that before. We went through it on \nthe catastrophic bill and we saw how quickly that one was repealed when \npeople started feeling the impact.\n  This would make the spending cuts more likely to stick. I fear that \nCongress may enact the tax cuts and the spending cuts called for in \nthis resolution and then later reverse itself on the spending cuts. \nSuch action by Congress is not difficult to imagine--just recall \nCongress reversing itself on the Catastrophic health care bill. It was \nenacted and then terminated 18 months later--before it was even \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to fight to address these priorities \nas this process continues and we debate the specific details in the \nreconciliation legislation that will carry out the specifics of this \nplan. I also believe that tax expenditures should not be exempt from \nreview. Balancing the budget requires shared sacrifice, and as we cut \nspending we should also review revenue-losing tax breaks which may not \nbe justified.\n  The general direction required to balance the budget is clear. If \nthere was an easy way or a painless way to balance the budget without \ncutting spending on popular programs, we would have done it long ago. \nBut that is simply not possible. To say it is, or to try and candy coat \nit with upfront tax cuts, only perpetuates such the myth that you can \nsustain the programs popular with the public, provide tax cuts, and \nsimultaneously balance the budget. These numbers just do not add up.\n  I recognize that this conference report will pass and I remain \nhopeful that fiscal responsibility and prudence will come to the \nforefront as we move on to the reconciliation process. We have no other \nchoice, because we cannot afford to continue with the status quo. Many \ntimes when priorities are debated the public is led to believe that \nonly deficit reduction is painful. But the status quo is not painless \neither, nor is it sustainable. We simply cannot continue to pile $200 \nto $300 billion in additional debt each year on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Again I commend my friend from Nebraska for his hard work and my \nfriend from New Mexico for his diligent effort on this resolution. I \nhope I am wrong in my projection of what is likely to happen. But \nhaving been here awhile I have seen this caster oil/dessert business in \nthe past and it is certainly a lot easier to eat the dessert than take \nthe caster oil. And I am afraid that is what we are doing here today.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, for just a brief moment, let me take from \nour time to thank my friend and colleague from Georgia. That was an \nexcellent statement to get right on the edge of the problem we have \nwith this. I like the caster oil/dessert. We have been \n\n[[Page S 9391]]\nthrough caster oil and dessert way back in the 1980's. I am sure that \nis what the Senator is referring to. This is the time to face up to \nreality. And I hope we will defeat the Republican budget.\n  I believe the next speaker would be the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I, too, extend my congratulations and my \nthanks to the two managers, Mr. Domenici and Mr. Exon, for their \nexcellent performance, for their skill in dealing with this very \ndifficult matter. And I have something of an understanding of the \npressures which they were both under.\n  Mr. President, when the FY 1996 budget resolution was being debated \nin the Senate, I spoke at some length in opposition to it. I did so \neven though I strongly support a continuation of efforts to achieve a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  Despite the partisan rhetoric to the contrary, this is not the first \nbudget resolution to come before the Senate promising to balance the \nFederal budget. Despite the fervent wishes of many of the other side of \nthe aisle to the contrary, there have been four other occasions when \nbudget resolutions came before the Senate promising to balance the \nbudget. The 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1991 budget resolutions also \nprojected a balanced budget at the end of 5 years. In fact, the 1991 \nbudget resolution, which was adopted after the 1990 Bipartisan Budget \nSummit, projected a budget surplus after 5 years, without using the \nSocial Security surplus. By way of comparison, if one takes away the \nuse of the Social Security surplus in the pending budget resolution \nconference agreement, there will still be a deficit in excess of $100 \nbillion in 2002, rather than a balanced budget.\n  The 1990 Budget Summit was the last bipartisan effort to balance the \nFederal budget. President Bush proposed no further deficit reductions \nin his last two budgets--for fiscal years 1992 or 1993.\n  When taking office, President Clinton did propose a deficit reduction \npackage which Congress enacted in October of 1993, without a single \nRepublican vote in either House of the Congress. That reconciliation \nbill cut the deficit by almost $500 billion over 5 years.\n  Now, I raise these matters to make the Record clear that I, along \nwith many others in both Houses of Congress, and on both sides of the \naisle, have struggled with these huge Federal deficits year after year \nover a long period of time. We made many, many tough choices in the \npast and in the hopes of balancing the budget.\n  We have been assured on a number of occasions in the past, in budget \nresolutions such as this one, that budget balance would be achieved. \nNone of these past efforts have met expectations; none have achieved a \nbalanced budget, despite the expertise and objectivity of the budget \nestimators at the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  So here we are today debating another in a long series of budget \nresolutions which projects a balanced budget in the year 2002, if we \nuse the Social Security surplus to offset what would otherwise be a \ndeficit. Furthermore, we are told that the calculations contained in \nthis budget resolution do not allow for any recessions over the next \nseven years. Yet, history tells us that there surely will be one or \nmore recessions between now and the year 2002. I, therefore, greatly \ndoubt that this agreement will result in a balanced budget, even if we \nadopt it and then enact all of its proposals.\n  This brings me to the specifics of this agreement. Mr. President, \nfirst, let me say that I opposed the Senate-passed budget resolution \nbecause I felt that it provided a wrongheaded approach and a misguided \nblueprint for the Nation's fiscal and social policy over the next seven \nyears. I reached this conclusion reluctantly, knowing how difficult it \nis to achieve nearly $1 trillion in deficit reduction, as the Senate-\npassed budget resolution and as this conference agreement would do.\n  I voted against the Senate budget resolution for a number of reasons. \nAmong them was the fact that the Senate-passed budget resolution called \nfor non-defense discretionary spending cuts totalling $190 billion \nbelow a 1995 freeze, while military spending would not be cut at all \nover the next seven years. I did so, as well, because the Senate-passed \nbudget resolution called for cutting Medicare by $256 billion and \nMedicaid by $175\n billion, mainly for budgetary reasons, without any plan to improve \nhealth care or to contain health care costs. And, I did so because the \nSenate-passed budget resolution called for a tax cut for the wealthiest \nin our society of $170 billion over the next 7 years.\n\n  Mr. President, as bad as the national spending priorities in the \nSenate-passed budget resolution were, the pending conference agreement \nis worse in virtually every area. For nondefense discretionary \nspending, this conference agreement would cut $499 billion, or $2 \nbillion more than the Senate-passed budget resolution, while at the \nsame time military spending would go up $33 billion above CBO's capped \nbaseline over the next 7 years. In other words, while we will be \ndestroying the programs which are investments in our future and that of \nour children by cutting nondefense discretionary spending--cuts \ntotalling $500 billion--we will be adding $33 billion over the baseline \nto military spending, even though we have repeatedly seen massive \nboondoggles and wasteful military spending uncovered in the past, and I \nam sure that we will again see them in the future.\n  Mr. President, the budget agreement would increase defense spending \nby some $6 billion for fiscal year 1996, and the Armed Services \nCommittee is now allocating that money to additional spending. Does the \nNation really need to bump up the defense budget by such a large sum at \na time when the threat of the Soviet empire has essentially vanished?\n  The preoccupation with defense spending at the very time when cold \nwar tensions are a memory stands logic on its head. For what will the \nextra money be going? Are we going to dust off the big ABM projects of \nthe early years of Mr. Reagan, outmoded concepts of strategic defense \ninvolving big new systems, expensive new surveillance systems, space-\nbased interceptors and the like? Are we going to junk the ABM Treaty to \nmake way for new, expensive strategic defense gadgetry? Has the Soviet \nUnion been reconstituted? Hardly. It continues to disintegrate. Are \nthere new threats confronting us? Certainly. But those new threats, \nincluding terrorism, biological proliferation and warfare, and \nactivities of powerful drug cartels and criminal syndicates and, \nparticularly, brutal economic competition do not cry out for a neo-\nReagan Star Wars response. We do not have billions to waste on such \nsystems.\n  The same kind of inexplicable drive to enhance and protect the \ndefense accounts has led the committee to erect firewalls between \ndomestic and defense spending for 3 fiscal years. Therefore, we cripple \nour ability to respond to unforeseen needs as the fiscal year evolves, \nallowing money to be shifted to areas of greatest need, or to respond \nto emergencies. It is as if we trust our judgment only when we put the \nbudget resolution together, erecting numbers which must be treated as \nsacred icons, and we do not trust our judgment to make sensible \nadjustments thereafter. With the limited resources that we are working \nwith for all our needs, this is not either efficient or wise.\n  For Medicare, the conference agreement calls for cuts of $270 \nbillion, or $14 billion more than the Senate-passed budget resolution. \nAnd, for Medicaid, the cuts amount to $182 billion, $7 billion greater \nthan the Senate-passed budget resolution. But, for the wealthiest in \nour Nation, this conference agreement calls for a tax cut of $245 \nbillion, $75 billion greater than was projected in the Senate-passed \nbudget resolution.\n  The specifies of this $245 billion tax package have not been decided. \nHowever, it will likely contain many of the key elements of the so-\ncalled ``Contract With America.''\n  Who would get the lion's share of the benefits from these tax cuts? \nAccording to a Treasury Department analysis, less than 16 percent of \nthe benefits of the bill as passed by the House Ways\n and Means Committee would go to the 60 percent of all families with \nincomes below $50,000. The top one percent of families with incomes of \n$350,000 or more a year would receive 20 percent of \n\n[[Page S 9392]]\nthe tax benefits, while more than half of the tax goodies would go to \nthe top 12 percent of families--those with incomes over $100,000 per \nyear.\n\n  According to an analysis by the Treasury Department, over half the \nbenefits from the House Ways and Means Committee's capital gains \nprovisions would go the wealthiest three percent of families who have \nincomes over $200,000, while three-fourths of the benefits would go to \nthe top 12 percent of families who have incomes over $100,000 a year; \nand the House Ways and Means Committee's reduction in the proportion of \nSocial Security benefits that are subject to taxes would give a tax \nbreak to the top 13 percent of Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Similarly, the changes proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee \nin rates of depreciation and the repeal of the corporate Alternative \nMinimum Tax would substantially reduce taxes paid by the Nation's \nlargest corporations.\n  How are we to be sure, Mr. President, that the $245 billion windfall \nwill actually take place over the next 7 years which will enable the \ntax cuts called for in this conference agreement to be undertaken \nwithout adding to the deficit? Senators will recall that under the \nSenate-passed budget resolution, no tax cuts would be allowed until \nafter a reconciliation bill had been signed into law. At that time, CBO \nwould advise Congress of the so-called windfall amount, which could be \nused for a tax cut. What happened to that requirement in the conference \non the budget resolution? It simply disappeared.\n  The conference agreement no longer requires that the reconciliation \nbill be enacted into law prior to consideration of any tax cut. \nInstead, the procedure set forth in this conference agreement would \nhave the CBO compute the deficit reduction that would take place under \nthe reconciliation proposal, prior to its enactment, and then the \nBudget Committees would be able to allocate whatever the CBO-estimated \nwindfall will be to the tax-writing committees of Congress, thus \nenabling them to report tax cut legislation which will be incorporated \ninto the reconciliation bill.\n  In other words, if we adopt this conference agreement and enact the \nreconciliation bill (including these tax cuts) into law, we will be \nproviding massive tax cuts for the wealthiest people and corporations \nin our society before any deficit reduction actually takes place--\nbefore, before any deficit reduction actually takes place; tax cuts for \nthose who clearly do not need them and who clearly should be \nparticipating in our efforts to balance the Federal budget, rather than \ntaking more.\n  At the same time, by adopting this conference agreement, we will be \nreducing our investments in our physical and human resources\n which will greatly hamper our ability to compete in the world \nmarketplace and, I fear, set the stage for this Nation to evolve into a \nsecond-class power in the next century.\n\n  Just one example, this conference agreement proposes termination of \nthe Department of Commerce. If this is intended to save the taxpayer \nmoney, or make government more efficient, or help the economy, it is a \nrash initiative which will cost us dearly if it is carried out. Its \neffect would be to cripple our ability to promote exports, protect \nagainst unfair imports, and create good jobs in the growing export \nsector.\n  The Commerce Department's International Trade Administration is one \nof the bright success stories of our government in decades. It does far \nmore than pay for itself. I am referring here to the International \nTrade Administration of the Department.\n  It is not necessary here to convince my colleagues that exports are \nessential to our national economy, and to jobs. Export-related jobs are \ngrowing seven to eight times the growth rate of total employment. Ten \nyears ago, seven million Americans worked in export-related jobs. Today \nthe number is about 12 million, and, if we keep pushing, by the turn of \nthe century, it could be about 16 million. That is, we could create one \nmillion jobs per year from now through the turn of the century through \nvigorous export promotion. That is what this Department has excelled \nat.\n  So what is the response in this resolution? Dismantle the Department. \nWe do not want to create more jobs. Let our trade competitors mop us \nup. Increase our trade deficit.\n  Mr. President, I could not feel more strongly than I do that the \nadoption of this budget resolution and the reconciliation and tax \nmeasures it calls for could not be more wrongheaded economic and social \npolicies, nor could it be more cruel to the youth of this Nation, nor \nto the elderly, upon whose shoulders the greatest burdens will fall, \nwhile the rich will get richer.\n  I yield back such time as I did not utilize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield Senator Jeffords 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the budget \nresolution. Like many of my colleagues I am concerned with some of the \nchoices made during the budget conference, and would like to take a few \nmoments to express some constructive comments about the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, in reaching a balanced budget we must be careful not \ncut those programs which could be counterproductive to balancing the \nbudget. In other words, cuts in one program can result in increased \ncosts in other programs, thus making it more difficult to balance the \nbudget.\n  One example of this dilemma is in cuts in health research. We are \nnearing discoveries and new treatments to the causes of many illnesses \nand diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. To reduce spending on \nthis research now could mean a continuation of tens of billions of \ndollars in health care costs needlessly spent, only to save a few \nmillion dollars in the short-term. Internationally we are seeing \ndeadlier viruses emerging, we can not afford to weaken our commitment \nto investigating, identifying and eventually eradicating these \ndiseases.\n  Another example is in cutting nutrition programs. For instance, cuts \nin WIC benefits for pregnant women, studies have shown, would increase \nhealth care costs by over $3 for every one dollar cut. Further, our \nfood stamp program provides necessary stability for low-income families \nat the most essential level--putting food on the table. This Nation's \nfuture id dependent upon how well we prepare our children for \nadulthood. Hungry children can not learn.\n  In addition, in the area of cutting education. This Nation faces a \ncrisis--a crisis which is costing us hundreds of billions of dollars in \nlost revenues, decreased economic productivity and increased social \ncosts, such as welfare, crime and health care.\n  Mr. President, business leaders warn us that unless improvements are \nmade in our educational system, our future will be even bleaker. The \nrising costs of higher education combined with the lower income levels \nof middle income families in causing thousands not finish college, and \nfewer to attend graduate school in critical areas such as math, science \nand engineering. As chairman of the Education Subcommittee, I am \nparticularly concerned about maintaining funding for education, and \nwill work with my colleagues during the appropriation and \nreconciliation process to ensure that education programs receive \nadequate funding.\n  Mr. President, thus in order to help solve the deficit problem, as \nimportantly, to prevent the unnecessary hardship to individuals I wish \nto put the leadership on notice, I will find it difficult to support a \nreconciliation bill or appropriation bills that could produce \ncounterproductive budget results and needless hardship for millions of \nAmericans, as outlined above.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that the budget resolution is not a law \nand is advisory in nature. Therefore, I will vote for the budget \nresolution, since I am committed to balancing the federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I can not make it any clearer that I remain firm in my \ncommitment to not see the budget process be used to make \ncounterproductive cuts, just to pay for a tax cut. I am committed to \nbalancing this budget, but not on the basks of the poor, the elderly \nand our children to simply provide a tax cut.\n  In closing, action needs to be taken now by Congress to balance the \nbudget \n\n[[Page S 9393]]\nfor the sake of our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the balanced budget amendment, and I \nsupported the budget agreement that came out of the Senate Budget \nCommittee after it was amended. However, when it traveled over to the \nHouse and was conferenced, substantial and unfortunate changes were \nmade, resulting in what I believe to be counterproductive cuts. \nTherefore, I reluctantly support this budget resolution. I do this, \nsince I believe that it is critical for this Nation to balance the \nfederal budget to give our children a future. But, I will still do all \nI can to change the cuts that were made in health care, the NIH, \nnutrition, and in education, in particular. I join speakers today--\nSenators Cohen, Kassebaum and Snowe--and will join them in their \nefforts to accomplish that same purpose.\n  Notwithstanding the huge votes that the NIH and the education \namendments had--85-14 for NIH, 67-32 for education--they came back with \nadditional cuts. I understand that during conference negotiations, \neveryone needs to take some additional cuts to create a compromise. But \nthese changes are counterproductive. I stand today to highlight some of \nthese concerns. When you are in a budget situation, there are programs \nyou can cut that will help reduce the budget, but there are also some \nprograms within the federal budget that by decreasing them it will \nincrease your costs in other programs. That is the potential here.\n  With respect to NIH research, we are on the verge of many \nbreakthroughs in curing illnesses and diseases, such as Alzheimer's and \nParkinsons. By cutting back their research funds by just 1 to 3 percent \nper year, we hamper that possibility in the near future for finding \nanswers. If these answers can be found in the next few years, the \nresult could be tens of billions of dollars in federal savings.\n  In addition, I point to education spending, because that is where I \nhave a role to play as chairman of the Senate Education Subcommittee. I \npoint out that, in this particular matter, what we may be cutting over \nthe next 7 years could be counterproductive to our Nation. Reduced \neducation expenditures could lead to reduced incomes, reduced revenues \nand increased social costs.\n  As for the $10 billion in mandatory cuts that the Labor Committee is \ninstructed to find, let me quickly talk about some of my concerns.\n  Mr. President, let us look at education generally. Education is the \nkey to the success of this Nation. It is the key to our growth. It has \nbeen the key to our growth over the past 60 years. From 1929 to 1990, \n45 percent of the growth was due to improved education--45 percent. The \namount of economic income that resulted from this growth is surely in \nthe trillions of dollars. But what are we going to do about it? We must \nbe careful in how we reduce federal education spending over the next 7 \nyears to ensure that we will not make these problems worse. Mr. \nPresident, that is my goal as chairman of the Education Subcommittee.\n  Let me highlight what this chart shows; this indicates what the \nannual taxes by family were in 1991. As you can see, those who do well \nin this Nation, who pay our taxes, are those who made it not only \nthrough college but through graduate school. High school graduates and \nthose that do not make it through high school do very poorly. If we can \nincrease those educational levels--and we are not doing well with \neducation right now on all these levels, we can increase federal \nrevenues and decrease federal costs on social programs. But let us talk \nabout higher education because that is where my concerns are greatest.\n  Let us look at the next chart we have. This shows the average annual \nearnings by profession and educational level, again, indicating the \nrevenues we lose by not allowing our kids to be sufficiently educated. \nRight now, if you do not finish high school, the yearly earnings are \n$12,000, and for graduate school graduates, it is up to $74,000.\n  The key to us continuing increasing our revenue is our education, as \nwell as increasing our national productivity.\n  This next chart shows the difference between high school dropouts and \ncollege graduates. This is what has happened over the last 20 years. \nThe high school dropout has seen a decrease in his or her income of 35 \npercent--family income. The only ones that have shown a real increase \nare those that are postgraduates, the ones we are picking on first. \nCollege graduates stayed about even. Some others have gone down.\n  If we do not improve the educational levels of this Nation, we are \ngoing to continue to see a drop in our revenues. The next chart is \nhelpful in letting us understand what is happening. This indicates \nwhere my state of Vermont is on education. This shows what has happened \nin our State over the last 8 years, as to what debt a college student \nhas to hold through the 4 years. It has gone from $8,000 in 1990 to \n$21,000, and it is going up off the chart in the future.\n  Mr. President, we need to work hard at improving educational costs \nfor students. The other charts that I have here will indicate how \nserious it is. I will highlight these charts at a later time.\n  Now let us take a look at this. Now, on top of these figures, \nconsider the proposal to eliminate the in-school interest subsidy for \ngraduate and professional students. I will work my colleagues over the \nsummer to find the best ways to maintain educational spending. We need \nto work on ways to keep the cost to students that borrow to a minimum. \nFor instance, if a student is using a subsidized Stafford loan, as an \nundergraduate that student may borrow up to $23,000. Upon graduation, \nthis student decides to earn an advanced degree in math or science and \nbegins to think about the cost. With the interest subsidy in place, he \ncould borrow an additional $8,500 per year through the subsidized \nStafford Loan Program. Assuming a 4-year graduate program, now that \nstudent would owe $57,000 upon graduation. My job over the next few \nmonths is to find appropriate cuts within the Labor Committee's \ninstructions to protect the interest subsidy and keep that same student \nfrom owing almost $65,000. Mr. President, as chairman of the Education \nSubcommittee that is my job. It is not one that I relish, but one that \nneeds to be done.\n  Mr. President, since I am committed to balancing the Federal budget \nto ensure the future of our children, I will vote most reluctantly for \nthis budget resolution, but I am committed to working with my \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee to improving on these \ncounterproductive cuts in education, health, and nutrition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Might I say to the distinguished Senator, Senator Jeffords, how much \nI personally appreciate--and I am sure the people of this country will \nappreciate--your vote today. Although the Senator has some questions \nabout how it will be implemented, I think when the Senator votes \n``aye'' today, the Senator is voting for a very important thing for \nAmerica's future--as important overall as anything we will do.\n  And the things the Senator holds dearly, that are part of the plan of \nour Government to help our people, the Senator holds dearly to, and are \nimportant to many.\n  I am very grateful that the Senator will seek to follow this course \nin changing things, without making it more difficult for, to get a \nbalanced budget before this Congress, and let them proceed to try to \nget there.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman for his comments.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President,\n   I rise to explain why I strongly believe the Senate should reject \nthe budget plan before us.\n\n  The hard-working families and senior citizens of America had better \nhold onto their wallets. The budget before us is the equivalent of a \nstick-up. It may as well carry a script that says ``put your hands up, \nand hand it over.'' This is a budget that robs you of your tax credit \nif you are a family working, not on welfare, and struggling to make \nends meet and raise your children. It will steal your plans to get a \nstudent loan if you are a middle-class family or high school student \ncounting on college to get ahead. It raids $270 billion \n\n[[Page S 9394]]\nfrom the Medicare trust fund and beats up Medicaid. It will slash \nspending for veterans programs and lead to closings of VA hospitals and \nclinics.\n  If you are already having problems paying your Medicare premiums, \nbuying prescription drugs, or getting decent health care, more trouble \nlies ahead with this budget. If the only way you can get health care \nfor your children or long-term care for your older parents is through \nMedicaid, sorry, this budget has to take that away from you. If you \nrely on VA for your health care, watch out, that will soon begin to \ndisappear.\n  This budget is packaged as the bold, courageous plan to balance the \nbudget. It is bold, alright. It has the audacity to cut education, \neliminate student loans, kill off part of the earned income tax credit, \nand raid the Medicare trust fund--but it bags $245 billion for more tax \nbreaks for Americans who are already well-off.\n  Mr. President, this is a budget that should be sent to the \npenitentiary. It is a felony against the people I represent, West \nVirginia families, senior citizens, students, veterans, and everyone \nelse. It is a direct assault on the basic promise made for years and \neven decades when it comes to education, student loans, Medicare, \nveterans benefits, and the tools that create jobs and growth in this \ncountry. It is a crime against the basic principles of fairness and \nshared responsibility that any budget--a family budget or the Federal \nGovernment's budget--should be based on.\n  It is not as though this is the only way to balance the budget. In \nfact, I voted for a very different way to get to the same bottomline. \nTo eliminate the Federal deficit and the red ink. To crack down on \nexcessive spending, including the\n tax breaks that are growing faster than inflation. Just about every \nSenator on this side of the aisle voted for the Conrad or the Bradley \nalternatives, because they spread the burden of balancing the budget so \nit does not crush something as basic as student loans or school lunches \nor a tax credit for the families with the most to lose.\n\n  After what we saw happen to this country and my State of West \nVirginia back in the 1980's, I never thought I would see the day again \nwhen the Senate agrees to a budget that steals from the middle-class to \ngive tax breaks to Wall Street and wealthy citizens. Once again, we're \ntold that trickle-down economics will do its magic, and to wait for the \njobs to grow and the prosperity to spring up. As Governor of West \nVirginia, I did that already. I watched the country sit on its hands as \nour foreign competitors took over industries and took our jobs. I \nwatched the tax breaks feed a mania for mergers and junk bonds, leaving \nour people high and dry.\n  My State has been climbing out of that rut of the 1980's when voodoo \neconomics did its terrible damage. West Virginians want to work, no \nmatter how little they have. Our workers and our industries want to be \nthe best, and we are moving into the markets of competitors like Asian \ncountries as this country gets tougher in demanding open markets and \nfair trade. Our families want good schools and a chance for West \nVirginia's high school graduates to go to college.\n  As I have traveled around my State in recent weeks, it is not just \nsenior citizens who have shared their worries about the plan to cut \nMedicare by $270 billion or Medicaid by $180 billion. The \nadministrators of some of our hospitals talk about being forced to \nclose their doors. Families wonder how a grandparent can stay in the \nnursing home. Physicians worry about children not coming in for \ncheckups. Veterans worry about the country's willingness to continue to \nhonor its commitments to those who served in time of peril.\n  This budget is out to disarm us economically. Maybe some of my \ncolleagues have a hard time figuring out what the Departments of \nEducation or Commerce do. For families who think education is what \ncounts, it is not so difficult. For the businesses in West Virginia \nthat count on the Government to enforce our trade laws, help them \nexport, and stay on top of technologies that turn into products, it is \nnot so difficult.\n  Take a company called Touchstone Research Laboratory, a two-person \noperation 15 years ago that now hires 40 people with $3 million annual \nsales. The two-person team, who worked themselves to the bone in the \n1980's to get the company going, say that it was when the Federal \nGovernment--through the Economic Development Administration--helped our \nState build a research park near Wheeling, that things finally picked \nup.\n With that footing, they could turn to something called the United \nStates and Foreign Commercial Service office in West Virginia, run by \nthe Department of Commerce, for advice on how to do business abroad and \nsell their terrific, high-tech products. That led to contracts, jobs, \nand profits that this small business believes never would have happened \nwithout a Department of Commerce whose mission is creating jobs and \nopportunity.\n\n  The steel plants in West Virginia, and their workers, might not exist \ntoday if there had not been a cop on the trade beat when foreign \ncountries were dumping their steel inside our borders. Again, trade \nenforcement done out of a Department of Commerce with a very real \nmission.\n  Mr. President, I know the proponents of this budget plan before us \nare very proud of their work and their dedication to balancing the \nbudget. But this is the wrong way to achieve the right goal. And it is \nnot the only way. If West Virginians and our fellow Americans succeed \nin rebelling against this highway robbery--against hard-working \nfamilies and seniors, young people with dreams, and even our \nbusinesses--we can get to work to balance the budget in the way that it \nshould be done. I fear for my State and for the country if this budget \never becomes reality. At this point, I will vote against it, and do \neverything I can to replace it with a course that stands up for the \nvalues of work, of education, of opportunity, and of fairness.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non House Concurrent Resolution 67, the fiscal year 1996 budget \nresolution.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, as well as the other members of his committee who have worked \nlong and hard to produce this conference agreement. I also commend the \nother Senators who have contributed to this historic, balanced budget, \nby pushing for a balanced budget, a responsible downsizing of \nGovernment, and pro-family and pro-growth tax relief.\n  Winston Churchill once said that democracy was the worst possible \nform of government except for the alternatives.\n  This budget is like that. You can nit-pick it, but you can't produce \na better one that does what what needs to be done and passes.\n  There are 100 perfect budgets in this body. But holding out for the \nperfect budget means condemning the American people to the economic \ntyranny of the status quo and an extra trillion dollars of debt over \nthe next 7 or 8 years.\n  There is honest disagreement over the priorities in this budget. But \nthe important thing is, for the first time in more than a generation, \nwe are passing a budget that sets priorities.\n  For 34 out of the last 35 years, the Federal Government has had only \none priority: Spend more. Tax more. Borrow more.\n  At long last, this budget adopts the priority of the American people: \nBalance the budget--let the Government spend no more on programs than \nthe people are willing to pay in taxes.\n  Under this budget, no one program, State, or segment of the \npopulation will pay a disproportionate share in fiscal discipline.\n  When I visit with Idahoans, they think this is fair. They are \npatriotic--they are ready to share in the discipline of balancing the \nbudget, as long as everyone does so.\n  I wish we could have had more defense spending. I wish we could have \nhad more in tax relief. I am concerned about the future of agriculture. \nIn fact, some of the details in the assumptions in this budget \nresolution will be changed in the appropriations and authorizing \ncommittees. As Senator Snowe said, this is the end of the beginning of \nthe budget process, and it is a good beginning.\n  The status quo is the least tolerable alternative.\n  The General Accounting Office's 1992 report said, ``(I)naction is not \na sustainable policy. * * * (T)he nation cannot continue on the current \npath.''\n\n[[Page S 9395]]\n\n  The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission's final report, issued in \nJanuary of this year, said, ``The present trend is not sustainable.''\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee in \nJanuary, said, ``(T)he current economic strength is not sustainable. * \n* * A balanced budget would be a major boost to the long-term growth of \nthe U.S. economy.''\n  This budget gives us a chance to vote for the future, instead of the \nfailed past.\n  This is the vote that counts. This is our chance to vote for a true \nbalanced budget. The only effective plan to balance the budget is the \none that passes.\n  This compromise budget does the most important thing possible: It \nprovides for a balanced budget by 2002, on a reasonable, gradual glide \npath.\n  We've heard a lot about winners and losers in this debate.\n  Who really wins under this budget?\n  Our children and grandchildren, because balancing the budget hands \nthem a healthier economy and real opportunity for the future;\n  Senior citizens, because a Medicare system now on the verge of \nbankruptcy is going to be reformed and rescued; Medicare is going to be \nthere for those who need it because of this budget;\n  People who want to work, because balancing the budget means economic \ngrowth and more jobs;\n  People in the greatest need who rely on essential Government \nprograms, because ever-bigger interest payments on an ever-growing debt \nincreasingly crowd out all other spending.\n  The deficit hurts all Americans. The debt is the threat. With this \nbalanced budget, all American are winners.\n  This budget does not represent a draconian cut in spending. It simply \ncalls for reducing the rate of growth in Federal spending.\n  Spending still grows an average of 3 percent a year, down from the \ncurrent 5.4 percent a year.\n  Only special interest groups and liberals inside the capital beltway \ncan say a 3 percent raise is really a ``draconian cut''.\n  Total Federal spending in fiscal year 2002 will be $346 billion more \nthan this year--fiscal 1995.\n  Only in Washington, DC, does anyone claim that a $346 billion \nincrease is really a $236 billion cut.\n  What does balancing the budget mean in people terms?\n  It means restoring the American Dream of economic opportunity, \nstarting now and extending to the next generation.\n  The cruelest budget cut of all is the cut in every American's living \nstandard that has occurred because of Government's failure or refusal \nto balance the budget.\n  The damage done by the borrow-and-spend status quo must be undone.\n  Living standards are lower today, Social Security checks buy less \ntoday, our children face a depressed future, because of a spiraling, \ncrushing debt burden.\n  According to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, for every year \nin which the Federal Government runs a $200 billion deficit, the \naverage child of today will pay $5,000 in additional taxes over his or \nher lifetime.\n  President Clinton's fiscal year 1995 budget projected that current \ntrends will force future generations to face a lifetime net tax rate of \n82 percent to pay off the current generation's bills, counting taxes at \nall levels of government.\n  In contrast, balancing the budget by fiscal year 2002 means a better \nfuture.\n  The econometrics firm DRI/McGraw-Hill said it means: 4 to 5 percent \nmore nonresidential investment, 2.5 million new jobs, a GDP that is 2.5 \npercent higher, and another $1,000 in the pocket of the average \nhousehold.\n  Balancing the budget means a better standard of living for our \nchildren.\n  GAO's 1992 report estimated that balancing the budget would raise our \nchildren's standard of living between 7 and 36 percent by the year \n2020.\n  Balancing the budget means more jobs.\n  The last Federal balanced budget was in 1969. Unemployment from 1970 \nto 1990 averaged 6.7 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for the entire \npost-war period. In the first three decades of this century, when \nbalanced budgets were the norm, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent.\n  This budget reforms and rescues Medicare. Under this budget, Medicare \nincreases an average of 6.4 percent a year, which is more than twice \nthe rate of inflation.\n  Under this budget, Medicare spending will be $86 billion more--53 \npercent more--in fiscal year 2002 than in 1995.\n  Nothing here cuts services or drives up needy patients' costs.\n  This budget calls for Medicare reform--that more choice and market \ncompetition and consumer information will slow down the runaway costs \nwe see now. It says reforms should give priority to identify and \neliminate fraud and abuse. It calls for a bipartisan commission that \nwould make recommendations for the solvency of the system.\n  A vote for this budget is a vote to rescue Medicare. Under the status \nguo, that system goes broke in fiscal year 2002.\n  Who says so? The Medicare board of trustees that includes three of \nPresident Clinton's Cabinet Secretaries, the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity, and two public trustees.\n  The trustees also said, in their April 3, 1995, report:\n\n       (T)he trust fund does not meet the Trustees' short-range \n     test of financial adequacy. . . . (It) fails to meet the \n     Trustees' test of long-range close actuarial balance . . . by \n     an extremely wide margin. . . . Congress must take timely \n     action to establish long-term financial stability for the \n     program.\n\n  The tax relief in this budget is reasonable, modest, and fair.\n  It is also contingent on reaching a balanced budget by 2002. It is \nperfectly reasonable to say to America's families, If you help with \nbalancing the budget, you get a small dividend--you get to keep just a \nlittle more of what you have earned.\n  This conference report does not say what kind of tax relief will be \nprovided.\n  I plan to support, a pro-family proposal like the $500-per-child tax \ncredit in the House-passed Contract With America tax bill and the \nCoats-Grams-Craig bill in the Senate. This would mark one tiny step in \nrecognizing the way the dependent exemption has been eroded by \ninflation and tax hikes over the years. That part of a family's income \nnecessary to cover the\n basic costs of living just should not be taxed.\n\n  I also will support pro-growth, pro-jobs tax relief for capital \ngains, small business, and family-owned farms and businesses passed on \nthrough an estate.\n  These proposals would benefit all Americans, across the income \nspectrum.\n  And they are modest. Even when fully phased in by fiscal year 2002, \nat a level of $50 billion, that tax relief would amount to well under 3 \npercent of the total revenues collected that year.\n  Back in January and February, some opponents--and a few supporters--\nof the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution said they wanted \nto see a plan for exactly how to balance the budget. Well, here's our \nplan, and it gets the job done in a fair, equitable way.\n  Now that those who demanded, ``Where's your plan?'' have been given a \nplan, I expect that 67th Senator should come forward and finally help \nus pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  We still need the balanced budget amendment.\n  The budget resolution before us today is a 7-year plan. That gives \nsome Members of Congress and the special interest groups 6 years and \nthree elections to try and knock us off track.\n  Can we balance the budget without the balanced budget amendment? The \nfirst Republican Congress in 40 years is proving we can, but can is no \nguarantee.\n  We have heard Senator after Senator say, ``This debate isn't about \nwhether to balance the budget.'' Well, let's turn this Congress's \npromise to balance the budget into an ironclad, constitutional promise \nthat the budget will stay balanced.\n  Let us now go back and pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I voted for the balanced budget amendment \nearlier this year, and more recently I cosponsored with Senator Bradley \na budget resolution that achieved balance by the year 2002.\n  I want to restore balance to the Federal budget, Mr. President, but \nnot for its own sake. The balance I seek is a means to achieve more \nconcrete, more \n\n[[Page S 9396]]\nhuman, more important goals than the abstract satisfaction of a tidy \nbalance sheet.\n  Our country is blessed, Mr. President, in many ways. By many measures \nour economy is strong.\n  In the past couple of years we have enjoyed healthy growth in the \nproductivity and output of our economy, by many measures the strongest \non the planet.\n  More Americans have found jobs, and, while you couldn't tell it from \nthe comments of some of my colleagues, Mr. President, the first 3 years \nof the Clinton administration have seen the first three consecutive \nreductions in the deficit since the Truman administration.\n  But there remain fundamental problems, Mr. President, problems that \nwe must not lose sight of as we set our Nation's priorities with the \nbudget resolution vote before us today.\n  Two fundamental trends have kept the real achievements of our economy \nfrom benefiting the majority of Americans.\n  Those trends are the stagnation, even decline, in the wages and \nsalaries of working Americans, and the increasing inequality in wealth \nand income that threatens the middle-class stability that has been the \nballast of our Nation since its founding.\n  In many ways, Mr. President, the issues that concern me today are the \nissues that brought me into public life: How to meet our shared \nresponsibility as public officials.\n  Our responsibility is to provide for our Nation's future, by \nnurturing and educating our youth, and by investing in the knowledge \nand technology on which the economy of the future will be built.\n  And we must also, Mr. President, honor our commitments to the \ngenerations whose achievements in war and peace secured for us our rich \ninheritance.\n  The budget resolution before us today sets our Nation's priorities \nfor the next 7 years. How does it measure up to our responsibilities?\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, that this budget resolution before us \ntoday, the compromise struck by Senate Republicans with the House \nRepublicans fails to meet the challenges before us.\n  I voted against the earlier budget resolution, Mr. President, because \nit cut too deeply into education and nutrition programs, because it \nneglected our responsibility to lay the foundations in research and \ntechnology on which our future must be built, and because it took too \nmuch from our senior citizens and from struggling workers.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution is worse than the earlier one.\n  It cuts $10 billion from student loans. It cuts $270 billion from \nMedicare, $182 billion from Medicaid. By cutting the earned income tax \ncredit, it raises taxes on working families who are giving their all to \nstay afloat.\n  It does all this, Mr. President, at the same time that it envisions \ntax breaks that would, if they follow the so-called Contract with \nAmerica, give those among us who are already the most comfortable an \neven greater share of our national wealth, including the very \nwealthiest among us.\n  By slighting investments in our children, by cutting resources for \neducation and research, by increasing the price of college loans, this \nbudget fails to meet our obligation to provide for our Nation's future.\n  By cutting Medicare and Medicaid, it fails to honor our contract with \nthe generations that went before us.\n  By increasing taxes on the poorest working families, it reduces the \ntake-home pay of those Americans already struggling to keep body and \nsoul together.\n  And by saving its generosity for those among us who--deserving as \nthey might be--need it least, this budget drives a wedge of resentment \ndeeper into the cracks already forming in our society.\n  I will continue to seek ways to restore balance to our Nation's \nfinances, Mr. President. And I will continue to seek ways to restore \nbalance to our Nation's priorities. But I will vote against the budget \nresolution before us today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we all know the budget cannot be \nbalanced by waiving a magic wand. Reducing a $200 billion budget \ndeficit will impose real pain on American families. The painful cuts \nwould be worth it, however, if through shared sacrifice, we brought our \nfiscal house in order.\n  I am disappointed I cannot endorse the budget resolution. While I \nsupport balancing the budget, I cannot support the priorities the \nmajority imposes to try to get us there in 7 years. The Republican plan \nwill impose too much pain on too many families. Those who will suffer \nthe most under this Republican budget resolution will be middle class \nfamilies across America. From preschool education to nursing home care \nfor the elderly, middle-class families will bear the biggest burden in \novercoming our Nation's budget deficit.\n  This budget, though not signed into law, will set the stage for the \nappropriations and budget reconciliation battles later this year. This \nresolution sets the Federal Government on course to cut vital services \nfor American families across the country. This is a course I cannot \naccept. This is how families will be hurt:\n  Medicare: The $270 billion cut over the next 7 years is the largest \nMedicare cut in history. Yet middle-income families will carry the \nburden--97 percent of all Medicare spending go to families with annual \nincomes of $50,000 or less.\n  Education: The resolution will cut $40 billion over the next 7 years, \ncutting back on Pell grants, student loans, and Head Start. Nearly one \nhalf of all Pell grant recipients have annual incomes of less than \n$10,000. The elimination of the forbearance of in-school interest will \nforce students to carry higher debt just as they enter the work force. \nThis will hurt the young as they struggle to get on their feet.\n  Medicaid: The resolution's $182 billion cut could force 8 million to \nlose Medicaid coverage by 2002, more than an 18-percent reduction over \nthe next 7 years.\n  Earned Income Tax Credit: The resolution reverses the EITC coverage \nfor childless workers adopted in 1993. This provision only partially \ncompensates these workers for the five payroll tax increases they have \nbeen forced to accept during the 1980's. The cut will force low-income \nworkers with incomes below the poverty level to pay a higher tax burden \nnext April.\n  We have heard a great deal that the budget resolution represents a \nglide path toward a balanced budget. However, I am afraid this budget \nresolution is more of a crash landing than a glide path.\n  By contrast, the administration has challenged the path of the \nmajority in Congress, offering a slower path to balance in exchange for \na reduction in the cuts for important Federal programs. When the \nPresident announced his proposal, he was criticized by Republicans for \nits economic assumptions. However, the Republican plan assumes an \nunprecedented 11 consecutive years of economic growth to justify its \nharsh cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.\n  As we start down the path the majority lays out today, we will need \nto continue to review both the plan and the timeline the resolution \nadopts to balance the budget. The value of balancing the budget in 7 \nyears will be measured by the economy the cuts will help to create in \neach of those 7 years and every year afterward. The Federal budget must \naddress our national economic needs and not weaken an already fragile \neconomy.\n\n\n                   State Economy Cannot Take the Cuts\n\n  Mr. President, the California economy is beginning the painful \nprocess of emerging from its longest recession since the Great \nDepression. While the rest of the country suffered as well, \nCalifornia's recession was both longer and more severe than the rest of \nthe Nation.\n  California's unemployment rate is nearly 3 percent higher than the \nnational average.\n  More than 1.28 million Californians are out of work. In fact, \nCalifornia has 17 percent of all the unemployed workers in America.\n  To these burdens, the Republican budget resolution will impose more \nthan $50 billion in additional budget cuts for California for Medicare, \nMedicaid, and the earned income tax credit alone, during the next 7 \nyears. I cannot support these additional burdens for California \nfamilies on our already strained economy.\n\n\n                       Medicare and Medicaid Cuts\n\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution imposes its biggest cuts on \nhealth care programs for the elderly and those \n\n[[Page S 9397]]\nmost in need of Federal assistance. The $450 billion in cuts from \nMedicare and Medicaid go too far, too fast, without any assurances that \nour health care system and the economy will not be significantly \nundercut. Health care spending represents more than one-seventh of the \nNation's total economy. We cannot make the sweeping changes proposed \nwithout imposing significant burdens on families, medical providers, \nhospitals, and State and local governments.\n  We all know that Medicare and Medicaid spending cuts are necessary. \nThe real questions are how much to cut, how to make sure the cuts are \ndistributed fairly, and how to make sure the cuts can work?\n  The proposed resolution cuts over $450 billion out of Medicare and \nMedicaid over the next 7 years--more than 60 percent of the $1.3 \ntrillion in cuts represent Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, or other \nentitlements. The impact of these cuts would affect California \nenormously--more than almost every other State.\n  The Health Care Finance Administration suggests the $270 billion in \nMedicare cuts may cause over $35 billion in total cuts to California \nhospitals and patients over the next 7 years.\n  Despite having only 9.5 percent of the Nation's Medicare population, \nCalifornia would pay for over 13 percent of the Medicare cuts.\n  The alarming trend is repeated when we turn to Medicaid. The Kaiser \nCommission on the Future of Medicaid issued a new Urban Institute \nreport that projects that California and just five other States would \nbear over 40 percent of the total Medicaid budget cuts, and cost-saving \nmeasures would cut at least 5 million additional people off of Medicaid \nnationwide.\n  Total California Medicaid funding are expected to be reduced by \nnearly $20 billion over 7 years.\n  The Medicaid cuts will force States to spend more, undercut the \nefforts of our safety net hospitals, increase the numbers of uninsured \npersons, and shift even more costs to the private employer-based health \ncare system.\n\n\n                        Education and Investment\n\n  Mr. President, U.C.L.A.'s Center for the Continuing Study of the \nCalifornia Economy reports the principal threat to job and income \ngrowth in California is the lack of a strategy to establish priorities \nand fund critical public investments. The center reconfirmed previous \nstudies, calling for investment in education and infrastructure to \nstrengthen the economy. I agree--only by investing in the next \ngeneration through education, we can provide for a stronger future.\n  Yet the Republican budget resolution cuts discretionary and mandatory \nprograms for education by $40 billion, the largest education cut in \nU.S. history. The resolution will cut support for education at all \nlevels, including elementary, secondary, and higher education. This \nbudget resolution will lead to cuts in student loans for 4 million \nstudents, making it more difficult for families to send children to \nschool and adding to the debt students will carry for years.\n  We cannot move forward unless we invest in our most important \nresource--our children. Only by carefully investing, can we build a \nstronger, more capable and competitive nation. These cuts will leave us \nless able to prepare for the future.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the priorities we spend our scarce dollars on are just \nas critical as how much we spend. I am very concerned these budget cuts \ncould damage an already strained economy and fail to prepare our next \ngeneration for the competitive world of the future, weakening our long-\nterm economic goals.\n  Congress needs to carefully consider cuts in spending because the \nvalue of balancing the budget in 7 years will be measured by the \neconomy the cuts will help to create. Regaining our full economic \nstrength in California will take years. We cannot take economic \nrecovery for granted and we must work to maintain economic vitality in \nan increasingly competitive global economy. I will work to ensure \nCongress takes the right action to strengthen the economy and create \njobs, without igniting another round of economic strains for California \nbusinesses and families.\n  I am concerned this budget resolution will not protect families or \nprovide opportunity and could worsen our current fragile economic \nstate. I cannot support deficit reduction which imposes such a heavy \ncost on those least able afford it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the impacts \nof this budget resolution on the appropriations process for the fiscal \nyear 1996.\n\n\n                         transportation funding\n\n  Mr. President, I would first like to address the impacts of this \nbudget resolution on our Nation's transportation systems. I have the \nprivilege of chairing not just the full Appropriations Committee, but \nalso the Transportation Subcommittee. I took that post because I \nunderstand the critical role that transportation plays in our economy \nand our way of life. In Oregon, we take great pride in our balanced \ntransportation system, and in the planning process that we use to make \ninvestments in the most effective, efficient, and environmentally \nsensitive manner. The State of Oregon is, I believe, a model for the \ncountry to follow. The concerns that I want to raise today are not just \nfor the future of Federal involvement in Oregon's transportation \nnetwork, but for the role that the Federal Government will play in \nmeeting the entire Nation's transportation needs.\n  Whether we are talking about investment in our Nation's highways and \ntransit systems, the critical operations of the Coast Guard, or the \ndirection of air travel through the FAA's air traffic control system, \nadequate funding for transportation is vital for this country to \nmaintain and enhance its economic position.\n  In setting our economic agenda, deficit reduction clearly is our top \npriority. And, transportation must play a role in achieving savings. \nBut, my concern is that this not just become a budget-cutting exercise. \nSimply lowering the Federal contribution to transportation without \nrethinking and adjusting the Federal role is a big step in the wrong \ndirection, and could have disastrous impacts.\n  While the conferees agreed on transportation cuts less severe than \nthose that passed the Senate, I continue to have serious concerns about \nhow we achieve those cuts. I was pleased to note that Chairman Domenici \nraised many of these issues in the Senate Budget Committee's report, \nwhich discussed the need to restructure transportation programs and \nreconsider what role the Federal Government plays versus State and \nlocal governments and the private sector. The committee report assumed \nthat savings in transportation would be achieved not just through \nreducing spending, but through steps such as consolidation of the \nDepartment of Transportation's agencies and programs, and by \nprivatizing the air traffic control system. The conference report \nrepeats those assumptions, calling for program downsizing, \nstreamlining, and consolidation of DOT, and for ATC privatization. \nWhile these changes may be controversial, the consequences of moving \nforward with business as usual and just cutting funding would be \ndestructive. It is critical that we now look at how we maintain our \ncommitment to sound transportation at the same time that we carry \nthrough with our commitment to deficit reduction. That is going to mean \ndoing things differently.\n  My concern is that the changes assumed in the budget resolution are \njust that--assumptions. What are real are the spending cuts. I tell my \ncolleagues that the Appropriations Committee will comply with the \ntargets laid out by the resolution. But to do so without having the \nbenefit of the authorizing changes assumed in the resolution will be \ndevastating because, in the end, we will still be bound by the outlay \nreductions. In order to achieve those reductions, we will be forced to \nmake severe and devastating cuts in fast-spending programs, such as: \nCoast Guard operations, which includes search and rescue and drug \ninterdiction activities; FAA operations, which will have direct impacts \non the viability of the air traffic control system; transit operating \nassistance, which will harm many of our cities; and Amtrak. Or, we will \nbe forced to impose even more drastic cuts in capital programs, such as \nthe highway program, transit new starts and modernization, badly needed \nnew equipment for Amtrak, and the FAA's modernization program, which is \nalready behind schedule and over budget.\n\n[[Page S 9398]]\n\n  It is in this respect that I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenic, in a discussion. Let \nme first ask my colleague, who is also a valued member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, if it is correct that the \nassumptions in the resolution are not binding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee is correct. For transportation, the conferees set outlays at \n$244.8 billion over 7 years, as compared to $227.5 billion in the \nSenate resolution, and $252.3 billion in the House. As the Senator \nnoted, with our committee reductions, we also assumed that much of it \nwould be achieved through fundamental restructuring of the Department \nof Transportation and through privatization of the air traffic control \nsystem. The conferees retained those assumptions. We want savings to \ncome out of administrative and bureaucratic costs before programs are \nhit. The conferees included the assumption of ATC privatization. I \nbelieve this can and should be done. Frankly, I believe that the \nprivate sector can better provide these services, that safety and \nefficiency will be enhanced, and that the American taxpayer and \ntraveler will be better off.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Let me then ask my distinguished colleague how he \nenvisions us moving from the budget resolution to the appropriations \nprocess. My intention is to work with the\n authorizing committees toward enactment of the changes that the \nresolution assumes?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is clearly a need to move forward \nwith changes. As noted in our assumptions, the funding levels provided \nunder the resolution do not support the transportation programs as they \ncurrently exist. There were no reconciliation instructions because the \nresolution assumes discretionary, not mandatory, savings. However, \nthere is no reason why legislation to restructure the DOT and its \nprograms and to privatize the ATC system should not be moved \nseparately. It is my intention to work with the authorizing committees \nto see such change enacted.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I welcome the Senator's involvement, and suggest his \ncontinued engagement in this process will be critical to achieving the \ndual goals of deficit reduction and sound transportation. I appreciate \nthe time and efforts of the chairman of the Budget Committee, and look \nforward to working with him. Mr. President, I would next like to \ncomment on the impacts of the budget resolution on programs falling \nunder the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton and Members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle support funding increases for law enforcement. The \nPresident's budget requests a 21-percent funding increase for justice \nand a 15-percent increase in funding for the judiciary. That translates \ninto a 20-percent increase in funding for the Federal criminal justice \nsystem--and grants to States--for almost 60 percent of the fiscal year \n1995 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. Even though the \nbudget resolution conference report assumes drastic changes across the \nGovernment in order to balance the budget, the conferees agreed to make \nfunding for law enforcement a top priority. The conferees' actions are \nconsistent with the Republican crime bills in both Houses of Congress \nwhich would change priorities among violent crime reduction trust fund \naccounts, providing a net increase in authorized trust fund spending \nfor law enforcement and prison construction.\n  The budget resolution conference agreement assumes a major \nreorganization in the executive branch--including an overhaul of State \nDepartment elimination of the Commerce Department. It is my hope that \nthe various authorizing committees with jurisdiction over portions of \nthese proposals will make quick action on these reorganization \nproposals a top priority.\n  A full debate on these issues would be extremely helpful to the \nAppropriations Committee as we attempt to find the savings assumed in \nthe budget conference report. As chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I hope to avoid situations where major legislative changes \nare attached to appropriations bills that must be enacted before the \nend of the fiscal year.\n  Last, Mr. President, I would like to speak to the budget resolution's \nimpacts on the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The conference agreement reduces funding for discretionary health \nprograms in fiscal year 1996 by approximately 8 percent. For Public \nHealth Service Act programs under the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS \nand Education Subcommittee this would mean an aggregate cut of $1.5 \nbillion. Purportedly, these reductions are to be achieved through a 1-\npercent cut in funding for medical research supported by the National \nInstitutes of Health, the consolidation of numerous categorical \nprograms into State administered block grants, a 50-percent cut in \nfunding for the National Health Service Corps, the Maternal and Child \nHealth Block Grant and the Preventive Health Services Block Grant, and \nthe elimination of a number of agencies and sub-agencies of the Public \nHealth Service, such as the Agency for Health Care and Policy and \nResearch. To date, however, no legislation to streamline Public Health \nService agencies or consolidate its programs has been considered in the \nSenate. The end result for fiscal year 1996 is that the savings will be \nachieved by cuts in research, services and training, and not achieved \nthrough greater administrative efficiencies.\n  Some of the steepest reductions in funding are reserved for \neducation, training, employment, and social services programs. Hardest \nhit are the job training programs of the Department of Labor. The \nbudget resolution conference agreement assumes a 20-percent cut in \nfunding for job training programs as a result of consolidating over 100 \nFederal job training programs into block grants. Legislation reported \nby the Labor and Human Resources Committee, however, would not \nimplement these changes until July 1, 1998. Thus, for fiscal year 1996, \nthe Appropriations Committee will be confronted with substantial cuts \nwithout the benefit of a reformed job training system. Particularly \nvulnerable will be funding for the 1996 Summer Youth Jobs Program which \nhad historically received advanced funding.\n  Funds also are jeopardized for readjustment assistance and services \nfor dislocated workers. Presently, the only funding for retraining is \nthrough Dislocated Worker Program authorized by title III of the Job \nTraining Partnership Act. In the wake of the recent recommendations of \nthe Base Realignment and Closure Commission and job layoffs in timber \ndependent communities in the Pacific Northwest, increased demand will \nbe placed upon these services. Estimates are that an additional 34,000 \nworkers on military bases and installations will be dislocated during \nthe next 2 years. Absorbing increased demand for these services likely \nwill necessitate cuts exceeding 20 percent in other training programs, \nsuch as Job Corps, School to Work, and the employment service.\n  Nearly $10 billion currently is spent to process mandatory claims for \nunemployment compensation, Social Security old age and survivors \nbenefits, disability, and Medicare claims, and yet the processing costs \nare part of the Appropriations Committee's discretionary outlays. As a \nresult of increases in workload, outlays for these activities are \nprojected to increase significantly, about $850 million in fiscal year \n1996 alone. Adding to these costs is legislation reported by the \nFinance Committee which requires the Social Security Administration to \nconduct more disability reviews. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the increased requirements will cost the committee an \nadditional $300 million in fiscal year 1996. Yet the conference report \nassumes a freeze in discretionary funds for both the Medicare and \nSocial Security Programs.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 1996. This budget achieves what the people of America and Idaho \nwant: A balanced budget.\n  The last time this Nation had a balanced budget, I was a junior in \nhigh school. My daughter will be a junior in high school next year. It \nhas been a generation since our country's books have been balanced. \nWhen I was in high school the last thing I thought about was a balanced \nbudget. But now, $5 trillion later, I wish the adults of that \n\n[[Page S 9399]]\nera had. I am the father of two great kids, Heather and Jeff, who will \nboth be in high school next year. They, like every other American \ntoday, owe $19,000 on the national debt. That is their share of the \nnational debt but did nothing to run up this bill. That is what they \nwill inherit from this generation. That is a national disgrace.\n  This budget conference report is a present to my son and daughter, to \nthe children of every American family, because in 7 years we will \nattain a goal which has not been accomplished in nearly 30 years.\n  If we do nothing, at the present rate of spending the deficit would \ngrow to almost $200 billion next year. But, under this budget the \ndeficit will be reduced to $170 billion next year, continue to decrease \neach year thereafter, and ultimately yield a budget surplus of $7 \nbillion by the year 2002. Total deficit reduction achieved by the \nRepublican budget over 7 years will be nearly $900 billion.\n  More importantly, the Republican plan will balance the budget \nentirely through spending cuts; not tax increases. In fact, after the \nCongressional Budget Office certifies that the spending cuts have \nyielded a dividend, this Republican budget will provide Americans with \nthe biggest tax cut in history; $245 billion of reductions, including a \n$500 per child tax credit, capital gains tax reduction, a new type of \nindividual retirement account--the ``American Dream Savings Account'', \nsenior citizen tax relief, and pro-growth economic tax incentives. The \nRepublican budget accomplishes this deficit reduction, budget \nbalancing, and tax relief without cutting a single dollar from Social \nSecurity.\n  Idahoans are worried about the deficit and the cost of the interest \non that debt. They are concerned about where spending cuts will be \nmade, how deep those cuts will be, and if the cuts will be fairly \ndistributed. The budget before us accomplishes a balanced budget \nthrough many significant reforms that are important to both the Nation \nand to Idaho. This budget preserves, protects, and enhances important \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid. Both of those programs need \nsubstantial reform simply to remain solvent. The impending bankruptcy \nof Medicare is a threat to every hard-working American who has \nfaithfully paid into the system. Imagine if you are 55 years old and \nhave contributed to Medicare for every year of your working adult life. \nYou expect your government will do its part and make good on its \npromise to you. You expect Medicare to be there when you need it. Yet \nthe Medicare trustees say the program will go broke in 7 years unless \nchanges are made. This budget does that. It slows the growth of \nspending on benefits to 6.4 percent annually. That will save $270 \nbillion. However, and this is important: Total Medicare spending will \nincrease from $4,350 per beneficiary in 1995 to $6,070 in 2002--an \nincrease of 40 percent.\n  Some are calling this a cut. Well that is just the way Washington \ndoes it's math. Because let me tell you that in Idaho, when you say \nsomething will increase at a slower rate, we do not call that a cut.\n  Medicaid will become a block grant program to the States and calls \nfor slowing the rate of growth from the present 10 percent to 4 percent \nover 7 years--resulting in savings of $181 billion. And it should \nimprove service. Who would an Idahoan rather call if there is a \nquestion about Medicaid--someone in Boise or someone in Washington, DC? \nI guarantee you it will be a whole lot easier to find the right person \nto talk with and solve the problem in Boise. That is improving service \nfor taxpayers.\n  The Republican budget downsizes the Federal bureaucracy by:\n  First, reducing discretionary spending by $190 billion over 7 years.\n  Second, eliminating the Commerce Department and other commissions, \nagencies, and functions that are duplicative or obsolete.\n  Third, reducing foreign aid by $23 billion over the next 7 years.\n  The budget also:\n  Fourth, makes good on the promise for welfare reform by achieving \nmandatory savings of $100 billion by combining AFDC, SSI, Food Stamps, \nchild care and child nutrition programs into a single block grant to \nthe States and by modifying the earned income tax credit by eliminating \nbenefits for undocumented workers and persons with no dependent \nchildren.\n  While certainly there are program cuts that I would prefer not be \nmade, I feel that we must apply the sacrifice evenly to all areas of \nthe budget if we are to be successful. The most troublesome reductions \nfor me are the cuts in agricultural production program outlays of $13 \nbillion, a 28 percent reduction in community development block grant \nmoneys to cities, and changes in the student loan program.\n  Idahoans tell me they are perfectly willing to do their share if they \nknow the impacts of this budget are spread evenly across the country. \nIf everyone has to bite the bullet, then it is something that must be \ndone. This country cannot afford to spend beyond it's means. Congress \nmust demonstrate the will to tear up its credit card and get the \nNation's fiscal house in order.\n  I believe that the interest we are paying on the debt is destroying \nour present well-being while it is denying future opportunities to our \nchildren and grandchildren. The opportunity to balance the budget, \nreduce the deficit, and offer tax relief to hard working families is \ntoo important to ignore.\n  After all, we are talking about the American taxpayer's money--it is \nnot the government's money--and it is time that we start leaving more \nof it in the taxpayer's pocket.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is truly a historic debate. At no \npoint in recent times have the differences between the two major \npolitical parties been more apparent. The choice is clear and defining. \nYou either: support $200 plus billion deficits through the next \ncentury, or you do not; support balancing the Federal budget by the \nyear 2002, or you do not; want to pass along a greater debt to your \nchildren and grandchildren, or you do not; want to let working \nAmericans keep more of what they earn, or you do not.\n  Mr. President, this country is $4.8 trillion in debt. There were some \ninteresting budget facts in the Wall Street Journal a few months back. \nShaquille O'Neal--the basketball star who plays for the Orlando Magic--\nearns about $30 million each year in salary and endorsements. Shaquille \nO'Neal would have to play 158,400 seasons to earn $4.8 trillion, our \ncurrent national debt.\n  The O.J. Simpson trial has captivated many in this Nation. Again, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Simpson is paying about \n$55,000 a day in legal fees. The trial would need to last 78 million \ndays before Mr. Simpson paid $4.8 trillion.\n  Mr. President, this is not a laughing matter, far from it. It is of \nthe most grave concern to all Americans. If we do not balance the \nbudget soon, we won't have a country to pass along to our children. \nThat's what this debate is all about.\n  I have three children. Like most Americans, I would like to pass \nalong to them my assets, my wealth, when I leave this world. They \nshould not inherit a mountain of debt. We must stop thinking about the \nnext election, and start thinking about the next generation.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate does not pass this balanced budget plan, \nthere is no coming back. If we do nothing: the national debt will \nexceed $6 trillion in 2002; Interest payments on that debt will be $331 \nbillion in 2002; The federal deficit will exceed $200 billion, with no \nend in sight.\n  That should be unacceptable to every American.\n  This budget conference report is bold, and it is fair. It would \nbalance the Federal budget in the year 2002. It would provide \nincentives for Americans to save and invest, and help the economy to \ngrow. It would allow for penalty free withdrawals from IRA's for first \ntime home buyers, education, and medical expenses. It would cut the \ncapital gains tax rate, and index it for inflation. It would provide \ntax relief for families in the form of a $500 tax credit per child. \nMost important, Mr. President, the tax cuts are paid for with \nadditional spending cuts.\n  Cutting taxes is not a sin. It is not wrong or irresponsible to let \nAmericans keep more of their hard-earned dollars. After all, it's not \nthe Government's money. History shows that tax cuts create jobs, a goal \nwe all share. But history also shows that unless we cut spending, no \namount of growth will \n\n[[Page S 9400]]\nbalance the budget. I believe this budget proves that we can, and \nshould, do both.\n  In 1993, every Republican Senator and House member voted against \nPresident Clinton's $250 billion tax increase. The tax cuts included in \nthis package total $245 billion. We don't even get as far cutting taxes \nas the President went in raising taxes. This is clearly an issue that \nunites Republicans.\n  I would like to praise the hard work of Senator Domenici, and others \non the budget committee, for a job well done. Many of us have waited a \nlong time for this day. I have been talking about balanced budgets for \n11 years. Now we have a rare chance to act. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President. I cannot support the conference report to \naccompany House Concurrent Resolution 67, the congressional budget \nresolution which has been presented to the Senate by the Republican \nmajority virtually without the participation of the Democratic members \nof the conference committee.\n  That budget proposal has been described by our Republican colleagues \nas achieving balance by the year 2002 although it will not. It relies \nheavily on surpluses in the Social Security trust funds to achieve \nbalance. In fact, in 2002, there will remain, under the terms of the \nbudget before, a more than $108 billion deficit, masked by the use of \nthe Social Security trust funds.\n  This is one crucial reason that I supported the Conrad substitute \nwhen the budget resolution was before the Senate last month. That \nsubstitute would have reduced the deficit even farther than the \nRepublican budget by 2002 and would have provided for a truly balanced \nbudget, without the use of Social Security funds, by the year 2004.\n  The Republican proposed budget resolution before us is unbalanced in \nanother important way. The budget blue print penalizes middle-income \nworking families, reduces our investment in education, and penalizes \nour senior citizens, in order to provide for a tax reduction which will \nbenefit mostly the wealthiest of Americans. The budget before us has \nits priorities wrong. It is simply a question of fairness.\n  The Republican budget hits our senior citizens very hard. Medicare \nwould be cut by $270 billion, $14 billion more than the Senate-passed \nresolution which already went too far. This is by far the largest \nMedicare cut in history. It is the most vulnerable who are hit hardest. \nNearly 83 percent of Medicare benefits go to beneficiaries with incomes \nless than $25,000. Two-thirds are below $15,000. Only 3 percent go to \nindividuals or couples with income in excess of $50,000. Over the 7-\nyear period, these cuts could cost the average individual beneficiary \n$3,345 more.\n  Another $182 billion, under the Republican budget, is cut from \nMedicaid. Many people don't realize that 70 percent of Medicaid costs \nare long-term care for the elderly and the disabled. Many middle-income \nelderly wind up relying upon Medicaid for nursing home and other care \nafter their resources are expended.\n  Another way in which the Republican priorities are wrong is that in \norder to pay for a tax cut for the most well-off among us, they have \ncut funding for college loans and educational improvement. This is \nperhaps the most shortsighted aspect of their budget proposal. \nInvestment in the education of our children is investment in America's \nfuture. There are few ways to better and more efficiently spend our \ndollars than educating America's future generations.\n  The budget contains a large $245 billion tax cut. While the specifics \nof the tax proposal are not apparent in the conference report before \nus, the intentions are clear. The House tax cut provides more than half \nof its benefit to the wealthiest 12 percent of Americans. And, the \nRepublicans cut the Boxer amendment from the bill. Senator Boxer's \namendment was sense-of-the-Senate language which called for 90 percent \nof the benefit from any tax cut to go working families with income less \nthan $100,000 per year--90 percent of the taxpayers. Our Republican \ncolleagues praised this language during the Senate consideration of the \nBudget Resolution, as a way of deflecting criticism of the tax cut. \nBut, the conferees dropped the language.\n  This tax cut amounts to borrowing from our children. This budget \ncreates a large tax cut long before the budget is balanced. How can we \ncontemplate spending $245 billion largely for the benefit of better-off \nAmericans, when the deficits remain, when massive cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid are being proposed, and when cut-backs in education funding \nare being put forward?\n  The minority claims that $170 billion, a so-called economic dividend \nis locked in to pay for the tax cut. Well, obviously, that $170 \nbillion, if it materializes, will not pay for a $245 billion tax cut. \nMoreover, the dividend itself is far from certain. It is based on a set \nof economic assumptions by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO, \nitself, in making the projections states:\n\n       The estimates--are subject to two kinds of uncertainty. The \n     first--is the substantial uncertainty about the effects of \n     balancing the budget, assuming that other outcomes match \n     CBO's January expectations. The second kind of uncertainty \n     arises because many things will happen--not just in the area \n     of fiscal policy but in the rest of the economy--that CBO \n     could not anticipate in its January forecast.\n       Such events beyond the domain of fiscal policy could easily \n     obscure the impacts on growth and interest rates that \n     balancing the budget would set in motion. For example, if the \n     weakness of the dollar continues, the Federal Reserve might \n     be unwilling to lower interest rates as quickly as the \n     budget-balancing scenario assumes. The estimates--should \n     therefore be viewed with appropriate caution: a few years \n     down the road, it may be impossible to disentangle the \n     effects of balancing the budget from other forces operating \n     at the same time in the U.S. economy.\n\n  Well, when we look closely at such projections, we find that, \naccording to the OMB, if the CBO has overestimated the gross domestic \nproduct by the average amount that they have overestimated that measure \nof the economy over the past 12 years, the effect would be a loss of \nmore than $166 billion in only 5 years. In other words, the economic \ndividend which is being put forward as insurance for the costs of the \ntax cut for wealthier Americans would disappear, leaving our children \nto pay the bill.\n  Mr. President, the issue before us is not whether the federal budget \nshould be balanced in the years ahead. The issue is how we do that. \nWhat are the priorities and who bears the burden. I believe that the \npriorities in the budget which our Republican colleagues have proposed \nare wrong. They place too much of the burden on the backs of the \nelderly, students in school, and working families, while cutting taxes \nfor the most well-off. That budget is simply not fair.\n  And, Mr. President, it fails to get the job done. It continues the \nuse of the Social Security trust funds to hide the real deficit.\n  I supported many amendments aimed at improving the budget resolution, \nmaking it more fair, without affecting the deficit reduction. Virtually \nall were rejected by the Republican majority along nearly straight \nparty lines. Now, it will be possible for the Republican majority to \nram through the budget resolution which it wants. However, as we go \nforward in the weeks ahead in the appropriations process and in \nreconciliation, I am hopeful that the Republican leadership will be \nmore willing to work with the President, and with the minority in the \nCongress. If we are truly to make progress in balancing the Federal \nbudget, and if we are to adopt a set of priorities which are wise and \nfair, we must do so in a bi-partisan way. Unfortunately, the set of \npriorities reflected in this Republican budget resolution, in my \njudgment, are neither wise nor fair.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last week, House and Senate Republican \nconferees reached an agreement on the fiscal year 1996 budget \nresolution, which in my mind, is more damaging then the original 7-year \nbudget resolution that the Senate adopted last month.\n  The compromise budget resolution still promises tax cuts for wealthy \nAmericans financed by a $270 billion cut in Medicare. Medicaid also \nlost out on the Republican proposal and will be cut an additional $7 \nbillion, for a new total of $182 billion. Stricken from the resolution \nis the Boxer amendment that expressed the sense of Congress that 90 \npercent of the benefits of potential tax cuts go to the middle class.\n  I also note that my Republican colleagues call the cuts to \nentitlement programs such a Medicare and Medicaid a way of restricting \ngrowth. Well, Mr. President, I don't know how my \n\n[[Page S 9401]]\ncolleagues define the word restricting, but I know a budget cut when I \nsee one.\n  The Senate Budget Committee resolution assumed a $256 billion cut in \nMedicare spending over 7 years, by far the largest Medicare cut in \nhistory. Well, Mr. President, it appears that the Republican budget \nconferees want to go even further and the adverse impact on \nbeneficiaries and providers is clear.\n  If Medicare cuts of this magnitude are approved, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services estimates that senior citizens' out-of-pocket \nmedical expenses will increase by $860 a year or a total of $3,345 over \nthe 7 years. As 83 percent of Medicare benefits go to beneficiaries \nwith incomes of $25,000 or less, it is obvious who will be hurt by \nthese cuts.\n  In addition, cuts to providers would have serious ramifications on \noverall health care costs as cuts in provider reimbursement are often \npassed on directly to other payers. Provider cuts could also have a \npotentially devastating impact on urban safety-net hospitals which \nalready bear a disproportionate share of the Nation's growing burden of \nuncompensated care.\n  Not all the pain will be felt in urban areas, however. The reductions \nin Medicare payments could also endanger access to care in rural areas. \nNearly 10 million Medicare beneficiaries--25 percent of the total--live \nin rural areas. Often there is only a single hospital in their county. \nSignificant cuts in Medicare have the potential of causing rural \nhospitals to close or increase the number of providers that refuse to \ntreat Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Under the conference agreement, Medicaid would be turned into a block \ngrant and cut by $182 billion. As I mentioned, this cut is $7 billion \nmore than the Senate-passed version and $5 billion less than the House. \nStates would likely have to reduce the number of people served by an \naverage of 7.6 percent, affecting nearly 3.5 million people.\n  While I fully recognize the critical need to ensure long-term \nstability in the Medicare Program and support efforts to balance our \nbudget, I am opposed to using arbitrary cuts in the Medicare Program to \nfinance a tax break for wealthy Americans.\n  Just as health care benefits are being cut for our senior citizens \ndependent on Medicare, the new GOP budget would also pay for tax breaks \nfor the rich by making unprecedented cuts in education. During last \nmonths's debate on the Senate budget resolution, a bipartisan amendment \npassed which reduced cuts to the student loan program by closing tax \nloopholes for the rich. The conferees chose to ignore this bipartisan \naction and cut education even more.\n  Under the new GOP resolution, millions of children and college \nstudents nationwide will be affected. Five hundred fifty thousand pre-\nschoolers could be dropped from the Head Start Program; 3,000 schools \nacross the Nation will lose funds to implement reform efforts to better \nprepare students for the challenges of the 21st century; and 4 million \ncollege students from middle-class families will have their college \ncosts increase by over $3,000 since the GOP budget eliminates the in-\nschool interest exemption on student loans.\n  Mr. President, the impact will be tremendous. The Republicans would \neliminate 33 percent of the Federal investment in education by year \n2002, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A good example of \nthe devastating impact can be seen in the $30 billion cut in Federal \naid to college students over the next 7 years. Given the fact that half \nof all college students receive Federal financial aid, and that 75 \npercent of all student aid comes from the Federal Government, it is \nobvious how this cut will affect our students' futures.\n  Mr. President, the Republican cut in Medicare, Medicaid, education, \nand other social programs are simply, in my eyes and in my heart, \nunacceptable. You cannot single out health care for one segment of the \npopulation without serious consequences. Nor should we broker the \nfuture of our country's youth in order to satisfy the Republicans' \nContract With America. The senior citizens of today and the leaders of \ntomorrow should not shoulder balancing the budget alone. I therefore \nurge my colleagues to reject the conference report on the budget \nresolution.\n                             faa/atc reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to both thank and congratulate the \nSenate and House Budget Committees for successfully completing a very \ndifficult task. For the first time in far too many years, the American \npeople can look forward to having a balanced Federal budget. Fiscal \nresponsibility has long been missing from the Federal budget process--\nuntil now. The Budget Committees deserve great credit for this \nremarkable achievement.\n  As chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I noted with particular \ninterest, the proposal in the budget regarding privatization of the \nNation's Air Traffic Control [ATC] System. The safety and efficiency of \nthe system that manages the airways is of great importance to both the \ntraveling public and the Nation's economy. Unfortunately, the FAA has \nbeen slow, inflexible, and wasteful in its effort to modernize the ATC \nSystem.\n  The motivation behind the Budget Committee proposal to change the \nsystem is quite understandable. Although our airways remain the safest \nin the world, potential problems loom on the horizon. As the National \nCommission To Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry pointed out \nin its report to the President, the airline industry is the only major \ncommercial industry the operating efficiency of which is dictated by \nthe efficiency of the Federal Government. That is certainly reason \nenough for concern. The inefficiencies and inadequacies of the current \nsystem must not be allowed to jeopardize safety or constrain the \nstruggling air carrier industry.\n  Although there is a consensus that the FAA needs significant change, \ndisagreements exist over how the agency should be reformed. The \nAviation Subcommittee will hold hearings in July to carefully look at \nthe current reform proposals, including the Budget Committee's idea of \nfull privatization. The administration has a proposal introduced in the \nHouse that would convert the ATC System into a wholly owned government \ncorporation. Under this plan, the corporation would be free from the \npersonnel, procurement, and budgetary constraints that presently burden \nit as a government bureaucracy.\n  Two other reform bills would remove the FAA from the Department of \nTransportation and make it an independent agency, freeing it from \ncertain Federal bureaucratic restraints. A final approach may simply be \nto retain the current structure but to revise the laws and regulations \nthat are said to hold back the FAA in its efforts to modernize the ATC \nSystem.\n  Although these approaches have significant differences, they all stem \nfrom a common belief that the FAA is in need of meaningful reform. The \nFAA must become more responsive and more proactive in nature. As the \nAviation Subcommittee examines all the options, we will keep this goal \nin mind. In that regard, I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee for his contribution to this important \ndebate, as well as for his outstanding work on the budget.\n  We will seek a solution that will bring greater efficiency to the FAA \nand promote its mission of safety in the conduct of air transportation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand here today to do something that I \nwas beginning to think I would never be able to do--rise in support of \na balanced budget resolution. I have stood before the Senate several \ntimes over the last 18 years arguing about the need to balance the \nbudget. In fact, I spent several weeks on this very floor earlier this \nyear fighting for a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget. I believe that a balanced budget is important enough to this \ncountry to warrant a constitutional amendment requiring it.\n  During that debate, many of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle argued that we did not need a constitutional amendment, that we \ncould--and should--balance the budget without an amendment. American \ntaxpayers were told that their elected Members of Congress should have \nthe fortitude to make the tough decisions.\n  Well, Mr. President, the new majority has, in fact, done just that. \nWe have made the difficult decisions required to balance the budget in \n7 years. Not \n\n[[Page S 9402]]\nevery Senator or House Member who voted for this conference report \nlikes every single provision in it. Each of us, were we king or queen \nof America, would no doubt have done this resolution differently in one \nway or another.\n  But, for the first time in a generation, the absolute necessity of \nattaining a balanced Federal budget was put ahead of individual \npreferences and ahead of short-term political considerations. For the \nfirst time in 26 years, we thought about the long-term economic future \nof our country and about the dismal prospects for our children and \ngrandchildren who will inherit it.\n  I regret that my colleagues on the other side could not bring \nthemselves to make these tough decisions. And, fortunately, the worst \ndecision they make is failing to take a long-term view. Instead of \nembracing a plan that will balance the budget, lower net interest \npayments on our staggering national debt, and lower taxes on hard-\nworking Americans, my colleagues on the other side are moaning that the \ncuts are too deep and too fast.\n  Unlike my Republican colleagues whose commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility transcended their own particular preferences, my \nDemocratic colleagues are waiting for a perfect balanced budget. In \nfact, they seem to be waiting for a budget resolution that does not \nrequire them to make any hard decisions at all.\n  Mr. President, I may not agree with every spending cut assumed in \nthis conference report. However, I do believe that the most important \nthing that this Congress can do for the future of this country is \nbalance the budget.\n  Why is this so important to the citizens of this country? A balanced \nbudget will mean interest rates that are as much as 2 percent lower. It \nmeans the creation of over 6 million jobs in the next 10 years. And, \nthis budget resolution could mean an increase in per capita incomes by \nover 16 percent. Mr. President, these changes are not just for a few, \nthey benefit everyone.\n  Of course, I am aware that one of the most contentious issues in this \nbalanced budget proposal is the question of tax cuts. Some of our \ncolleagues would be pleased to see a resolution that contained little \nor no room for tax cuts. They make an interesting point, one that we \nshould consider. After all, if the goal is to bring the budget into \nbalance as quickly as possible, isn't it easier and smarter to do so \nwithout reducing the tax inflow of cash to the Treasury?\n  At first glance, the answer to this question seems obvious. However, \nthis assumes that our tax system is perfectly efficient and that it is \ndelivering revenue to the Treasury in the most beneficial way possible.\n  I believe the answer to this question is yes; there are policies we \ncan and should enact. Generally, we need to ensure that the Tax Code is \nproviding proper incentives for individuals to save and invest, for \ncompanies to expand and create jobs and to compete in the global \nmarketplace. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code is striking out \non all of these goals.\n  As Americans, we save too little and consume too much. Our colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Packwood, has been holding hearings in the Finance \nCommittee that reinforce this point. We've heard panel after panel of \nexperts testify that our savings rate is dangerously low. A lot of the \nfault lies with the Tax Code, which rewards the wrong kind of behavior. \nWe have very little incentive to save and invest because our tax \nsystem, in effect, taxes twice the gains from such saving and \ninvesting, and at a discouragingly high rate for most people.\n  The most effective way to reduce this double taxation is to change \nthe way this country taxes capital gains. I can think of nothing that \nwould get our economy moving and growing like a significant cut in the \ncapital gains rate. Simply stated, lower capital gains taxes will lead \nto more jobs. Jobs don't create themselves: businesspeople create them \nwhen capital is used to start or expand a business.\n  And, as America's entrepreneurs can tell us, capital is too scarce \nand costs too much. Fortunately, it appears that a capital gains tax \ncut, like the one included in the Hatch-Lieberman Capital Formation \nAct, would go a long way toward reducing the cost of capital. A drop in \nthe after-tax costs of equipment, land, buildings, and investments \nwould provide the incentive for billions of dollars of new, productive \ninvestment.\n  We also need to make changes in the Tax Code in order to enhance our \nNation's international competitiveness. Many elements of our Tax Code \nwere designed at a time when the United States had little, if any, \ncompetition from foreign manufacturers. Today, we ignore the reality of \nglobal competition at our peril.\n  One area of the Tax Code that stands in need of change is the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit. Since 1981, the credit has \nbeen extended six times and modified four times. Twice it was extended \nonly retroactively. Firms making long-term plans cannot rely on this \nkind of a track record. American industries spend over $75 billion each \nyear on research and development. Unlike a few years ago, these \ncompanies don't have to perform that research within U.S. borders.\n  Should the U.S. continue with its intermittent support for R, or \nworse, allow the credit to expire altogether, much of this spending, \nand the jobs that go with it, may well be transferred overseas. \nCongress needs to demonstrate its commitment to America's future by \nenacting policies such as the permanent extension of this credit. A \nbill I am sponsoring, S. 351, would do just that.\n  Similarly, the semiconductor industry is laboring under outmoded laws \nthat could drive their facilities overseas. Currently, under Japanese \nlaw, a company can depreciate up to 88 percent of its semiconductor \nequipment cost in the first year, while U.S. law permits a mere 20 \npercent first-year depreciation. When multinational semiconductor firms \nare deciding where to spend their investment dollars, a depreciation \ngap this large can be decisive.\n  Repairing flaws such as these in our Tax Code will strengthen \nAmerican companies, create jobs, and restore business confidence.\n  Mr. President, tax cuts are a vital component of this budget \nresolution. I am pleased that the conferees from both the Senate and \nthe House were able to keep a reasonable allocation for making some of \nthese important adjustments to the Internal Revenue Code, once we have \ncertified that our budget will be balanced. And, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to formulate a \npackage of tax cuts that will maximize the ability of our economy to \nproduce jobs and for our companies to compete internationally.\n  Mr. President, another of the more controversial issues in this \nbudget resolution is funding for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Two other provisions of the conference agreement have a bearing on \nMedicare.\n  First, the resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that a \nCommission should be established to make immediate recommendations on \nthe most appropriate way to ensure Medicare's solvency. Under section \n307, that Commission will report its recommendations to Congress by \nFebruary 1 of next year.\n  While I generally am skeptical about Commissions which can often just \ndelay action on an issue, in the case of Medicare, it is obvious to me \nthat Congress needs all the help it can get. This program is too vital \nfor us to act precipitously and make changes that will not work. An \nexpert Commission can give us valuable input.\n  Second, the budget conference report contains language expressing the \nsense of the Congress that the relevant Committees should give high \npriority to proposals which will ferret out waste, fraud, and abuse in \nMedicare, and that any funds resulting from those efforts will be used \nto enhance the solvency of Medicare.\n  I think those efforts are absolutely crucial; and I am very\n   supportive of this language. As my colleagues are aware, I did have \nconcerns about the Senate version in that it would have advocated using \nhealth care fraud and related fines to finance investigations. \nHistorically, Congress has frowned on financing law enforcement \nactivities through criminal and civil fines and penalties.\n\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that there are myriad financial \nproblems with both Medicare and Medicaid. Everyone knows it. It is no \nsecret.\n  The question remains this: How do we improve the programs? That will \nbe \n\n[[Page S 9403]]\na responsibility that falls to the Finance Committee. As a member of \nthe Finance Committee, I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  I want to make sure that both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries \nhave the services they need, that the services are of the highest \nquality possible, and that they are cost-efficient.\n  I want to make sure that the services are available in rural as well \nas urban areas. I want to make sure that we have a system which \nprovides incentives for providers to deliver cost-efficient, high-\nquality care.\n  I will be working with my colleagues on Finance to meet those goals. \nGood solutions be hard to achieve, but we cannot simply sweep the \nproblems away because they are too hard. It is necessary that we tackle \nthese issues. We cannot evade this duty because it is unpleasant and \nmay involve difficult choices.\n  I want to turn for a moment to two crucial components of this budget \ncompromise: the targets we have set for Medicare and Medicaid funding.\n  I am not insensitive to all the concerns which have been expressed \nabout the possibility of reductions in the rate of increase of these \ntwo programs. As many of my colleagues have pointed out here today, the \ntargets we are setting with this bill are ambitious and unprecedented.\n  But they are also very necessary.\n  The reason I support this budget resolution, is very simple.\n  This country is going bankrupt. And so is Medicare.\n  And if it weren't a jointly administered, State/Federal program, \nappropriated annually from general revenues, Medicaid would be going \nbankrupt also.\n  And, let's not forget one more thing: Without a fiscally solvent \ncountry, our country cannot have fiscally solvent\n programs.\n\n  Let me turn for a minute to the specifics.\n  The budget compromise provides $773.1 billion in budget authority and \noutlays for Medicaid over 7 years. As the conference noted, that level \nwill allow Medicaid to grow 7.2 percent in 1996, 6.8 percent in 1997, \nand 4 percent thereafter. Or, the resolution holds out the possibility \nthat the rate of increase could be higher, if the so-called \ndisproportionate share hospital payments are frozen.\n  The resolution is flexible in that it allows the Committee on Finance \nto decide how the program should be restructured, that is, to consider \nthe myriad issues which have been raised about Medicaid, such as \nwhether there should be changes to its eligibility, benefits, payment \nrates, financing, distribution formula, and entitlement status.\n  For Medicare, the budget conference report provides $1.457 trillion \nin budget authority and $1.443 trillion in outlays for Medicare over \nthe 7-year period. Again, the budget resolution is flexible in how we \nmeet that target.\n  It is important to note that the conference agreement predicated its \nMedicare spending levels on funding necessary to preserve and protect \nMedicare, which every knowledgeable expert predicts is headed rapidly \nfor bankruptcy, and to start the structural reforms which are necessary \nto make Medicare solvent in the long-term.\n  As with the Medicaid targets, the resolution allows the Finance \nCommittee the flexibility to design Medicare program reforms.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution is the right thing to do for \nthis country. The Republicans have stepped up to the plate and made the \ndifficult decisions necessary to balance the budget. It was not easy \nand I don't necessarily agree with every single one of the choices \nassumed in this resolution. There were difficult decisions regarding \nspecific programs, overall priorities, and general reforms.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution contains no actual changes in \nthe law, but it does assume some important changes in the way the \nFederal Government operates and a significant shift in its role in the \nlives of the American people. In the budget resolution, the Republicans \ndownsize government. We strengthen the national defense system. We \nreform Medicare to preserve and protect it. We improve Medicaid and \nprotect Social Security. And, we reform a destructive welfare system \nthat drags our families down into a cycle of dependency.\n  Most importantly, this Budget resolution balances the budget by 2002. \nInstead of balancing the budget on the backs of the taxpayers with tax \nincreases, this budget resolution will provide tax relief. This budget \nresolution gives the American people back some of their hard-earned \nmoney and includes provisions to expand economic growth and create new \njobs.\n  We have set the stage for important reforms in the way the Federal \nGovernment operates. We have set out to make government smaller, more \nresponsive, and more effective.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is the best thing we can do for the \nAmerican people. We must get them out from under the heavy burden of \ndeficit spending and the ever increasing public debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to make a few final observations on \nthis Republican budget.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has the votes, and \nI congratulate him for steering the Republican budget to a successful \nconclusion which I suspect will be basically on a party line vote.\n  However, as we head home to our families, loved ones, and neighbors, \nI hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take a \nlittle time to think about their budget outside of the confines of \nWashington. Because back home is the best place to put this budget in \nits proper setting and context. Back home is the place to see the havoc \nand suffering this budget will wreak upon our fellow Americans.\n  My colleagues know how proud I am of Nebraska and its people. They \nare tough and spirited. They are hard working and patriotic. They are \neverything one could want in a neighbor.\n  Mr. President, when a family is facing difficult times, its members \npull together. They work and they sacrifice. That is how we should \napproach our Nation's fiscal crisis. We should get our priorities in \norder. We should call for fair and reasonable sacrifice for the greater \ngood.\n  But that did not occur in this Republican budget agreement. We did \nnot get a balanced budget for the American family.\n  We got a budget that asks the most of those who have the least.\n  We got a far-right wing budget with twisted priorities and convoluted \nthinking.\n  We got a budget so far out of step with the American people that it \nis laughable when my Republican friends call it ``mainstream.''\n  I would say that the $245 billion tax cut for the wealthy is the \nheart and soul of this budget. But this Republican budget lacks all \nheart, and it has no soul.\n  In a family, you look out for each other. You do not unfairly rip \naway medical care from the elderly, our poor, our disabled and our \nchildren. You do not mortgage your family's future by cutting education \nand job training. You do not kick a man when he is down, like this \nbudget does to rural America.\n  And, make no mistake, this budget will devastate our rural economy. \nOur Nation's farmers are having the rug pulled out from under them. \nMedicare cuts of this magnitude will close rural hospitals and \neliminate jobs. To complete this devastation, we are reducing rural \neconomic development efforts and slashing rural housing. This budget \ndoes not offer a helping hand, it gives rural America the back of its \nhand.\n  You should not do all of this merely to finance a $245 billion tax \ncut for the wealthiest. You do not do this to satisfy some ideological \nitch. You do not\n do this to score points in a political poll.\n\n  Mr. President, you do not do this to your family. And Mr. President, \nI could not inflict this misguided budget upon the families of \nNebraska.\n  In the seeks that lie ahead, I hope that cooler heads will prevail \nand that my colleagues on the other side will come out from behind \ntheir closed doors. They have no choice now but to face the music.\n  Yesterday, both President Clinton and OMB Director Alice Rivlin \nweighed \n\n[[Page S 9404]]\nin against this budget. In his letter to the Republican leaders, \nPresident Clinton said:\n\n       I hope we can work together and avoid the situation in \n     which I have no choice but to use my veto authority.\n\n  Director Rivlin echoed the President's sentiments on the misguided \npriorities in the Republican budget. She states:\n\n       If reconciliation and appropriations legislation \n     implementing these policies were presented to the President, \n     I would strongly recommend that he use his veto authority.\n\n  These are strong words but I believe they are right on target.\n  So I say one more time, that if my Republican colleagues want a \nbalanced budget that is fair and reasonable, they will find in this \nSenator a fair and reasonable man who is willing to listen and willing \nto help. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, ``The \nchoice is yours.''\n  I will be there to help when and if I can.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Bond, the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, many very significant things have happened \nin this body during the 8\\1/2\\ years I have been here. Some have \nchanged people's lives in America for the better and some have laid the \ngroundwork for a better America in the future.\n  Notwithstanding, I believe that this budget resolution is the most \nimportant thing we have done for America since I have been a Member of \nthe Senate, and probably the most important since the Vietnam war.\n  Why? Because we have committed ourselves to completing something the \nAmerican people have wanted us to do for decades, but the Congress \nlacked the courage to go forward with it--that is making the very tough \ndecisions to get our annual budget in balance and begin to lift the \nenormous burden of debt we have left for the next generation of \nAmericans to carry.\n  Mr. President, this had to happen and we have to see it through.\n  Now we have the blueprint, but the tough part is just beginning. In \nthe next 2 months, the authorizing committees and appropriations \ncommittees must do the heavy lifting of specifying in detail and in \nlaw, how we are going to squeeze down Federal spending to meet this \nambitious plan. Make no mistake, this will not be easy. We are going to \nhear from every imaginable interest group and everyone of our friends. \nAll will share the goal of balancing the budget, but all will also want \nus to protect their individual interest.\n  Here is where the American people want us to show some courage. For \nthe good of the whole, we must resist the pressures that will come from \nthose only interested in the few. These will be tough and important \ndecisions, but I believe we will see them through.\n  When I became Governor of Missouri in 1981, I was faced with a \nsimilar situation. The State's budget was seriously out of balance. \nMost believed that the tough things we had to do would so anger the \npowerful special interests that I could not survive taking them on. \nWell, from that experience I learned something. People are willing to \nstick with you, even though a vocal minority make it their mission to \nbring you down, if you make the cuts fairly, and everyone contributes \nto solving the problem.\n  I believe this budget resolution meets that test.\n  This budget resolution allows Federal spending to grow, just at a \nslower rate. It does not rely on smoke and mirror accounting to achieve \nbalance in 2002. And, it courageously confronts the entitlements, which \nwe all know must be confronted if we are going to get the job done.\n  Also, I am pleased that the tax relief for families and economic \ngrowth are conditioned upon actually realizing the revenue dividend \nthat will come from balancing the budget. This is a responsible way to \nmake sure deficit reduction is a condition precedent to tax cuts and \nI'm glad the Senate's position prevailed on this issue in conference.\n  I hope that as the authorizing and appropriations committees begin \ntheir work, that we all will think of our children and the children of \nfuture generations. When the special interest cries begin, let's not \nforget what has already been done to future generations and ask \nourselves, ``Can we put this off any longer?'' I believe the answer is \nno. Let's commit ourselves to seeing through this national priority and \nallow the good of the whole to override the good of the few. The \nAmerican people will reward us for our commitment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9356-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9404-S9410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on House Concurrent Resolution 67 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) setting forth the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal years, \n     1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, having met, \n     after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and \n     do recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed \n     by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 26, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that means that this is before us \nofficially and formally at this point; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as now printed, the Statement of Managers in the \nconference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 1996 (H. Rept. 104-159) contains several technical and \ntypographical errors. Under the rules of the Senate, the conference \nreport is not amendable so I submit the following list for the \ninformation of Senators and other interested parties only.\n  On page 40, in the table showing the aggregate and functional levels \nin the House resolution, the outlays in fiscal year 2000 for Function \n350: Agriculture should be 9.0.\n  On page 48, the ``Conference Agreement--Discretionary Totals'' tables \nshould end after the outlay line for ``Nondefense''. Following that \nline, the header ``CONFERENCE AGREEMENT--Mandatory Totals'' should be \ninserted.\n  On Page 49, at the top of page, the header should be ``CONFERENCE \nAGREEMENT--MANDATORY TOTALS.''.\n  On Page 51, in the second sentence of the first paragraph, the word \n``separated'' should read ``separate''.\n  On Page 56, in the table ``Allocation of Spending Responsibility to \nHouse Committees'', the Discretionary action outlay subtotal for the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee should be ``-63''.\n  On Page 94, at the end of the second sentence in the third full \nparagraph, ``in the Senate'' should be inserted.\n  On Page 94, in the third sentence of the third full paragraph, \n``Senate Budget Committee is'' should be substituted for ``Budget \nCommittees are''.\n  On Page 94, in the first and second sentences of the fifth full \nparagraph, the phrase ``tax writing committees are'' should be ``Senate \nFinance Committee is''.\n  On Page 95, in the first and second full paragraph, references to \n``205(e)'' should be to ``205(c)''.\n  On Page 95, in the second full paragraph, references to ``204(a)'' \nshould be to ``205(a)''.\n  On Page 98, in the last sentence of the explanation on the IRS \nAllowance the phrase ``to this Congress'' should read ``in this \nCongress''.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico for the mammoth task he is about to complete--to pass a \nresolution putting the United States on track to balance the Federal \nbudget by 2002. The Foreign Relations Committee is committed to do its \npart to put the international affairs budget function on a trajectory \nfor meeting the targets specified in the budget blueprint that \n\n[[Page S 9405]]\nlies before us. That said, I respectfully request to ask my friend from \nNew Mexico to engage in a colloquy to clarify for the Record the terms \nof the conference report on the budget resolution relating to the \ninternational affairs budget function.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be delighted to enter into a colloquy with my \ngood friend on this point.\n  Mr. HELMS. The House resolution contains an agreement to restructure \nthe various foreign affairs activities by consolidating AID, USIA, and \nACDA into the Department of State. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is my further understanding that the Senate budget \nresolution also assumed major restructuring of the U.S. foreign affairs \napparatus, including support for the consolidation of ACDA, USIA, and \nAID into the Department of State and any cost savings which it \ngenerates. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. So, in other words, the House and Senate budget conference \nreport accommodates the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nreorganization proposal to abolish the Agency for International \nDevelopment, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency, and fold their essential functions and \npersonnel into the Department of State, and when the Senate decides to \nabolish these agencies the budget resolution will support it. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank my distinguished friend from New Mexico for his \nsupport and look forward to celebrating his remarkable victory later \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator Simpson, \nfrom the great State of Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have been here 16-plus years. There are \na lot of people who do a lot of work in this place, but the senior \nSenator from New Mexico is, in my estimation, much like a true patriot. \nHe practically has given his life to the budget and he has learned it, \nand I think we must respect him.\n  My good colleague from Nebraska, who came here when I did, has \ndedicated a lot of his energy and time. But, ladies and gentlemen, this \nis it. Either we start now or we leave nothing --nothing--for people \nbetween 18 and 45, because when they are 63, the cupboard will be \npicked clean: Medicare broke in 7 years, disability insurance broke in \n2016, Social Security itself broke in the year 2031. Who is telling us \nthat? Appointees of the President of the United States.\n  So this is it. No more fun and games. No smoke and mirrors. Step up \nto the plate.\n  Buy--the things are on me.\n  I have heard many criticisms of this budget from the other side of \nthe aisle, but even the harshest critics of the budget admit that its \nnumbers are honest, indeed conservative, and there is no ``smoke and \nmirrors'' employed here to create an illusion of balancing the budget. \nTo put it very simply, if we and future Congresses adhere to the \nrequirements of this budget, we will get the job done.\n  I will only take a short time to review where we are with respect to \nthe economic future of this country. We currently have a national debt \napproaching $5 trillion. Early in the next century, the baby boom \ngeneration will begin to retire, and this will place untold strains on \nour working population. By the year 2013, under current law, the Social \nSecurity System will begin to experience a deficit, and we will have to \ncut benefits or raise payroll taxes to meet that challenge. Also under \ncurrent law, by the year 2002, Medicare will be broke--flat broke.\n  I have heard it said--even the President has said it--that 7 years' \ntime is ``too short'' a time in which to force the budget into balance. \nI cannot understand this. Where in the world will we find the money to \nprovide for the baby boomers' retirement and health costs if we \ncontinue to use up the Federal budget with ever-increasing interest \npayments? If we do not balance the budget shortly after the turn of the \ncentury, we will never do it.\n  I have reviewed this budget conference report unusually carefully, \neven skeptically, because of the great importance that I attach to \nmeeting this dire situation now, and meeting it properly. I have been \ngreatly concerned about doing anything in the way of tax cuts that \ncould undermine the objective of reaching a balanced budget.\n  My colleagues well know that I joined with 11 other Republicans in \nsigning a letter urging Senator Domenici and the conferees to uphold \nthe Senate's CBO-certification provision. This would verify that we are \non course to balancing the budget before permitting any tax decreases. \nI am greatly pleased that the certification mechanism is a component of \nthis conference agreement.\n  It is, however, in slightly different form than it was in the \noriginal Senate version, so I believe it is necessary to review the \nsubstance of what we are talking about, in order to more fully explain \nmy support for this agreement.\n  We have been told by various economists, and by the Congressional \nBudget Office, that certain benefits will accrue from balancing the \nbudget. Economic activity will increase, investment in our economy will \nincrease, growth will increase, and interest rates will drop due to a \nlessening of the pressures of debt. All of this will tend to bring in \nmore revenue to the Federal Government.\n  It is reasonable to ask what we would do with that revenue if it did \nmaterialize. It seemed only proper that the revenue should be returned \nto fortify and strengthen the private economy from which it came, to be \ngiven back to the hard-working American families who created it, rather \nthan to give it to Government to spend.\n  This was the origin of the provision in the Senate budget resolution. \nEstimates were that a dividend of $170 billion would be created if we \ndid our work properly and balanced the budget. So we would--in the \noriginal Senate provision--therefore have permitted $170 billion in tax \ndecreases to be enacted if we were indeed on course to balance.\n  Now, let me sound a note of caution here, that note of skepticism--\nthat ornery Wyoming strain. It's in each of us who is from the land\n of high altitude and low multitude.\n\n  It has not escaped my attention that even the CBO certification of an \neconomic dividend would be something of a speculation. We would be \nprojecting the economic benefit, and allowing ourselves to commit to \nreturning it before it had all completely materialized. Future \nCongresses could ``chicken out,'' could fail to follow through with the \nspending cuts. CBO certification would not bind future Congresses. We \nwould still have the chance to hand out the tax goodies, to fail to \nfinish all of the spending cuts in the out-years, and make the debt \nproblem worse.\n  But this is where my position on the Finance Committee comes in. I \nremind my colleagues that the work of making the promise of this budget \nresolution a reality will be done in the reconciliation process. and I \nam going to work doggedly to ensure that when the Finance Committee \nmakes changes in our entitlement programs to meet the terms of this \nconference report, that we lock in all of that reduced growth \ncarefully. Because if we do that, we will do a great deal to slow \nfuture Government spending--even if future Congresses fail to hold to \nour restraints on appropriations.\n  Although the conference did retain the Senate provision requiring a \nCBO certification before proceeding with revenue decreases, I was \ninitially concerned upon reading that the total amount of the tax cuts \nin the conference report would be $245 billion, somewhat higher than \nthe $170 billion figure which we understood to be the size of the \ndividend projected by CBO.\n  However, I am satisfied that this budget conference report will \nindeed bring us to a balanced budget if we adhere to its terms, and I \nintend to help Finance Committee chairman, Bob Packwood, to do just \nthat in the entitlements and tax area.\n  One key is that not more than $50 billion of the tax cuts can be \nconcentrated in the year 2002. If we enact more than that, then the \nbudget will not be balanced in 2002, the target year. The tax cuts must \nbe spread out over the 7 years properly in order to meet this \nobjective, and I have every confidence that we in the finance committee \ncan accomplish this.\n  As we pass this conference report, I would remind my colleagues again \nthat \n\n[[Page S 9406]]\nthe real tough work of balancing the budget still awaits us in the \nfuture. We in the Finance Committee will still have to enact the \nrestraints on entitlement programs, and this and future Congresses must \nadhere to the plan for reducing annual appropriations. Only if we do \nthis can we have the balanced budget and the tax relief at the same \ntime.\n  While no budget conference report can guarantee that this work will \nbe done properly, I believe that the conference report gives us our \nbest chance to do the job. The numbers are tough, realistic, \nconservative. If tax relief stimulates additional economic growth, \nspeeds it to the rates assumed by President Clinton in his own budget \nproposal, then we will perhaps advance even faster toward the target of \na balanced budget. That its a real possibility, given the tough \nassumptions used by CBO and our budget negotiators.\n  In all cases, it is clear that this budget is far preferable to the \nstatus quo, and this is why I will vote for it. The status quo would \npermit absolutely intolerable increases in spending, particularly \nentitlement spending. We cannot afford growth rates of 10 percent per \nyear in these programs. But that is what we will continue if we defeat \nthis agreement.\n  I therefore urge the adoption of this conference report and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we have very little time on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator from Nebraska would yield me 5 \nminutes, if he has 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 17 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we had one cancellation. Therefore, I have \nsome extra time that I do not have obligated. I am very pleased to \naccommodate my friend by yielding him 5 minutes from our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, first I want to thank Senator Exon. In spite of the \nremarks he made today about the budget of the Republicans that is \nbefore us today, and that is before the people of this country today, I \nbelieve he is a man of great respect. I happen to disagree with almost \neverything he said about this budget. But in 7 minutes I cannot go \nthrough point by point. I would just say it is an enormous exaggeration \nto say that this is aimed at harming rural America. Anyway we look at \nit, the only part that could even be considered is the health care \nreform package that we have here. Let me say to rural America, what we \nhave done is save Medicare from bankruptcy, from going broke. And on \nMedicaid, what we have done is said let us deliver that program more \nefficiently by letting the Governors and legislators have more to say \nabout how we do that.\n  I can hardly believe that is going to harm rural America. We might \neven get fooled, and find that by saving Medicare we make it more \nefficient and better for seniors and by saving Medicaid, which we could \nhardly afford to pay for the next 7 years, by saving it and making it \nmore responsive at the local level, we might even do better by rural \nAmerica.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, most Americans start this weekend \ncelebrating a great, great American holiday. That holiday is \nIndependence Day, the Fourth of July. And it is more than symbolic that \njust before Independence Day, when we treat ourselves to the joy of \nfreedom, of opportunity, that these Forefathers brought to us, it is \nmore than a coincidence that a budget resolution before the Senate is \ngoing to free America up. It is going to say to the American people \nthat future generations are free to earn more money and make a better \nliving. It is going to free up the interest rates where they will come \ndown instead of going up. It will make America's dollar stronger here \nand in the world markets, all of which means a better life for more and \nmore Americans. And it means we are not going to force the young people \nof our country to pay our bills, whether they are bills for seniors, \nbills for education, bills for veterans.\n  We have asked everybody to look at this somberly and decide with us \nthat we can do it better and do it for less. And for those who claim, \nas Senator Rockefeller did here on the floor in those exaggerated words \nwhich some master of public relations wrote up for him, but when he \ncomes down and talks about all it is doing, fellow Americans, we are \nsaying the budget cannot grow at 5 percent a year. It can only grow at \n3. You tell me. An American budget that is growing at 3 and instead of \n5 percent a year, starting at $1.6 trillion that we are doing something \ndraconian. What those who are opposing it piece by piece are saying is \nthey do not want to do anything. They would like to leave the deficit \nhang around our necks and hang around our young people's necks until it \nthrottles them. They will work for the Government instead of their \nfamilies. Is not that an interesting Fourth of July, to say bondage for \nour children instead of freedom because we do not have the guts to cut \nFederal spending?\n  And for those who come to the floor and claim we are going to hurt \nour senior citizens, we are going to make this program of health care \nsolvent instead of sitting by and watching it get to a point where you \ncannot even pay the bills in 7 years. And we will do it in an orderly \nmanner, and they will get as good or better health care when we are \nfinished reforming it than they are today. There will be less \nGovernment. But who today wants more Government?\n  Are those on the other side who are chastising this budget with such \nstrange words as ``felonies'' and ``misdemeanors,'' what would they do? \nThey talk about being for a budget. The only budget I know that was \noffered on the other side had the highest tax increase in the history \nof the Nation in it. Is that how we want to balance the budget? Sure. \nThey call it ``loophole closures.'' Loophole closures? The five largest \nloopholes belong to every American who has a house and it has been \nmortgaged. That is the largest of all loopholes. Then in order after \nthat, for deducting health care expenses, that is the second largest. \nIs that a loophole that we ought to just close, or will not that be \nincreasing taxes? How about charitable deductions? It is the fourth \nlargest. It is a loophole. We can go on from there. One man's loophole \nis another man's or another woman's increase in taxes. So there is no \nplan.\n  And I want to close today, as I have done one other time or two other \ntimes, by quoting none other than a liberal professor from Harvard \nUniversity, Laurence Tribe. Let me close my remarks by building on a \nstatement that he made when we were speaking of the balanced budget. \nListen carefully. He said:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we seek somehow to tie our hands so that we cannot spend our \n     children's legacy.\n\n  That is a pretty good statement of why we should balance the budget, \nor, conversely, what we have been doing. We have been spending our \nchildren's legacy, future, and opportunity.\n  So I say just before the Fourth of July, 220 years ago, the brave \nforefathers of this country crept onto a ship in Boston Harbor where, \nin order to protest a cruel system of taxation, they cut up boxes of \nBritish tea and dumped it into the water. That too was described as a \nrevolutionary act, but it was one which helped to bring a better future \nfor many people in America and for this young land.\n  So, Mr. President, it has been my privilege to lead the Republicans \nin a spirit of that Boston Tea Party. We are saying free our young \npeople from this debt. We are saying that we want to declare war on \ndeficits, and we want to give deficits the death penalty for, indeed, \nthey are debt for our children, ultimately death for our growth and \nprosperity. And I am proud of this budget. When we get it implemented, \nalmost every American will be also.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the majority has expired. The \nSenator from Nebraska controls the remaining 13 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I listened with great care to my good friend. We use \nthat term around here, and people listening \n\n[[Page S 9407]]\nmight say: How can they be good friends when they carry on as they did? \nBut we are good friends. We just happen to differ very strongly on this \nmatter.\n  My good friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nwhom I have worked with for 17 years, complained about some of rhetoric \nand some of the phraseology that was used by those on this side of the \naisle, attacking it. I listened very carefully to my good friend who \nused time that I yielded to him----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For which I am most grateful.\n  Mr. EXON. To make some statements that I must at least indicate that \nI do not agree with. I thought that I had maybe concluded my statement. \nBut I must make note of some statements that were made by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  To say that this budget saves Medicare is doubly misleading.\n  So in the first instance, even by their own terms and by their own \nfigures, the Republican budget will only postpone and not save the \ninsolvency of the Medicare trust fund that we have heard so much about. \nThey would only extend it for 3 years. That is hardly saving it. And I \nhope that everyone will understand that those are the facts and they \nare indisputable.\n  Secondly, and equally as important, they seek to save this program by \ndramatically slashing benefits. If that is a savings, and if that is \nsaving this program, I would hate to see what they would do if they \nreally wanted to attack the program.\n  The bottom line is that the average Medicare beneficiary will have to \npay $3,345 more over the next 7 years than he or she would have spent \nwithout the Republican budget. That is a fact.\n  I hear time and time again how this is going to save the Nation, how \nwe are making sacrifices, how we have to help the younger generation. \nThe younger generation, I assure you, Mr. President, is not going to be \nhelped by the $245 billion tax giveaway, most of which goes to the most \nwealthy Americans, those making over $200,000. That is not a benefit to \nthe younger generation.\n  I simply say that were it not for the $245 billion tax cut mainly \ngoing to the wealthiest Americans, I am not sure that the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and myself, the ranking member, would be that far \napart. I cannot swallow it, and I will not swallow it. I think it is \nwrong. You cannot save and protect the younger people and protect the \nolder people and have a budget that works if you are going to have that \nlarge of a giveaway to the most affluent in our society.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time which will be assigned to the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, when he comes to the floor. In the \nmeantime, I would suggest the absence of a quorum with the time charged \nto our side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. EXON. I withhold the request in view of the fact the majority \nleader is in the Chamber.\n  How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 8 minutes \nand 44 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Eight minutes and 44 seconds is being reserved for the \nminority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the remaining time will be deducted from the \nminority side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand most of the time has \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Given that, I will use the 5 minutes and whatever \nadditional time I may need by calling upon my leader time for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the real disappointment in this budget is \nthat it did not result in a debate between Democrats and Republicans in \nthe conference itself but between the right and the far right, and the \nfar right won. Rather than consensus, it represents confrontation. \nRather than accomplishment, it represents missed opportunity. Rather \nthan success, it represents avoidable failure.\n  For many of us, for the country, for the future, this budget \nrepresents disappointment. Why? Because it is more extreme in every way \nthan what was originally voted on when we passed this resolution in the \nSenate--more extreme, more unfair, more unacceptable in every one of \nthe criteria we laid out during the debate on this budget several weeks \nago.\n  Our Republican colleagues say that they are worried about our \nchildren, but what do they do? They gut the very investments that this \nNation has made in its children.\n  They say they want to fix Medicare, but what do they do? They gut the \nprogram and want us to believe that things will somehow get better.\n  They say they want to get people off welfare, but what do they do? \nThey gut the very thing which keeps people out of welfare and taxes \nthem right back onto the welfare rolls. Why? Not in the name of a \nbalanced budget; not in the name of deficit reduction.\n  The reason they have made these choices is now there for all \nAmericans to see. They want to find a way to pay for a quarter of a \ntrillion dollar tax break, a tax break which in large measure goes to \nthe richest people in America.\n  The problem is that it does so to an even greater degree than the \noriginal budget resolution.\n  My colleagues have already stated the facts. Medicare is cut $270 \nbillion, $14 billion more than the Senate bill, the largest cut by far \nin the history of the program.\n  Medicaid is cut by $182 billion, $6 billion more than the Senate \nbill. Over 40 percent of the real cuts in this budget come from two \nprograms: Medicare and Medicaid. This extreme budget more than doubled \nthe cuts in student loans. Instead of a $4 billion reduction in the \navailability of student loans as called for in the original budget \nresolution, the figure is now $10 billion. It still asks American \nfamilies to cough up $21 billion in new taxes. And while the Senate \nversion at least--at least--had a sense-of-the-Senate provision urging \nthat 90 percent of tax cuts go to families with incomes of less than \n$100,000, that disappeared completely in the extreme budget conference \nreport we have before us now.\n  Mr. President, we have had the opportunity to analyze just exactly \nwhat this budget conference report will do. We have asked a number of \nbudgetary authorities to examine the figures, and this is the report \nthat we have now been given:\n  The average middle-class family will see $900 in loss to their \npocketbooks over the course of this budget resolution. Those making \nunder $75,000 will lose $900. And what about the wealthiest 1 percent \nof others in this country? They will see an increase of $20,000 as a \nresult of this budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important to look at how this \nbreaks down in terms of the demographics in this country just to see \nwho wins and who loses once this budget resolution goes into effect. \nThose who make less than $75,000, 77 percent of the American families, \nas I said, will lose $900. Those in the $75,000 to $100,000 category, \n12 percent of the population, will lose $600. Those who fall in the \ncategory that most Members of Congress fall in, $100,000 to $200,000, \nwe will see a $200 increase in our income over the course of this \nbudget resolution. That 3 percent of the population whose incomes fall \nbetween $200,000 and $350,000 will see a $9,000 increase in their \nincomes. And, finally, those with incomes over $350,000, 1 percent of \nthe country's population, will see $20,000.\n  Mr. President, the American people are catching on. They are \nbeginning now to understand. The more they see, the less they like. The \ncloser they look, the more concerned they get. And that has been in \nevidence with virtually every poll that has come out in the last \nseveral weeks. The Time/CNN poll, which is probably the most \ndemonstrative of this fact: Which one of the following do you think \nshould be the top priority for Congress in the next 6 months? people \nwere asked, and without equivocation 42 percent said protecting \nMedicare from the deep cuts that are proposed in this budget are by far \nand away the most important thing that we could do. \n\n[[Page S 9408]]\n\n  Which of the following budgets do you favor, the Republican plan or \nthe President's plan, the plan proposed by President Clinton? Nineteen \npercent of those who responded said they would support the Republican \nplan; 37 percent said they would support the President's plan.\n  Asked whether or not the Republican proposals to reduce Government \nprograms will generally help or hurt various people, 71 percent of the \nAmerican people said wealthy Americans are going to benefit from the \nRepublican budget as it has been proposed; 57 percent of all of those \nwho responded to this poll said that the middle class are going to be \nhurt and hurt badly.\n  In poll after poll, Mr. President--the Gallup poll on June 5 and 6, \nthe NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, again, in the latter part of this \nmonth--each and every one have come out as unequivocally as the \nAmerican people can through the data that has been presented to them, \neach and every American has said without equivocation, do not do this. \nYou are hurting those very people that you claim to be protecting. You \nare hurting the future of this country. You are devastating the \ninvestments in our people, and you are doing so, as we have seen with \nthis chart, to benefit the people who do not need help at all.\n  Mr. President, this budget will probably pass today. And when it \ndoes, it will pass with great disappointment. We can do better than \nthis. Democrats have proposed specific alternatives to do just that. \nThe American people expect more of us than what we have before us right \nnow. Extreme budgets like this do not merit our support. And many of us \nbelieve that we can do better. Many of us believe that when the vote is \ncast today, we have no recourse but to vote ``no'' because we know we \ncan do better.\n  But this is the easy part. This is the blueprint. The tough choices \ncome next. When those tough choices are made, it is imperative that we \nmove from the far right to the middle, away from deep cuts in Medicare, \naway from gutting education, away from tax breaks we cannot afford, and \ntoward a future we all want. It is not too late, Mr. President. It is \nnow past time to do the right thing. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Leaders' time was reserved; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first I want to thank all my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have had a good debate. We will be voting \nhere in just a few moments, and the conference report will pass.\n  I am just sitting here thinking about President Clinton and what he \nsaid on June 4, 1992, about balancing the budget on the Larry King \nShow. President Clinton was asked if he would submit a balanced budget \nsoon. ``I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.'' In an \nearlier question, he said he balanced the budget 11 times in Arkansas. \nOf course, that was required by law. If we had a balanced budget \namendment, we might have a balanced budget out here in 2 or 3 years. We \nhave one in 7 years. The President started off with 5.\n  Then he sent us a budget earlier this year and we had a vote on it, \n99-0, opposing the President's budget. Not a single Democrat would vote \nfor it. And then in June the President had a 10-year plan. I mean, if 5 \nyears was too painful and 7 years was too painful, let us try 10 years. \nIf it is too painful, we will try 12 years, 15 years, 20 years. Before \nlong it does not make any sense at all.\n  So I want to congratulate my colleagues and my colleagues in the \nHouse for passing the conference report and what I believe will happen \nhere in a few moments. I listened to my friend from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, talk about July 4th and Independence Day, to gather and \ncelebrate our independence and our freedom. And I really believe, \nthough maybe not every American will talk about the budget resolution \non July 4th; I am not certain many will unless they are having a \nproblem, we will talk about it--it is historic--because it is a little \nbit unexpected, I assume, in some cases, but it is going to bring about \nmore freedom and more independence for all Americans. And the first \nfreedom is going to be freedom from crushing debt.\n  The Senator from New Mexico closed his debate by talking about the \nchildren and the grandchildren. And I think most people are concerned \nabout that. Let me share with you some very wise words, which I will \nquote:\n\n       If the nation is living within its income, its credit is \n     good. If, in some crisis, it lives beyond its income for a \n     year or two, it can usually borrow temporarily at reasonable \n     rates. But if, like a spendthrift, it throws discretion to \n     the wind, and is willing to make no sacrifice at all in \n     spending . . . if it extends its taxing to the limit of the \n     people's power to pay . . . if it continues to pile up \n     deficits, then it is on the road to bankruptcy.\n\n  Now, those are not the words of this Senator. They are not the words \nof the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, or the chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee, Congressman Kasich. They are instead the \nwords spoken 62 years ago by President Franklin Roosevelt. So this is \nnot something new that cropped up here in the last few years. It has \nbeen a concern for a long, long time.\n  He was absolutely right. So we have thrown discretion to the winds. \nWe have had more spending, more taxes, more spending, more taxes. \nPresident Clinton gave us the biggest tax increase in the history of \nthe world in 1993 and is proud of it.\n  So I suggest there is just a different philosophy on that side of the \naisle: Do not touch any spending; if you have a problem, raise taxes. \nThey believe it, and that is probably the way it ought to be.\n  We have a different philosophy, and we believe it. We believe taxes \nhave been extended to the limits of Americans' power to pay. We have \nthe deficit about as high as we can pile it, and we are well down the \nroad to bankruptcy, as Roosevelt predicted 62 years ago, unless we \nbegin to change directions, and that is precisely what we are doing \ntoday. We are going to change directions, avoid bankruptcy, and set a \ncourse for a balanced budget by the year 2002. Here it is right on this \nchart.\n  President Clinton's budget has deficits as far as the eye can see in \nthe range of $200 billion, his budget proposed June 10. Our budget, the \nRepublican budget: Balanced by the year 2002. We do it without cooking \nthe books, without smoke and mirrors, without throwing seniors, \nchildren, and the less fortunate out on the street, though it has been \nsuggested by some here today that we are heartless, we lack compassion, \nwe do not care about anybody.\n  We do it by making tough decisions, by slowing the rate of growth of \nFederal spending. Yes, it eliminates some of the bureaucracies, and a \nfew others will have to learn to make do with less than they receive \nnow. But the vast majority will actually be receiving increases, just \nnot as much as they have been accustomed to. The rate of growth is \ngoing to be slowed, as most Americans would suggest we should do.\n  We are going to achieve about $894 billion through reductions in \nGovernment spending and savings. Still, Government spending will \nincrease $1.5 trillion this year to $1.876 trillion in the year 2002, \nas the Senator from New Mexico also indicated just a few moments ago.\n  Let me repeat those numbers, because it is going to continue to grow: \nFrom $1.5 trillion this year to $1.876 trillion in the year 2002. Now, \nthat may come as a surprise to some who may have believed what they \nhave been hearing from some on the other side of the aisle.\n  If you believe what they said, you would think the Republicans are \nshutting down the entire Government once and for all and every Federal \nprogram, taking money from education, taking money from Medicare, \ntaking money from Medicaid, taking money from rural America. That is \nnot the truth. That is not accurate.\n  It is not what we proposed. I do not care how often they repeat it, \nrepeat it, and repeat it, and how often the media picks it up, picks it \nup, picks it up, and spins it. It is not going to sell with the \nAmerican people.\n  So freedom from crushing debt, number one; freedom from excessive \ntaxation, number two.\n  On this Independence Day, the American people can also celebrate the \nfact they will have the freedom to save and spend more of their hard-\nearned money as they see fit. Whoever said the Government had a \nmonopoly on taxpayers' \n\n[[Page S 9409]]\nmoney, on what you make, whether you are a wage earner or in some other \nbusiness or some other vocation?\n  So we have a $245 billion tax relief package. The House wanted more. \nThis was the figure we agreed upon. It is large enough to accommodate \nthe family tax credit, which the Presiding Officer has been so \ninterested in in the past several years when he was in the House and \nalso now in the Senate.\n  We believe the American families are overtaxed. Maybe the Democrats \ndo not believe that, and they certainly have every right to say that \neverywhere they go, ``You are not taxed enough; we want to tax you some \nmore.''\n  We believe our tax system should encourage rather than discourage \ninvestment in job creation. We believe we ought to overhaul the tax \nsystem. So we have a tax commission headed by our former colleague, \nJack Kemp, to talk about economic growth and tax reform. They will \nreport to the Speaker and majority leader later this year. It is a 15-\nmember commission.\n  So is it wrong to have $245 billion in tax relief for overtaxed \nAmericans? I do not believe so.\n  Marriage penalty relief, opportunity to increase savings and \ninvestment, capital gains rate reduction, and I do not believe the \nDemocrats will oppose if we have some estate tax relief for small \nfamily-held businesses and farms and ranches across America where if \nsomebody dies, the Government ends up with half the estate. We want to \ncorrect that. So it seems to me that we are on the right track.\n  They do not take effect unless and until the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office certifies that we are absolutely on the \npath to a budget that is balanced in the year 2002. That is the safety \nvalve; that is the safety valve. They do not take effect until that has \nbeen certified, as the chairman has pointed out time after time.\n  So freedom from crushing debt, freedom from excessive taxation, \nfreedom from big Government. We are going to make the Government leaner \nand more efficient and more cost-effective and return more power to the \nStates and the communities and our other citizens.\n  I think also we ought to point out it is going to be freedom from \nworries of Medicare survival. I was on the 1983 Social Security \nCommission, a Commission appointed by Senator Howard Baker, the \nmajority leader at that time; by Ronald Reagan, a Republican President; \nby Tip O'Neill, a Democratic Speaker of the House. Social Security was \non the verge of bankruptcy. We had a bipartisan Commission. We rescued \nSocial Security, and it is going to be in good shape, at least until \nthe year 2020 and maybe beyond.\n  We want to do the same with Medicare, because if it goes bankrupt, \nyou cannot pay part A or part B, you cannot pay the doctor, you cannot \npay the hospital in about 5 or 6 years. We have an obligation to \nAmerica's seniors to correct it.\n  We have had a lot of political rhetoric on this floor, but it is less \nthan somewhat since President Clinton's budget proposal acknowledged \nthat we were right; we must slow the rate of growth of Medicare if we \nare going to protect, preserve, and improve it.\n  There are always those who try to scare the American seniors, always \nthose who engage in class warfare, always those who say we are going to \nslash Medicare. What are they going to do? What are all those people \nout trying to scare America's senior citizens going to do? Nothing. \nWhat are they going to do in 4 or 5 years when we cannot pay the \nhospital bill or the doctor bill of some senior in Minnesota, Kansas, \nNew Mexico, or wherever in America?\n  So it seems to me we are on the right track. We are trying to avoid \nthe bankruptcy of Medicare. We are not going to allow Medicare to go \nbankrupt. We are not going to allow Medicare to be cut to the bone. \nIndeed, under this Medicare proposal in our budget, we are going to \nincrease beneficiary spending from $4,860 a year to $6,732 by the year \n2002--a big increase.\n  Finally, I think what we are doing here in a broad way is \nsafeguarding our freedom and independence.\n  I hope that under this resolution--and this is just the start; the \nhard part comes after we pass the resolution--Americans will also know \nthat their freedom and independence, which was purchased by the \nsacrifice of countless Americans who risked and lost their lives, will \nremain secure. That is what this debate is all about: The future of \nAmerica, going into the next century in the year 2002. This budget \nresolution maintains our commitment to national security second to \nnone.\n  So I am pleased with the work that has been done by the budget \nconferees and by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee and the \nHouse Budget Committee.\n  There is a saying that has been around about as long as America has. \nThere are two ways to get to the top of an oak tree: One is to climb \nand the other is to find an acorn and sit on it and it will grow into a \ntree some day and you will be up on top.\n  We are going to do it the first way. We have been sitting on the \nacorn too long in this Congress hoping that somehow our deficits could \nbe reduced and a balanced budget would be magically sprouted and we \nwould be sitting on top of the world. Americans for a long time, \nbecause they have been ahead of us, hoped that we would find a \ndifferent course. We chose a different course--a balanced budget--to \nget to the top by climbing the tree, and there is a lot of climbing \nleft to do.\n  Mr. President, let me salute Senator Domenici for his tireless \nefforts in making this moment possible. He has the toughest job around \nhere. The taxpayers of America have no better friend than the senior \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  I also want to thank the Senate budget conferees for their dedication \nand hard work: Senators Brown, Gorton, Grassley, Gregg, Lott, and \nNickles, and thanks as well to Speaker Gingrich and House Budget \nCommittee chairman John Kasich and their conferees, because this has \nbeen a one-party effort. The other party did not want to participate. \nThey like to raise taxes. They do not want to reduce the rate of growth \nof spending anywhere, and that is precisely what we did.\n  So I believe we have reached the right result. It is not perfect. A \nlot of hard work is left, but we are ready for it. I hope that \neverybody will vote aye on the conference report.\n                             closing thanks\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are a number of people I want to \nbriefly thank for bringing this year's budget resolution to completion.\n  We all know, however, that this is not the end of the budget \nprocess--it is just the first step. But a very critical and important \nfirst step.\n  Let me first begin by thanking my friend and leader, Bob Dole and the \nRepublican Conference Chairman Senator Cochran for allowing me to serve \nas chairman of the Budget Committee this year.\n  To my fellow Senate Budget Committee members--and particularly the \nranking member, Senator Exon--thank you for the long hours we spent \ntogether earlier this year in hearings, debate, and markups.\n  Not too many Senators realize that the Budget Committee also marked \nup and reported unfunded mandates and line-item veto legislation while \nalso working on the budget. The committee has been busy.\n  I want to pay particular thanks to three members of the Budget \nCommittee--Senators Brown, Gorton, and Gregg. Thank you for chairing \nthree critical working groups earlier this year on discretionary, \nentitlement, and privatization issues.\n  Those groups' input was critical to the design of the resolution.\n  Let me also thank the three freshmen of the Budget Committee--\nSenators Abraham, Snowe, and Frist. I cannot remember a time when \nfreshmen on the Budget Committee were more active--in field hearings, \nparticipation, and just plain old input into the design of a \nresolution.\n  Finally, behind the scenes throughout has been the committee's \nstaff--both majority and minority. They have worked tirelessly for the \npast 6 months to bring us to this conclusion today. But their work is \nnot finished. They now must help to oversee that the resolution is \nimplemented and enforced.\n  There are a number of staff that should receive special recognition. \nI will insert into the Record a list of the committee staff. While \nsmall, the staff has been very effective in their work product and \nhelping us as Senators do our job better.\n\n[[Page S 9410]]\n\n  Let me give special recognition to Austin Smythe and Jennifer Smith, \nthe committee's counsels, for their hard work in getting this product \ndrafted and before the two Houses today. There is no question that \nwithout their dedication this product would never have been possible.\n  I want to also pay special tribute to Anne Miller, without her hard, \nconsistent, and careful scrutiny of the numbers this product also would \nnever have been possible.\n  Thanks to Cheri Reidy, Denise Ramonas, and Carol McGuire on taxes and \nappropriations crosswalks.\n  Special thanks to Peter Taylor who has been the chief economist on \nthe committee for the last few years. Peter will be leaving to join the \nJoint Committee on Taxation after the recess.\n  Thanks to Keith Hennessey for all his work on Medicare and Medicaid, \nand Ricardo Rel on agriculture issues.\n  Thanks to Brian Riley, Mike Ruffner, Lisa Cieplak, and Jim Hern for \nthe work on transportation, welfare, education, and housing issues.\n  Thanks to Roy Phillips and Greg Vuksich for their continued work on \ndefense and foreign affairs funding issues.\n  Behind them all, getting the briefing books put together and\n   copies, copies, copies--stand Christy Dunn, Andrea Gatta, Mieko \nNakabayashi, Karen Bilton, and Beth Wallis.\n  And finally, we all need our communications people and I have one of \nthe best in Bob Stevenson and his excellent assistant, Melissa \nLongoria.\n  Trying to keep all these people coordinated has been the job of my \nstaff director--Bill Hoagland.\n  Thank you all. Now get back to work and implement it.\n                Senate Budget Committee Republican Staff\n       Bill Hoagland, Majority Staff Director.\n       Carole McGuire, Assistant Staff Director.\n       Austin Smythe, Assistant Staff Director.\n       Anne Miller, Budget Review.\n       Cheri Riedy, Sr. Analyst for Budget Review.\n       Jennifer Smith, Counsel.\n       Jim Hearn, Sr. Analyst for Government Finance and \n     Management.\n       Lisa Cieplak, Sr. Analyst for Education, Social Service & \n     Justice.\n       Mike Ruffner, Analyst for Income Security and Veterans.\n       Keith Hennessey, Economist for Social Security and Health.\n       Ricardo Rel, Sr. Analyst for Agriculture and Natural \n     Resources.\n       Peter Taylor, Economist.\n       Brian Riley, Sr. Analyst for Transportation and Science.\n       Roy Phillips, Sr. Analyst for Defense.\n       Denise Ramonas, General Counsel.\n       Brian Benczkowski, Asst. to General Counsel.\n       Greg Vuksich, Sr. Analyst for International Relations.\n       Bob Stevenson, Communications Director.\n       Melissa Longoria, Asst. to Communications Director.\n       Christy Dunn, Asst. to Staff Director.\n       Andrea Gatta, Staff Assistant.\n       Karen Bilton, Staff Assistant.\n       Beth Wallis, Staff Assistant.\n       Mieko Nakabayashi, Staff Assistant.\n\n  Mr. President, even though we are under a time constraint, I want to \nsay thank you, once again, to one person. There are many, but I have to \ntell you, we would not be here if it were not for the staff of the \nmajority of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Hoagland, we thank you. Every member \nof this institution thanks you. Anybody that has dealt with you in this \narena thanks you. You know more than anyone around, and your \ntemperament and approach has been marvelous.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I echo what has been said. I echo my thanks \nto Bill Hoagland and the great staff on the Republican side on this \nmatter. They worked very hard. We are also indebted to Bill Dauster, \nwho is over here, and the members of his staff. Both staffs did a \ntremendous job.

ABBOTT SAFFOLD (ABBY) FOR HER LONG, FAITHFUL, AND \n                  EXEMPLARY SERVICE TO THE U.S. SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it's my sad duty today to announce to my \ncolleagues the retirement of Abby Saffold, who has served as Secretary \nto our caucus since her appointment to that post by then-majority \nleader, Senator Byrd, in 1987.\n  Together with the majority leader, Senator Dole, Senator Ford, \nSenator Lott, Senator Byrd, Senator Thurmond, and all other Senators, I \nsend a resolution to the desk to express the gratitude of the Senate to \nAbby Saffold for her years of service to the Senate of the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 143) commending C. Abbott Saffold \n     (Abby) for her long, faithful and exemplary service to the \n     United States Senate.\n       Whereas Abby Saffold has faithfully served the Congress in \n     many capacities over the past 28 years, 25 of which were \n     spent in service to the Senate;\n       Whereas Abby Saffold was the first women in the history of \n     the Senate to serve as Secretary for the Majority and the \n     first to serve as Secretary for the Minority;\n       Whereas Abby Saffold has at all times discharged the \n     important duties and responsibilities of her office with \n     great efficiency and diligence;\n       Whereas her dedication, good humor, and exceptional service \n     have earned her the respect and affection of Democratic and \n     Republican Senators as well as their staffs: Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its appreciation to \n     Abby Saffold and commends her for her lengthy, faithful and \n     outstanding service to the Senate.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to C. Abbott Saffold.\n\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Abby's service to the Senate covers a \nquarter of a century. Her service to the Congress runs from 1967. When \nshe became Secretary to the majority in 1987, she was the first woman \nto hold that post in the history of the Senate.\n  The Democratic caucus has been extraordinarily fortunate to have \nAbby's services for so long. It is no exaggeration to say that Abby has \nprevented more than one disaster from becoming a debacle. We, who rely \non her, know \n\n[[Page S 9411]]\n\nthat much of the Senate operation depends on her knowledge and skill in \nmaking certain that the procedural hurdles do not become roadblocks.\n  I believe the entire Senate, not just the Democratic caucus, owes \nSenator Byrd a large debt of gratitude for the fact that it was his \nexcellent judgment that first brought Abby to the floor staff in 1979 \nand the caucus 8 years later.\n  I am extremely sorry that it falls to my lot to have to announce \nAbby's retirement.\n  It is well known that the great American author, William Faulkner, \nserved as the postmaster in Oxford, MS. What is not as well known is \nwhy he decided to quit the job after many years of service, \nparticularly at a time and in a place where good, stable jobs were hard \nto come by.\n  Asked why, Faulkner replied: ``I couldn't stand for one minute longer \nbeing at the beck and call of anyone just because he has three cents in \nhis pocket.''\n  I would not want to think Abby Saffold made the decision to retire \nbecause, after 16 years, she could not stand for another minute being \nat the beck and call of anyone just because they had been elected to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  But it is a fact Abby has served Senators--and been at their beck and \ncall--for a long time. I believe I state the sentiments of Senators on \nthe Republican side as well as Members of the Democratic caucus when I \nsay that Abby has been unfailingly cheerful and helpful to Senators \nregardless of party.\n  Abby Saffold's departure is a sad day for everyone in the Senate, \nmost particularly for Senators, who have come to rely on Abby's advice, \nseek her counsel, and listen to her jokes. Somehow, because Abby served \nthe Senate so well and for so long, we had come to think she would \nalways be here for us.\n  Although many of the men and women with whom she worked elected, and \nunelected alike, may be better known to the American people than Abby, \nnot many will be more well-loved by those who know her. Few will have a \nrecord of service and integrity to match hers.\n  I have been an admirer of Abby's since my first days in the Senate. \nShe has been a good and tireless friend to me and other Members of the \nSenate. It is with great regret that I say goodby to Abby Saffold \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there's a story told about an incident that \noccurred here on the floor several years ago, when Howard Baker was \nSenate majority leader.\n  Senator Baker was leading a floor debate, while Republican and \nDemocrat Senators worked out a timetable in back of the Chamber.\n  Finally, Senator Baker could proceed no further until negotiations \nwere finished.\n  He looked to the back of the room, sized up who was involved in the \nnegotiations, and who was key to their successful conclusion, and said \nfor the record, ``We're just here waiting for Abby.''\n  He was, of course, referring to Abby Saffold, who has served as \nSecretary for the Democrat side of the aisle for more than 8 years, and \nwho served as manager of the Democrat floor staff for the 8 years prior \nto that.\n  As has been indicated by my good friend, Senator Daschle, Abby is \nretiring this Friday afternoon, after nearly three decades of service \non Capitol Hill--a career that saw her rise from serving as a \ncaseworker to a Congressman to becoming the first woman in the history \nof the Senate to occupy the post of Secretary for the majority.\n  I know I speak for all Members of the Senate in saying that she will \nbe greatly missed.\n  We spend a great deal of time here on the Senate floor. And \nfrequently, negotiations and discussions can get a bit tense. Abby has \nbeen involved in hundreds of those negotiations and discussions.\n  Even though Abby's duties here on the floor require her to look after \nthe interests of the Democrats, there has never--there has never been a \nmoment where I questioned her professionalism, fairness, or honesty.\n  And through all the discussions and debates, Abby has always \nexhibited a great deal of courtesy, and an unfailing good humor. In \nshort, as my good friend, George Mitchell, once said, ``Abby helps to \nmake our long days on the Senate floor more tolerable.''\n  I share the view expressed by my colleague, Senator Daschle, and I \nknow that all Senators join with me in wishing Abby good luck, and in \nthanking her for her service to the Senate and to America.\n  Thank you.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in paying \ntribute to Abby Safford on her retirement from the Senate. Knowing \nAbby, I can only imagine that when she leaves us, she is planning a \nfull life of travel and continued learning and challenge. Anyone \nfamiliar with her energy, sharp intelligence, political commitment and \nlove of the Senate knows she will continue to follow our activities \nwith close attention. I know all of us are going to miss her advice, \nincredible attention to our needs, her knowledge of the Senate and her \nability to help make this institution work.\n  On the eve of her retirement from the Senate I want to wish Abby the \nvery best and hope that her next 25 years will be as satisfying as \nthose she spent in the Senate, and filled with challenge, satisfaction, \nlove, and contentment. She has made an enormous contribution to this \ninstitution and the many Senators who have occupied these desks since \nshe began here many years ago, sitting in the staff gallery following \nthe Senate floor for her Senator. It is a pleasure to simply say, in \nreturn, ``Thank you, Abby.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Chick Reynolds, the \nformer Chief Reporter of Debates for the Senate. As my colleagues know, \nChick passed away earlier this month. He will be sorely missed by each \nand every one of us.\n  The Reporter of Debates is one of those unheralded jobs without which \nthis institution could not run. The Reporter is the bridge between the \nSenator and his constituents and between this institution and history. \nBy faithfully transcribing the proceedings of the Senate, the Recorder \nensures that ordinary Americans can follow the work of their elected \nrepresentatives and that historians will have an accurate record of the \ngreat debates of our time.\n  Chick Reynolds was considered one of the fastest and most accurate \nreporters in the United States. As a result, he recorded many of the \nmost momentous political events of the latter half of the twentieth \ncentury, including the McCarthy and Jimmy Hoffa hearings and President \nKennedy's famous speech in Berlin.\n  In 1974, Chick Reynolds was appointed an official reporter for the \nSenate, and he went on to become chief reporter in 1988. He served in \nthat job with distinction, and he was scheduled to retire, in fact, \nnext month.\n  I join my colleagues in extending my sympathies to Chick's wife, \nLucille, on her loss.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the order of \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that the regulatory \nreform bill will be laid down.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed as if in morning business for no more than 2 minutes for the \npurpose of introducing a bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject; may I ask, is it going to be a couple of minutes? That will be \nfine. I know Senator John Kerry has some remarks he would like to make. \nWe will put the bill in and yield to him for some remarks, if that is \nOK. And then we will go on with remarks on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerry be \npermitted to make some remarks without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. I just \nwanted to rise for a few moments to say some words about the regulatory \nreform bill, and where we find ourselves now. Then I will make further \ncomments at a later time. I thank the distinguished manager for the \nDemocrats.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that if you ask most people \nin the United States Senate, ``Do you favor regulatory reform?'' people \nare going to say, ``Yes; I am in favor of regulatory reform.'' We all \nunderstand that in the course of the last few years, regrettably, there \nhave been some excesses that every single American has come to \nunderstand. And unfortunately, because of the negativity and conflict \norientation of the press nowadays, the negative aspects of what has \nhappened in environmentalism sometimes supersedes people's perceptions \non the positive side.\n  The truth is, in America, there have been remarkable gains over the \ncourse of the last 25 years in the particulates that we breathe, and in \nthe level of our health as a consequence of better air. Today, cities \ncan literally be viewed from airplanes, and from outside the city \nwhere, this one not be the case, a decade ago if you were in Denver or \nLos Angeles given the air pollution levels and smog. There are still \nproblems, but the level is so markedly reduced from what it was that we \ntend to forget the benefits.\n  If you look all across this country, there are rivers where salmon \nhave returned and rivers that you can swim in and fish in. This was not \nthe situation a number of years ago. There has been just an incredible \nincrease in the quality of life for all Americans and the opportunities \nthat are available as a consequence of positive choices we have made \nfor the environment.\n  On the other side of the ledger, there have been some terrible \ndisasters in terms of our efforts to do better. The Superfund Program \nis a classic example of one of those efforts that has not done as well \nas intended. However, the Superfund Program is not really a reflection \nof what we need to do in regulatory reform. Yet it somehow finds its \nway into the bill that is currently on the floor.\n  Likewise, with the Toxics Release Inventory, over the years since \n1986, we have reduced over 40 percent the level of toxic releases into \nthe atmosphere. And, there again, has been an enormous gain in terms of \npeople's knowledge of what is happening in their community. That is \nall--just knowledge. That knowledge has empowered communities to make \nbetter choices and, in fact, many industries have voluntarily made \nchoices based on the fact that they knew a particular community knew \nwhat was being released into the air. People have benefited. We have \nhad an enormous reduction in the level of toxic releases. All by virtue \nof a community right-to-know program that is simply informative. All it \ndoes is let people know. It does not require a company to do anything. \nIt does not take any chemical off the market. It does not prohibit it \nfrom being sold. It does not levy any fines. There is no administrative \nprocess except reporting information to the public.\n  Yet, in this bill, there is a wholesale discarding of that particular \nprocess. It does not belong here. It should not be here.\n  Similarly, the Delaney clause, which prevents people from being \nexposed to carcinogens in food additives. This is a critical program. \nMost people agree that there have been some problems in its \nadministration, and we need to fix it. I agree, we ought to fix it. The \nLabor and Human Resources Committee and others have been working \ndiligently on a fix. They are in the process of working within the \ncommittee with jurisdiction to rework the program. Then along comes \nthis approach of just grabbing out of thin air and plunking into this \nbill what is not a fix, but an absolute eradication of the Delaney \nprotections. That does not make sense. I do not think Americans have \ncome in and said, ``Hey, expose me to a whole new set of carcinogens, \nand it really does not matter what is in my food.'' But that is the \neffect of what is in this legislation.\n  Those were the ``special fixes,'' the provisions that do not relate \nto regulatory reform and that should not be in the legislation before \nus.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I have some concerns with a number of \nprovisions in the bill that actually address regulatory issues. For \nstarters, this bill lowers the threshold for the definition of a \n``major'' role in the rulemaking process. When the EPA or another \nagency decides that something is a major rule which then affords it a \ncertain set of administrative procedures, the threshold today for a \nmajor rule is $100 million of annual economic impact. First, you have \nto make a determination that the rule will have an effect of $100 \nmillion of consequence, and then it is treated as a major rule.\n  In the bill that is on the floor, the sponsors lower that threshold \nto just $50 million. The $100 million threshold was set in 1975 by \nPresident Ford.\n  That 1975 value is worth just $35 million. It is not very hard to get \nto a $35 million current value in terms of rulemaking impact. If you \nlower that by half, to an $18 million impact, any lawyer worth his salt \ncan come in and achieve that; particularly since the definition in this \nbill allows you to take indirect costs into account, you can very \nrapidly get to a $50 million consequence.\n  What is the impact of that? Here is a bill that talks about being \nregulatory reform yet will open up a whole expanse of new rules subject \nto major rulemaking procedures which makes it then subject to court \nreview.\n  Currently, EPA spends $120 million per year to conduct risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis for major rules at the $100 \nmillion level. EPA estimates that it will need an increase of 191 \npercent to 458 percent to keep up with the increased workload. Nowadays \nthe EPA handles approximately 10 rules per year that qualify as major \nrules. Under the $50 million threshold, we are going to go to 75 major \nrules per year just for rule at the $50 million threshold. In addition, \nin this bill before us, S. 343, the Superfund is lowered even further \nto a threshold of just $10 million which will cause a minimum of an \nadditional 650 rules that need this new complex administrative \nprocedure. Every one of us knows that no one is going to come down here \nand say ``add personnel to EPA, appoint more judges, give us the people \nto achieve this and make this work.''\n  So what you have here is not just an effort to have a legitimate \nreform of a system that I acknowledge needs reform. What you have is a \ntotally calculated capacity to create gridlock within the system so the \nrules cannot be made and many of the rules on the books get eliminated.\n  Now, there are a host of other problems with S. 343. There is a \nproblem with the effective date. The effective date of this bill is \nupon enactment. The implication of this term will require going back to \nscratch and being over to develop any rules that are in the entire \nFederal Government system on that date, whatever that day may be. The \nimpact may well be enormous from meat inspection regulations to \ndrinking water protections and other things that would literally stop \nin midstream as a consequence.\n  I do not think that is the intention of the authors. However, that \nwill be the effect. These are the types of problems of which colleagues \nmust be aware. This legislation currently leaves open to question a \nnumber of concerns such as this.\n  Another very significant area is judicial review and the petition \nprocess developed in this bill. The bill before us \n\n[[Page S 9413]]\nhas at least seven different tiers to its petition process. Unless it \nhas been changed to reflect negotiations we have been having in the \nlast few days, that opens up a Pandora's box of judicial review. You \nare going to have the capacity to go on for year after year after year \nwith lawyers expending huge sums of money; this process will transform \nthe whole regulatory process into the hands of somebody who has money \nrather than an evenhanded administrative process that seeks to balance \nthe needs of the country.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize I want to have a legislative \nreform bill. I think we must. I also want to emphasize that it is \nappropriate to have cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. We \nshould be making some determination of the benefits and the costs but \nwe should not do it in a way that is so rigid that we literally deny \nourselves the ability to include certain benefits to the country; even \nif an option is not the least cost alternative it may be something we \nwant to do and we should not take away the discretion or the capacity \nof somebody to make that decision on the appropriate standards.\n  Let me give an example from the air quality standards in the Clean \nAir Act. For 25 years it has been understood that the Federal \nGovernment would base its national ambient air quality standards not on \na cost-benefit test, but on health protection standards--and I might \nadd that even after 25 years of hard work over 100 million Americans \nstill live in areas where these standards are not met. If this bill \nbecomes law, I believe that it will be virtually impossible for EPA to \nbase its standards on health protection, and it will begin an endless \ncourt process that will serve to set back.\n  Under this bill, for example, if there is an existing statute that \nhas a standard to achieve, for health reasons and other reasons, so \nmany parts per million in air emissions and it is determined that \nnumber is a minimum standard, a floor level of protection, but that the \nagency has the discretion to go to a higher level in the statute \nbecause we want to get to at least a minimum standard knowing there is \na minimum health benefit for getting to that minimum standard; and this \nminimum standards costs $10 million to achieve and it is the least cost \nalternative. Now, for $11 million, you may be able to get exponentially \nfurther in terms of public benefits, but it is not the least cost, the \nagency will not be able to go to the higher standard of benefit even if \nyou want to spend the additional resources to get the vastly greater \nlevel of benefits.\n  Under this bill, you will not be able to go to the higher standard of \nbenefit because it is not the least cost alternative--even though that \nhigher standard of benefit may give you other benefits of \nhospitalization reduction, long-term care reduction, quality of health, \na whole number of important benefits, just because it is not the least \ncost for the purposes of the underlying statute's minimum gain you \ncannot do it.\n  Now, Mr. President, in keeping with what I said to the Senator from \nOhio, I am not going to go on, and I am not going to go through a \ncomplete analysis of the bill at this time. But I think it is \nabsolutely essential that we approach this bill with a sober intention \nto legislate, not just to walk in lockstep to make happen what has come \nhere in a very hasty process.\n  The Environment Committee was bypassed. The chairman of the \nEnvironment Committee, a Republican, has signed on to an alternative \nversion of this bill with Senator Glenn, and he will talk about that. \nThe Judiciary Committee never got a chance to consider but a handful of \namendments before the bill was forced out on a procedural maneuver. \nSenators wanted to, but they were never heard or given a chance to \nconsider a vast number of amendments in committee.\n  On the other hand, the Governmental Affairs Committee sent a bill out \nby a vote of 15 to nothing, yet that bill has been ignored. And it is \nessentially that bill with a couple of minor changes that the Senator \nfrom Ohio and the Senator from Rhode Island will introduce, and I am \nglad to be a cosponsor of that, Mr. President.\n  This bill has far-reaching implications for the health and safety and \nwell-being of the United States of America. This bill should not become \na grab bag, a greed effort by a lot of people who never wanted the EPA, \nwho never wanted the Clean Air Act, never wanted the Clean Water Act, \nnever wanted the Safe Drinking Water Act, never wanted the national \nparks program, never wanted any of these efforts in the first place. \nAnd we should not allow them under the guise of regulatory reform to \nundo 25 years of progress and effort, notwithstanding I emphasize a \ngenuine need to have regulatory reform and to change the way we have \nbeen doing business in this city.\n  So I am prepared to embrace a very legitimate effort to get there. I \njoined with a number of my colleagues to meet with the Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Johnston, Senator Hatch, and others and we thought \nwe were making some progress. I think we did make some progress. It is \nmy hope that over the course of the next week we can continue that \neffort and hopefully work out the kinks in this bill in order to come \nup with a very significant vote in the Senate for regulatory reform.\n  I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Glenn, very much for his \ngracious forbearance here, and I particularly thank him for his \nleadership on this effort. He is the person who has been working for \nyears to come up with a reasonable alternative on this, and I am glad \nto be working with him on it.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his comments. \nI have noted his efforts for this legislation. He has worked tirelessly \nfor the last couple of weeks almost in trying to work something out on \nthis, and we are glad to have him with us on this. In fact, we hope to \nhave the whole Senate working with us.\n  Mr. ROTH. Some of my colleagues have questioned why I support the \nDole-Johnston compromise when the bill I originally wrote received \nunanimous support in the Committee on Governmental Affairs. The bill I \nintroduced in January, S. 291, the Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, was--\nin my opinion--a good proposal for regulatory reform. I am pleased that \nit received unanimous support from all 15 members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. But S. 291 was itself a compromise. It was, in my \nview, a good bill, but not a perfect bill.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute improves upon S. 291 in some key \nrespects, especially the use of a stronger cost-benefit test. I \nbelieve, to the extent practical, the benefits of a regulation should \njustify its costs. The pending amendment is the product of the three \ncommittees that proposed regulatory reform legislation, and many other \nSenators. It likewise may not be perfect from everyone's point of view, \nbut it is a strong effort to make Government more efficient and \neffective.\n  When you review the key provisions of S. 291, you can see they are \nreflected in the Dole-Johnston amendment. These provisions include:\n  Cost-benefit analysis: The benefits of a regulation must justify its \ncosts, unless prohibited by the underlying law authorizing the rule.\n  Market-based mechanisms and performance standards: Flexible, goal-\noriented approach are favored over rigid command-and-control \nregulation.\n  Review of existing rules: Old rules on the books must be reviewed to \nreform or eliminate outdated or irrational regulations.\n  Risk assessment: Agencies must use sound science to measure and \nquantify risks to the environment, health, or safety.\n  Comparative risk analysis: Agencies must set priorities to achieve \nthe greatest overall risk reduction at the least cost.\n  Reform of the Regulatory Flexibility Act: The Regulatory Flexibility \nAct is strengthened to make agencies more sensitive to the impact of \nregulations on small businesses and small governments.\n  Congressional review of rules: Rules will not become effective until \nthey are reviewed by Congress. Congress can veto irrational or \nineffective regulations.\n  Regulatory accounting: The Government must compile the total costs \nand benefits of major rules.\n  Most important, the Dole-Johnston amendment, like S. 291, has limited \njudicial review so agency rules will not be invalidated for minor \nprocedural missteps. But the Dole-Johnston amendment also improves upon \nS. 291 by having a more focused cost-benefit \n\n[[Page S 9414]]\ntest. Regulators must directly set regulatory standards so that the \nbenefits of a rule justify its costs, unless prohibited by the law \nauthorizing the rule. Of course, neither S. 291 or the Dole-Johnston \namendment contains a supermandate that overrides the substantive goals \nof any regulatory program.\n  The three provisions that lie at the heart of any good regulatory \nreform proposal are: First, decisional criteria, such as the cost-\nbenefit test; second, judicial review; and third, review of existing \nrules. The Dole-Johnston amendment is better on the first provision and \nequal on the second, as I have previously suggested. On the third \nprovision, review of existing rules, it is also better since the \nprovision in S. 291 has significant administrative difficulties.\n  S. 291 said that every major rule on the books had to be reviewed by \nthe appropriate agency within 10 years, plus a possible 5-year \nextension, or terminate. The basic problem with that approach is what \nconstitutes ``a rule.'' Most rules are amendments to existing programs \nwhich upon becoming effective merge into the text of the program. What \nyou have on the books are programs which have been molded by a whole \nseries of prior rules. So how can one mandate that the rules must be \nreviewed? On which page of the Code of Federal Regulations does a rule \nbegin and end? What grouping of concepts constitutes a rule? A major \nrule? When 10 years has elapsed, what exactly has terminated?\n  S. 291 meant well, but it was silent on such questions. The Dole-\nJohnston amendment, in contrast, provides a clearer alternative: the \nagency establishes a schedule of the rules to be reviewed. This list is \npublished for all to see. Only rules on that list are subject to \ntermination under the legislation.\n  In turn for its workability, however, a vulnerability arises. Suppose \nthe agency list is underinclusive, then what? The Dole-Johnston \namendment allows petitioners to request inclusion and, if denied, sue \nthe agency. However, the burden that a petitioner must meet in court is \npurposefully high, lest any agency be overwhelmed by such petitions.\n  The Dole-Johnston provision is a balanced, workable, and fair \nresolution of the thorny issue of how agencies are to review existing \nrules. It is the product of fruitful negotiations with Senators Kerry, \nLevin, Biden, Johnston, Hatch, Nickles, Murkowski, Bond, and myself.\n  In short, the Dole-Johnston amendment is the newer, better product--\nrepresenting the cumulative wisdom of months of negotiations on \ndifferent options in three committees. When we voted to report S. 291 \nfrom the Committee on Governmental Affairs last March, that version may \nwell have been the best text available. But it no longer is.\n  From the day I introduced S. 291 it has been my objective to produce \nthe best possible bill--one that achieves real reform, that passes both \nHouses, and that is signed into law. From that day I have found myself \nas the Senator in the middle, serving as a bridge between various \nopposing viewpoints. I believe that I have been able to achieve \nsignificant progress by bringing opposing sides closer together. The \npolicy gap on this legislation has closed and is closing.\n  Today Senator Dole will lay down the Dole-Johnston amendment that \nrepresents the current state of progress. Some on the other side of the \naisle have introduced a slightly modified version of S. 291. I am \nsomewhat alarmed that this is being done after substantial progress has \nbeen made in talks with Senators representing all colors of the \npolitical spectrum. I hope that their action does not indicate that \ntheir position is hardening on this legislation.\n  S. 291 was a good bill. But the Dole-Johnston amendment is an \nimprovement, thanks in part to suggestions made by those who seek to \nrally around a modification of S. 291.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, Senator Dole has made his proposals here. I \nknow he wants to make some remarks in a moment.\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I ask unanimous consent to \nyield the floor to Senator Dole, and then Senator Kassebaum has remarks \non a different subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9412-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to express my deep \nconcern about the deteriorating situation in Nigeria. And I thought it \nwas important to express my concern about what was happening there that \nhas been illustrated by the arrest and detention of General Obasanjo of \nNigeria and 23 other political prisoners. Recent reports indicate the \nmilitary dictatorship in Lagos may be trying General Obasanjo in a \nsecret tribunal on unspecified charges possibly leading to capital \nsentencing.\n  I join with President Clinton, Foreign Secretary Hurd of Great \nBritain, and much of the international community in strongly condemning \nthe arrest and continuing detention of General Obasanjo. I have known \nGeneral Obasanjo for a number of years and have long respected his \nintellect and leadership abilities. He is one of the few leaders in \nAfrican history to peacefully step down from power in favor of a \ncivilian democratic regime.\n  Despite the unbanning of political parties, I remain deeply skeptical \nabout the commitment of the Nigerian military government to a \ndemocratic transition. The continuing imprisonment of General Obasanjo \nand disregard for basic human rights and due process only reinforces \nthe mistrust of the current regime.\n  To date, I have supported the administration's policy of limited \nsanctions and diplomatic engagement in Nigeria. I believe the time is \ncoming, however, where the United States, together with our European \nallies, should consider tougher and more aggressive steps to pressuring \nthe Nigerian Government into political reform. I will chair a hearing \nof the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on July 20 to explore further options of U.S. policy.\n  Mr. President, I have long believed that Nigeria held the key to \ndevelopment of a large portion of Africa. It has been a large and rich \nand bountiful nation. It is a country with tremendous economic and \nhuman potential. It is also a country with a history of deep-seated \nethnic and religious division. For these reasons, the continuing \nintransigence of the current military leadership is particularly \ntroubling. It could lead, I fear, to further political and economic \ninstability and great tragedy in Nigeria.\n  I firmly hope, together with all friends of Nigeria, that the \nNigerian Government will move quickly toward \n\n[[Page S 9415]]\nreestablishing democratic, civilian rule. Only then can Nigeria fulfill \nits true promise and stand in its rightful place as one of the great \ncountries in Africa and the world.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank again the Senator from Ohio [Mr. \nGlenn] for yielding to me because certainly the debate on regulatory \nreform is a very important debate that needs the most thoughtful \nconsideration. I appreciate him for yielding to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I was glad to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas. I know from my days way back on the Foreign \nRelations Committee when something came up like this where there was a \ntragedy internationally and some people were suffering, no one was on \ntheir feet first ahead of her to bring this to the attention of the \nSenate, to bring it to the attention of the American people, and to try \nto do something about it. That is what needs to be, a response from the \nSenate in these areas. And once again, she is fulfilling that role \nhere. She sees a pending tragedy, which we all do, and is speaking out \nand hoping we can avert some of that tragedy.\n  I compliment the Senator on her statement.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Glenn pertaining to the introduction of S. 1001 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for not more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9414-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9415-S9418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MICROSOFT SOFTWARE RELEASE\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Although many in Congress and legions across the country \nwill be on vacation in August, Microsoft people will be working \novertime to make sure that their long-awaited new operating system \nsoftware for personal computers is officially released as scheduled on \nAugust 24.\n  The company is convinced that Windows 95 will help make personal \ncomputers significantly easier to operate, more fun, and more \nproductive for millions of Americans.\n  On that same day, Miscrosoft plans to launch a new online information \nservice, the Miscrosoft Network, as a competitor to existing online \nservices like America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy.\n  Microsoft is not alone in anxiously awaiting August 24 in this new \nproduct and online service. As the Wall Street Journal reported \nrecently, hundreds of other computer hardware companies, equipment \nmanufacturers, and independent software developers and content \nproviders all stand to benefit enormously from the introduction of \nWindows 95 Microsoft Network. The Journal speculated much of the \ncontinued growth of the high technology economy and the overall stock \nmarket is tied to the timely and successful launch of this online \nservice.\n  It is not surprising, therefore, that several commentators have \nquestioned the Department of Justice's belated investigation of \nMicrosoft's decision to include access software for the Microsoft \nNetwork as a feature of Windows 95, a decision announced last year.\n  I share the commentators' concern with the timing of this \ninvestigation, and hope that this 11th hour investigation will not \ndelay the introduction of Microsoft's much anticipated software, an \nintroduction that will increase both consumer choice and competition.\n  In the event my colleagues missed the articles, I ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 19, 1995]\n\nWall Street Anxiously Awaits Microsoft's Windows 95--System's Reception \n                  May Affect Stocks for Months to Come\n\n                            (By Dave Kansas)\n\n       It's the second-hottest topic on Wall Street after interest \n     rates, a driving force that could well influence the course \n     of the stock market for months to come.\n       What's the big deal? Windows 95.\n       With so-called beta test sites littered across the country, \n     anxiety about the late-August launch of Microsoft's new \n     operating system is intensifying. Questions about the \n     software are sweeping through Wall Street, and for a market \n     that discounts future news months early, investors are \n     already betting on the answers. Will it arrive on time? Will \n     it work? Who will benefit? Who will lose?\n       The Windows 95 operating system has become the most \n     important product introduction in decades for the stock \n     market. With the technology sector firmly in the forefront of \n     the six-month-old stock-market rally, the success of the \n     program has taken on immense significance, becoming in \n     essence the linchpin of the market's future direction.\n       A bad stumble by Microsoft in launching the product would \n     spill into the technology group and then ripple through the \n     rest of the market with dismal effect. But a successful roll-\n     out will spur another cycle of technology upgrades. That \n     means personal-computer purchases, demand for more powerful \n     semiconductors, a plethora of new software and other \n     products. If it works, the entire technology sector will get \n     a lift and that, in turn, will take the broad market higher \n     into record territory.\n       ``This is big-time important, and not just for Microsoft,'' \n     says Robert Doll, executive vice president at Oppenheimer and \n     head of the Oppenheimer Growth Fund, a big holder of \n     Microsoft stock.``If Microsoft were to announce that they \n     were having big problems and they'd have to put off the \n     introduction for more than two months, then we'd have a \n     problem not just with Microsoft, but throughout the sector.''\n       One reason for the nervous anticipation of Windows 95 is \n     the technology sector's uninterrupted rise this year. \n     Traditionally, the technology group has experienced a \n     correction in the late spring or early summer. That \n     correction has yet to occur, creating anxiety among some \n     analysts who figure tech stocks have risen too-far too fast.\n       But other analysts argue that expectations of a successful \n     Windows 95 introduction late this summer has helped the group \n     defy history and avoid the annual pullback, thereby upping \n     the stakes for the product's introduction.\n       Microsoft insists that Windows 95 remains on track. But the \n     path leading to introduction hasn't been smooth. Originally \n     code-named Chicago, the product was first expected to arrive \n     late last year. That was postponed and the delay extended to \n     mid-1995, and now to late August.\n       According to the company, final versions of the operating \n     systems will reach hardware makers in the next several weeks. \n     Industry insiders say Microsoft has managed to jawbone \n     computer makers into including Windows 95 personal computers, \n     to be shipped for the crucial Christmas shopping season.\n       The importance of Windows 95 stems from the intricate \n     interrelationship of products and companies in the personal \n     computer sector. Windows 95, in many ways, is the equivalent \n     of a brand-new engine that many new cars will require. In \n     turn, other companies make products akin to doors, tires, \n     frames, windshield wipers, brakes and lights. Dataquest, a \n     market research firm, projects sales of nearly 30 million \n     copies of Windows 95 in the first four months, not to mention \n     an increase in personal-computer purchases.\n       ``It's believed that Windows 95 will increase the number of \n     personal computers sold by a large number, especially in the \n     home, because it makes games and entertainment software more \n     accessible,'' says Irfan Ali, an analyst with Massachusetts \n     Financial Services in Boston. ``There's no question that \n     Windows 95 is the key to another wave of product upgrades in \n     the personal-computer area, and that's key for not only for \n     Microsoft, but for the whole sector.''\n       Indeed, more than 500 mutual funds own chunks of Microsoft, \n     and are, in a sense, wagering on Windows 95. Among them are \n     such big names as Fidelity Magellan, Janus Twenty and \n     Twentieth Century Ultra, according to recent industry data.\n       For Microsoft, a successful Windows 95 introduction already \n     is largely reflected in the price of its stock, money \n     managers say. Trading at a whopping 36 times earnings, many \n     investors are already counting on Windows 95 to provide the \n     Redmond, Wash., software company with another leg of \n     explosive growth. Even the unraveling of its bid to purchase \n     Intuit, a maker of popular finance software such as Quicken, \n     has failed to halt Microsoft's stock rise.\n     But analysts say other areas of the market still represent \n     value to those looking to bet on Window 95. Among them, big \n     semiconductor firms such as Intel, Texas Instruments and \n     Advanced Micro Devices. Also, makers of the computers that \n     would use the new operating system: Compaq Computer, Dell \n     Computer and Gateway 2000.\n       ``As investments, Compaq and other hardware companies don't \n     yet reflect the big surge that is likely if Windows 95 \n     succeeds,'' says Roger McNamee of Integral Capital Partners \n     in Menlo Park, Calif. ``If you want to look at bang-for-your-\n     buck, the hardware area will likely be a better sector.''\n       Perhaps the largest fear would be any unexpected problems \n     with the new generation operating system. And some money \n     managers, like Oppenheimer's Mr. Doll, concede that Windows \n     95 could face a modest delay, which the market could swallow. \n     Anything more serious, however, would be a setback.\n       ``Any disappointments could hit the rest of the personal-\n     computer industry, and that could make people rethink the \n     whole technology sector,'' says Neil Hokanson, president of \n     Hokanson Financial Management in \n\n[[Page S 9416]]\n     Encinitas, Calif. ``Whatever happens with Windows 95, we're going to \n     see a significant ripple effect throughout the whole market. \n     It will affect the whole food chain.''\n       One possible stumbling block for Windows 95 is the Justice \n     Department's concern about Windows 95 inclusion of the \n     Microsoft Network, the software maker's own on-line network. \n     Competitors such as America Online complain that Microsoft's \n     inclusion of the on-line network in the operating-system \n     software is anticompetitive. Many analysts think time is too \n     short for the Justice Department to prevent Microsoft from \n     rolling out Windows 95 without the network.\n       Even if Microsoft shakes the department's inquiry, and does \n     get Windows 95 out in time, that still doesn't guarantee \n     success.\n       The big ``question is whether people upgrade to Windows 95 \n     immediately, or do it over time,'' says Frederick J. Ruvkun, \n     a money manager at Bessemer Trust in New York. ``It could \n     happen right away, or it may take a little while. But in any \n     case, this product is the key event for the industry, and the \n     market.''\n\n\n                         friday market activity\n\n       Stocks mustered modest early gains built mostly on trading \n     related to the expiration of options and futures. Equities \n     then settled into a listless session and finished narrowly \n     ahead.\n       The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 2.71, or \n     0.50%, to 539.83. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index \n     gained 1.20, or 0.42%, to 289.96. The Dow Jones Equity Market \n     Index added 2.55, or 0.50%, to 507.15.\n       The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 5.97, or 0.66%, to \n     908.65, while the American Stock Exchange Market Value Index \n     climbed 0.68, or 0.14%, to 495,40.\n       For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 86.80, \n     or 1.96%. The S 500 gained 11.89, or 2.25%. The Nasdaq \n     Composite shot up 24.26, or 2.74%.\n       Many telecommunications and media companies posted gains on \n     enthusiasm for the new telecommunications-deregulation \n     legislation working its way through Congress.\n       Capital Cities/ABC rose 3\\1/4\\ to 106, Clear Channel \n     Communications added 4\\5/8\\ to 69 and Time Warner gained 1\\1/\n     2\\ to 40\\5/8\\%.\n       Among telecommunications companies, Ameritech advanced \\7/\n     8\\ to 46\\1/4\\, Bell Atlantic moved up 1\\1/2\\% to 57 and \n     BellSouth climbed 1\\1/8\\ to 63\\7/8\\.\n       Microsoft jumped 2\\1/8\\ to 87 on Nasdaq after a federal \n     appeals court held that a lower court judge shouldn't have \n     rejected the Justice Department's antitrust settlement with \n     the software maker over software-discounting practices.\n       Caremark International advanced 1\\7/8\\ to 21\\7/8\\. The home \n     health-care services provider reached a settlement with \n     criminal investigators that will end an inquiry into \n     kickbacks. The company agreed to plead guilty and pay about \n     $159 million in civil damages and criminal fines. In the wake \n     of the news, Rodman & Renshaw raised its rating on the \n     company to ``buy'' from ``neutral.''.\n\n                    Who May Benefit From Windows 95\n\n       CompUSA (CPU)--Computer superstore retailer should see a \n     pickup in traffic with customers looking for the Windows 95 \n     upgrade.\n       Integrated Silicon Solutions (ISS)--As Windows 95 requires \n     more memory, conputer makers will likely be placing orders \n     with this SRAM memory-chip maker.\n       Symantec (SYMC)--Windows 95 users will need new utilities \n     (such as backup and virus-protection programs) from Symantec, \n     which controls 75% of software-utilities market.\n       Diamond Multimedia (DIMD)--Graphics-broad and multimedia-\n     chip maker will see more orders as consumers want to take \n     advantage of all of Windows 95 capabilities.\n       Microcom (MNPI)--More consumers will want high-end modems \n     and communications products for faster on-line service \n     (particularly if Windows 95 comes with Microsoft Network).\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Windows 95--Successful Launch Would Be a Boon to Dozens of Firms\n\n                            (By Molly Baker)\n\n       Microsoft's Windows 95 may create a tidal wave in the \n     technology and financial markets, but investors looking to \n     profit by it should search among the ripples.\n       Certainly no one should underestimate the significance of \n     the new operating system, scheduled to be shipped on Aug. 24, \n     less than 10 weeks from now.\n       ``This is a broad infrastructure change that will have \n     ramifications not seen before,'' proclaims Chris Galvin, a \n     software analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. ``This is not your \n     normal upgrade cycle; it is a very significant event.''\n       Obviously, Microsoft has the most to gain or lose from \n     Windows 95 and its price already reflects that. But changes \n     the system will bring--providing, of course, that it is \n     successful--will be a boon to dozens of other companies.\n\n\n                             replacing pc's\n\n       Consider, for instance, that the new operating system \n     probably will make obsolete many of the personal computers \n     sold in the past decade. The sheer number of people who will \n     be seeking to replace or upgrade their existing PCs suggests \n     that computer retailers like CompUSA will be mobbed.\n       ``With its ease of use, [Windows 95] will also draw new \n     users to computers for the first time. It's likely to be one \n     incredible Christmas season,'' says Shelton Swei, a \n     technology analyst and portfolio manager at Fred Alger \n     Management.\n       ``Because CompUSA is more on the consumer side, they will \n     benefit from the consumers' quick adoption rate,'' says Mr. \n     Swei. ``They'll get traffic from people in the stores getting \n     the upgrade and those people just might pick up a game or two \n     at the same time.''\n       Wholesale distributors such as Tech Data and Merisel can \n     also expect burgeoning orders for both hardware and software. \n     They are two of the largest middlemen that put computer \n     equipment and supplies from the major manufacturers on the \n     shelves of retailers.\n\n\n                           utilities programs\n\n       Along with Windows 95, consumers will also be snapping up \n     new utilities programs, such as virus protection and hard-\n     drive backup tools, as the old set won't work Windows 95. \n     Many money managers are betting on Symantec, which controls \n     about 75% of the utilities market.\n       ``Our logic with Symantec is real simple. Once [Windows 95] \n     gets released, the utilities upgrades will be pervasive, just \n     like when Windows 3.0 was introduced,'' says Edward Antoian, \n     a portfolio manager with Philadelphia-based Delaware \n     Management.\n       Than there are the memory makers. Windows 95 will gobble up \n     memory, requiring at least eight megabytes of random-access \n     memory, or RAM, to run its various tools. Most consumers have \n     been buying computers with just four megabytes of RAM and \n     will be turning to the memory providers for upgrades.\n       ``I think eight megabytes of RAM will be underpowered, and \n     most are going to be looking for 16 megabytes,'' predicts \n     Charles F. Boucher, a semiconductor analyst with Hambrecht & \n     Quist.\n       Although the big RAM makers such as Micron and Texas \n     Instruments are the obvious names, smaller companies could \n     profit from the memory demand.\n       ``When it comes to Windows 95, anyone selling anything \n     remotely related to memory will benefit--because you'll need \n     it,'' comments Lise Buyer, an analyst with T. Rowe Price's \n     Science and Technology Fund.\n       Integrated Silicon Solutions, which makes the higher \n     performance SRAM memory circuits, is already producing at \n     capacity and orders are expected to increase. The Sunnyvale, \n     Calif., company's shares, which rose \\1/4\\ to 51 Friday on \n     the Nasdaq Stock Market, have soared from an initial offering \n     price of 13 in February.\n       Another 1995 IPO that might ride Windows 95 to bigger gains \n     is Oak Technology, a maker of semiconductors and software \n     specifically for multimedia applications. Multimedia is \n     supposed to be one of Windows 95's especially strong suits. \n     Oak's stock has been rising in tandem with consumer demand \n     for CD-ROM-equipped computers. Shares have more than doubled \n     since Oak's first-quarter IPO at 14 a share to Friday's close \n     of 34\\1/4\\, up 3\\1/4\\.\n       Once armed with the latest turbocharged computers and the \n     new operating system, consumers will turn to software \n     developers to write more advanced multimedia titles to take \n     advantage of that power. To hear and see all of the bells and \n     whistles of the new programs, computer makers and consumers \n     will be loading their PCs with all kinds of graphic \n     accelerator chips and boards.\n\n\n                             soaring shares\n\n       A number of smaller companies specialize in the graphic \n     chips market, and their stocks have been soaring this year. \n     S3 has more than doubled this year, closing Friday at 34\\5/\n     8\\, down 1. Trident Microsystems has gained 64% this year to \n     close at $19.25 a share on Friday, up \\1/2\\, while Chips & \n     Technologies, which focuses on the portable PC market, has \n     gained 55% since January to end last week at $11.125, up 1.\n       S3 got an added boost last week when Compaq Computer said \n     it would use an S3-produced multimedia chip package in one of \n     its PC lines. Following the announcement, S3 said it was \n     comfortable with analysts' sales estimates for the year of \n     $300 million, compared with $140 million in 1994.\n       The second quarter played host to two hot IPOs of companies \n     which make boards combining the various graphics and \n     multimedia chips. Diamond Multimedia Systems and Number Nine \n     Visual Technology should both get a boost from consumers who \n     want to upgrade their capabilities without buying a new \n     computer.\n       In addition to selling the boards, Number Nine also makes \n     its own high-end 128-bit graphics card--enabling computing to \n     run at near Mach speeds compared with the current 16-bit \n     standard and Windows 95's breakthrough 32-bit capabilities.\n       ``It's a small market right now, but that's where a lot of \n     the growth will be coming from in the next few years,'' says \n     Brad Hoopman, a technology analyst with Philadelphia-based \n     PNC Small Cap Growth Fund.\n       With increased memory and the speed of the new system, more \n     consumers will be turning to the Internet for entertainment \n     and information. They might need high-performance modems made \n     by Microcom and U.S. Robotics.\n       One warning from the analysts: Software makers that aren't \n     ready for Windows 95 when it arrives could be in for some \n     hard times. They recommend evaluating software stocks in \n     light of their ability to offer Windows 95 products.\n       ``Clearly it's something that has to be thought of in the \n     overall investment equation,'' advises Fred Alger's Mr. Swei. \n     ``When \n\n[[Page S 9417]]\n     considering the technology stocks, you've got to think about whether \n     the product can complete or will it just become irrelevant'' \n     in the post-Windows 95 world.\n\n\n                         friday market activity\n\n       The week ended with the small-capitalization stock rally \n     intact.

It's called the ``public interest.''\n       Antitrust laws are, allegedly, about the government's job \n     to protect you and me--the ``public''--from big, bad \n     monopolies that charge higher prices for basic goods and \n     annihilate any of their would-be competitors.\n       The federal government is clearly trying to establish a \n     principle that Microsoft is a ``monopoly''--in the ever-\n     changing computer world.\n       Justice may still revive its 5-year-old antitrust suit \n     against Microsoft. It killed off Microsoft's bid to acquire \n     Intuit. And the government is scrutinizing Microsoft's entry \n     into on-line services (competing against Vienna-based America \n     Online and others) later this summer.\n       But there is something very, very wrong about all of this \n     monopoly-busting activity. What's missing is that funny \n     little principle at the heart of the antitrust laws--the need \n     to protect the ``public interest.''\n       Ignore the Justice Department's--and U.S. District Judge \n     Stanley Sporkin's--cyberspeak nonsense about how Microsoft \n     rules the software world with an iron fist. They don't know \n     what they're talking about.\n       The truth is that the public is being served--with better \n     products, more of them and cheaper prices--right now in the \n     cutthroat world of software development.\n       The software industry is exploding with growth, and the \n     consuming public is being served by this. Microsoft is \n     playing a central role in this, to be sure, but not the only \n     role.\n       IBM is buying Lotus, for crying out loud. That purchase \n     alone tells the world that competition is very much alive in \n     the software industry.\n       It's IBM, by the way, that controls more of the software \n     market world-wide--not Microsoft. IBM holds 14.6 percent of \n     the global software market, compared with just 6.2 percent \n     for Microsoft. And other computer companies, such as Novell, \n     Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Digital, own significant software \n     market shares worldwide as well.\n       No, despite Justice's protests, the software industry is \n     growing and competing right off the charts--and the pubic is \n     being served.\n       Software is the fastest-growing industry in the United \n     States. It grew by 270 percent between 1982 and 1992. In \n     1994, $77 billion of software was sold worldwide, an increase \n     of 11 percent over 1993. And it will likely grow another 10 \n     to 15 percent again in 1995.\n       Is Microsoft responsible for all of this growth? And, in \n     the process, is it pushing players out of the marketplace, \n     dominating competitors, gouging consumers by running up \n     prices and generally skewing software industry practices? \n     Nope.\n       There are three times as many independent software vendors \n     today as there were five years ago. Eight of the top 10 \n     software industry growth leaders are new to the industry \n     charts this year.\n       Many of these software companies are experiencing \n     astronomical growth rates. A company called Shapeware, for \n     instance, grew 2,444 percent last year. Others, such as \n     Interplay, MicroHelp and Citrix Systems, grew by more than \n     100 percent.\n       But that's the industry. What of consumers? Are they hurt \n     or helped by Microsoft? What's happened to their choices as \n     Microsoft has gotten bigger and better?\n       The answer is that Microsoft and its thousands of small and \n     large competitors now offer consumers a dizzying array of \n     choices. Today, software is more powerfully, easier to use \n     and costs less than in years past. That trend is the result \n     of fierce competition, not a monopoly.\n       In 1986, the state-of-the-art microprocessing chip could \n     process information at about 3 ``millions of instruction'' \n     (MIPS) per second. Today, Intel's Pentium chip processes at \n     100 MIPS.\n       Multimedia computers cost more than $4,000 several years \n     ago. Today, you can buy a state-of-the-art multimedia \n     computer with a Pentium chip for less than $2,000.\n       And what about the area where Microsoft has the most direct \n     ``monopoly''--in sales of operating systems? Early versions \n     of the DOS operating system once sold for $100. Today, you \n     can buy Microsoft's vaunted MS-DOS and Windows together for \n     the same price. Consumers are hardly being gouged there.\n       Are software companies being killed off in this fierce \n     price-cutting atmosphere, which might lead Justice to believe \n     Microsoft is cutting prices to drive competitors away? Nope. \n     Among the top 100 software companies in the United States, \n     the ones with the most competitive consumer prices also saw \n     the greatest revenue growth. As a group, these top 100 grew \n     by 25 percent last year.\n       And what about choices? Are consumers being denied choices \n     by big, bad Microsoft? Nope. There were fewer than 200 CD-ROM \n     titles available to consumers in 1993. Today, there are more \n     than 2,000 titles. And consumers can choose from about 31,000 \n     packaged software products today. Most of them didn't exist a \n     few years ago.\n       So never mind all the fireworks and histrionics from \n     competitors and related industries that are worried about \n     Microsoft, and that have persuaded the federal government to \n     target Bill Gates and his vaunted empire. Just ask consumers \n     if the ``public interest'' is being served by antitrust \n     harassment of Microsoft. The answer is clearly ``no.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        [From Upside, July 1995]\n\n                                Bad Boy\n\n                             (By Eric Nee)\n\n       In the eyes of much of the high-technology community, Bill \n     Gates is well on his way to entering the rogues' gallery. \n     There he will join the ranks of other business executives who \n     have used their power and wealth for evil intent, such as the \n     fictional banker Mr. Potter in the movie ``It's a Wonderful \n     Life'' and Mr. Burns in the TV show ``The Simpsons,'' or the \n     real-life John D. Rockefeller and Michael Milken.\n       Demonizing successful business executives is part of a long \n     tradition in the United States. As a nation, we have always \n     been schizophrenic in our attitude toward wealth. We pride \n     ourselves on being a nation of risk-takers and entrepreneurs, \n     yet are suspicious of anyone who really succeeds.\n       If that's all there was to the attacks on Gates, we \n     wouldn't have that much to worry about. As they say, ``It \n     comes with the territory.''\n       But the attacks on Gates are more insidious. By appealing \n     to the legal powers of the federal government, Microsoft's \n     competitors are trying to stop the company from extending its \n     reach into any new area. If successful, this effort would not \n     only emasculate one of the country's premier high-tech \n     companies, but establish legal precedents that could be used \n     to stop other companies from entering new businesses as well.\n       The first battle was won by those aligned against \n     Microsoft, when they were able to get the company to drop its \n     attempted acquisition of Intuit. Gates beat a hasty retreat \n     on the issue, hoping to avoid a drawn-\n\n[[Page S 9418]]\n     out battle with the Justice Department. But he is likely to find that \n     instead of declaring victory and going home, Justice will \n     pursue him into the next arena, Microsoft Network.\n       Microsoft's foes argue that the company would have an \n     unfair advantage in on-line services if it is allowed to \n     bundle Microsoft Network with Windows 95. As an alternative, \n     they want Justice to force Microsoft to unbundle the two \n     products or offer other on-line services alongside Network on \n     the operating system.\n       A central issue in the debate is whether Microsoft's \n     dominance of the PC operating system should prevent it from \n     moving into new markets or from adding functionality to the \n     OS. Those who argue that Microsoft should be restrained, a \n     view championed by Gary Reback's White Paper, claim to be \n     taking a dynamic view of the computer market based on \n     leverage and future change. In fact, they are taking a very \n     static view that projects the present into the future.\n       Microsoft's opponents believe a fixed line can be drawn \n     between the operating system and other applications, but it \n     is natural and preferable for the OS to absorb new features \n     as they become standard. Technology is not static.\n       Microsoft opponents also say that the company's dominance \n     of operating systems gives it leverage to move into adjacent \n     markets, such as on-line services, and dominate those as \n     well. Again this is a static view of the industry. On-line \n     services such as CompuServe and America Online may indeed go \n     down in flames, but if they do it is more likely to be \n     because of the growing popularity of the World Wide Web than \n     because of Microsoft bundling Network and Windows 95. In \n     fact, Microsoft Network may be dead on arrival because of the \n     growing popularity of the WWW.\n       If Microsoft's foes succeed, other companies had better \n     watch out. Intel may be told that it cannot push native \n     signal processing because of its dominance of \n     microprocessors. Novell may be told it cannot offer \n     networking enhancements to its applications suite because of \n     its dominance of LAN OSes. And Netscape may be told to drop \n     its home page because of its dominance of WWW browsers. Let's \n     put our trust in the market, not in illogical, artificial \n     constraints.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      [From PC Week, June 5, 1995]\n\n                Despite Appearances, Is the DOJ All Wet?\n\n                            (By Stan Gibson)\n\n       Watching big, bad Microsoft ``lose one'' and the Clinton \n     administration ``win one'' has got to make all those who \n     favor the underdog happy.

Perhaps they should. Microsoft's--almost Novell's--\n     Money has never needed more help competing than it does now.\n       What about other software makers that gain, for a few \n     years, a stranglehold on a given market? Lotus' 1-2-3 at one \n     time was a near-monopoly. Should Ashton-Tate have been broken \n     up in 1986?\n       Notes had the groupware arena all to itself until recently. \n     Meantime, Lotus was attempting to leverage one of its \n     monopoly products, Notes, with the E-mail market leader, \n     cc:Mail, which it acquired without complaint.\n       Now that Lotus has had an embarrassing quarterly loss, does \n     it deserve federal help in restraining its Redmond rival?\n       Maybe this means it is all right to have a monopoly, as \n     long as you are small, incompetent, or both.\n       If Intuit is not to be broken up, who could buy it? Could \n     Novell? Would Novell be judged sufficiently incompetent that \n     it could not cobble together any meaningful synergy between \n     its NetWare, WordPerfect, TCP/IP, Unix, and network-\n     management wares?\n       The big question is whether the Justice Department can \n     practically regulate the software industry, an industry that \n     is vastly different from the big oil, railroads, or even the \n     IBM of the 1970s, that it once grappled with.\n       The single most apparent fact of the computer industry is \n     that today's market-share leader is tomorrow's loser.\n       Trying to level the playing field through legal maneuvering \n     is too cumbersome a procedure for today's markets, where \n     innovation and risk-taking can bring about surprising \n     reversals.\n       Maybe the fact that Microsoft will not own Intuit is for \n     the best. But where will the Justice Department act in the \n     future? It is highly speculative to say that, because a \n     company has been successful in the past, it is likely to \n     dominate a market such as electronic commerce that has barely \n     come into being.\n       We can't help but think that the Justice Department is \n     trying to create legal order that, like sand castles built \n     near the water's edge, will be gone in the next tide.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9415-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9418-S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE RULE OF LAW--GRADUATION ADDRESS BY BILL GOULD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last month, Bill Gould, chairman of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, addressed the graduating class of the \nOhio State University College of Law. In his address, Chairman Gould \nspeaks eloquently of the important role that public service has played \nin the Nation's history, from President Franklin Roosevelt's creation \nof the Civilian Conservation Corps through President Kennedy's creation \nof the Peace Corps and President Clinton's establishment last year of \nthe National and Community Service Trust.\n  It is gratifying that so many young men and women in all parts of the \ncountry are considering careers in public service.

Beardsley, Professor of Law, Stanford Law School (On \n     Leave); delivered at the Ohio State University College of Law \n graduation ceremony, May 14, 1995, Mershon Auditorium, the Ohio State \n                       University, Columbus, OH)\n       Ladies and gentlemen. Members of the faculty. Honored \n     guests. I am indeed honored to be with you here today in \n     Columbus and to have the opportunity to address the graduates \n     of this distinguished College of Law School as well as their \n     parents, relatives, and friends on this most significant rite \n     of passage. Looking backward 34 years to June 1961, my own \n     law school graduation day was certainly one of the most \n     important and memorable in my life. It was the beginning of a \n     long involvement in labor and employment law as well as civil \n     rights and international human rights.\n       But I confess that today I am hardly able to recall any of \n     the wise words of advice that the graduation speaker imparted \n     to us that shining day at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New \n     York. So, as I address you today I don't have any illusions \n     that what I say is likely to change the course of your lives. \n     But my hope is that my story will provide some context \n     relevant to the professional pathways upon which your are \n     about to embark.\n       Both governmental service and the furtherance of the rule \n     of law by the legal profession have possessed a centrality \n     and thus constituted abiding themes in my professional life. \n     I hope that my remarks to you here today will induce some of \n     you to consider government as an option at some point in your \n     careers, notwithstanding the anti-government tenor of these \n     times.\n       The tragedy of Oklahoma City has dramatized the \n     contemporary vulnerability of these values to sustained \n     attack, both verbal and violent. As the New York Times said \n     last month, we must ``confront the reality that over the past \n     few years the language of politics has become infected with \n     violent words and a mindset of animosity toward the \n     institutions of government.'' The columnist Mark Shields has \n     noted that this phenomenon has been fueled by the idea that \n     the ``red scare'' should give way to the ``fed scare.''\n       My own view is that government does best when it intervenes \n     to help those in genuine need of assistance--but I am aware \n     that those point does not enjoy much popularity in Congress \n     these days. Again Shields, in discussing recent comments of \n     Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, put it well when he \n     characterized the conservative view of the nation's problem: \n     ``The problem with the Poor is that they have too much money; \n     the problem with the Rich is that they have too little.''\n       Although I cannot recall the Great Depression and its \n     desperate circumstances, a trilogy of values have always made \n     up my inner core. The first of these is the idea that I heard \n     in Long Branch, New Jersey's St. James' Episcopal Church \n     every Sunday, i.e., that it is our duty to live by the \n     Comfortable Words and to help those who ``travail and are \n     heavy laden.'' Fused together with this was a belief, \n     inculcated by my parents, that the average person needs some \n     measure of protection against both the powerful and \n     unexpected adversity. The third was based upon personal \n     exposure to the indignity of racial discrimination which \n     consigned my parents' generation to a most fundamental denial \n     of equal opportunity. It is this trilogy of values which \n     fostered my philosophical allegiance to the New Deal, the New \n     Frontier and the Great Society.\n\n[[Page S 9419]]\n\n       Simply put, I came to the law and Cornell Law School \n     because of my view that law and lawyers can reduce arbitrary \n     inequities and the fact that Chief Justice Earl Warren's May \n     17, 1954, opinion for a unanimous Supreme Court in Brown v. \n     Board of Education represented an accurate illustration of \n     that point. As you know, the holding was that separate but \n     equal was unconstitutional in public education.\n       A unanimous Court rendered that historic decision--in some \n     sense a corollary to President Harry Truman's desegregation \n     of the Armed Forces--which possessed sweeping implications \n     for all aspects of American society. The High Court's ruling \n     prompted a new focus upon fair treatment in general and \n     discrimination based upon such arbitrary considerations as \n     sex, age, religion, sexual orientation and disabilities in \n     particular.\n       As a high school senior reading of NAACP Counsel Thurgood \n     Marshall's courageous efforts throughout the South--and one \n     who was heavily influenced by the Democratic Party's \n     commitment to civil rights platforms in 1948 and 1952, as \n     well as President Truman's insistence upon comprehensive \n     medical insurance--I thought that the legal profession was \n     one in which the moral order of human rights was relevant. \n     The prominence of lawyers in political life, like Adlai \n     Stevenson who ``talked sense'' to the American people, was \n     also a factor in my choice of the law as a career.\n       More than anything else, though, the struggle in South \n     Africa made me see the connection between the development of \n     the rule of law and dealing with injustice. I watched the \n     United Nations focus its attention upon that country when a \n     young lawyer named Nelson Mandela and so many other brave \n     activists were imprisoned, or, worse yet, tortured or killed \n     for political reasons. My very first publication was a review \n     of Alan Paton's ``Hope for South Africa'' in ``The New \n     Republic'' in September 1959. In the early 1990s I had the \n     privilege to meet Mr. Mandela twice in South Africa--and then \n     to attend President Mandela's inauguration just a year ago in \n     Pretoria.\n       The Brown ruling, its judicial and legislative progeny and \n     the inspiration of lawyers dedicated to principles and \n     practicality--lawyers like Marshall, Mandela, Stevenson and \n     President Lincoln in the fiery storm of our own Civil War--\n     promoted my belief in the rule of law. And the fact is that \n     my faith in the law as a vehicle for change has been \n     reinforced and realized over these many years through the \n     opportunities that I have had to work in private practice, \n     teaching and government service.\n       My sense is that there is a great opportunity for lawyers \n     to serve the public good through the public service today--\n     even in this period of government bashing by the 104th \n     Congress. More than three decades ago President John F. \n     Kennedy called upon the sense of a ``greater purpose'' in a \n     speech at the University of Michigan when he advocated the \n     creation of the Peace Corps during the 1960 campaign. \n     President Bill Clinton's National and Community Service Trust \n     Act (AmeriCorps), designed to allow young people tuition \n     reimbursements for community service, echoes the same spirit \n     of commitment set forth by President Kennedy--and at an \n     earlier point by President Franklin D. Roosevelt through the \n     Civilian Conservation Corps.\n       This sense of idealism and purpose was at work in the New \n     Deal which brought so many bright, public spirited young \n     people to Washington committed and dedicated to the reform of \n     our social, economic and political institutions. The same \n     spirit has been rekindled by both President Kennedy as well \n     as President Bill Clinton since the arrival of this \n     Administration in Washington almost two-and-one-half-years \n     ago.\n       In a sense, this has come about by virtue of the Clinton \n     Administration's commitment--not only to child immunization \n     initiatives and helping the less financially able to use \n     available education opportunities and to provide a higher \n     minimum wage to those who are in economic distress--but also, \n     most particularly, through the National Service.\n       You have an unparralleled opportunity in the `90s to serve \n     the public good. Your course offering which includes Social \n     and Environmental Litigation, Right of Privacy, Society, \n     Deviance and the Law, Foreign Relations Law, Employment \n     Discrimination Law and Law of Politics, to mention a few, \n     reflect our times and provide you with a framework that my \n     contemporaries never possessed.\n       Though most of my words today are focused upon government \n     or public service as a career or part of a career, the fact \n     is that your commitment to the public interest and the rule \n     of law can be realized in a number of forms. It is vital to \n     the public interest that those committed to it are involved \n     in a wide variety of legal, business and social careers--\n     representing, for instance, corporations, unions, as well as \n     public interest organizations.\n       But our commitment to law and the public interest is made \n     more difficult given the fact that our legal profession is in \n     the midst of a tumultuous and confusing environment. On the \n     one hand, lawyer bashing, sometimes justified and sometimes \n     not, seems to be moving full steam ahead. Part of this \n     phenomenon seems to be attributable to the fear that the \n     production of so many law students will soon result in too \n     many lawyers for a society's own good.\n       Only two years ago a ``National Law Journal'' poll showed \n     that only five percent of parents, given the choice of \n     several professions, wanted their children to be attorneys. \n     Undoubtedly, this unpopularity is what has fueled a number of \n     the legal initiatives undertaken by the Republican Congress \n     to the effect, for instance, that the loser in litigation \n     should pay all costs, that caps be devised for punitive \n     damages, etc.\n       A 1993 ABA poll comparing public attitudes toward nine \n     professions ranked lawyers third from the bottom, ranking \n     higher than only stockbrokers and politicians in popularity. \n     In attempting to discover the reasons for the low public \n     opinion of lawyers the poll asked what percentage of lawyers \n     and of five other occupations lack the ethical standards and \n     honesty to serve the public.\n       The results revealed an appalling ethical image of lawyers. \n     Lawyer ranked well below accountants, doctors and bankers and \n     barely above auto mechanics. According to the ABA poll half \n     of the public thinks one-third or more of lawyers are \n     dishonest, including one in four Americans who believe that a \n     majority of lawyers are dishonest. The pollster concluded \n     that ``the legal profession must do some soul searching about \n     the status quo, resolve to make some sacrifices to ensure a \n     positive future, and, above all, clean up its own house.''\n       One way for the profession to clean its own house is to \n     find new substitutes for lengthy litigation, frequently both \n     wasteful and unnecessarily acrimonious, such as alternative \n     dispute resolution--particularly in my own area of employment \n     law. More than a decade ago I chaired a Committee of the \n     California State Bar which recommended that new methods be \n     devised for many employment cases, and that where employees \n     could have access to economical and expeditious procedures, \n     it was appropriate to limit or cap damages. But the difficult \n     balance involved is to avoid limitation of the basic rights \n     of ordinary people to sue for the enforcement of consumer and \n     employment related legislation.\n       Attitudes towards lawyers are inevitably affected by one's \n     view of the law and the legal process. I hope that you will \n     look very seriously at government service as you seek to use \n     your newly acquired skills to better the position of your \n     fellow human being. This is the most basic contribution that \n     lawyers can make to society--and it is obvious that an \n     increased commitment to government or, if you choose private \n     practice or some other area of activity, pro bono work is \n     central to this effort.\n       I am particularly proud to head an agency which is \n     celebrating its 60th anniversary this summer and which, from \n     the very beginning of its origins in the Great Depression of \n     the 1930s, has contributed to the public good through \n     adherence to a statute which encourages the practice and \n     procedure of collective bargaining--as well as in other \n     portions of our law. Since its inception, the National Labor \n     Relations Board has possessed a culture of commitment to hard \n     work, excellence, and to the promotion of a rule of law which \n     is designed to allow both workers and business to peaceably \n     resolve their difficulties through their own procedures.\n       Illustrative of this process was the NLRB's prominent role \n     in the baseball dispute. It was not the Board's job to take \n     sides between the players and the owners or to determine \n     whose economic position ought to prevail. Consistent with \n     this approach, it was our job to decide whether there was \n     sufficient merit, as reflected by the facts and law, to \n     proceed into federal district court to obtain an injunction \n     against certain unilateral changes in conditions of \n     employment made by the owners. The Board handled the baseball \n     case as it does any other case.\n       Nor is it our job to take into account policy arguments \n     arising out of the peculiarities of this industry, the income \n     or status or notoriety of particular individuals on\n      either side. The statute applies--properly in my judgment--\n     to the unskilled and the skilled, to those who make the \n     minimum wage and those who are financially secure.\n       In the baseball case, the public was able to obtain a brief \n     glimpse of the Board's day-by-day commitment to the rule of \n     law in the workplace. Where parties are involved in an \n     established collective bargaining arrangement, our mandate \n     under the statute is to act in a manner consistent with the \n     fostering of the bargaining process--and I believe that we \n     discharged our duty in baseball in a manner consistent with \n     that objective.\n       What may have been overlooked in the public view was the \n     fact that the Board was able to proceed through a fast track \n     approach and make the promise of spontaneous and free \n     collective bargaining in the workplace a reality. I hope that \n     the players and owners will now do their part and bargain a \n     new agreement forthwith!\n       Our March 26 decision to seek an injunction seems to have \n     facilitated the resumption of baseball and thus was a great \n     victory for the public in renewing its contact with the game \n     which, like the Constitution, the Flag, and straight-ahead \n     jazz is so central to the essence of the country. Hopefully, \n     it will have the effect of promoting the collective \n     bargaining process sooner rather than later.\n       Frequently, the public gains its impressions of lawyers and \n     law from such high visibility cases and from exposure through \n     television rather than books. I can tell you that another \n     factor stimulating my interest in the law was watching the \n     McCarthy-Army hearings in the spring of 1954, that fateful \n     spring when Brown was decided. The hearings focused upon the \n     Wisconsin Senator's investigation of alleged Communist \n     infiltration of Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, where my \n\n[[Page S 9420]]\n     father worked. Because of ideological hysteria, ``guilt'' by \n     association and rank anti-Semitism, many of our closest \n     friends were dismissed--and, indeed, I feared that this would \n     be my father's fate, particularly because of his announced \n     sympathy for Paul Robeson, a hero to so many black people of \n     his generation.\n       Later I had the opportunity to attend the so-called Watkins \n     Hearings in the following September in Washington which \n     ultimately led to McCarthy's censure. Ft. Monmouth and the \n     McCarthy-Army hearings demonstrated how excessive government \n     authority can trample upon individual civil liberties--and \n     the aftermath of the Watkins Hearings redeemed our country's \n     constitutional protection of individual rights of belief and \n     association.\n       Since then, I think that televised Congressional hearings, \n     the Watergate hearings for instance, have contributed to the \n     public understanding about the rule of law and its \n     relationship to the preservation of this Republic's \n     principles. Though, regrettably less conclusive, it may be \n     that the Iran-Contra hearings of 1988 and the Hill-Thomas \n     hearings of October 1991 performed a similar function in that \n     the assumption underlying both proceedings was that \n     government, like private individuals, must adhere \n     unwaveringly to the rule of law.\n       Again, this is to be contrasted with the spectacle of law \n     as show business on television. In my state of California, \n     the O.J. Simpson trial has treated the nation to an episodic \n     soap opera which appears to be more about the business of the \n     money chase than the real substance of law and the legal \n     profession. As Attorney General Janet Reno said about the \n     trial:\n       ``I'm just amazed at the number of people who are watching \n     it. If we put as much energy into watching the O.J. Simpson \n     trial in America . . . into other issues as Americans seem to \n     have done in watching the trial, we might be further down the \n     road.''\n       A recent Los Angeles Times Mirror poll reported by Peter \n     Jennings last month revealed that only 45 percent of adults \n     surveyed said that they had read a newspaper the previous \n     day, and a quarter of those responding said they spent so \n     much time watching the Simpson trial that they did not have \n     time for the rest of the news. At best, the siren song of \n     sensationalism is a distraction--and, at worst, it reinforces \n     excessively negative perceptions of law and lawyers.\n       My hope is that many of you will dedicate yourselves as \n     lawyers or in other careers to a concern for the public good. \n     Now, when Oklahoma City has made it clear that the idea of \n     government itself as well as the law is under attack, it is \n     useful to reflect back upon what government, frequently in \n     conjunction with lawyers, has done for us in this century \n     alone in moving toward a more civilized society.\n       Justice Holmes said, ``Taxes are what we pay for civilized \n     society,''--an axiom often forgotten in the politics of the \n     mid-`90's. What would our society look like without the trust \n     busters of Theodore Roosevelt's era and the Federal Reserve \n     System created by Woodrow Wilson? Regulatory approaches to \n     food and drug administration, the securities market, the \n     licensing of radio and television stations, labor-management \n     relations (with which my agency is concerned) and trade \n     practices are all part of the Roosevelt New Deal legacy which \n     few would disavow in toto.\n       It should not be forgotten that all three branches of \n     federal government took the lead in the fight against racial \n     discrimination and other forms of arbitrary treatment. And as \n     Judge (now Counsel to the President) Abner Mikva has noted: \n     ``The history of the growth of the franchise is a shining \n     example of why we needed . . . the federal approach.''\n       Today, the challenge of public service in Washington has \n     never been more exciting or inspirational. As I have \n     indicated, President Clinton's National Public Service echoes \n     anew the similar initiatives undertaken by both Roosevelt and \n     Kennedy.\n       I urge you to think of the government as a career in which \n     you can use your legal experience in pursuit of the public \n     interest. That does not mean that you have to be a Washington \n     or ``inside the Beltway'' careerist, although that is another \n     way in which to make a contribution. Many of you may choose \n     to serve in your communities throughout\n      the country and, at a point where your career is well-\n     developed, elect to serve through an appointment such as \n     mine.\n       In particular, if you accept such an appointment consisting \n     of a limited term (in the case of the Board five years), I \n     hope that you will keep in mind President (then-Senator) \n     Kennedy's characterization of eight law makers who were the \n     subject of his book, ``Profiles in Courage.'' Said the junior \n     Senator from Massachusetts:\n       ``His desire to win or maintain a reputation for integrity \n     and courage were stronger than his desire to maintain his \n     office . . . his conscience, his personal standards of \n     ethics, his integrity or morality . . . were stronger than \n     the pressures of public disapproval.''\n       This is a particularly vexatious problem for those who are \n     appointed and not elected because of the inevitable and \n     appropriate subordination of appointees--even in the arena of \n     independent regulation--to the people's elected \n     representatives. My own view on serving in Washington is to \n     do the very best you can to implement the public interest in \n     the time allocated in your term, with the expectation that \n     you will return to your community, reestablish your roots and \n     feel satisfied that you have--to paraphrase President \n     Kennedy--done your duty notwithstanding some of the immediate \n     ``pressures of public disapproval.''\n       While I consider the term limits issue to be an entirely \n     different proposition--the people ought always to be able to \n     freely choose their elected leaders amongst the widest \n     possible number of candidates--my view is that the proper \n     standard for those who are subordinate to such leaders is \n     that attributed to Cincinnatus, the Roman general and \n     statesman of the fifth century, who upon discharging his \n     public duty, returned to his community rather than taking the \n     opportunity to seize power and perpetuate himself in office.\n       The independence of administrative agencies might be \n     enhanced by legislation limiting Board Members or \n     Commissioners to one term of service. The temptation to \n     please elected superiors might decline accordingly.\n       Of course, all of us cannot win victories within 15 days, \n     like Cincinnatus, and be back on our farms or in our \n     communities so quickly. But true public service involves a \n     self-sacrifice which rises above the immediate pressures. Do \n     the best that you can to serve the public good.\n       This does not assure success or complete effectiveness. But \n     it allows you to make use of your acquired expertise for the \n     best possible reasons. And this, in turn, puts you in the \n     best position to see it through to the end with a measure of \n     serenity that comes when you have expended your very best \n     effort despite setbacks and criticisms you may endure in the \n     process.\n       As President Lincoln said:\n       ``If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the \n     attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any \n     other business. I do the very best I know how--the very best \n     I can and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end \n     brings me out all right, what is said against me won't amount \n     to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels \n     swearing I was right would make no difference.''\n       You graduate from a distinguished institution in the most \n     exciting political period since the reforms undertaken by the \n     Administration of the 1960s. I hope that some of you will be \n     attracted to public service and help advance our society \n     through the rule of law.\n       As you embark upon the excitement of a new career and \n     challenges in the days ahead, I wish you all good luck and \n     success on whatever path you choose.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9418-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9420-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9420-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9420-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S PROPOSED FISCAL YEAR 1996 BUDGET--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 59\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-\nGovernment and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the \nDistrict of Columbia's Proposed FY 1995 Second Supplemental Budget and \nRecissions of Authority Request Act and the Proposed FY 1996 Budget \nRequest Act.\n  The Proposed FY 1996 Budget has not been reviewed or approved by the \nDistrict of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance \nAuthority, created by Public Law 104-8, the District of Columbia \nFinancial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (the \n``Act'').

A bill to protect the national information infrastructure, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce the Kyl-Leahy National \nInformation Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995. I thank Senator \nLeahy for his sponsorship of this bill, and his leadership in combating \ncomputer crime. I am pleased to introduce this bill, which will \nstrengthen current public law on computer crime and protect the \nnational information infrastructure. My fear is that our national \ninfrastructure--the information that bonds all Americans--is not \nadequately protected. I addressed this issue in the terrorism bill and \nI offer this bill as a protection to one of America's greatest \ncommodities--information.\n  Although there has never been an accurate nationwide reporting system \nfor computer crime, specific reports suggest that computer crime is \nrising. For example, the computer emergency and response team [CERT] a \nCarnegie-Mellon University reports that computer intrusions have \nincreased from 132 in 1989 to 2,341 last year. A June 14 Wall Street \nJournal article stated that a Rand Corp. study reported 1,172 hacking \nincidents occurred during the first 6 months of last year. A report \ncommissioned last year by the Department of Defense and the CIA stated \nthat ``[a]ttacks against information systems are becoming more \naggressive, not only seeking access to confidential information, but \nalso stealing and degrading service and destroying data.'' Clearly \nthere is a need to reform the current criminal statutes covering \ncomputers.\n  Many computer offenses have found their origin in our new \ntechnologies. For example, the horrific damage caused by inserting a \nvirus into a global computer network cannot be prosecuted adequately by \nrelying on common law criminal mischief statutes. The need to reevalute \nour computer statues on a continual basis is inevitable; and protecting \nour nation's information is vital. I, therefore, introduce the National \nInformation Infrastructure Protection of 1995.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is a worldwide system of computers and \ncomputer networks that enables users to communicate and share \ninformation. The system is comparable to the worldwide telephone \nnetwork. According to a Time magazine article, the Internet connects \nover 4.8 million host systems, including educational institutions, \ngovernment facilities, military bases, and commercial businesses. \nMillions of private individuals are connected to the Internet through \ntheir personal computers and modems.\n  Computer criminals have quickly recognized the Internet as a haven \nfor criminal possibilities. During the 1980's, the development and \nbroadbased appeal of the personal computer sparked a period of dramatic \ntechnological growth. This has raised the stakes in the battle over \ncontrol of the Internet and all computer systems. Computer criminals \nknow all the ways to exploit the Internet's easy access, open nature, \nand global scope. From the safety of a telephone in a discrete \nlocation, the computer criminal can anonymously access personal, \nbusiness, and government files. And because these criminals can easily \ngain access without disclosing their identities, it is extremely \ndifficult to apprehend and prosecute them successfully.\n  Prosecution of computer criminals is complicated further by \ncontinually changing technology, lack of precedence, and weak or \nnonexistent State and Federal laws. And the costs are passed on to \nservice providers, the judicial system, and most importantly--the \nvictims.\n  Because computers are the nerve centers of the world's information \nand communication system, there are catastrophic possibilities. Imagine \nan international terrorist penetrating the Federal Reserve System and \nbringing \n\n[[Page S 9423]]\nto a halt every Federal financial transaction. Or worse yet, imagine a \nterrorist who gains access to the Department of Defense, and gains \ncontrol over NORAD. The June 14 Wall Street Journal article reported \nthat security experts were used to hack into 12,000 Defense Department \ncomputer systems connected to the Internet. The results are astounding. \nThe experts hacked their way into 88 percent of the systems, and 4 \npercent of the attacks went undetected.\n  An example of the pending threat is illustrated in the Wednesday, May \n10 headline from the Hill entitled ``Hired Hackers Crack House \nComputers.'' Auditors from Price Waterhouse managed to break into House \nMembers' computer systems. According to the article, the auditors' \nreport stated that they could have changed documents, passwords, and \nother sensitive information in those systems. What is to stop \ninternational terrorists from gaining similar access, and obtaining \nsecret information relating to our national security?\n  In a September 1994 Los Angeles Times article about computer \nintrusion, Scott Charney, chief of the computer crime unit for the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, stated, ``the threat is an increasing threat,'' \nand ``[i]t could be a 16-year-old kid out for fun or it could be \nsomeone who is actively working to get information from the United \nStates.''\n  He added, there is a ``growing new breed of digital outlaws who \nthreaten national security and public safety.'' For example, the Lo \nAngeles Times article reported that, in Los Angeles alone, there are at \nleast four outlaw computer hackers who, in recent years, have \ndemonstrated they can seize control of telephones and break into \ngovernment computers.\n  The article also mentioned that government reports further reveal \nthat foreign intelligence agencies and mercenary computer hackers have \nbeen breaking into military computers. For example, a hacker is \nawaiting trial in San Francisco on espionage charges for cracking an \nArmy computer system and accessing files on an FBI investigation of \nformer Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. According to the 1993 \nDepartment of Defense report, such a threat is very real: ``The nature \nof this changing motivation makes computer intruders' skills high-\ninterest targets for criminal elements and hostile adversaries.''\n  Mr. President, the September 1993 Department of Defense report added \nthat, if hired by terrorists, these hackers could cripple the Nation's \ntelephone system, ``create significant public health and safety \nproblems, and cause serious economic shocks.'' The hackers could bring \nan entire city to a standstill. The report states that, as the world \nbecomes wired for computer networks, there is a greater threat the \nnetworks will be used for spying and terrorism. In a 1992 report, the \nPresident's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee \nwarned, ``known individuals in the hacker community have ties with \nadversary organizations. Hackers frequently have international ties.''\n  A 1991 Chicago Tribune article detailed the criminal activity of a \ngroup of Dutch teenagers who were able to hack into Defense Department \ncomputers which contained sensitive national security information, \nincluding one system which directly supported Operation Desert Storm. \nAccording to the article, Jack L. Brock, former Director of Government \nInformation for the General Accounting Office, said that ``this type of \ninformation could be very useful to a foreign intelligence operation.''\n  These startling examples illustrate the necessity for action. Mr. \nPresident, that is why I am here today--to take action. I would, at \nthis time, like to highlight a few provisions of the bill. This bill \nstrengthens the language currently in section 1030 of title 18 of the \nUnited States Code. I would eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the \ndefinition of ``trespassing'' in a government computer. This bill \ntoughens penalties in current law to ensure that felony level sanctions \napply when unauthorized use of the computer is significant. Current law \ndoes not adequately address the act of trespassing into a computer. But \na breach of a computer security system alone can have a significant \nimpact. For example, an intruder may trespass into a computer system \nand view information\n --without stealing or destroying it. The administrator of the system \nwill spend time, money, and resources to restore security to the \nsystem. Damage occurs simply by trespassing. We can no longer accept \nmere trespass into computers, and regard these intrusions as \nincidental.\n\n  This bill redefines a protected computer to include those computers \nused in foreign communications. The best known international case of \ncomputer intrusion is detailed in the book, ``The Cuckoo's Egg.'' In \nMarch 1989, West German authorities arrested computer hackers and \ncharged them with a series of intrusions into United States computer \nsystems through the University of California at Berkeley. Eastern bloc \nintelligence agencies had sponsored the activities of the hackers \nbeginning in May 1986. The only punishment the hackers were given was \nprobation.\n  This bill deters criminal activity by strengthening the penalties on \ncomputer crime. It will elevate to felony status, the reckless damage \nof computer trespassers and it will criminalize computer trespassers \nwho cause negligent damage. A new subsection is added in section 1030 \nof title 18, United States Code to respond to the interstate \ntransmission of threats directed against computers and computer \nnetworks. In certain cases, according to the Department of Justice, \nindividuals have threatened to crash a computer system unless they are \ngranted access to the system and given an account. The provision will \nprotect the data and programs of computers and computer networks \nagainst any interstate or international transmission of threats. The \nstatutory language will be changed to ensure that anyone who is \nconvicted twice of committing a computer offense will be subject to \nenhanced penalties. This bill will make the criminals think twice \nbefore illegally accessing computer files.\n  Everybody recognizes that it is wrong for an intruder to enter a home \nand wander around; it doesn't make sense to view a criminal who breaks \ninto a computer system differently. We have a national antistalking law \nto protect citizens on the street, but it doesn't cover stalking on the \ncommunications network. We should not treat these criminals differently \nsimply because they possess new weapons.\n  These new technologies, which so many Americans enjoy, were developed \nover many years. I understand that policy can't catch up with \ntechnology overnight, but we can start filling in the gaps created by \nthese tremendous advancements. We cannot allow complicated technology \nto paralyze us into inactivity. It is vital that we protect the \ninformation and infrastructure of this country.\n  Because not everyone is computer literate, there is a tendency to \nview those who are computer literate as somewhat magical and that the \nnormal rules don't apply. Hackers have developed a cult following with \ntheir computer antics, which are regarded with awe. These criminals \ndisregard computer security and authority. In 1990, a hacker cracked \nthe NASA computer system and gained access to 68 computer systems \nlinked by the Space Analysis Network. He even came across the log on \nscreen for the U.S. Controller of the Currency. After being caught, the \nhacker's comment about NASA officials was, ``I still think they're \nbozos,'' and he added ``[i]f they had done a halfway competent job, \nthis wouldn't have happened.''\n  Mr. President, the Kyl-Leahy National Information Infrastructure \nProtection Act of 1995 will deter criminal activity and protect our \nNation's infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators Kyl \nand Grassley the ``National Information Infrastructure Protection Act \nof 1995'' [NIIPA]. This bill will increase protection for both \ngovernment and private computers, and the information on those \ncomputers, from the growing threat of computer crime.\n  We increasingly depend on the availability, integrity, and \nconfidentiality of computer systems and information to conduct our \nbusiness, communicate with our friends and families, and even to be \nentertained. With a modem and a \n\n[[Page S 9424]]\ncomputer, a business person can communicate with his or her office, a \nstudent can access an on-line encyclopedia at home, or researcher can \nget weather information from Australia over the Internet. \nUnfortunately, computer criminals can also use this technology to pry \ninto our secrets, steal confidential Government information, and damage \nimportant telecommunications systems. With the advances in global \ncommunication, these criminals can do this virtually anywhere in the \nworld.\n  The facts speak for themselves--computer crime is on the rise. The \ncomputer emergency and response team at Carnegie-Mellon University \nreports that, since 1991, there has been a 498 percent increase in the \nnumber of computer intrusions, and a 702 percent rise in the number of \nsites affected. About 40,000 Internet computers were attacked in 2,460 \nincidents in 1994 alone. We need to increase protection for this vital \ninformation infrastructure to stem the online crime epidemic.\n  The NII Protection Act seeks to improve the Computer Fraud and Abuse \nAct by providing more protection to computerized information and \nsystems, by designating new computer crimes, and by extending \nprotection to computer systems used in foreign or interstate commerce \nor communications. The bill closes a number of gaps in our current laws \nto strengthen law enforcement's hands in fighting crimes targeted at \ncomputers, computer systems, and computer information.\n  First, the bill would bring the protection for classified national \ndefense or foreign relations information maintained on computers in \nline with our other espionage laws. While existing espionage laws \nprohibit the theft and peddling of Government secrets to foreign \nagents, the bill would specifically target those persons who \ndeliberately break into a computer to obtain the Government secrets \nthat they then try to peddle.\n  Second, the bill would increase protection for the privacy and \nconfidentiality of computer information. Recently, computer hackers \nhave accessed sensitive data regarding Operation Desert\n Storm, penetrated NASA computers, and broken into Federal courthouse \ncomputer systems containing confidential records. Others have abused \ntheir privileges on Government computers by snooping through \nconfidential tax returns, or selling confidential criminal history \ninformation from the National Crime Information Center.\n\n  The bill would criminalize these activities by making all those who \nmisuse computers to obtain Government information and, where \nappropriate, information held by the private sector, subject to \nprosecution. The harshest penalties would be reserved for those who \nobtain classified information that could be used to injur the United \nStates or assist a foreign state. Those who break into a computer \nsystem, or insiders who intentionally abuse their computer access \nprivileges, to secret information off a computer system for commercial \nadvantage, private financial gain or to commit any criminal or tortious \nact would also be subject to felony prosecution. Individuals who \nintentionally break into, or abuse their authority to use, a computer \nand thereby obtain information of minimal value, would be subject to a \nmisdemeanor penalty.\n  Third, the bill would protect against damage to computers caused by \neither outside hackers or malicious insiders. Computer crime does not \njust put information is at risk, but also the computer networks \nthemselves. Hackers, or malicious insiders, can destroy crucial \ninformation with a carefully placed code or command. Hackers, like \nRobert Morris, can bring the Internet to its knees with computer \n``viruses'' or ``worms.'' This bill would protect our Nation's computer \nsystems from such intentional damage, regardless of whether the \nperpetrator was an insider or outside hacker.\n  Under the bill, insiders, who are authorized to access a computer, \nface criminal liability only if they intend to cause damage to the \ncomputer, not for recklessly or negligently causing damage. By \ncontrast, hackers who break into a computer could be punished for any \nintentional, reckless, or negligent damages they cause by their \ntrespass.\n  Fourth, the bill would expand the protection of the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse Act to cover those computers used in interstate or foreign \ncommerce or communications. The law already gives special protection to \nthe computer systems of financial institutions and consumer reporting \nagencies, because of their significance to the economy of our Nation \nand the privacy of our citizens. Yet, increasingly computer systems \nprovide the vital backbone to many other industries, such as the \ntelecommunications network.\n  Current law falls short of protecting this infrastructure. Generally, \nhacker intrusions that do not cross State lines are not Federal \noffenses. The NII Protection Act would change that limitation and \nextend Federal protection to computers or computer systems used in \ninterstate or foreign commerce or communications.\n  Fifth, this bill addresses a new and emerging problem of computer-age \nblackmail. In a recent case, an individual threatened to crash a \ncomputer system unless he was granted access to the system and given an \naccount. The bill adds a new provision to the law that would ensure law \nenforcement's ability to prosecute these modern day blackmailers, who \nthreaten to harm or shut down computer networks unless their \nextortionate demands are met.\n  Finally, the statutory scheme provided in this bill will provide a \nbetter understanding of the computer crime problem. By consolidating \ncomputer crimes in one section of title 18, reliable crime statistics \ncan be generated. Moreover, by centralizing computer crimes under one \nstatute, we may better measure existing harms, anticipate trends, and \ndetermine the need for legislative reform. Additionally, as new \ncomputer technologies are introduced, and new computer crimes follow, \nreformers need only look to section 1030 to update our criminal laws, \nwithout parsing through the entire United States Code.\n  The Kyl-Leahy NII Protection Act would provide much needed protection \nfor our Nation's important information infrastructure. It will help \nensure the confidentiality of sensitive information and protect \ncomputer networks from those who would seek to damage these networks.\n  I commend the Department of Justice for their diligent work on this \nbill, and their continued assistance in addressing this critical area \nof our criminal law. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nrefining and improving this bill, as necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\nNational Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995--Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of \n     1995 amends the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1030, to increase protection for the confidentiality, \n     integrity and security of computer systems and the \n     information on such systems.\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``National \n     Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995.''\n       Sec. 2. Computer Crime. (1) The bill amends five of the \n     prohibited acts in, and adds a new prohibited act to, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a).\n       (A) Subsection 1030(a)(1)--Protection of Classified \n     Government Information.\n       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(1) to increase \n     protection for computerized classified data. The statute \n     currently provides that anyone who knowingly accesses a \n     computer without, or in excess of, authorization and obtains \n     classified information ``with the intent or reason to believe \n     that such information so obtained is to be used to the injury \n     of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign \n     nation'' is subject to a fine or a maximum of ten years' \n     imprisonment. The amendment would modify the scienter \n     requirement to conform to the knowledge requirement in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 793(e), which provides a maximum penalty of ten \n     years' imprisonment for obtaining from any source information \n     connected with the national defense. Unlike Sec. 793(e), \n     however, Sec. 1030(a)(1) would require proof that the \n     individual knowingly used a computer without, or in excess \n     of, authority in obtaining the classified information.\n       As amended, Sec. 1030(a)(1) would prohibit anyone from \n     knowingly accessing a computer, without, or in excess of, \n     authorization, and obtaining classified national defense, \n     foreign relations information, or restricted data under the \n     Atomic Energy Act, with reason to believe the information \n     could be used to the injury of the United States or the \n     advantage of a foreign country, and willfully communicating, \n     delivering or transmitting, or causing the same, or willfully \n     retaining the information and failing to deliver it \n\n[[Page S 9425]]\n     to the appropriate government agent. The amendment specifically covers \n     the conduct of a person who deliberately breaks into a \n     computer without authority, or an insider who exceeds \n     authorized access, and thereby obtains classified information \n     and then communicates the information to another person, or \n     retains it without delivering it to the proper authorities.\n       (B) Subsection 1030(a)(2)--Protection of Financial, \n     Government and Other Computer Information.\n       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(2) to further \n     protect the confidentiality of computer data by extending the \n     protection for computerized financial records in current law \n     to protecting information from any department and agency of \n     the United States and on computers subject to unauthorized \n     access involving interstate or foreign communications.\n       This amendment is designed to protect against the \n     interstate or foreign theft of information by computer. This \n     provision is necessary in light of United States v. Brown, \n     925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991), where the court held \n     that purely intangible intellectual property, such as \n     computer programs, cannot constitute goods, wares, \n     merchandise, securities, or monies which have been stolen, \n     converted, or taken within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2314.\n       The seriousness of a breach in confidentiality depends on \n     the value of the information taken or on what is planned for \n     the information after it is obtained. The statutory penalties \n     are structured to reflect these considerations. Specifically, \n     first-time offenses for obtaining, without or in excess of \n     authorization, information of minimal value from government \n     or protected computers is a misdemeanor. The crime becomes a \n     felony, subject to a fine and up to five years' imprisonment, \n     if the offense was committed for purposes of commercial \n     advantage or private financial gain, for the purpose of \n     committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the \n     Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, or \n     if the value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000.\n       (C) Subsection 1030(a)(3)--Protection for Government \n     Computer Systems.\n       The bill would make two changes to Sec. 1030(a)(3), which \n     currently prohibits intentionally accessing, without \n     authorization, computers used by or for any department or \n     agency of the United States and thereby ``adversely'' \n     affecting ``the use of the Government's operation of such \n     computer.'' First, the amendment would delete the word \n     ``adversely'' since this term suggests, inappropriately, that \n     trespassing in a government computer may be benign. Second, \n     the amendment would replace the phrase ``the use of the \n     Government's operation of such computer'' with the term \n     ``that use by or for the Government.'' When a computer is \n     used for the government, the government is not necessarily \n     the operator, and the old phrase may lead to confusion. The \n     amendment would make a similar change to the definition of \n     ``protected computer'' in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(A).\n       (D) Subsection 1030(a)(4)--Increased Penalties for \n     Significant Unauthorized Use of Computers.\n       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(4) to insure that \n     felony level sanctions apply when the fraudulent use of a \n     computer without, or in excess of, authority is significant. \n     The current statute penalizes, with fines and up to five \n     years' imprisonment, knowingly and with intent to defraud, \n     accessing a computer without, or in excess of, authorization \n     to further the fraud or obtain anything of value, unless the \n     object of the fraud and the thing obtained is only the use of \n     the computer. The blanket exception for computer use is too \n     broad since trespassing in a computer and using computer time \n     may cause large expense to the victim. Hackers, for example, \n     have broken into Cray supercomputers for the purpose of \n     running password cracking programs, sometimes amassing \n     computer\n      time worth far more than $5,000. The amendment would \n     restrict the exception for trespassing, in which only \n     computer use is obtained, to cases involving less than \n     $5,000 during any one-year period.\n       (E) Subsection 1030(a)(5)--Protection from Damage to \n     Computers.\n       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(5) to further \n     protect computers and computer systems covered by the statute \n     from damage both by outsiders, who gain access to a computer \n     without authorization, and by insiders, who intentionally \n     damage a computer. Subsection 1030(a)(5)(A) of the bill would \n     penalize with a fine and up to five years' imprisonment \n     anyone who knowingly causes the transmission of a program, \n     information, code or command and intentionally causes damage \n     without authorization to a protected computer. This would \n     cover anyone who intentionally damages a computer, regardless \n     of whether they were authorized to access the computer.\n       Subsection 1030(a)(5)(B) of the bill would penalize with a \n     fine and up to five years' imprisonment anyone who \n     intentionally accesses a protected computer without \n     authorization and, as a result of that trespass, recklessly \n     causes damage.\n       Finally, subsection 1030(a)(5)(C) of the bill would impose \n     a misdemeanor penalty of a fine and no more than one year \n     imprisonment for intentionally accessing a protected computer \n     without authorization and, as a result of that trespass, \n     causing damage.\n       The bill would punish anyone who knowingly invades a \n     computer system without authority and causes significant \n     losses to the victim, even when the damage caused is not \n     intentional. In such cases, it is the intentional act of \n     computer trespass that makes the conduct criminal. Otherwise, \n     hackers could break into computers or computer systems, safe \n     in the knowledge that no matter how much damage they cause, \n     it is no crime unless the damage was intentional or reckless. \n     By contrast, persons who are authorized to access the \n     computer are criminally liable only if they intend to cause \n     damage to the computer without authority, not for recklessly \n     or negligently causing damage.\n       As discussed more fully below, the bill adds a definition \n     of ``damage'' to encompass significant financial loss of more \n     than $5,000 during any one year period, potential impact on \n     medical treatment, physical injury to any person, and threats \n     to public health and safety.\n       (F) Subsection 1030(a)(7)--Protection from Threats Directed \n     Against Computers.\n       The bill adds a new section to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a) to \n     provide penalties for the interstate transmission of threats \n     directed against computers and computer systems. It is not \n     clear that such threats would be covered under existing laws, \n     such as the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951 (interference with \n     commerce by extortion), or\n      18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(d) (interstate communication of threat to \n     injure the property of another). The ``property'' \n     protected under these statutes does not clearly include \n     the operation of a computer, the data or programs stored \n     in a computer or its peripheral equipment, or the decoding \n     keys to encrypted data.\n       The new subsection (a)(7) covers any interstate or \n     international transmission of threats against computers, \n     computer systems, and their data and programs, whether the \n     threat is received by mail, telephone, electronic mail, or \n     through a computerized messaging service. Unlawful threats \n     could include interference in any way with the normal \n     operation of the computer or system in question, such as \n     denying access to authorized users, erasing or corrupting \n     data or programs, slowing down the operation of the computer \n     or system, or encrypting data and then demanding money for \n     the key.\n       (2) Subsection 1030(c)--Increased Penalties for Recidivists \n     and Other Sentencing Changes. The bill amends 18 U.S.C. \n     1030(c) to increase penalties for those who have previously \n     violated any subsection of Sec. 1030. The current statute \n     subjects recidivists to enhanced penalties only if they \n     violated the same subsection twice. For example, a person who \n     violates the current statute by committing fraud by computer \n     under Sec. 1030(a)(4) and later commits another computer \n     crime offense by intentionally destroying medical records \n     under Sec. 1030(a)(5), is not treated as a recidivist because \n     his conduct violated two separate subsections of Sec. 1030. \n     The amendment would provide that anyone who is convicted \n     twice of committing a computer offense under Sec. 1030 would \n     be subjected to enhanced penalties.\n       The penalty provisions in Sec. 1030(c) are also changed to \n     reflect modifications to the prohibited acts, as discussed \n     above.\n       (3) Subsection 1030(d)--Jurisdiction of Secret Service. The \n     bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(d) to grant the United States \n     Secret Service authority to investigate offenses only under \n     subsections (a)(2) (A) and (B), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and \n     (a)(6). The current statute grants the Secret Service \n     authority to investigate any offense under Sec. 1030, subject \n     to agreement between the Attorney General and the Secretary \n     of the Treasury. The new crimes proposed in the bill, \n     however, do not fall under the Secret Service's traditional \n     jurisdiction. Specifically, proposed Sec. 1030(a)(2)(C) \n     addresses gaps in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314 (interstate \n     transportation of stolen property), and proposed \n     Sec. 1030(a)(7) addresses gaps in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1951 \n     (the Hobbs Act) and 875 (interstate threats). These statutes \n     are within the jurisdiction of the FBI, which should retain \n     exclusive jurisdiction over these types of offenses, even \n     when they are committed by computer.\n       (4) Subsection 1030(e)--Definitions. The bill contains \n     three new definitions for ``protected computer,'' ``damage,'' \n     and ``government entity.''\n       The term ``protected computer'' would replace the term \n     ``federal interest computer'' used currently in Sec. 1030. \n     The new definition of ``protected computer'' would slightly \n     modify the current description in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(A) of \n     computers used by financial institutions or the United States \n     Government, to make it clear that if the computers are not \n     exclusively used by those entities, the computers are \n     protected if the offending conduct affects the use by or for \n     a financial institution or the Government.\n       The new definition of ``protected computer'' would also \n     replace the current description in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(B) of a \n     covered computer being ``one of two or more computers used in \n     committing the offense, not all of which are located in the \n     same State.'' Instead, ``protected computer'' would include \n     computers ``in interstate or foreign commerce or \n     communication.'' Thus, hackers who attack computers in their \n     own State would be subject to this law, if the requisite \n     damage threshold is met and the computer is used in \n     interstate commerce or foreign commerce or communications.\n       The tern ``damage,'' as used in new Sec. 1030(a)(5), would \n     mean any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, \n     information, program or system which (A) causes loss of more \n     than $5,000 during any one-year period; (B) modifies or \n     impairs the medical examination, diagnosis or treatment of a \n\n[[Page S 9426]]\n     person; (C) causes physical injury to any person; or (D) threatens the \n     public health or safety. Computers are increasingly being \n     used for access to critical services, such as emergency \n     response systems and air traffic control. ``Damage'' is \n     therefore broadly defined to encompass the types of harms \n     against which people should be protected from any computer \n     hacker or those insiders who intentionally cause harm.\n       The term ``government entity,'' as used in new \n     Sec. 1030(a)(7), would be defined to include the United \n     States government, any State or political subdivision \n     thereof, any foreign country, and any state, provincial, \n     municipal or other political subdivision of a foreign \n     country.\n       (5) Subsection 1030(g)--Civil Actions. The bill amends the \n     civil penalty provision in Sec. 1030(g) to reflect the \n     proposed changes in Sec. 1030(a)(5). The 1994 amendments to \n     the Act authorized victims of certain computer abuse to \n     maintain civil actions against violators to obtain \n     compensatory damages, injunctive relief, or other equitable \n     relief, with damages limited to economic damages, unless the \n     violator modified or impaired the medical examination, \n     diagnosis or treatment of a person.\n       Under the bill, damages recoverable in civil actions would \n     be limited to economic losses for violations causing losses \n     of $5,000 or more during any one-year period. No limit on \n     damages would be imposed for violations that modified or \n     impaired the medical examination, diagnosis or treatment of a \n     person; caused physical injury to any person; or threatened \n     the public health or safety.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 983. A bill to reduce the number of executive branch political \nappointees; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n           executive branch political appointees legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, along with my good friend the senior \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], I am introducing legislation today \nto reduce the number of political employees who are appointed by the \nPresident. Specifically, the bill caps the number of political \nappointees at 2,000. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates \nthe current number averages 2,800. Thus an estimated 800 of these \npositions would be saved. The measure, based on one of the options \noutlined by the CBO in its publication ``Reducing the Deficit: Spending \nand Revenue Options,'' is estimated to save $363 million over the next \n5 years. The savings for fiscal year 1996 is estimated to be $45 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, this proposal is consistent with the recommendations \nof the Vice President's National Performance Review, which called for \nreduction in the number of Federal managers and supervisors, arguing \nthat ``over-control and micromanagement'' not only ``stifle the \ncreativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year \nin salary, benefits, and administrative costs.''\n  That argument may be particularly true will respect to political \nappointees, whose numbers grew by over 17 percent between 1980 and \n1992, over three times as fast as the total number of executive branch \nemployees. And if we look back further, to 1960, the growth is even \nmore dramatic. In his recently published book, ``Thickening Government: \nFederal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,'' author Paul \nLight reports a startling 430-percent increase in the number of \npolitical appointees and senior executives in Federal Government \nbetween 1960 and 1992.\n  The sentiments expressed in the National Performance Review were also \nreflected in the 1989 report of the National Commission on the Public \nService, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. \nArguing that the growing number of Presidential appointees may \n``actually undermine effective Presidential control of the executive \nbranch,'' the Volcker Commission recommended limiting the number of \npolitical appointees to 2,000, as this legislation does. Mr. President, \nit is essential that any administration be able to implement the \npolicies that brought it into office in the first place. Government \nmust be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the \nVolcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of political \nappointees in recent years has not made Government more effective or \nmore responsive to political leadership.\n  The Commission report cited three reasons. First, it noted that the \nlarge number of Presidential appointees simply cannot be managed \neffectively by any President or White House. This lack of control is \naggravated by the often competing political agendas and constituencies \nthat some appointees might bring with them to their new positions. \nAltogether, the Commission argued that this lack of control and \npolitical focus ``may actually dilute the President's ability to \ndevelop and enforce a coherent,\n coordinated program and to hold cabinet secretaries accountable.''\n\n  Second, the report argued that the excessive number of appointees are \na barrier to critical expertise, distancing the President and his \nprincipal assistants from the most experienced career officials. Though \nbureaucracies can certainly impede needed reforms, they can also be a \nsource of unbiased analysis. Adding organizational layers of political \nappointees can restrict access to important resources, while doing \nnothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments.\n  Author Paul Light says, ``As this sediment has thickened over the \ndecades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of \ngovernment, and the front lines from them.'' Light adds that \n``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping \ngovernment of the barriers to doing its job effectively . . .''\n  Finally, the Volcker Commission asserted that this thickening barrier \nof temporary appointees between the President and career officials can \nundermine development of a proficient civil service by discouraging \ntalented individuals from remaining in Government service or even \npursuing a career in Government in the first place.\n   Mr. President, former Attorney General Elliot Richardson put it well \nwhen he noted:\n\n       But a White House personnel assistant sees the position of \n     deputy assistant secretary as a fourth-echelon slot. In his \n     eyes that makes it an ideal reward for a fourth-echelon \n     political type--a campaign advance man, or a regional \n     political organizer. For a senior civil servant, it's irksome \n     to see a position one has spent 20 or 30 years preparing for \n     preempted by an outsider who doesn't know the difference \n     between an audit exception and an authorizing bill.\n\n   Mr. President, many will recall the difficulties the current \nadministration has had in filling even some of the more visible \npolitical appointments.\n  A story in the National Journal in November 1993, focusing upon the \ndelays in the Clinton administration in filling political positions, \nnoted that in Great Britain, the transition to a new government is \nfinished a week after it begins, once 40 or so political appointments \nare made. That certainly is not the case in the United States, \nrecognizing, of course, that we have a quite different system of \ngovernment from the British Parliament form of government.\n  Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the vast number of political \nappointments that are currently made creates a somewhat cumbersome \nprocess, even in the best of circumstances. The long delays and logjams \ncreated in filling these positions under the Clinton administration \nsimply illustrates another reason why the number of positions should be \ncut back.\n  The consequences of having so many critical positions unfilled when \nan administration changes can be serious. In\n the first 2 years of the Clinton administration, there were a number \nof stories of problems created by delays in making these appointments. \nFrom strained relationships with foreign allies over failures to make \nambassadorship appointments to the 2-year vacancy at the top of the \nNational Archives, the record is replete with examples of agencies left \ndrifting while a political appointment was delayed. Obviously, there \nare a number of situations were the delays were caused by circumstances \nbeyond control of the administration. The current case involving the \nposition of Surgeon General of the United States is a clear example.\n\n  Nonetheless, it is clear that with a reduced number of political \nappointments to fill, the process of selecting and appointing \nindividuals to key positions in a new administration is likely to be \nenhanced.\n  Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the \ninitial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that \nposition over time. In a report released last year, the General \nAccounting Office reviewed a portion of these positions for the period \nof 1981 to 1991, and found high levels of turnover--7 appointees in 10 \n\n[[Page S 9427]]\nyears for one position--as well as delays, usually of months but \nsometimes years, in filling vacancies.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that this legislative proposal is not \nlikely to be popular with many people, both within this administration \nand perhaps among members of the other party who hope to win back the \nWhite House in the next election.\n  I want to stress that I do not view efforts to reduce the number of \npolitical appointees to be a partisan issue. Indeed, I think it adds to \nthe credibility and merits of this proposal that a Democratic Senator \nis proposing to cut back these appointments at a time when there is a \nDemocratic administration in place.\n  The legislation has been drafted to take effect as of October 1, \n1995. It provides for reduction in force procedures to accomplish this \ngoal. In other words, this administration would be required to reduce \nthe number of political appointees to comply with this legislation. It \nwould obviously apply to any further administration as well.\n  The sacrifices that deficit reduction efforts require must be spread \namong all of us. This measure requires us to bite the bullet and impose \nlimitations upon political appointments that both parties may well wish \nto retain. The test of commitment to deficit reduction, however, is not \nsimply to propose measures that impact someone else.\n  As we move forward to implement the NPR recommendations to reduce the \nnumber of Government employees, streamline agencies, and make \nGovernment more responsive, we should also right size the number of \npolitical appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the \npolicies of any administration without burdening the Federal budget \nwith unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs.\n  Mr. President, when I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1992, I developed an \n82-point plan to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced \nbudget. Since that time, I have continued to work toward enactment of \nmany of the provisions of that plan and have added new provisions on a \nregular basis.\n  The legislation I am introducing today reflects one of the points \nincluded on the original 82-point plan calling for streamlining various \nFederal agencies and reducing agency overhead costs. I am pleased to \nhave this opportunity to continue to work toward implementation of the \nelements of the deficit reduction plan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the fundamental right of a parent to direct \nthe upbringing of a child, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n          THE PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Parental \nRights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 to reaffirm the right of \nparents to direct the upbringing of their children. While most parents \nassume this right is protected, some lower courts and Government \nbureaucrats have acted to limit this basic freedom. The bill I am \nintroducing will protect the family from unwarranted intrusions by the \nGovernment. Congressmen Steve Largent and Mike Parker have joined me to \npursue this initiative.\n  While the Constitution does not explicitly address the parent-child \nrelationship, the Supreme Court clearly regards the right of parents to \ndirect the upbringing of their children as a fundamental right under \nthe 14th amendment to the Constitution. Fundamental rights, such as \nfreedom of speech and religion receive the highest legal protection.\n  Two cases in the 1920's affirmed the Court's high regard for the \nintegrity of the parent-child relationship. In Meyer versus Nebraska, \nthe Court declared that the 14th amendment,\n\n       [W]ithout doubt, . . . denotes not merely freedom from \n     bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to . . \n     . marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship \n     God according to the dictates of his own conscience. . . .\n\n  The second important case was Pierce versus. Society of Sisters. In \nthis case, the Court declared that:\n\n       [In] this day and under our civilization, the child of man \n     is his parent's child and not the state's . . . It is not \n     seriously debatable that the parental right to guide one's \n     child intellectually and religiously is a most substantial \n     part of the liberty and freedom of the parent.\n\n  The Court went on to hold that parents are chiefly responsible for \nthe education and upbringing of their children.\n  While the Supreme Court's intent to protect parental rights is \nunquestionable, lower courts have not always followed this high \nstandard to protect the parent-child relationship. The recent lower \ncourt assault on the rights of parents to direct their children's \neducation, health care decisions, and discipline is unprecedented.\n  Several examples of lower court cases will demonstrate the need for \nthis bill. A group of parents in Chelmsford, MA, sued when their \nchildren were required to sit through a 90-minute AIDS awareness \npresentation by ``Hot, Sexy, and Safer Productions, Inc.'' In this so-\ncalled group sexual experience students were instructed to engage in \nactivities which some parents considered outrageous and pornographic. \nWhen the parents challenged the propriety of the school's actions, the \ncourt held that the parents, who were never told about the \npresentation, did not have a right to know and consent to this sexually \nexplicit program before their children were required to attend.\n  The Washington State Supreme Court ruled that it was not a violation \nof parents' rights to remove an eighth-grade child from her family \nbecause she objected to the ground rules established in the home. The \nparents in this case grounded their daughter because she wanted to \nsmoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She objected, and the \ncourts removed her from the home. Most parents would consider these \nrules imminently reasonable. But the court held that although the \nfamily structure is a fundamental institution of our society, and \nparental prerogatives are entitled to considerable legal deference, \nthey are not absolute and must yield to fundamental rights of the child \nor important interests of the state.\n  Recent news accounts reported of a father who was accused of child \nabuse because he publicly spanked his 4-year-old daughter. When she \ndeliberately slammed the car door on her brother's hand, her father \nacted promptly to discipline her by a reasonably administered spanking. \nA passer-by called the police and the father had to defend against the \ncharge of child abuse. While the father won his case, it is amazing to \nmost parents that they could be dragged into court against their will \nto defend against such an outrageous charge as child abuse for \ndisciplining their child for open rebellion.\n  Unfortunately, these cases are only a few of the many examples of \nparents' rights being violated when trying to direct the training and \nnurturing of their children. Recent public debate has also contributed \nto the movement to violate parental rights.\n\n[[Page S 9428]]\n\n  Dr. Jack Westman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison proposes that \nthe State license parents as a means of conveying the seriousness of \nthe parental responsibility. While there is no question of the awesome \nresponsibility to raise and nurture a child, the proposal to have the \nState license potential parents for the right to have children raises \nmany serious questions. Who will decide what will be the appropriate \nstandards for parenthood? These and other questions stretch the \nimagination of freedom loving American parents.\n  With recent lower court cases and the flow of public debate around \n``Parental licensing'', it is easy to see the need for the Parental \nRights Act of 1995.\n  The goal of the PRA is to reaffirm the parental right to direct the \nupbringing of their children in four major areas: First, Directing or \nproviding for the education of the child; two, making health care \ndecisions for the child; three, disciplining the child, including \nreasonable corporal discipline; and four, directing or providing for \nthe religious teaching of the child.\n  The PRA accomplishes this goal by simply clarifying for lower courts \nand administrative tribunals that the proper standard to use in \ndisputes between the Government and parents is the highest legal \nstandard available. This standard, known as ``The Compelling Interest \nStandard'' means that before the Government can interfere in the \nparent-child relationship, it must demonstrate that there is a \ncompelling interest to protect and that the means the Government is \nusing to protect this interest is the least restrictive means \navailable.\n  Practically speaking, this means that the law in question is not so \nbroad in application that it sweeps in more than is necessary to \nprotect the interest in question.\n  An example will help to clarify this point. Unfortunately, there are \nparents who abuse and neglect their children. Clearly, protecting \nchildren from abuse and neglect would fit into any reasonable person's \ndefinition of a compelling interest of the State. One of the stated \npurposes of the PRA is to protect children from abuse and neglect.\n  Another stated goal is to recognize that protecting children in these \ncircumstances is a compelling Government interest. Abusing or \nneglecting your child has never been considered a protected parental \nright.\n  Using the least restrictive means available to protect children from \nabuse and neglect means that a parents who are appropriately meeting \ntheir child's needs could not fall victim to an overzealous State law. \nThe law would be written in such a way that it would cover parents who \nare abusing or neglecting their children but it would not cover parents \nwho are not.\n  If the law is written so poorly that even good, loving parents could \nbe accused of child abuse, it would not pass the test of being the \nleast restrictive means available and would have to be modified.\n  You might ask, ``How is the PRA going to work?'' It uses the \ntraditional four-step process to evaluate fundamental rights which \nbalances the interests of parents, children and the Government. First, \nparents are required to demonstrate that the actions being questioned \nare within their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their \nchild.\n  Second, they must show that the Government interfered with this \nright. If the parents are able to prove these two things, then the \nburden shifts to the Government to show that the interference was \nessential to accomplish a compelling Government interest and that the \nGovernment's method of interfering was the least restrictive means to \naccomplish its goal.\n  In these cases, the court would balance the parents' right to make \ndecisions on behalf of their children against the Government's right to \nintervene in the family relationship and decide what was the proper \nbalance.\n  While it would be better if lower courts and administrative agencies \nwould use the appropriate legal standard outlined by the Supreme Court \nwithout Congress having to clarify the standard, the history shows this \nis not likely to occur. My bill will clarify this standard with \nfinality.\n  Two specific concerns were raised that I want to address. The first \nis from child abuse prosecutors and advocates. As we moved through \ndiscussions on the early drafts of this bill, I made clear that I \nfirmly believed child abuse and neglect is a compelling Government \ninterest.\n  With this in mind, I incorporated suggestions from prosecutors and \nadvocates on this issue. I am comfortable that the changes made address \ntheir concerns.\n  The second issue was infanticide and abortion. The National Right to \nLife Committee was concerned that the bill would overturn the baby doe \nlaws protecting handicapped children after birth. After consultation \nwith other attorneys who agreed that this was a concern, I changed my \ndraft to clarify that the PRA could not be used in this way.\n  The second point that NRL raised was that the PRA would somehow \nempower parents to coerce a young woman to have an abortion against her \nwishes. This is because the PRA allows parents to make health care \ndecisions for their child unless the parents' neglect or refusal to act \nwill risk the life of the child or risk serious physical injury to the \nchild. I have consulted with other pro-life organizations and advocates \nwho do not share this concern and have endorsed the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is critical to the \nproper balance of parents' rights against the Government's actions. \nWithout the PRA, lower courts, Government bureaucrats, and \nadministrative tribunals will continue to interfere needlessly in the \nparent-child relationship.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 985. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain lands in Gilpin \nCounty, CO; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      the gilpin land exchange act\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I, and my colleague, Senator \nBrown, are introducing legislation to exchange approximately 300 acres \nof fragmented Bureau of Land Management lands near Black Hawk, CO, for \napproximately 4,000 acres that will be added to Rocky Mountain National \nPark and to other Department of the Interior holdings in Colorado, \nwhile dedicating any remaining equalization funds to the purchase of \nland and water rights for the Blanca Wetlands Management Area near \nAlamosa, CO.\n  This legislation is supported by local governments, environmental \ngroups, and land developers in Colorado. More specifically, the bill: \nWill enable Rocky Mountain National Park to obtain an adjacent 40-acre \nparcel known as the Circle C Ranch. The Park Service has long sought to \nacquire the ranch to avoid its subdivision and development; will result \nin the public acquisition of approximately 4,000 acres of elk winter \nrange and other important wildlife habitat at the headwaters of La Jara \nCanyon and Fox Creek, approximately 10 miles from Antonito, CO; and \nwill create a fund from cash equalization moneys that may be paid to \nthe United States as a result of the exchange, with the fund to be used \nto augment fish and wildlife habitat in the BLM's Blanca Wetlands \nManagement Area. The BLM has wanted funds for these purposes for many \nyears.\n  In exchange for picking up over 4,000 acres of land, 130 parcels of \nhighly fragmented BLM land totalling about 300 acres will be made \navailable for private acquisition. Of these 130 parcels, 88 are less \nthan 1 acre in size. The BLM, through its established land use planning \nprocess, has already identified these lands as appropriate for \ndisposal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill, along with letters of support from \nthe city of Central, the city of Blackhawk, the Gilpin County Board of \nCounty Commissioners, and the Huerfano County Board of County \nCommissioners be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 985\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land in Gilpin \n     County, Colorado, are administered by the Secretary of the \n     Interior as \n\n[[Page S 9429]]\n     part of the Royal Gorge Resource Area, Canon City District, Bureau of \n     Land Management;\n       (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 \n     separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately \n     38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as \n     suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management \n     through its resource management planning process and are \n     appropriate for disposal; and\n       (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless \n     by virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear \n     to have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal \n     Government to exchange for lands which will better lend \n     themselves to Federal management and have higher values for \n     future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the \n     protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and \n     wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, \n     wetlands, scenic beauty and other public values.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, \n     direct, facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth \n     herein in order to further the public interest by disposing \n     of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire in \n     exchange therefor lands with important values for permanent \n     public management and protection.\n\n     SEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Act shall be \n     consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     Lake Gulch, Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in \n     section 4 of this Act) offers to transfer to the United \n     States pursuant to the provisions of this Act the offered \n     lands or interests in land described herein.\n       (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of \n     section 3 of this Act, Lake Gulch shall convey to the \n     Secretary of the Interior all right, title, and interest in \n     and to the following offered lands--\n       (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n     improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n     lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park \n     as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church \n     Camp'', dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition \n     by the United States and without further action by the \n     Secretary of the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain \n     National Park and thereafter be administered in accordance \n     with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to \n     the National Park System and Rocky Mountain National Park;\n       (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n     States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n     Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n     acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n     Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and\n       (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau \n     of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano \n     County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Bonham Ranch-\n     Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, however, That \n     it is the intention of Congress that such lands may remain \n     available for the grazing of livestock as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with applicable \n     laws, rules, and regulations: Provided further, That if the \n     Secretary determines that certain of the lands acquired \n     adjacent to Cucharas Canyon hereunder are not needed for \n     public purposes they may be sold in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law.\n       (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise \n     offered land parcels identified above is unable to be \n     conveyed to the United States due to appraisal or other \n     problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may mutually\n      agree to substitute therefor alternative offered lands \n     acceptable to the Secretary.\n       (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of \n     title to the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary \n     shall simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, \n     and interest of the United States, subject to valid existing \n     rights, in and to the following selected lands--\n       (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n     approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n     federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on \n     a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994;\n       (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n     which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994; and\n       (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, \n     and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306, and 308-\n     326 on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated \n     July 1994: Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of \n     land in section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if \n     at the time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels \n     are under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit \n     of local government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature \n     of such parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in \n     section 13, and the high cost of surveying such small \n     parcels, the Secretary is authorized to transfer such section \n     13 lands to Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or \n     other description as the Secretary determines appropriate to \n     carry out the basic intent of the map cited in this \n     subparagraph.\n       (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \n     Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the \n     Secretary may utilize the authority and direction of this Act \n     to transfer to Lake Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 that \n     are in addition to those precise selected lands shown on the \n     map cited herein, and which are not under formal application \n     for transfer to a qualified unit of local government, upon \n     transfer to the Secretary of additional offered lands \n     acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to the Secretary \n     by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money amounting to the \n     full appraised fair market value of any such additional \n     lands. If any such additional lands are located in section 13 \n     they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without survey based on \n     such legal or other description as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate as long as the Secretary determines that the \n     boundaries of any adjacent lands not owned by Lake Gulch can \n     be properly identified so as to avoid possible future \n     boundary conflicts or disputes. If the Secretary determines \n     surveys are necessary to convey any such additional lands to \n     Lake Gulch, the costs of such surveys shall be paid by Lake \n     Gulch but shall not be eligible for any adjustment in the \n     value of such additional lands pursuant to section 206(f)(2) \n     of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (as \n     amended by the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of \n     1988) (43 U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n       (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant \n     to this Act or other authority of law any lands which are \n     contiguous to North Clear Creek southeast of the City of \n     Black Hawk, Colorado in the County of Gilpin, Colorado, the \n     Secretary shall notify and consult with the County and City \n     and afford such units of local government an opportunity to \n     acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such \n     easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as \n     may be necessary to serve public utility line or recreation \n     path needs: Provided, however, That any survey or other costs \n     associated with the acquisition or reservation of such \n     easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the unit or \n     units of local government concerned.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) Equalization of Values.--(1) The values of the lands to \n     be exchanged pursuant to this Act shall be equal as \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior utilizing \n     nationally recognized appraisal standards, including, to the \n     extent appropriate, the Uniform Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisition, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal \n     Practice, the provisions of section 206(d) of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)), \n     and other applicable law.\n       (2) In the event any cash equalization or land sale moneys \n     are received by the United States pursuant to this Act, any \n     such moneys shall be retained by the Secretary of the \n     Interior and may be utilized by the Secretary until fully \n     expended to purchase from willing sellers land or water \n     rights, or a combination thereof, to augment wildlife habitat \n     and protect and restore wetlands in the Bureau\n      of Land Management's Blanca Wetlands, Alamosa County, \n     Colorado.\n       (3) Any water rights acquired by the United States pursuant \n     to this section shall be obtained by the Secretary of the \n     Interior in accordance with all applicable provisions of \n     Colorado law, including the requirement to change the time, \n     place, and type of use of said water rights through the \n     appropriate State legal proceedings, and to comply with any \n     terms, conditions, or other provisions contained in an \n     applicable decree of the Colorado Water Court. The use of any \n     water rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be \n     limited to water that can be used or exchanged for water that \n     can be used on the Blanca Wetlands.

In the event \n     the exchange cannot be consummated within such 6-month-time \n     period, the Secretary, upon application by Lake Gulch, is \n     directed to sell to Lake Gulch at appraised fair market value \n     any or all of the parcels (comprising a total of \n     approximately 11 acres) identified in section 2(d)(1)(C) of \n     this Act as long as the parcel or parcels applied for are not \n     under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of \n     local government.\n       (c) Administration of Lands Acquired by United States.--In \n     accordance with the provisions of section 206(c) of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1716(c)), all lands acquired by the United States pursuant to \n     this Act shall upon acceptance of title by the United States \n     and without further action by the Secretary concerned become \n     part of and be managed as part of the administrative unit or \n     area within which they are located.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       City of Black Hawk, CO.\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell State Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter is to reaffirm the City \n     of Black Hawk's support for the land exchange proposal \n     between Lake Gulch, Inc. and the U.S. Bureau of Land \n     Management which you sponsored last year. We support the \n     proposal and hope that you will see fit to seek its \n     reintroduction before the Congress.\n       As our letter to you last August indicated, the lands which \n     Lake Gulch Inc. is seeking to acquire through the exchange \n     are scattered parcels ranging from 38 acres in size to as \n     little as one-one hundredth of an acre. Because they are \n     mostly interspersed with private lands which are owned or \n     under option to Lake Gulch and its affiliates, it is our \n     belief that there is little rationale for the BLM to retain \n     them, but common sense logic supporting Lake Gulch's \n     acquisition.\n       We feel the proposed acquisition by Lake Gulch will benefit \n     our area by consolidating land that can be used for future \n     residential and non-gaming purposes. As you may be aware, \n     real estate prices within our existing city limits have \n     escalated so rapidly since the advent of gaming that little \n     land is realistically available at the present time for uses \n     other than gaming and its ancillary facilities such as \n     parking, lodging and restaurants. Therefore, we view it is \n     highly desirable to see additional land consolidation into \n     private ownership in our community so that there will be \n     increased opportunities for the location of affordable \n     housing, stores, gas stations, and other needed services.\n       We finally note that the legislation which you sponsored \n     last year contained a provision in Section 2(d)(3) giving us \n     the right to acquire easements or rights-of-way through the \n     lands to be conveyed to Lake Gulch as might be necessary to \n     serve future utility line or recreation path needs. We would \n     request that this provision be included in the legislation \n     again this year.\n       Thank you for your sponsorship of the legislation last \n     year. We hope you will be able to lend your assistance again \n     this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kathryn Eccker,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              City of Central,\n\n                                   Central City, CO., May 25, 1995\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nighthorse Campbell: I am writing to reaffirm \n     the City of Central's support, as first expressed to you in \n     our letter of August 5, 1994, for the proposed Gilpin County \n     land exchanged as embodied in bills S. 2470 and H.R. 5016 \n     introduced in Congress last year. It is our understanding \n     that Lake Gulch Inc. and its associates will be seeking \n     reintroduction of the legislation this year, and we are \n     supportive of their efforts provided that the legislation \n     contains, as it did last year, a provision prohibiting the \n     transfer to Lake Gulch of any lands in Section 13 for which \n     we have submitted a formal transfer application.\n       We have re-examined the proposed land exchange boundaries \n     with representatives of Lake Gulch Inc. and have reached \n     agreement with them that the proposal will exclude the lands \n     known as parcels 310, 305, and 307. The City of Central is \n     currently seeking a land use permit and possible future \n     purchase for those three tracts. With this exclusion, there \n     should be no overlap between their proposal and our current \n     application.\n       Please let us know if we can provide any assistance in this \n     matter. We hope that the legislation can be reintroduced and \n     moved forward expeditiously.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                    David C. Stahl\n     Interim City Manager\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Board of County Commissioners,\n\n\n                                                Gilpin County,\n\n                                  Central City, CO., June 6, 1995.\n     Senator Hank Brown,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Congressman Scott McInnis,\n     Cannon House Office Bldg.,\n     Congressman David Skaggs,\n     Longworth House Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Congressmen and Senators: Last August we contacted \n     your offices indicating the County's support of the proposed \n     land exchange between the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and \n     the Lake Gulch Organization, provided that the conveyance of \n     the BLM lands to Lake Gulch would be subject to the existing \n     easement for Gilpin County Road 6. We understand that the \n     legislation failed due to Congress' adjournment last fall, \n     but that Lake Gulch will be requesting its reintroduction in \n     this Congress.\n       As we indicated last year, Gilpin County is supportive of \n     the idea of taking any steps that would allow consolidation \n     into private ownership of the land holdings involved in this \n     land exchange. Given the extremely scattered nature of the \n     BLM lands, we do not believe any purpose is served by their \n     continued public ownership under BLM control whereas our \n     County has the need for additional private land near the \n     rapidly expanding communities in Black Hawk and Central City. \n     Lake Gulch and its affiliates have represented that they own \n     or control most of the private land surrounding the land they \n     are seeking to acquire from the BLM, hence the requested land \n     consolidation appears logical.\n       While we have no detailed knowledge of the principals, \n     resources or objectives associated with Lake Gulch, we agree \n     with the idea of taking any steps that would allow \n     consolidation of land holdings in this area, including the \n     transfer of BLM lands to Lake Gulch or some other entity that \n     could demonstrate an ability to assemble a significant amount \n     of privately held tracts in this area. Without knowing more \n     about the company or its principals, we cannot say whether \n     Lake Gulch is or is not the best entity to accomplish this \n     goal.\n       Although the proposed bill reserves a right-of-way for \n     County Rd. 6, which now runs through this area, no width is \n     specified. We would expect the recipients of the public lands \n     to recognize a no less than 60 foot right-of-way for County \n     Road 6, in an alignment acceptable to the county.\n       While the county believes that the type of transfer \n     contemplated in the proposed legislation is appropriate for \n     the BLM lands in question, we also feel that other BLM lands \n     in Gilpin County should be investigated for possible transfer \n     to the county or other public or quasi-public entities for \n     preservation and other uses which could directly benefit the \n     residents of the county and surrounding areas. We look \n     forward to a continuation of the ongoing discussion with BLM \n     representatives on this matter.\n       Thanking you in advance for your attention to this \n     important matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we \n     can be of any assistance to you in your deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ralph H. Knull,\n                                                          Chairman\n     \n[[Page S 9431]]\n\n                                          Huerfano County Board of\n\n\n                                         County Commissioners,\n\n                                    Walsenburg, CO., June 7, 1995.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We understand that you may shortly \n     be considering a land exchange proposal which would involve \n     up to 4700 acres of land in Huerfano County currently \n     belonging to Mr. Orville Bonham being exchanged to the Bureau \n     of Land Management.\n       Our Board is familiar with the land in question and is \n     aware of BLM's ongoing interest in acquiring all or a portion \n     of Mr. Bonham's land to protect Cucharas Canyon for future \n     public uses such as hunting, fishing and other outdoor \n     recreation. We are also aware that Mr. Bonham is willing to \n     sell or exchange his lands to BLM. We, therefore, believe \n     that public interest, as well as the interests of our County, \n     would be well served by making such an exchange in Cucharas \n     Canyon.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. Cucharas \n     Canyon is a beautiful place where land ownership \n     consolidation is logical to round out BLM's existing \n     holdings.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Reinets,\n       Chairman.\n     Xavier E. Sandoval,\n       Commissioner.\n     Neal J. Cocco,\n       Commissioner.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. \n        Inhofe):\n  S. 986. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the Federal income tax shall not apply to United States citizens \nwho are killed in terroristic actions directed at the United States or \nto parents of children who are killed in those terroristic actions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the terrorism victims tax relief act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nTerrorism Victims Tax Relief Act of 1995, a bill that was prompted by \nthe recent Oklahoma City bombing, and the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nMoynihan, Inhofe, and Nickles join me in introducing legislation that \nwe believe will provide some relief to families of Americans who fall \nvictim to domestic terrorism directed against the U.S. Government.\n   Mr. President, of February 26, 1993, Americans were shocked when we \nexperienced the most dramatic terrorist attack in our history. On that \nfateful day, the bombing of the World Trade Center brought \ninternational terrorism to this country. It was a heinous act that \nkilled 6 people and injured over 1,000. This bombing was, in part, \nresponsible for legislation recently passed that will provide our \nFederal law enforcement officials with more effective ways of fighting \nboth domestic and international terrorism.\n  A little more than 2 years later, on April 19, 1995, in America's \nheartland, Oklahoma City was the scene of something far more heinous \nand devastating, the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. \nThis cold and calculated act ultimately killed 168 Americans, including \n19 innocent children. The images of that day will remain with us \nforever, but most of all, the lives of family members will be forever \nchanged.\n  Mr. President, it is for this reason that we introduce this \nlegislation today. We believe it is our duty to do what we can, no \nmatter how small, to lessen the emotional and financial burden on the \nfamilies of the victims of these two horrible tragedies. This \nlegislation would amend Internal Revenue Code section 692(c), which \nexempts from taxation the wages of military and civilian employees of \nthe United States who die as a result of wounds or injury incurred \noutside the United States in a terroristic or military action.\n  This proposed legislation would amend the law to extend the \nprovisions of section 692(c) to U.S. citizens, including the parents of \nchildren, who fall victim to either domestic or international \nterrorism. To take into consideration those American who died in the \nWorld Trade Center bombing, the effective date of this legislation \nwould be for tax years beginning after December 31, 1992.\n  Mr. President, although we in Congress can do nothing to fill the \nvoid left by these tragedies, it is our belief that this legislation \nwill help relieve the heavy burden felt by those who lost their \nhusbands, wives and children. I hope that our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle will join us in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the full settlement of all claims of \nSwain County, NC, against the United States under the agreement dated \nJuly 30, 1943, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                the swain county settlement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Swain County \nSettlement Act of 1995, fulfilling a promise I made to the people of \ntiny Swain County, NC, two decades ago when I promised that I would do \neverything in my power to require the Federal Government to keep a \ncommitment it made in writing to them back in 1943, more than a half-\ncentury ago.\n  This is the third time this legislation has been introduced. On \nOctober 22, 1991, I introduced the Swain County Settlement Act of 1991, \nand on January 26, 1993, I reintroduced this legislation as the Swain \nCounty Settlement Act of 1993. Unfortunately, the Senate did not pass \nthis legislation in the 102d and 103d Congresses.\n  For those unfamiliar with this legislation, it merely directs the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury to honor \nthe 1943 contract between the people of western North Carolina and the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, at the outset I make this point: At issue here is \nwhether the U.S. Government will keep its word, and live up to a very \nclear commitment it made in writing 52 years ago in exchange for the \nright to flood thousands of acres of Swain County to create the Fontana \nLake. By what we do, or fail to do, the integrity of the Federal \nGovernment, and those of us who serve in Congress today, will be \ndecided in the minds of people who have been waiting for 52 years.\n  Specifically, the Helms legislation proposes three things: First, it \norders the Secretary of the Interior to begin construction of the road \npromised by the Federal Government in 1943; second, it directs the \nSecretary of the Treasury to pay Swain County, North Carolina the sum \nof $16 million to compensate the county for the destruction of North \nCarolina Highway No. 288; and third, it orders the Park Service to \n\n[[Page S 9432]]\nerect a historical marker at Soco Gap to honor the contributions of the \nCherokee Nation to the people of North Carolina and to the United \nStates.\n  Senators should be aware of what happened 52 years ago to understand \nwhy I so vigorously support full settlement of this matter. In 1943, \nthe Federal Government and the Tennessee Valley Authority decided that \nin order to generate hydroelectric power they needed to flood land \ntaken from the farmers in Swain County. Literally thousands of Swain \nCounty residents packed up and left their homes because the Federal \nGovernment needed their land. The Government did not relocate them, nor \ndid the Government give North Carolina families additional land. The \nGovernment merely offered a few dollars for the land, buy many Swain \nCounty citizens never received even one dime for their land.\n  I don't have to remind Senators, Mr. President, that in 1943, World \nWar II was raging in Europe and the Pacific. Many of the men from the \nSwain County area were overseas fighting for our freedom--at the very \ntime their land back home was being seized by the Federal Government.\n  When the Government took the 44,400 acres of land north of Fontana \nLake, it agreed: First, to reimburse Swain County for an existing \nhighway that was flooded in order to create Fontana Lake; and second, \nto build an around-the-park road to, among other things, provide access \nto gravesites left behind when the people were forced off the land.\n  In case any Senator cares to see it, I have a copy of the North Shore \nRoad contract signed by FDR's Interior Secretary Harold Ickes and North \nCarolina's Gov. J. Melville Broughton.\n  In July 1943, shortly after the agreement was signed, a Tennessee \nValley Authority supervisor wrote the families about gravesite removal. \nThe letter stated:\n\n       The construction of Fontana Dam necessitates the flooding \n     of the road leading to the Proctor Cemetery located in Swain \n     County, North Carolina, and to reach this cemetery in the \n     future [it] will be necessary to walk a considerable distance \n     until a road is constructed in the vicinity of the cemetery, \n     which is proposed to be completed after the war has ended. We \n     are informed that you are the nearest surviving relative of a \n     deceased who is buried in this cemetery.\n\n  Because of the understanding mentioned in this letter--that the road \nwould be completed shortly after the war--families in Swain County \nagreed to leave their deceased relatives on the land taken by the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, documents dating back to 1943 show that the Government \ndid fulfill its promise to pay for Highway No. 288. In 1943 the \nGovernment paid to the State of North Carolina approximately $400,000, \nan amount which represents the principal which Swain County owed on \noutstanding bonds.\n  According to my information, the Federal Government paid that amount \nto the State of North Carolina as trustee. A letter dated November 22, \n1943, from the Treasurer of the Tennessee Valley Authority to the \nTreasurer of the State of North Carolina confirms that payment was \nindeed made.\n  The full payment never reached Swain County because it went into the \nState's general highway fund account and the Federal Government never \nfulfilled its obligation to build the road. There were a few false \nstarts. In 1963, the Federal Government built 2.5 miles of the road; in \n1965, it built 2.1 miles; and in 1969 it built 1 additional mile and a \n1,200-foot tunnel. Then the environmentalists got into the act and the \nproject was shut down.\n  Now, Mr. President, you can visit one of western North Carolina's \nbest-known sites, the ``Road to Nowhere.'' It is a travesty--a monument \nto a broken promise by the U.S. Government.\n  The payment of $16 million to Swain County, which is to compensate \nthe county for the destruction of North Carolina Highway No. 288 in \n1943, will certainly help this economically poor county. However, it \nwill never be able to cover all the economic distress that Swain County \nand most of western North Carolina have suffered because of the \nincreasing amount of land in western North Carolina being acquired by \nthe Federal Government and taken off the tax rolls.\n  Over the years, people in western North Carolina have watched the \nFederal Government seize their land for one purpose or another. They \nhave very little industry. They have little tax base. The unemployment \nrate is high.\n  No one can fully appreciate how the Government has crippled the \neconomy in western North Carolina until he or she looks at how much \nland the Federal Government has already seized. In Swain County alone, \nout of 345,715 acres, the Federal Government has taken 276,577 acres. \nNearby Graham County has the same problem. Of the 193,216 acres in that \ncounty, the Federal Government has taken 138,813 acres. Of the 353,452 \nacres in Haywood County, the Federal Government has taken 131,111 \nacres.\n  I mention all this to emphasize the frustration in western North \nCarolina. Meanwhile, in the four Tennessee counties bordering the Great \nSmoky Mountains National Park for instance, the Federal Government owns \nless than two fifths of the land. I have no quarrel with our friends in \nTennessee, but facts are facts.\n  Although the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited \nnational park in the country, few tourists who travel through the \nSmokies have a place to pause on the North Carolina side of the park. \nThe road in Swain County, promised over 52 years ago, would change \nthat. It would attract industry and tourists--not to the detriment of \nthe scenic beauty of the Smokies but for the betterment of the citizens \nof western North Carolina. In fact, I would like the road to become a \npart of the Blue Ridge Parkway system.\n  The Helms legislation takes care of Department of the Interior \nregulations and so-called environmental guidelines that would prevent \nthe construction of the road because it orders, notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, the Secretary of the Interior to build the \nroad.\n  As Paul Harvey put it, ``Now you know the rest of the story.'' And as \nI stated at the outset, I made a commitment to the people of western \nNorth Carolina years ago. I promised to fight for their interests. If I \nlose, the Federal Government will lose the respect and confidence of \nthousands of North Carolinians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of S. 987 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer \nadministrative jurisdiction over certain land to the Secretary of the \nArmy to facilitate construction of a jetty and sand transfer systems, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                the oregon inlet protection act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in offering the Oregon Inlet Protection Act \nof 1995, I would emphasize that this is legislation of vital importance \nto thousands of citizens of both North Carolina and other States and \nespecially the citizens of the Outer Banks along the northeastern coast \nof my State. The commercial and recreational fishermen who risk their \nlives each day attempting to navigate the hazardous waters of Oregon \nInlet have been pleading for this legislation for decades. It is, in \nfact, a matter of life or death for them.\n  On December 30, 1992, a 31-foot commercial fishing vessel sank in \nOregon Inlet--the 20th ship to go down in those waters since 1961. \nFortunately, both crewmen were rescued, but the Coast Guard has never \nfound the wreckage. At last count, 20 fisherman have lost their lives \nin Oregon Inlet in the past 30 years.\n  This legislation proposes to spend no money, nor authorize new \nexpenditures nor new projects. It requires the Secretary of the \nInterior to transfer two small parcels of Interior Department land to \nthe Department of the Army so that the Corps of Engineers may begin \nwork on a too long-delayed project authorized by the Congress in 1970, \n25 years ago.\n  This legislation transfers 100 acres of land, adjacent to Oregon \nInlet in Dare County, NC, to the Department of Army.\n  Mr. President, in October 1992, then Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan \nissued conditional permits for the Corps of Engineers to begin the \nconstruction process. However, the Clinton administration revoked those \npermits. The bill I am offering today serves notice to the self-\nproclaimed environmentalists who have stalled this project that I will \ncontinue to do everything I can to protect the lives and livelihoods of \nthe countless commercial and recreational fisherman who have been \ndenied greater economic opportunities because of the obstinacy of the \nfederal government.\n  A brief review of the history of this problem may be in order:\n  In 1970, Congress authorized the stabilization of a 400-foot wide, \n20-foot deep channel through Oregon Inlet, and the installation of a \nsystem of jetties with a sand-by-pass system. The U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers was authorized to design and build the jetties.\n  Ever since 1970, however, the project has been repeatedly and \ndeliberately delayed by bureaucratic roadblocks contrived by the fringe \nelements of the environmental movement. As a result, many lives and \nlivelihoods have been lost. North Carolina's once thriving fishing \nindustry has deteriorated, and access to the Pea Island National \nWildlife Refuge and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore has been \nthreatened.\n  Throughout the past 25 years critics of this project have claimed \nmore studies were needed and more time was essential to determine the \nimpact the jetties will have on the Outer Banks. Pure stalling tactics, \nMr. President, while men died and livelihoods were lost. Twenty-five \nyears of studies. Is this not enough of bureaucratic stalling?\n  Mr. President, the proposed Oregon Inlet project surely is the most \nover-studied project in the history of the Corps of Engineers and the \nDepartment of the Interior. Since 1969, the Federal Government has \nconducted 97 major studies and three full blown environmental impact \nstatements but, of course, the environmentalists demand more. As for \nthe cost/benefit factor, the Office of Management and Budget found--as \nrecently as March 14, 1991--the project to be economically justified. \nThen, in December 1991, a joint committee of the Corps of Engineers and \nthe Department of the Interior recommended to then Interior Secretary \nLujan and then Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Page \nthat the jetties be built. But the people of the Outer Banks, NC are \nstill waiting.\n  The time has come to get off the dime. Too many lives have been lost \nand the very existence of the Outer Banks is now in question because \nnothing has been done to manage the flow of sand from one end of the \ncoastal islands to the other. If very much more time is wasted, the \nenvironmentalists won't have to worry about turtles or birds on Cape \nHatteras, because a few short years hence, Oregon Inlet will have \ndisappeared.\n  To understand why this project has become one of the Interior \nDepartment's most studied and controversial and to see how out of touch \nthese environmental extremists are, the October 1992, edition of the \nSmithsonian magazine is highly instructive. In an article entitled, \n``The beach boy sings a song developers don't want to hear,'' the \nmagazine chronicles the adventures of a professor at a major North \nCarolina university who has made his living organizing opposition to \nall coastal engineering projects on the Outer Banks--\n Oregon Inlet in particular. The article further relates how, when \nconfronted by an angry Oregon Inlet fisherman--a man who works for a \nliving made more hazardous by the failure to keep a safe channel at \nOregon Inlet open--this professor retorted that he and his radical \nfriends will not be satisfied until ``all the houses are taken off the \nshore to leave it the way it was before.''\n\n  Mr. President, this from a professor whose home occupies a large plot \nof land 200 miles west in the middle of North Carolina. Yet, the \nprofessor is all too ready to deprive other North Carolinians of their \nrights to live and prosper.\n  That is not environmental activism. It is environmental hypocrisy.\n  As the poet said, ``that does not even make good nonsense''.\n  Mr. President, the issue is clear. The time for delay is over. It is \ntime to put these long-neglected citizens of North Carolina first. This \nlegislation should mark the beginning of the end of the jetty debate on \nthe Outer Banks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of S. 988, \nthe Oregon Inlet Protection Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 988\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FLOOD CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Joint designation.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the\n      Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army, \n     acting through the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of \n     Engineers, shall jointly designate the tracts of land for \n     the jetty and sand transfer system for the Oregon Inlet on \n     the Coast of North Carolina, approximately 85 miles south \n     of Cape Henry and 45 miles north of Cape Hatteras (as \n     described on page 12 of the Report of the House of \n     Representatives numbered 91-1665), authorized under the \n     River and Harbor Act of 1970 and the Flood Control Act of \n     1970 (Public Law 91-611; 84 Stat. 1818), and the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall transfer administrative jurisdiction \n     over those tracts to the Secretary of the Army.\n       (2) Failure to jointly designate.--If the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of the Army fail to jointly \n     designate the tracts of land by the date that is 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Army shall designate the tracts of land pursuant to a \n     description prepared by the Secretary of the Army, in \n     consultation with the Chief of Engineers, and shall notify \n     the Secretary of the Interior of the designation, who shall \n     transfer administrative jurisdiction over those tracts to the \n     Secretary of the Army.\n       (b) Size.--\n       (1) Limits.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     quantity of acreage in the tracts referred to in subsection \n     (a) shall not exceed--\n       (A) with respect to the tract in the Cape Hatteras National \n     Seashore Recreational Area, 65 acres; and\n       (B) with respect to the tract in the Pea Island National \n     Wildlife Refuge, 35 acres.\n       (2) Exception.--If the Secretary of the Army and the \n     Secretary of the Interior \n\n[[Page S 9434]]\n     jointly designate the tracts of land pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the \n     area of each tract may exceed the acreage specified for the \n     tract in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Modification.--Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1), if, \n     after designating the tracts of land pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(2), the Secretary of the Army determines that any tract \n     is inadequate for the construction, operation, and \n     maintenance of a jetty and sand transfer system for the \n     Oregon Inlet, the Secretary of the Army may designate, not \n     earlier than 60 days after providing notice of a designation \n     to the Secretary of the Interior under subsection (a)(2), an \n     additional tract of land adjacent to the inadequate tract.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 989. A bill to limit funding of an Executive order that would \nprohibit Federal contractors from hiring permanent replacements for \nlawfully striking employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Services.\n\n\n                    STRIKER REPLACEMENT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Coats, Gorton, and Hatch, the Fairness in Federal Contracting \nAct, a bill to prohibit the administration from using any appropriated \nfunds to administer its striker replacement Executive order. I \nencourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved with this issue for the last 4 \nyears. Quite frankly, I had hoped that this whole matter of hiring \npermanent replacements for striking workers had been put to rest. \nApparently, I was mistaken.\n  As my colleagues may know, for over 60 years, Federal labor law has \npermitted workers to strike and employers to continue to operate during \na strike, if necessary with the assistance of permanent replacements. \nDuring the 102d and 103d Congresses, the Senate debated whether to \nprohibit permanent striker replacements. Ultimately, however, we did \nnot amend Federal labor law.\n  Members may disagree on whether we made the right decision over the \nlast two sessions of Congress, but everyone will agree that the matter \nwas properly before us. The Congress of the United States should decide \nimportant matters of national labor policy.\n  That changed on March 8, 1995, when the President issued an Executive \norder permitting the administration to cancel Federal contracts with \ncompanies that have hired permanent striker replacements. Through the \nExecutive order, the President attempted to change our Federal labor \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow our system of Government to be \nundermined. The Congress makes the laws, and the executive branch \nenforces them.\n  The legislation I propose today will reassert congressional authority \nover Federal labor policy by the only means that we now have, which is \nthe power of the purse. This bill will prohibit the administration from \nspending any appropriated funds to implement or enforce the striker \nreplacement executive order.\n  I hope that my colleagues, whatever their view of the striker \nreplacement issue, will recognize the fundamental, constitutional \nprinciple at stake here and will support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in Federal \n     Contracting Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Fundings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is the role of Congress, as the representative body \n     of the people, to decide the policy of the United States with \n     respect to relations between management and labor; and\n       (2) the executive branch should not use the Federal \n     procurement process to initiate major changes in the labor-\n     management relations of the United States.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the \n     Congress decides important labor-management relations policy \n     by prohibiting the executive branch from spending any \n     appropriated funds for the purpose of implementing an \n     executive order that would debar or in any way limit the \n     right of Federal contractors under common law to use \n     permanent replacements for lawfully striking employees.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMIT ON APPROPRIATED FUNDS.\n\n       None of the funds made available under any appropriations \n     Act for fiscal year 1995 may be used to issue, implement, \n     administer, or enforce any executive order, or other rule, \n     regulation, or order, that limits, restricts, or otherwise \n     affects the ability of any existing or potential Federal \n     contractor, subcontractor, or vendor to hire permanent \n     replacements for lawfully striking employees.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 990. A bill to expand the availability of qualified organizations \nfor frail elderly community projects (Program of All-inclusive Care for \nthe Elderly) [PACE], to allow such organizations, following a trial \nperiod, to become eligible to be providers under applicable titles of \nthe Social Security Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                     the pace provider act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with \nthe distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, the PACE \nProvider Act of 1995. PACE--the Program of All-inclusive Care for the \nElderly--is a cost-effective managed care system pioneered by On Lok \nSenior Health Services in San Francisco.\n  PACE programs provide a comprehensive package of primary acute and \nlong-term care services. All services, including primary and specialty \nmedical care, adult day care, home care, nursing, social work services, \nphysical and occupational therapies, prescription drugs, hospital and \nnursing home care are coordinated and administered by PACE program \nstaff.\n  Mr. President, PACE programs are cost effective in that they are \nreimbursed on a capitated basis, at rates that provide payers savings \nrelative to their expenditures in the traditional Medicare, Medicaid, \nand private pay systems.\n  The PACE Provider Act does not expand the number of individuals \neligible for benefits in any way. Rather, it makes available to \nindividuals already eligible for nursing home care, because of their \npoor health status, a preferable, and less costly alternative.\n  Specifically, the act would increase the number of PACE programs \nauthorized from 15 to 30 in 1995; to 40 in 1996; to 50 in 1997; and to \nan unlimited number in 1998.\n  Mr. President, today, 11 PACE programs provide services to 2,200 \nindividuals in eight States--California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New \nYork, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. At least 45 other \norganizations are actively working to develop PACE in many other \nStates.\n  By expanding the availability of community-based long-term care \nservices, On Lok's success of providing high quality care with an \nemphasis on preventive and supportive services, can be replicated \nthroughout the country. PACE programs have substantially reduced \nutilization of high-cost inpatient services. In turn, dollars that \nwould have been spent on hospital and nursing home services are used to \nexpand the availability of community-based long-term care.\n  Mr. President, analyses of costs for individuals enrolled in PACE \nshow a 5- to 15-percent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending \nrelative to a comparably frail population in the traditional Medicare \nand Medicaid systems.\n  States have voluntarily joined together with community organizations \nto develop PACE programs out of their commitment to developing viable \nalternatives to institutionalization. This is particularly relevant as \nthe demand and responsibility for long-term care expands.\n  Mr. President, as our population ages, we must continue to place a \nhigh priority on long-term care services. Giving our seniors \nalternatives to nursing home care and expanding the choices available, \nis not only cost effective, but will also improve the quality of life \nfor older Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     \n[[Page S 9435]]\n\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``PACE Provider Act of 1995''.\n     SEC. 2. WAIVER AUTHORITY AND PROVIDER ELIGIBILITY FOR PACE \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Trial Periods.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (hereafter for purposes of this Act referred to as the \n     `Secretary') shall grant waivers of certain requirements of \n     titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395 et seq., 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), or of any other \n     applicable title of such Act, to public or nonprofit \n     community-based organizations for a trial period to enable \n     such organizations to demonstrate their capacity to provide \n     comprehensive health care services of proper quality on a \n     cost-effective capitated basis to frail elderly patients at \n     risk of institutionalization. An organization shall be \n     eligible to be a provider under such titles if the \n     organization successfully completes the trial period \n     described in the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Approval of applications.--An appropriately completed \n     application for a waiver under this Act is deemed approved \n     unless the Secretary specifically disapproves it in writing--\n       (A) not later than 90 days after the date the completed \n     application is filed in proper form; or\n       (B) not later than 90 days after the date additional \n     information is provided to the Secretary if the Secretary \n     requests reasonable and substantial additional information \n     during the 90-day period described in subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Sole authority.--The Secretary shall have sole \n     authority to approve or disapprove the eligibility of an \n     organization for a waiver under this Act and shall make such \n     determinations in a timely manner.\n       (4) Consideration of existing sites.--In reviewing an \n     application for a waiver under this Act, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (A) consider whether any existing organization already \n     operates under a waiver granted under this Act in the \n     proposed service area identified in the application; and\n       (B) if the Secretary determines that such an organization \n     exists, assure that the potential population of eligible \n     individuals to be served under the proposed waiver is \n     reasonably sufficient to sustain an additional organization \n     without jeopardizing the economic or service viability of any \n     other organization operating in that service area.\n       (b) Terms and Conditions for Waivers.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided by law or \n     regulation, the terms and conditions of a waiver granted \n     pursuant to this Act shall be substantially equivalent to--\n       (A) the terms and conditions of the On Lok waiver (referred \n     to in section 603(c) of the Social Security Amendments of \n     1983 and extended by section 9220 of the Consolidated Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985), including permitting the \n     organization to assume the full financial risk progressively \n     over the initial 3-year period of the waiver;

42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), \n     and may apply to be recognized as such in accordance with \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary.\n       (2) Requirements.--No organization may be eligible to be a \n     provider under any applicable title of the Social Security \n     Act if--\n       (A) the Secretary specifically and formally finds that \n     projected reimbursement for such organization would not, \n     without any reimbursement modifications specified in the \n     Secretary's finding, result in payments below the projected \n     costs for a comparable population under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.) and the medicaid program under title XIX of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), or under any other applicable title \n     of such Act, or that the care provided by such organization \n     is significantly deficient;

Any such organization may \n     provide additional services as deemed appropriate by the \n     organization for qualified participants without regard to \n     whether such services are specifically reimbursable through \n     capitation payments. To the extent such services, in terms of \n     type or frequency, are not reimbursable, no payments for such \n     services may be required of participants.\n       (2) Exception.--In the case of an organization receiving an \n     initial waiver under this Act on or after October 1, 1995, \n     the Secretary (at the request of the organization) shall not \n     require the organization to provide services under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) on \n     a capitated or other risk basis during the first or second \n     year of the waiver, in order to allow such an organization to \n     progressively assume the financial risk and to acquire \n     experience with such a payment method.\n       (e) Application to On Lok Waivers.--The provisions of this \n     Act also shall apply to an organization operating under the \n     On Lok waiver described in subsection (b)(1)(A).\n       (f) Application of Income and Resources Standards for \n     Certain Institutionalized Spouses.--Section 1924 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-5) (relating to the \n     treatment of income and resources for certain \n     institutionalized spouses) shall apply to any individual \n     receiving services from an organization operating--\n       (1) under a waiver under this Act; or\n       (2) as a provider under title XIX of such Act, after a \n     determination that the organization has successfully \n     completed a trial period under this Act.\n       (g) Promotion of Additional Applications.--The Secretary \n     shall institute an ongoing effort to promote the development \n     of organizations to acquire eligibility, through \n     participation in a trial period under this Act, to become \n     providers under any applicable title of the Social Security \n     Act.\n       (h) Provision of Services to Additional Populations.--\n     Nothing in this Act shall prevent any participating \n     organization from independently developing distinct programs \n     to provide appropriate services to frail populations other \n     than the elderly under any provision of law other than this \n     Act, except where the Secretary finds that the provision of \n     such services impairs the ability of the organization to \n     provide services required for the elderly.\n       (i) Definition of Provider.--The term ``provider'' means a \n     provider of services which--\n       (1) has filed an agreement with the Secretary under section \n     1866 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc);\n       (2) is eligible to participate in a State plan approved \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et \n     seq.); or\n       (3) is eligible to receive payment for such services under \n     any other applicable title of the Social Security Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT RULES.\n\n       Section 1924(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396r-5(a)(5)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Application to individuals receiving services from \n     certain organizations.--This section applies to individuals \n     receiving institutional or noninstitutional services from any \n     organization--\n       ``(A) operating under a waiver under--\n       ``(i) section 603(c) of the Social Security Amendments of \n     1983 (as in effect on the day \n\n[[Page S 9436]]\n     before the date of the enactment of the PACE Provider Act of 1995);\n       ``(ii) section 9412(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1986 (as so in effect); or\n       ``(iii) the PACE Provider Act of 1995; or\n       ``(B) which has become a provider under this title after a \n     determination that the organization has successfully \n     completed a trial period under the PACE Provider Act of \n     1995.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, and other \nstatutes, to extend VA's authority to operate various programs, collect \ncopayments associated with provision of medical benefits, and obtain \nreimbursement from insurance companies for care furnished; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                         veterans' legislation\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 991, a bill to amend title 38, United \nStates Code, and other statutes to extend VA's authority to operate \nvarious programs, collect copayments associated with provision of \nmedical benefits, and obtain reimbursement from insurance companies for \ncare furnished. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this \nlegislation to the President of the Senate by letter dated March 3, \n1995.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act \n     an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 2. Section 1720A(e) is amended by striking ``1995'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``1997''.\n       Sec. 3. Section 1720C(a) is amended by striking ``1995'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``1996''.\n       Sec. 4. Section 1722A(c) is amended by striking ``1998'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``2000''.\n       Sec. 5. (a) Section 1732 is amended--\n       (1) in the heading by striking ``and grants'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (b) and redesignating \n     subsections (c) and (d) as (b) and (c);\n       (3) in subsection (b) as redesignated by striking ``or \n     grant'' both places it appears;\n       (4) in subsection (c) as redesignated by striking ``and to \n     make grants''.\n       (b) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 17 is \n     amended by revising the item relating to section 1732 to read \n     as follows:\n       ``1732. Contracts to provide for the care and treatment of \n           United States veterans by the Veterans Memorial Medical \n           Center''.\n       Sec. 6. Section 3735(c) is amended by striking ``1995'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``1997''.\n       Sec. 7. Section 7451(d)(3)(C)(iii) is amended by striking \n     ``1995'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``1999''.\n       Sec. 8. Section 7618 is amended by striking ``1995'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``1999''.\n       Sec. 9. Section 8169 is amended by striking ``1995'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``1997''.\n       Sec. 10. Section 115(d) of the Veterans' Benefits and \n     Services Act of 1988, Public Law 100-322, is amended by \n     striking ``1995'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``1998''.\n       Sec. 11. Section 7(a) of Public Law 102-54 is amended by \n     striking ``1995'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``1998''.\n       Sec. 12. Section 8013(e) of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508) is amended by \n     striking ``1998'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``2000''.\n       Sec. 13. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may carry out \n     the major medical facility projects for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, and may carry out the major medical \n     facility leases for that Department, for which funds are \n     requested in the budget of the President for Fiscal Year \n     1996, and authorization is required under section 8104(a)(2) \n     of title 38, United States Code.\n       Sec. 14. (a) There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Fiscal Year 1996--\n       (1) $224,800,000 for the major medical facility projects \n     authorized in section 13; and\n       (2) $2,790,000 of the major medical facility leases \n     authorized in section 13.\n       (b) The projects authorized in section 13 may only be \n     carried out using--\n       (1) funds appropriated for fiscal year 1996 pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations in subsection (a);\n       (2) funds appropriated for Construction, Major Projects for \n     any fiscal year that remain available for obligation; and\n       (3) funds appropriated for Construction, Major Projects for \n     any fiscal year for a category of activity not specific to a \n     project.\n       Sec. 15. Section 1710(e)(3) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Hospital and nursing home care and medical services \n     may not be provided under or by virtue of subsection \n     (a)(1)(G) of this section--\n       (A) after December 31, 1996 in the case of a veteran \n     described in paragraph (1)(A);\n       (B) after September 30, 1997 in the case of a veteran \n     described in paragraph (1)(C).''\n       Sec. 16. Section 1712(a)(1)(D) is amended by striking out \n     ``December 31, 1995'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``September 30, 1997''.\n       Sec. 17. Section 1729(a)(2)(E) is amended by striking \n     ``1988'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``2000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 2: Section 2 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1720A to \n     extend through December 31, 1997, VA's authority to contract \n     for care, treatment, and rehabilitative services for eligible \n     veterans suffering from alcohol or drug dependence or abuse \n     disabilities. Section 1720A specifically authorizes VA to \n     contract for the appropriate care with halfway houses, \n     therapeutic communities, psychiatric residential treatment \n     centers, and other community-based treatment facilities. \n     Before October 1, 1997, the Department will complete an \n     evaluation of this program's effectiveness to determine \n     whether it should be permanently authorized. Under existing \n     law, authority to enter into such contracts expires on \n     December 31, 1995.\n       Section 3: Section 3 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1720C(a) to \n     extend through September 30, 1996, VA's authority to conduct \n     its Pilot Program for Noninstitutional Alternatives to \n     Nursing Home Care. Under existing law, authority for this \n     recently implemented pilot program will expire on September \n     30, 1995. The program allows VA to contract for provision of \n     home-based care, and other noninstitutional care for veterans \n     who are either receiving nursing home care or who are in need \n     of nursing home care. Extension of the authority will allow \n     VA to fully assess the cost-effectiveness of the program as \n     an \n\n[[Page S 9437]]\n     inexpensive alternative to costly nursing home care.\n       Section 4: Section 1722A of title 38, United States Code, \n     requires VA to charge a $2 copayment for each 30 day supply \n     of medication furnished to veterans, except service-connected \n     veterans rated at least 50 percent, veterans receiving the \n     medication for a service-connected disability, and \n     nonservice-connected veterans with low incomes. Subsection \n     (c) of section 1722A provides that the copayment requirement \n     will expire on September 30, 1998. Section 4 of this proposal \n     would extend the authority to collect the copayments through \n     September 30, 2000.\n       Section 5: Section 5 would amend section 1732 of title 38, \n     United States Code, to delete all provisions pertaining to \n     authorization of appropriations for VA to make certain grants \n     to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) in the \n     Philippines. For a number of years, section 1732(b) \n     authorized appropriations for VA to make grants to assist the \n     Philippines in the replacement and upgrading of equipment and \n     in rehabilitating the physical plant and facilities of the \n     VMMC. Although the authorization of appropriations expired on \n     September 30, 1990, Congress has continued to appropriate \n     funds for the grants in VA's annual appropriation Act. No \n     funds for the grants are being sought in the President's \n     budget for Fiscal Year 1996. There is no reason to retain the \n     provisions in section 1732, and section 5 would therefore \n     delete them.\n       Section 6: Section 6 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3735(c) to \n     extend through December 31, 1997, VA's authority to sell, \n     lease, or donate certain real property for use by homeless \n     veterans. The law permits VA to convey real property acquired \n     under the Department's home loan guaranty program to \n     nonprofit organizations, states, and local governments which \n     agree to use the property solely as a shelter primarily for \n     homeless veterans and their families. Under existing law, \n     authority for the program will expire on December 31, 1995.\n       Section 7: Section 7 would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7451(d)(3)(C) to extend through April 1, 1999, the \n     authority of VA medical center directors to use nurse \n     anesthetist contract agency compensation data to adjust \n     locality-based nurse anesthetist pay rates where a VA \n     locality survey provides insufficient data. A medical center \n     may use this authority only if, after exhaustion of all \n     available administrative authority, it is unsuccessful in \n     conducting a VA local survey.\n       Section 8: Section 8 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7618 to \n     extend through fiscal year 1999, VA's authority to award \n     scholarships under VA's Health Professional Scholarship \n     Program. The program assists VA in recruiting and retaining \n     various health professionals, most notably nurses, physical \n     therapists, occupational therapists, nurse anesthetists, and \n     respiratory therapists. VA furnishes students in the above \n     professions with scholarships during the final year or two of \n     their educational program. In return, the student agrees to \n     work for VA for a specified period of obligated service. \n     Under existing law, authority for the scholarship program \n     will expire on December 31, 1995.\n       Section 9: Section 9 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8169 to \n     extend through December 31, 1997, authority for VA's \n     enhanced-use leasing program. Under the program, the \n     Secretary may enter into long-term leases of VA real property \n     and in return, obtain goods and services from the lessee with \n     little or no expenditure of appropriated funds. For example, \n     VA might lease real property to a 3rd party who constructs a \n     nursing home on the property, and agrees to provide VA with a \n     certain number of nursing home beds at a discount rate. \n     During the next two fiscal years, VA will complete a report \n     evaluating the cost effectiveness of this program. Under \n     existing law, authority for the enhanced-use leasing program \n     will expire on December 31, 1995.\n       Section 10: Section 10 would amend section 115(d) of Public \n     Law 100-322 to extend through September 30, 1998, authority \n     for VA's pilot program to assist homeless chronically \n     mentally ill veterans. Under this widely recognized program, \n     VA conducts outreach among homeless veterans, and furnishes \n     residential care to those who are chronically mentally ill. \n     Care is primarily furnished on a contract basis. Under \n     existing law, authority for the program will expire September \n     30, 1995.\n       Section 11: Section 11 would amend section (7)(a) of Public \n     Law 102-54 to extend through September 30, 1998, authority \n     for VA's compensated Work Therapy/Therapeutic Residence \n     Program. This program permits VA to operate transitional \n     housing for veterans who are participating in VA's \n     compensated work therapy program. It serves many veterans who \n     are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, and who suffer \n     from substance abuse disabilities. Under existing law, \n     authority for the program will expire September 30, 1995.\n       Section 12: Section 8013 of Public Law 101-508 amended 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1710 to expand the categories of veterans \n     required to agree to pay copayments in order to receive VA \n     health-care benefits. That law also imposed additional new \n     copayments on certain veterans amounting to $10 per day for \n     hospital care, and $5 per day for nursing home care. \n     Subsection (e) of section 8013 originally provided that the \n     changes made by the section would expire on September 30, \n     1991, but that date has subsequently been extended several \n     times. Most recently, section 12002 of Public Law 103-66 \n     extended the provisions to September 30, 1998. Section 12 of \n     the draft bill would extend the provision for two years to \n     September 30, 2000.\n       Section 13: Section 13 would authorize the VA to undertake \n     the major medical facility construction and leasing projects \n     requested in the President's Fiscal Year 1996 budget.\n       Section 14: Section 14 would authorize appropriations of \n     $224,800,000 to carry out the major medical facility \n     construction projects authorized in section 13, and \n     $2,790,000 for the leases authorized in section 13.\n       Section 15: Section 15 would extend the expiration dates \n     for the authority provided in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710(a)(1)(G). \n     Section 1710(a)(1)(G) requires VA to furnish needed hospital \n     and nursing home care in three unique situations described in \n     section 1710(e). First, VA must furnish such care for \n     disorders possibly associated with exposure to ionizing \n     radiation from nuclear testing, or from participation in the \n     American occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of \n     World War II. Second, VA must provide care to Vietnam \n     veterans for disabilities which may be associated with \n     exposure to dioxin or a toxic substance found in herbicides \n     used in Vietnam. Third, subsection (e) provides that VA shall \n     furnish hospital and nursing home care to Persian Gulf \n     veterans for disabilities possibly related to exposure to a \n     toxic substance or environmental hazard during Gulf service.\n       The authority to provide care for disorders possibly \n     associated with exposure to ionizing radiation will expire on \n     June 30, 1995. Section 2 would make permanent the requirement \n     that VA furnish such care. The authority to provide care for \n     disorders associated with exposure to dioxin or a toxic \n     substance found in a herbicide will expire on June 30, 1995. \n     Section 15 would extend that authority through December 31, \n     1995. Finally, the requirement that VA provide care to \n     Persian Gulf veterans exposed to a toxic substance or \n     environmental hazard expires on September 30, 1995. Section \n     15 would extend the authority through September 30, 1997.\n       Section 16: Section 16 would extend provisions of 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1712 which require VA to provide priority outpatient \n     care to Persian Gulf veterans for disabilities possibly \n     related\n      to exposure to a toxic substance or environmental hazard \n     during Gulf service. Under current law, the authority to \n     furnish such priority care will expire on September 30, \n     1995. Section 16 would extend the authority for two years \n     through September 30, 1997.\n       Section 17: Section 1729 of title 38, United States Code, \n     authorizes VA to recover or collect from insurance companies, \n     the reasonable cost of care it furnishes to a veteran for a \n     nonservice-connected disability. VA may collect or recover to \n     the extent the veteran would be eligible to receive payment \n     for such care from the insurance company. VA may not collect \n     for care furnished for a service-connected disability. If the \n     veteran has a service-connected disability, and receives care \n     for a nonservice-connected disability, section 1729 \n     authorizes VA to recover from the insurance company, but that \n     authority currently exists only through September 30, 1998. \n     Section 17 would extend that authority for two additional \n     years through September 30, 2000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore, Jr.,\n     President, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill, ``To amend title 38, United States Code, and other \n     statutes, to extend VA's authority to operate various \n     programs, collect copayments associated with provision of \n     medical benefits, and obtain reimbursement from insurance \n     companies for care furnished.'' We request that it be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       Authority for a number of important VA health care programs \n     are time limited and will soon expire. Some of the programs \n     provide veterans with needed benefits; others provide \n     mechanisms by which the Government obtains funding to help \n     defray the cost of providing nonservice-connected health care \n     benefits. The Department has assessed the continuing need for \n     these programs and authorities in the development of the \n     President's budget for fiscal year 1996, and has determined \n     that extensions of the expiring authorities are warranted. \n     Also included in the draft bill are the Administration's \n     proposals for major medical facility construction projects \n     and leases. We urge that Congress act favorably on this \n     measure.\n\n\n                         cost-saving provisions\n\n       In 1986, Congress first authorized VA to begin collecting \n     funds from insurance companies for the cost of care furnished \n     to nonservice-connected veterans who have health insurance. \n     The law permits VA to recover to the extent the veteran would \n     otherwise be eligible to recover. In 1990, Congress extended \n     the authority to collect to\n      insured service-connected veterans who receive care for \n     nonservice-connected conditions. However, that authority \n     will expire on September 30, 1998.\n       Similarly in 1990, laws were enacted requiring VA to impose \n     certain new copayments on veterans to help defray the cost of \n     delivering care. VA is required to charge a $2 copayment for \n     each 30 day supply of medication furnished to veterans, \n     except service-connected veterans rated at least 50 percent \n     disabled, veterans receiving the medication for a service-\n     connected disability, and nonservice-connected veterans with \n     low incomes. Additionally, the law requires veterans with \n     relatively higher incomes, who have \n\n[[Page S 9438]]\n     no service-connected disabilities, to pay copayments amounting to $10 \n     per day for hospital care, and $5 per day for nursing home \n     care. These copayment requirements will expire on September \n     30, 1998.\n       The draft bill would extend the foregoing authorities \n     through Fiscal Year 2000.\n       Extension of the 3rd party insurance recovery provision \n     would result in saving of $312.5 million in Fiscal Year 1999, \n     and $318.8 million in Fiscal Year 2000. Extension of the \n     copayment provisions would result in savings of $39.4 million \n     in both Fiscal Year 1999, and Fiscal Year 2000.\n\n\n                     special treatment authorities\n\n       The draft bill would also continue VA's special authority \n     to provide hospital and nursing home care in three unique \n     situations. First, it would permanently authorize treatment \n     for disorders which may be associated with exposure to \n     ionizing radiation following the detonation of the two bombs \n     in Japan, and during subsequent nuclear weapons testing. It \n     would extend through December 3, 1996, the authority to treat \n     Vietnam veterans for disabilities which may be associated \n     with exposure to Agent Orange. It would extend through \n     September 30, 1997, the authority to treat Persian Gulf \n     veterans for disorders which may be associated with exposure \n     to environmental contaminants during service in the Gulf.\n       In 1981, Congress first authorized VA to provide treatment \n     for disorders possibly associated with exposure to ionizing \n     radiation from nuclear testing, or from participation in the \n     American occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of \n     World War II. Congress initially authorized treatment while \n     scientific studies took place to more clearly determine the \n     effects of exposure. The authority has been extended several \n     times. Over the years, scientific evidence has been amassed \n     linking various cancers to exposure to radiation. Given the \n     current state of knowledge about diseases related to exposure \n     to radiation, permanent treatment authority is warranted, as \n     provided in the draft bill.\n       In 1981, Congress also first authorized VA to treat Vietnam \n     veterans for disabilities which may be associated with \n     exposure to dioxin or a toxic substance found in herbicides \n     used in Vietnam. The authority was time limited, but has been \n     extended on several occasions as scientific work has \n     continued regarding disorders which may be associated with \n     exposure. For some time, the National Academy of Sciences \n     (NAS) has been conducting a study of the matter. The NAS \n     released preliminary findings of its work in 1993, and is \n     scheduled to provide a further report to VA in late 1995. \n     That report may provide VA with information to better tie the \n     treatment authority to specific disorders that may have \n     resulted from exposure. Until that time, it is appropriate to \n     extend the blanket treatment authority. The draft bill would \n     extend the existing authority through December 31, 1996, a \n     period sufficient to allow VA officials time to receive and \n     assess the NAS report, and determine what further legislative \n     action is needed.\n       In 1993, Congress authorized the Secretary to provide care \n     to Persian Gulf veterans for disabilities possibly related to \n     exposure to a toxic substance or environmental hazard during \n     Gulf service. The authority is needed to care\n      for veterans while the scientific community seeks answers to \n     questions about what might be causing illnesses and \n     conditions experienced by some Persian Gulf veterans. At \n     this time research is continuing. Until further work is \n     completed, VA's authority to provide priority care to \n     effected veterans should be extended. The draft bill would \n     extend the authority for two years. The estimated cost of \n     this provision is $36 million for Fiscal Year 1996.\n\n\n          noninstitutional care and programs for the homeless\n\n       The draft bill would extend five separate programs which \n     provide noninstitutional care or facilitate care of the \n     homeless and those suffering from substance abuse \n     disabilities. Since 1980, VA has had authority to contract \n     for care, treatment and rehabilitative services for eligible \n     veterans suffering from alcohol or drug dependence \n     disabilities. The Department contracts for these services \n     with halfway houses, therapeutic communities, psychiatric \n     residential treatment centers, and other community-based \n     treatment facilities. Begun as a time limited pilot program, \n     the contract authority has been extended several times. The \n     draft bill would extend this program through December 31, \n     1997. By that date, VA will have completed a study evaluating \n     the effectiveness of this program to determine whether it \n     should be permanently authorized. The estimated costs of this \n     provision are $9.5 million in Fiscal Year 1996.\n       The draft bill would also extend, through Fiscal Year 1996, \n     authority for a pilot program which allows VA to contract for \n     provision of home-based care for veterans who are receiving \n     nursing home care or are in need of nursing home care. \n     Continued authority is needed to allow VA to fully assess the \n     cost effectiveness of the program as an alternative to \n     expensive nursing home care. The Department will complete a \n     report evaluating the effectiveness of this program. The \n     estimated costs of this provision are $17.3 million in Fiscal \n     Year 1996.\n       Authority for VA's two most prominent programs to assist \n     homeless veterans will expire in 1995 and must be extended. \n     Under the well known Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill \n     Veterans (HCMI) Program, VA outreach teams work with veterans \n     in the streets, and assist those who are eligible to enter \n     into a contract residential treatment program. The estimated \n     cost of this program is $28 million in Fiscal Year 1996, and \n     $88.2 million over three fiscal years. Under the Compensated \n     Work Therapy/Therapeutic Residence (CWT/TR) Program, VA \n     operates transitional housing for veterans who participate in \n     VA's compensated work therapy programs during the day. \n     Participants work in the community pursuant to contracts VA \n     has with private entities, and use their earnings to pay rent \n     for the transitional housing. The estimated operating cost of \n     this program is $6.9 million in Fiscal Year 1996, and $21.5 \n     million over three fiscal years. The draft bill would extend \n     authority for both programs through September 30, 1998.\n       The bill would also extend through December 31, 1997, VA's \n     authority to sell, lease, or donate certain real property for \n     use by homeless veterans. The authority permits VA to convey \n     real property acquired under the Department's home loan \n     guaranty program to nonprofit organizations, states, and \n     local governments which agree to use the property solely as \n     shelter primarily for homeless veterans and their families.\n\n\n                       administrative provisions\n\n       The draft bill would extend for two more years, VA's \n     enhanced-use leasing program. The program permits the \n     Secretary to enter into long-term leases of VA real property \n     and in return, obtain goods and services from the lessee with \n     little or no expenditure of appropriated funds. For example, \n     VA might lease real property to a 3rd party who constructs a \n     nursing home on the property, and agrees to\n      provide VA with a certain number of nursing home beds at a \n     discount rate. During the next two years, the Department \n     will complete a study evaluating the cost-effectiveness of \n     this program to determine whether it should be continued \n     beyond Fiscal Year 1997. Enactment of the measure will not \n     result in new costs.\n       VA also proposes extension of the Health Professional \n     Scholarship Program. The program assists in recruiting and \n     retaining various health professionals, most notably nurses, \n     physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurse \n     anesthetists, and respiratory therapists. VA furnishes \n     students in the above professions with scholarships during \n     the final year or two of their educational program. In \n     return, the student agrees to work for VA for a specified \n     period of obligated service. The estimated costs of the \n     extension are $10.4 million in Fiscal Year 1996, and $41.6 \n     million for the four year extension.\n       Finally, the bill would extend for four more years a sunset \n     provision in VA's authority to use nurse anesthetist contract \n     data in adjusting VA locality nurse anesthetist salaries. \n     There would be no additional costs associated with this \n     measure.\n\n\n                              philippines.\n\n       The draft bill includes provisions to repeal statutory \n     language authorizing appropriations for grants to the \n     Philippine government for upgrading equipment and making \n     improvements at the Veterans Memorial Medial Center (VMMC). \n     VA has long made grants to the Philippine-run hospital which \n     has served both Filipino veterans and those Filipinos who are \n     United States veterans. The law authorizing appropriations \n     for the grants expired in 1990. Subsequent to that, grants \n     were made because Congress continued to appropriate funds for \n     the grants. United States veteran admissions to the VMMC have \n     been suspended due to many problems and deficiencies in the \n     physical plant and equipment. Therefore, no funds are being \n     sought in the President's 1996 budget, and there is no reason \n     to retain the authorization language in the law.\n\n\n                        Construction and leases\n\n       As a final matter, the draft bill includes language that \n     would authorize those major medical construction projects and \n     leases proposed in the President's Fiscal Year 1996 budget \n     that must be specifically authorized by law. It would \n     authorize $224.8 million for six construction projects, and \n     $2.79 million for two leases. The six construction projects \n     are construction of a new medical center and nursing home in \n     Brevard County, Florida, renovation of nursing home units in \n     Lebanon, Pennsylvania, environmental improvements in Marion, \n     Illinois and Salisbury, North Carolina and replacement or \n     renovation of psychiatric beds in Marion, Indiana, and Perry \n     Point, Maryland. The two leases are for a satellite \n     outpatient clinic in Bay Pines, Florida, and a footwear \n     center in New York City.\n       The estimated costs for the various programs being extended \n     have been provided to the extent they are available. \n     Extension of the programs will not result in new costs. \n     Sections 4 and 12 of the draft bill--provisions extending \n     certain copayments for veterans medical services--would \n     increase receipts. Therefore, the draft bill is subject to \n     the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The copayment provisions \n     would result in pay-as-you-go savings of $39.4 million in \n     each of Fiscal Years 1999-2000. In addition, sections 6 and \n     9--provisions extending certain leasing authorities--are also \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA because they \n     affect both direct spending and receipts. In total, the pay-\n     as-you-go effect of the leasing provisions in zero.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of the draft \n     bill to \n\n[[Page S 9439]]\n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the program of \n     the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 992. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase, \neffective as of December 1, 1995, the rates of disability compensation \nfor veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of \ndependency and indemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n    the veterans' compensation cost-of-living adjustment act of 1995\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 992, a bill entitled the ``Veterans' \nCompensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995,'' to amend title \n38, United States Code, to increase, effective as of December 1, 1995, \nthe rates of disability compensation for veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity \ncompensation for survivors of such veterans, and for other purposes. \nThe Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the \nPresident of the Senate by letter dated March 1, 1995.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' \n     Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995.''\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RATES AND LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, \n     as provided in paragraph (2), increase, effective December 1, \n     1995, the rates of and limitations on Department of Veterans \n     Affairs disability compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation.\n       (2)(A) The Secretary shall increase each of the rates and \n     limitations in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and \n     1314 of title 38, United States Code, that were increased by \n     the amendments made by the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\n     Living Adjustment Act of 1994 (Public Law No. 103-418; 108 \n     Stat. 4336). This increase shall be made in such rates and \n     limitations as in effect on November 30, 1995, and except as \n     provided in subparagraph (B) shall be by the same percentage \n     that benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective \n     December 1, 1995, as a result of a determination under \n     section 215(I) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(I)).\n       (B) For purposes of this subsection, as well as for \n     purposes of any cost-of-living adjustment in rates of \n     dependency and indemnity compensation enacted for fiscal \n     years 1997 through 2000, the amount of any increase in the \n     rates of dependency and indemnity compensation in effect \n     under section 1311(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, \n     will be equal to 50 percent of the amount (rounded down, if \n     not an even dollar amount, to the next lower dollar) by which \n     the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation in effect \n     under section 1311(a)(1) increases.\n       (C) In the computation of increased rates and limitations \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A), and for purposes of computing \n     any cost-of-living adjustment in such rates and limitations \n     enacted for fiscal years 1997 through 2000, any amount which \n     as so computed is not an even multiple of $1 shall be rounded \n     down to the next lower whole-dollar amount.\n       (b) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a)(2)(A) and (C), the rates of disability \n     compensation payable to persons within the purview of section \n     10 of Public Law No. 85-857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in \n     receipt of compensation payable pursuant to chapter 11 of \n     title 38, United States Code.\n       (c) Publication Requirement.--At the same time as the \n     matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be \n     published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(I) of such Act during fiscal year 1995, the Secretary \n     shall publish in the Federal Register the rates and \n     limitations referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) as increased \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF LIMITATION ON PENSION FOR CERTAIN \n                   RECIPIENTS OF MEDICAID-COVERED NURSING-HOME \n                   CARE.\n\n       Section 5503(f)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``September 30, 1998'' and inserting \n     in lieu thereof ``September 30, 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF ``SUNSET'' LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) Subsection (g) of section 5317 of Title 38, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking out ``1998'' and \n     inserting ``2000'' in lieu thereof.\n       (b) Subparagraph (D) of section 6103(1)(7) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by deleting ``1998'' in the \n     penultimate sentence and inserting ``2000'' in lieu thereof.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. This section contains the short title of the \n     bill, the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Act of \n     1995.''\n       Section 2. This section authorizes a December 1, 1995 COLA \n     in disability compensation and DIC rates for surviving \n     spouses and children. Most rates would increase by the same \n     percentage as Social Security rates will effective the same \n     date. The only exception is for ``grandfathered'' DIC \n     recipients, i.e. certain surviving spouses of veterans who \n     died before 1993. These rates would increase by one-half the \n     dollar amount of the increase in the basic DIC rate for \n     survivors of veterans whose deaths occurred during or after \n     1993. All rate computations would be rounded down to even-\n     dollar amounts. Provisions for rounding down the COLA \n     computations and limiting to one-half the COLA for certain \n     DIC recipients would also be made to apply to any FY 1997-\n     2000 COLA's in these rates.\n       Section 3. This provision extends for 2 years, until \n     September 30, 2000, the provision in law (38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5503(f)) which limits to $90 the payment of VA pension \n     to patients receiving Medicaid-covered nursing-home care who \n     have no dependents.\n       Section 4. This provision would extend for 2 years, until \n     September 30, 2000, the authority of VA to access unearned \n     income information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n     and wage and self-employment income information from the \n     Social Security Administration (SSA) for purposes of income \n     verification in determining eligibility for VA means-tested \n     benefits such as pension and medical care.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill to authorize an FY 1996 cost-of-living adjustment in the \n     rates of disability compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation, and for other purposes. I request that this \n     bill be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       Section 2 of this bill would provide a cost-of-living \n     increase, effective December 1, 1995, in the rates of \n     compensation for service-disabled veterans and of dependency \n     and indemnity compensation (DIC) for the survivors of \n     veterans who die as a result of service. The rate of increase \n     would in most respects be the same as the cost-of-living \n     adjustment (COLA) that will be provided under current law to \n     veterans' pension and Social Security recipients, currently \n     estimated to be 3.1 percent.\n       Compensation under title 38, United States Code, is payable \n     only for disabilities resulting from injuries or diseases \n     incurred or aggravated during active service. Payments are \n     based upon a statutory schedule of rates which vary with the \n     degree of disability assigned by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA), and additional amounts are payable to veterans \n     with spouses and children if the veteran's disability is \n     rated 30-percent or more disabling. DIC benefits are payable \n     at statutorily directed rates to the surviving spouses or \n     children of veterans who die of service-connected causes, or \n     who die of other causes if they suffered service-connected \n     total disability for prescribed periods immediately preceding \n     their deaths. This proposed cost-of-living increase will \n     protect these benefits against the eroding effects of \n     inflation.\n       Two features of this COLA proposal, as outlined in the \n     President's FY 1996 budget request, would substantially \n     reduce its cost. First, we propose that the dollar increase \n     in rates of DIC payable for certain pre-1993 deaths, i.e., \n     those rates which exceed the rate payable for deaths \n     occurring during and after 1993, be only 50% of the dollar \n     increase in the rate for the later-occurring deaths. Such a \n     limitation, which was also a feature of the December 1, 1993 \n     COLA, would lessen the disparities in rates payable to these \n     two categories of beneficiaries. Second, under our proposal, \n     in computing the higher compensation and DIC rates, VA would \n     be required to round down to the next lower whole dollar any \n     computations which yielded amounts not evenly divisible by \n     $1. This polity is consistent with both the 1993 and 1994 \n     COLA's.\n       The two limiting features would be effective for each \n     year's COLA beginning in FY 1996 through 2000. Our proposal \n     would reduce FY 1996 costs by $29 million and five-year (FY \n     1996-2000) costs by $582 million. Net costs of the FY 1996 \n     COLA would be an estimated \n\n[[Page S 9440]]\n     $340 million in FY 1996 and $1.969 billion over five years.\n       Section 3 of our bill would extend, through FY 2000, the \n     $90 limitation on monthly VA pension payments that may be \n     made to beneficiaries, without dependents, who are receiving \n     Medicaid-covered nursing-home care. The current payment \n     limitation, which is due to expire at the end of FY 1998, \n     works to the advantage of these nursing-home residents \n     because it permits them to keep the $90 to apply toward \n     personal expenses rather than have it ``pass through'' the \n     homes to the Medicaid program. We estimate this two-year \n     extension would result in VA savings of $497.2 million in FY \n     1999 and a total of $1 billion during FY's 1999 and 2000.\n       The final provision in our bill, Section 4, would amend \n     titles 26 and 38, United States Code, to extend certain \n     income verification provisions of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n       This section would extend he current September 30, 1998, \n     ``sunset'' limitation on VA access to Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) income \n     information until September 30, 2000. Experience has shown \n     that authority to match unearned income information from IRS \n     and wage and self-employment income information from SSA with \n     VA data for purposes of income verification in determining \n     eligibility for or the proper amount of VA means-tested \n     benefits has been an effective savings measure.\n       The amendment would permit VA to continue its proven \n     techniques. In the compensation and pension category of VA \n     means-tested benefits, savings are estimated to total $89.4 \n     million in FY 1999 and FY 2000.\n       The ability to match income information improves integrity \n     in the pension program by reducing overpayments that occur \n     when self-reported income is the only information used to \n     verify eligibility. In this regard, we note that authority to \n     match income information with IRS and SSA has had a \n     significant program-abuse deterrent effect.\n       Certain medical-care eligibility is also means tested. \n     Continuation of authority to match income information in that \n     program would allow VA to more effectively identify and \n     collect copayments from higher income veterans. The combined \n     savings in FY 1999 and FY 2000 are estimated to total $88.1 \n     million. Combining the VA means-tested benefits categories of \n     medical care and compensation and pension, it is estimated \n     that a total of $177.5 million could be saved in FY 1999 and \n     FY 2000 with the extension of the ``sunset'' limitation.\n       The bills' provisions to round down benefits, provide a \n     half COLA for certain DIC recipients, limit pensions for \n     certain veterans in nursing homes, and the income \n     verification proposals would result in pay-as-you-go savings \n     as noted above.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the transmittal of this draft \n     bill to Congress and that its enactment would be in accord \n     with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 993. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \ncost-savings in the housing loan program for veterans, to limit cost-\nof-living increases for Montgomery GI bill benefits, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n    the veterans' housing loan program and montgomery gi bill cost-\n                         reduction act of 1995\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans' Affairs, S. 993, a bill entitled the ``Veterans' \nHousing Loan Program and Montgomery GI Bill Cost-Reduction Act of \n1995,'' to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for cost-\nsavings in the housing loan program for veterans, to limit cost-of-\nliving increases for Montgomery GI Bill benefits, and for other \npurposes. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation \nto the President of the Senate by letter dated March 2, 1995.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled. That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Housing Loan Program and \n     Montgomery GI Bill Cost-Reduction Act of 1995''.\n\n                         TITLE I--HOUSING LOANS\n\n     SEC. 101. REPEAL OF LOAN DEBT COLLECTION RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) Subchapter III of chapter 37 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking out section 3726 in its \n     entirety.\n       (b) The table of sections for such subchapter is amended by \n     striking out:\n\n``3726. Withholding of payments, benefits, etc.''\n\n     and inserting in lieu thereof:\n\n``[3726. Repealed.]''.\n     SEC. 102. MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN DOWNPAYMENT AND FEE.\n\n       (a) Section 3712(c)(5) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``95'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``90''.\n       (b) Section 3729(a)(2)(A) of title 38, United States Code, \n     is amended by:\n       (1) inserting ``(i)'' immediately after ``(A)'';\n       (2) striking out ``of this title or for any purpose \n     specified in section 3712 (other than section \n     3712(a)(1)(F))'';\n       (3) inserting ``or'' immediately after ``amount;''; and\n       (4) inserting at the end thereof the following new clause.\n       ``(ii) in the case of a loan made for any purpose specified \n     in section 3712 (other than section 3712(a)(1)(F)) of this \n     title, the amount of the fee shall be two percent of the \n     total loan amount;''.\n       (c) Section 3729(a)(2)(D)(ii) of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking out ``one'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof ``two''.\n       (d) The amendments made by this section shall apply to all \n     loans closed on or after October 1, 1995.\n\n     SEC. 103. EXTENSION OF LOAN FEE INCREASE.\n\n       Section 3729(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``1998,'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``2000,''.\n\n     SEC. 104. EXTENSION OF FEE FOR MULTIPLE USE OF LOAN \n                   ENTITLEMENT.\n\n       Section 3729(a)(5)(C) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``1998.'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``2000.''.\n\n     SEC. 105. EXTENSION OF NO-BID FORMULA.\n\n       Section 3732(c)(11) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``1998.'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``2000.''.\n\n                      Title II--MONTGOMERY GI BILL\n\n     SEC. 201. LIMITATION REGARDING COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR \n                   MONTGOMERY GI BILL BENEFITS.\n\n       For Fiscal Year 1996 and each subsequent fiscal year \n     through 2000, the cost-of-living adjustments in the rates of \n     educational assistance payable under chapter 30 of title 38, \n     United States Code, and under chapter 1606 of title 10, \n     United States Code, shall be the percentage equal to 50 \n     percent of the percentage by which such assistance would be \n     increased under section 3015(g) of title 38, and under \n     section 1631(b)(2) of title 10, United States Code, \n     respectively, but for this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         Title I--Housing Loans\n\n       Section 101. Repeal of Loan Debt Collection Restrictions: \n     Subsection (a) would repeal 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3726. Section 3726 \n     currently prohibits VA, in most cases, from offsetting \n     against Federal payments, other than VA benefits, debts owed \n     to the Government resulting from the foreclosure of VA \n     guaranteed or direct housing loans. This provision would \n     permit VA to collect these debts by offsetting Federal \n     salaries and income tax refunds as permitted by other Federal \n     debt collection laws. Veterans would have the right to \n     challenge the existence and amount of the debt through VA's \n     normal administrative process, including review by the Court \n     of Veterans Appeals, prior to such offset. Veterans would \n     also be able to seek waiver of the debt if collection would \n     be against equity and good conscience under current law.\n       Subsection (b) would make a conforming change to the table \n     of sections.\n       Section 102. Manufactured Home Loan Downpayment and Fee: \n     Subsection (a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3712(c)(5) to \n     require a 10 percent downpayment on VA guaranteed loans for \n     the purchase of a manufactured home. Current law requires a 5 \n     percent downpayment.\n       Subsection (b) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3729(a)(2)(A) to \n     increase the fee most veterans must pay to VA for obtaining a \n     VA guaranteed loans for the purchase of a manufactured home \n     to 2 percent of the loan amount. The current fee for such a \n     loan is 1 percent. This amendment would not affect the \n     exemption from the fee current law grants to certain disabled \n     veterans and surviving spouses.\n       Subsection (c) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3729(a)(2)(D) to \n     increase the fee veterans whose only qualifying service was \n     in the Selected Reserve must pay to VA for obtaining a VA \n     guaranteed loan for the purchase of a manufactured home to 2 \n     percent of the loan amount. The current fee for such a loan \n     is 1 percent. This amendment would not affect the exemption \n     from the fee current law grants to certain disabled veterans \n     and surviving spouses.\n       Subsection (d) would make these amendments apply to all \n     manufactured home loans closed on or after October 1, 1995.\n       Section 103. Extension of Loan Fee Increase: Would extend \n     for 2 years the sunset of the temporary VA loan fee increase. \n     Section 12007(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1993 increased by 75 basis \n\n[[Page S 9441]]\n     points, or 0.75 percent of the loan amount, the fee that veterans must \n     pay to VA for most VA guaranteed housing loans. This increase \n     is now set to expire on September 30, 1998. This amendment \n     would continue the increased fees for all loans closed \n     through the end of Fiscal Year 2000.\n       Section 104. Extension of Fee for Multiple Use of Loan \n     Entitlement: Would extend for 2 years the sunset of the fee \n     for multiple use of VA housing loan benefits. Section \n     12007(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     imposed a fee of 3 percent of the loan on veterans who had \n     previously obtained a VA home loan. This fee does not apply \n     to certain refinancing loans or to loans where veterans make \n     a downpayment of 5 percent of more. The multiple use fee is \n     now set to expire on September 30, 1998. This amendment would \n     continue this fee for all loans closed through the end of \n     Fiscal Year 2000.\n       Section 105. Extension of No-Bid Formula: Would extend for \n     2 years the sunset of the VA ``no-bid formula'' contained in \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 3732(c). This formula determines VA's \n     liability to a loan holder under the guaranty and whether or \n     not the holder would have the election to convey the property \n     to the VA following the foreclosure. As amended by section \n     12006 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the \n     no-bid formula requires VA to consider, in addition to other \n     costs, VA's loss on the resale of the property. The no-bid \n     formula applies to all loans closed before October 1, 1998, \n     regardless of the date the loan is terminated. This amendment \n     would make the formula apply to all loans closed before \n     October 1, 2000.\n\n\n                      Title II--Montgomery GI Bill\n\n       Section 201. Limitation Regarding Cost-of-Living \n     Adjustments for Montgomery GI Bill Benefits: Would limit by \n     half the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) payable to \n     participants in the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) (chapter 30 of \n     title 38 and chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code) \n     for Fiscal Years 1996 through 2000. The MGIB currently \n     provides that the monthly rate of basic educational \n     assistance shall be subject to an annual COLA based on the \n     Consumer Price Index. Section 12009 of the Veterans' \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 limited the MGIB COLA for Fiscal \n     Year 1995 to 50 percent of the otherwise mandated adjustment \n     (i.e., increase). This section would continue that 50 percent \n     reduction of the annual COLA through Fiscal Year 2000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                        Washington, March 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmitted herewith is a draft bill \n     ``To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for cost-\n     savings in the housing loan program for veterans, to limit \n     cost-of-living increases for Montgomery GI Bill benefits, and \n     for other purposes.'' This bill would implement several cost-\n     savings proposals contained in the President's budget for \n     Fiscal Year 1996. I request that this measure be referred to \n     the appropriate committee and promptly enacted.\n       Title I of this draft bill, entitled the ``Veterans' \n     Housing Loan Program and Montgomery GI Bill Cost-Reduction \n     Act of 1995,'' would make amendments to the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) housing loan guaranty program to reduce \n     the costs of this program, while continuing to provide \n     eligibility for all veterans. In brief, the bill would extend \n     for 2 years; i.e., until September 30, 2000, three cost-\n     savings measures enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1993 and increase the downpayment and fee required for \n     VA guaranteed manufactured housing loans. In addition, this \n     bill would repeal a restriction on the collection of debts \n     owed to the Government arising from the loan program.\n       The VA home loan program has been and continues to be of \n     great importance to present and former members of the \n     Nation's Armed Forces who seek to become homeowners. We are \n     mindful that the cost to the taxpayers of operating the \n     program and paying claims on loans resulting in foreclosure \n     are significant. Since the loan guaranty program provides a \n     unique benefit for a select group of beneficiaries, we \n     believe the measures proposed are reasonable, and are \n     necessary to preserve this important benefit.\n       Title II of the draft bill would continue through Fiscal \n     Year 2000 the limitation on cost-of-living adjustments under \n     the Montgomery GI Bill enacted by the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993.\n       A detailed section-by-section analysis of the draft bill is \n     enclosed. We are also enclosing an analysis of changes \n     proposed to be made in existing law by title I of the draft \n     bill (title II of the bill does not amend any current \n     provision of the United States Code).\n       VA estimates that enactment of title I of this bill would \n     produce a savings of approximately $0.02 million of budget \n     authority and $89.64 million in outlays in Fiscal Year 1996, \n     and a 5-year savings of approximately $372.02 million in \n     budget authority and $461.64 million in outlays. The 5-year \n     savings includes a saving of $371.90 million in the Guaranty \n     and Indemnity Program subsidy (which includes the interactive \n     effects of the extension of the three sunsets) and $0.12 \n     million in the Loan Guaranty Program subsidy.\n       Enactment of title II would produce savings in Fiscal Year \n     1996 of approximately $12.55 million, and a 5-year savings of \n     $202.17 million.\n       The bill's provisions affecting VA's home loan program and \n     title II's limitation on cost-of-living adjustments under the \n     Montgomery GI Bill would result in pay-as-you-go savings as \n     noted above.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the transmittal of the draft \n     bill to Congress and that its enactment would be in accord \n     with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 994.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 994, a bill to clarify the \neligibility of certain minors for burial in national cemeteries. The \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the \nPresident of the Senate by letter dated May 10, 1995.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Section 1. That paragraph (5) of section 2402, title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding the following at the \n     end thereof: ``For purposes of this paragraph, a `minor \n     child' is a child under 21 years of age, or under 23 years of \n     age if pursuing a course of instruction at an approved \n     educational institution.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                         Washington, May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill to clarify the eligibility of veteran's children for \n     burial in our national cemeteries. I request that this bill \n     be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       Among those eligible for interment in the National Cemetery \n     System under section 2402 of title 38, United States Code, \n     are the minor children of veterans and certain others \n     eligible for national cemetery burial. The term ``minor \n     child'' is not defined in the statute.\n       When Congress enacted the National Cemeteries Act of 1973, \n     transferring from the Department of the Army to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the responsibility for \n     operating national cemeteries, it reenacted without change \n     the prior title 24 provisions regarding eligibility. The \n     Department of the Army, in exercising its authority, had \n     interpreted title 24's ``minor child'' provision as including \n     children under age 21. Because Congress indicated an intent \n     that similar eligibility rules should apply under VA's \n     management of the cemetery system, this Department's \n     regulation at 38 C.F.R. Sec. 1.620(g) governing burial \n     eligibility generally defines a minor child as being under 21 \n     years of age. In keeping with the general definition of a \n     ``child'' for title 38 purposes, the age limit is 23 if the \n     individual was pursuing a course of instruction at an \n     approved educational institution.\n       The present situation occasionally results in confusion \n     since the general title 38 definition of a ``child'' is in \n     one significant respect more restrictive than the regulatory \n     definition of ``minor child'' for purposes of burial \n     eligibility. Under section 101(4) of title 38, an individual \n     is generally not considered a ``child'' after reaching age 18 \n     unless, as indicated above, the individual is pursuing an \n     education. We do not believe Congress intended to restrict \n     burial eligibility in this manner. Accordingly, we are \n     proposing to amend statute governing burial elibility to \n     incorporate the regulatory definition of ``minor child.''\n       Because enactment of our proposal would affect only \n     technical clarification of the law as currently being \n     applied, there would be no attendant costs or savings.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of the draft \n     bill to Congress from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n\n[[Page S 9442]]\n\n  S. 995.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 995, a bill entitled the ``Veterans' \nBenefits Reform Act of 1995,'' to amend title 38, United States Code, \nto restrict payment of a clothing allowance to incarcerated veterans \nand to create a presumption of permanent and total disability for \npension purposes for certain veterans who are patients in a nursing \nhome.

PRESUMPTION OF PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY FOR CERTAIN \n                   VETERANS WHO ARE NURSING-HOME PATIENTS.\n\n       Section 1502(a) of title 38, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting ``is 65 years of age or older and a patient in a \n     nursing home or, regardless of age,'' after ``such a \n     person''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                 Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill entitled the ``Veterans' Benefits Reform Act of 1995.'' \n     I request that this bill be referred to the appropriate \n     committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       Section 2 of the draft bill would amend chapter 53 of title \n     38, United States Code, to restrict the payment of a clothing \n     allowance to incarcerated veterans who are furnished clothing \n     without charge by a penal institution. Under 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1162, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is \n     required to pay a clothing allowance to each veteran who, \n     because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a \n     prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear out or \n     tear the veteran's clothing, or who uses medication \n     prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-\n     connected disability and which causes irreparable damage to \n     the veteran's outergarments. Although 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5313 \n     limits payment of compensation to certain incarcerated \n     veterans, that statute does not restrict payment of the \n     clothing allowance to incarcerated veterans, even though they \n     generally do not pay for their institutional clothing.\n       A clothing allowance for incarcerated veterans is \n     unnecessary where they receive institutional clothing at no \n     personal expense. We therefore recommend legislation to limit \n     payment of the clothing allowance to incarcerated veterans \n     furnished clothing without charge by the institution in which \n     they are incarcerated. This proposal would affect direct \n     spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go \n     requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. \n     This provision would reduce direct spending by less than \n     $500,000 annually.\n       Section 3 of the draft bill would create a presumption of \n     permanent and total disability for pension purposes for \n     veterans 65 years of age or older who are patients in a \n     nursing home. Section 8002 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 1388-342, eliminated \n     the presumption of total disability for pension purposes for \n     persons 65 years of age and older. As a result, it is \n     currently necessary for a VA rating board to evaluate \n     disability before pension can be paid to any veteran, \n     regardless of age or physical condition.\n       We propose that 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(a) be amended to \n     provide, for pension purposes, a presumption of permanent and \n     total disability for persons 65 years of age or older who are \n     patients in a nursing home. Enactment of this amendment would \n     reduce the time necessary to process disability-pension \n     claims because, once a veteran's age and status as a nursing-\n     home patient is confirmed, it would no longer be necessary to \n     develop and evaluate medical evidence regarding the veteran's \n     disability.\n       Adoption of this proposal would not affect the integrity of \n     VA's pension program because an individual 65 years old who \n     is a patient of a nursing home would almost certainly meet \n     the current requirements of section 1502(a), which state that \n     a person is considered to be permanently and totally disabled \n     if he or she is unemployable as a result of disability \n     reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the \n     disabled person or suffers from a disease or disorder which \n     justifies a determination of permanent, total disability. In \n     addition, VA could adopt procedures to reevaluate entitlement \n     to pension in the event a notice of discharge is received \n     from a veteran whose pension is based on age and confinement \n     in a nursing home.\n       Enactment of this proposal would result in estimated \n     administrative cost savings of $304,000 in fiscal year 1996 \n     and $1.6 million for the five-year period fiscal year 1996 \n     through fiscal year 2000.\n       We urge that the House promptly consider and pass these \n     legislative items.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of the draft \n     bill to Congress from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 996.

Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill entitled the ``Veterans' Insurance Reform Act of 1995.'' \n     I request that this bill be referred to the appropriate \n     committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       Section 2 of this draft bill would amend title 38, United \n     States Code, to change the name of the Servicemen's Group \n     Life Insurance program to Servicemembers' Group Life \n     Insurance to reflect gender neutrality.\n       Section 3 of the bill would merge the existing Retired \n     Reservists' Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program \n     into the Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) program. \n     Currently, when members of the Ready Reserve retire with 20 \n     years of service or are transferred to the Retired Reserve \n     under the temporary special retirement authority provided in \n     10 U.S.C. Sec. 1331a, they may continue their SGLI coverage \n     as Retired Reservists' SGLI until they receive their retired \n     pay or reach age 61, whichever comes first. Members of the \n     Ready Reserve who retire with 20 years of service also have \n     the option to convert their SGLI policy to a commercial life \n     insurance policy. We propose to discontinue the Retired \n     Reservists' SGLI program and instead place the insured \n     Retired Reservists in the VGLI program. This proposal would \n     benefit Retired Reservists by making available the lifetime \n     coverage provided under the VGLI program and would save \n     administrative expenses. However, Retired Reservists who are \n     over 44 years of age would have to pay increased premiums for \n     the lifetime VGLI coverage. For example, the monthly premium \n     for $100,000 of SGLI coverage for Retired Reservists who are \n     ages 50-54 is currently $56, and the monthly premium for \n     $100,000 of VGLI coverage for the Retired Reservists who are \n     ages 50-54 would be $65. This proposal would have no adverse \n     effect on any other insured member or on the SGLI or VGLI \n     programs and would involve no cost to the Government.\n       Section 3 would also extend the benefit of VGLI lifetime \n     coverage to members of the Ready Reserve of a uniformed \n     service. When the Veterans' Insurance Act of 1974 was \n     enacted. Congress stated that members of the Ready Reserve \n     who separate with less than 20 years of service would not be \n     eligible to convert their SGLI coverage to VGLI, unless they \n     are disabled and uninsurable at the time of release. This \n     proposal would improve the overall financial performance of \n     the VGLA program by creating an additional pool of potential \n     insureds and involve no cost to the Government. In addition, \n     it would not adversely affect the SGLI or VGLI programs.\n       Section 4 of the draft bill would expand the opportunities \n     of SGLI and VGLI insured to convert their coverage to \n     commercial life insurance. VGLI coverage is provided under a \n     five-year level premium term plan that is renewable every \n     five years for life. Premiums are based on the insured's age \n     at the time of issue and/or renewal and are increased \n     accordingly at the beginning of each five-year renewal \n     period. Although term policies provide low cost coverage for \n     younger insureds, term insurance becomes very expensive for \n     older insureds. Under the current law, VGLI insureds have the \n     option of converting their VGLI coverage to permanent life \n     coverage with the commercial insurance company at \n\n[[Page S 9444]]\n     the end of each five-year term period. A permanent life insurance \n     policy, which provides coverage at a level premium throughout \n     the premium paying period of the policy, is an alternative to \n     the ever-increasing cost of term coverage. Since the cost of \n     the converted policy increases as the insured's age \n     increases, required insureds to delay conversion until the \n     end of the five-year period increases the cost. For example, \n     if a VGLI insured converts his or her policy at age 41, the \n     monthly premium for $100,000 of whole life coverage would be \n     $170. However, under the draft proposal, if the insured were \n     allowed to covert at age 36, rather than waiting until the \n     end of the five-year renewal period, the premium would be \n     $133.\n       For the same reason, the draft bill would also extend this \n     conversion privilege to SGLI insureds at the time of their \n     separation from service. Currently, SGLI insureds must first \n     convert to VGLI and thereafter can convert their\n      VGLI policy to a commercial permanent life policy at the end \n     of their five-year VGLI period. This increases the cost of \n     conversion to a commercial life policy as discussed above.\n       Expansion of the conversion privilege would expand the life \n     insurance options of our insured veteran and lower their cost \n     of conversion to a commercial permanent life policy. We do \n     not anticipate any negative effect on the SGLI or VGLI \n     program or any cost to the Government if this proposal were \n     enacted. However, changing the VGLI conversion features may \n     change the composition of VGLI policyholders and result in a \n     change to premium rates.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of this draft \n     bill to Congress from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n       We urge that the House promptly consider and pass this \n     legislative item.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 997. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the exclusion for amounts received under qualified group \nlegal services plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    the employer-provided group legal services exclusion act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto reinstate, and make permanent, the employee exclusion for amounts \nreceived under qualified employer-provided group legal services plans. \nDuring the 103d Congress I sponsored this legislation along with \nSenators Packwood, Riegle, and Levin. Unfortunately, it was one of the \nextenders that was allowed to expire on June 30, 1992. I believe it is \ntime to reinstate this measure which will provide affordable legal \nservices to individuals and their families who cannot afford a private \nlawyer, and are above the maximum income range to receive a public \ndefender.\n  This bill amends section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code and becomes \neffective for tax years beginning after December 31, 1994. It provides \nthat an employee does not have to pay income and social security taxes \nfor a qualified employer-provided group legal services plan. The annual \npremium is limited to $70 per person. In order to qualify, a plan must \nfulfill certain requirements, one of which states that benefits may not \ndiscriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.\n  The tax exclusion of group legal services is not a new provision. In \nfact, prior to its expiration in June of 1992, employees had been \nallowed to exclude such benefits from their gross income since 1976, \nalbeit through seven extensions from Congress. Making this exclusion \npermanent will be a positive and substantial step forward. Group legal \nservices have provided valuable and necessary assistance to millions of \nAmericans. Today's economic conditions have increased the need of low \nand moderate Americans for legal counsel. Whether its a real estate \ntransaction, preparation of a will, or a simple divorce, Americans are \nfrequently confronted with problems of a legal nature, which makes \naccess to a lawyer indispensable. Employer-provided group legal \nservices are a low cost, effective source for legal assistance.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason why we should not reinstate and \nmake permanent this tax exclusion. By doing so, we remove the burden \nhanging over the businesses that provide these services and the 2.5 \nmillion working Americans who gain access to critical legal services \nthrough these plans.\n  In the past, the Senate repeatedly affirmed its commitment to \nassuring the availability of legal services. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort to reinstate employer-provided group legal \nservices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 997\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF EXCLUSION FOR AMOUNTS \n                   RECEIVED UNDER QUALIFIED GROUP LEGAL SERVICES \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to amounts received under qualified group \n     legal services plans) is amended by striking subsection (e) \n     and by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (e).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1994.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 998. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to terminate \nthe Far West spearmint marketing order, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n     the far west spearmint marketing order termination act of 1995\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to \nend one of the most inequitable and unjust farm policies ever \nconceived. I am introducing a bill that will terminate the Far West \nspearmint marketing order.\n  The Far West marketing order was issued in April 1980 and controls \nproduction in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Utah. The intent, \nat that time, was to include all areas which were currently producing \nor which had the potential to produce spearmint. While there were \nattempts to include Montanans in the process, no one was producing the \ncrop at that time in Montana. Therefore, they had no participation and \nwere not allotted any base for selling the crop. Without the base you \ncan't sell the crop.\n  In the past few years farmers in Montana looking for alternative \ncrops to grow, looking for ways to rotate crops and improve their land, \nhave determined that spearmint would be an ideal crop for many of them. \nAgronomists from Montana State University have shown that we have ideal \nsoils and climate to grow spearmint in parts of our State. Producers in \nnorthwest Montana have been successful producing peppermint since about \nthe time the order was created. Spearmint, due to different agronomic \ncharacteristics, represents a potential crop to use in rotation with \npeppermint to break tough disease cycles. But alas, we cannot plant \nspearmint because we can't sell spearmint oil. Who would want to \nproduce a crop you can't sell.\n  At it's inception, the order covered the majority of spearmint oil \nproduced and consumed in the United States. Today, nearly 50 percent of \nthe domestic spearmint production occurs outside the boundaries of the \nFar West order. In addition, we are now importing over 10 times the \nquantity that was imported at the time the Far West order was started.\n  Currently, a small amount of base is allotted by lottery each year in \nthe order. It amounts to between 20 and 40 acres of production each \nyear being awarded to each State. This absurdly low amount has failed \nto attract Montana producers.\n  Montana farmers believe a more fair policy would be to establish a \nlarger base of 3,000 acres in the State. Other producers in the order \nhave refused to allow the establishment of spearmint production in \nMontana. This doesn't sound fair to me. It would take decades for \nenough farmers to build base to the point where they could use \nspearmint as an alternative crop. Montana farmers need more flexibility \nto be able to grow crops that not only improve their land but also \nallow them to remain profitable. Spearmint is such a crop.\n  The USDA has tried to correct this problem. However, an \nadministrative solution to this crisis has evaded us. In the past, USDA \nhas withdrawn three orders that dealt with citrus. USDA feared \nlitigation, the appearance that the orders are not working as they \nshould, and the inability to achieve citrus industry consensus on the \nissue.\n  These same factors exist in the spearmint program, with the exception \nof the legal action. It would appear that the Montana requests, dating \nback \n\n[[Page S 9445]]\nover 5 years, continue to be ignored because there no legal action has \nbeen taken.\n  Therefore, in an effort to save Montana farmers the expense of taking \nlegal action and to end this unfair marketing order I offer legislation \nto end this program.\n  I have participated in numerous farm bill hearings this spring on the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. One of the underlying \nthemes in these hearings have been that farmers and ranchers want the \nfarm programs to be simpler, easier to understand. Mr. President, this \nbill eliminates bureaucracy and allows farmers to grow what they choose \nto grow. I believe in America we call this concept freedom. I urge and \nwelcome my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Mack, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1000. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the depreciation rules which apply for regular tax purposes shall \nalso apply for alternative minimum tax purposes, to allow a portion of \nthe tentative minimum tax to be offset by the minimum tax credit, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n             THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senator \nNickles, Senator Hatch, Senator Murkowski, Senator Breaux, Senator \nD'Amato, Senator Mack, Senator Grams, and Senator Inhofe, in offering \nthis bill to reform the corporate alternative minimum tax. The intent \nof this bill is to make the alternative minimum tax system work more as \nCongress originally envisioned when it enacted this scheme back in \n1986--as a backstop so that truly profitable companies pay their fair \nshare of the tax burden. Under this bill, companies will not be able to \nescape paying their fair share of taxes; but, the Government will not \nbe allowed to take more than its fair share either.\n  While the overall goal of the AMT is noble, its present practical \neffect is to discourage capital investment, to threaten the \ncompetitiveness of American businesses in the global market, and to \nincrease taxes operating close to the margin at a time when they can \nleast afford an increase in taxes. Because the AMT increases the cost \nof capital projects by negating the benefits of accelerated \ndepreciation which was designed to foster capital formation and \ninvestment, reducing capital investment in one of the only ways that a \ntaxpayer can extract itself from AMT status. Further, the AMT is the \nworst capital cost recovery system among the industrialized nations; \nmost of the other industrialized nations allow industry to recover the \ncost of capital expenditure over much shorter periods in order to \nencourage investment in cost-effective, efficient environmentally \nupdated equipment; under the current AMT depreciation rules, American \ncompanies are discouraged from doing so.\n  Finally, the costs of compliance with AMT are oppressive to most \nsmall businesses. Essentially, every company in America which might \nfall into AMT status must keep separate books on depreciation for every \npiece of plant and equipment: one set of books for regular tax \ndepreciation, and one for AMT depreciation. Also, all of these \ncompanies must take the time to conduct two tax computations to \ndetermine if they fall into AMT status. These tax computations are \nhighly complicated and extremely time-consuming to complete. According \nto statistics compiled by the National Association of Manufacturers, \napproximately 90% of the companies who incur these compliance costs to \ndetermine whether they fall into AMT status, do not end up paying the \nAMT tax. They still, however, have to incur the costs of making that \ndetermination.\n  It is clear that the AMT is not working as Congress intended. For \nmany cyclical capital-intensive companies, AMT has become their primary \nsystem of taxation. AMT was originally intended to operate as a \nbackstop to prevent truly profitable companies from paying little or no \ntax. It was never intended to provide disparate tax treatment for \ninvestment in the same asset. Yet this has been the practical result of \nAMT. Those industries most affected include airline, mining, \ntransportation, and utility businesses, and producers of automobiles, \nchemicals, energy, and paper. And the effect of AMT on these industries \nis to increase the costs to the consumers, decrease the efficiency of \nthese businesses, and decreases the businesses' ability to compete \nglobally.\n  Many companies have made substantial AMT payments over the past few \nyears in excess of their regular\n tax liability. These payments--AMT credits--are supposed to be \nreturned to these companies when their regular tax liability exceeds \ntheir AMT tax, so that, over time, these companies will pay no more in \ntax than is required by the regular income tax system. Many taxpayers, \nhowever, find that the limitation on use of AMT credits is too severe \nand, therefore, they cannot be used in a meaningful time frame. Our \nlegislation addresses these concerns in the following ways:\n\n  First, depreciation reform: This legislation would allow companies to \nuse the same depreciation system for AMT purposes as they use for \nregular tax purposes. Investment in plant and equipment and other \nbusiness use assets is essential for American businesses to increase \nproductivity and modernize and maintain international competitiveness. \nThe current AMT depreciation system penalizes companies for making \nthese job creating investments and is contributing to inadequate \nreplacement of capital assets necessary for long-term economic growth. \nFurthermore, this change eliminates the burden of keeping separate \ndepreciation books for all plant and equipment purchased after \nenactment of the AMT. This would substantially reduce the compliance \ncosts that these companies incur, and, in so doing, free up money for \nincreasing salaries, job creation, and investment.\n  Two, accumulated minimum tax credits: This legislation also allows \ntaxpayers who have unused accumulated minimum tax credits for any 3 of \nthe past 5 years to use a portion of those credits to offset up to 50 \npercent of their current year AMT liability. When Congress originally \nimposed the AMT, it was intended to accelerate the timing of tax \npayments rather than permanently increase tax payments. Therefore, \nCongress allowed companies to receive credit in future years for the \namount of AMT they paid in excess of their regular tax liability. For \nmany companies, the limits on the use of AMT credits have effectively \nprevented them from recovering their excess payment of taxes in a \ntimely manner. The Government is, in effect, under the present scheme \nenjoying an interest-free loan from these taxpayers, many of whom had \nto borrow the money to pay the AMT liability. This provision would \nbring AMT into line with its original intention and assure that low-\nprofit, capital intensive companies are not subject to an unintended \npermanent tax increase.\n  I conclude my remarks today by emphasizing that enactment of this \nlegislation would result in the AMT operating as Congress originally \nintended that it should--as a backstop system so that truly profitable \ncompanies would not escape taxation. It would correct the current \nproblem of excessively taxing investment during recessionary periods, \nand it would ensure that investments in similar assets are taxed the \nsame. Because it will result in economic growth and significant new job \ncreation in high wage, high-skilled industries, I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Senate \ncolleagues in support of the Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1995. It will \nreform the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, that is imposed on \nprofitable U.S. companies. By reforming the way the system works, our \nbusinesses will be able to create more high-wage and high-skilled jobs, \nleading to greater economic growth.\n  The current AMT is a job killer. Companies are penalized for making \nneeded investments in new plant equipment and technology that improve \nproductivity and keep prices competitive. Not only is job creation \nimpaired, but existing jobs are put in jeopardy as companies lose out \nto foreign competition. The AMT is an impediment to job creation in \nbasic industries such as \n\n[[Page S 9446]]\nmanufacturing, transportation, and energy production. For small growing \nfirms, the AMT is particularly burdensome since their revenue stream is \ninsufficient to pay start-up and expansion costs as well as the taxes \nthey will owe down the road.\n  I have heard from many businesses in my home State of Minnesota who \nsay the AMT is severely impeding their ability to invest in \nproductivity-improving assets and development activities. As a result, \ntheir ability to compete on a level playing field with other domestic \nand international companies is severely frustrated.\n  By removing the current AMT penalty on capital investment, businesses \nof all sizes will be freed to reinvest and expand their operations. \nThis will create new jobs not only for the company making the \ninvestment, but for companies supplying materials and labor as well.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike have sponsored bills to reform the \nAMT. With this bipartisan measure introduced today, we will enable U.S. \ncompanies to create more jobs with better wages for American workers, \nincrease economic growth, and improve the standard of living for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Minimum Tax \nReform Act of 1995 with my friend from Montana, Senator Burns, and \nseveral other colleagues. In this legislation, we are attempting to \ncorrect some major Tax Code inequities related to the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  The alternative minimum tax, or AMT as it is commonly known, was \nenacted for what I believe is a good reason. Prior to the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986, there was a great deal of media attention directed at \nlarge, profitable corporations, who for a variety of reasons, paid no \ncorporate income tax. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Packwood, created the AMT in 1986 to make sure corporations who \nreport economic income to their shareholders pay taxes. I basically \nagree with that premise, Mr. President. I believe it is important to \nthe average citizen to know that large, profitable corporations are \npaying their fair share of this country's tax burden.\n  It is this issue of fairness, or the perception of fairness, which \nhas always been the driving force behind the AMT. The driving force \nmost certainly is not simplification or revenue generation, because the \nAMT is neither simple nor a major revenue source. It is ironic that the \n1986 tax reform effort to simplify taxation created an entirely new Tax \nCode in the AMT, and now most corporations must plan for and comply \nwith two Tax Codes instead of one. Even more ironic is the fact that in \n1992 the regular corporate tax yielded $96 billion, while the AMT \ncorporate tax yielded only $2.6 billion.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, in the real world the AMT has reached \nfar beyond its original purpose. As it is currently structured, the AMT \nis a massive, complicated, parallel Tax Code which places huge burdens \non capital intensive companies.\n  The biggest problem with the AMT, Mr. President, is that it denies \nmany corporations the benefit of accelerated depreciation. If you \nreally want to boil it down to the bare truth, the AMT is a 20-percent \nsurtax on accelerated depreciation. This is very bad news for \nbusinesses who must invest heavily and often in new equipment to \ncompete or to maintain their technological edge.\n  Essentially, the AMT requires businesses to compute their \ndepreciation deduction using longer recovery periods and slower \ndepreciation methods. The difference between the regular tax \ndepreciation and AMT depreciation is then added to taxable income.\n  For example, a chemical company invests $1,000 in equipment in 1994. \nUnder the regular tax, they would follow the guidelines of the Modified \nAccelerated Cost Recovery System [MACRS] to compute a first-year \ndepreciation deduction of $400--200 percent declining balance method \nover 5 years. However, under the AMT they would only be allowed a \ndepreciation deduction of $158--150 percent declining balance method \nover 9.5 years.\n  The difference between the two calculations of $242 would be added to \ntheir alternative minimum taxable income [AMTI]. After adding other \npreferences and adjustments, AMTI is taxed at 20 percent to arrive at \nthe tentative alternative minimum tax [TAMT]. To the extent TAMT \nexceeds regular tax the chemical company would owe the larger amount.\n  As complicated as that example may sound, Mr. President, it is, in \nfact, greatly simplified compared to real life. What the example does \nclearly show, however, is the inequity of allowing a reasonable \nbusiness deduction under one Tax Code, and then taking it away through \nanother Tax Code. Meanwhile, the businessman is caught in the \ncrossfire. His cost of capital is increased and he must hire more \nemployees simply to keep up with the paperwork.\n  I understand that there are some people in Washington, DC, who \nbelieve regular tax depreciation is too generous and should be \ncurtailed, but this is an extremely complicated and convoluted way to \naccomplish that goal, Mr. President.\n  The Minimum Tax Reform Act we are introducing today would conform AMT \ndepreciation with regular tax depreciation. This one simple reform will \nremove the disincentive to invest in job-producing assets, put capital \nintensive businesses on the same footing as their international \ncompetitors, and greatly simplify AMT compliance and reporting.\n  The second major problem with the AMT is that for many categories of \nbusinesses it has become a permanent tax system, a result which was not \nanticipated in 1986. Reviewing the history of the AMT reveals that its \ncreators believed businesses would pay AMT for a couple of years before \nbecoming\n regular taxpayers again. For this reason, they developed a provision \nwhich allows businesses who have paid AMT in a prior year to credit \nthose payments against their regular tax liability in future years.\n\n  Unfortunately, many capital-intensive businesses, as well as many \noil, gas, and coal companies, have become chronic AMT taxpayers. They \ncontinue to pay AMT year after year with no relief in sight, and as a \nmatter of function they have accumulated billions in unused AMT \ncredits. These credits are a tax on future, unearned revenues which may \nnever materialize, they represent an interest-free loan to the Federal \nGovernment, and because of the time-value of money their value to the \ntaxpayer decreases every year.\n  To address this problem the Minimum Tax Reform Act includes a unique \nnew provision which would allow chronic AMT taxpayers to utilize unused \nprior-year AMT credits to offset 50 percent of their tentative minimum \ntax. This provision will help chronic AMT taxpayers dig their way out \nof the AMT and allow them to recoup at least a portion of these \naccelerated tax payments in a reasonable manner and timeframe.\n  Mr. President, much of the tax debate this year has focused on \nproviding incentives for savings and investment. An important part of \nthat process should be to first eliminate the investment disincentives \ncreated by the AMT.\n  Will the Minimum Tax Reform Act take care of every business' AMT \nproblems, Mr. President? No, it will not. This bill addresses the \ndepreciation adjustment, but there are many other AMT adjustments, \npreferences, and limitations which are not dealt with. These provisions \nhave little to do with preventing corporations from zeroing out, but \nthey have a lot to do with profitability and competitiveness. I hope \nall these issues will be examined when the Senate Finance Committee \nconsiders AMT reform.\n  Mr. President, the issues surrounding the alternative minimum tax are \nvery complicated. I hope my colleagues will take the time to study them \nand join me in this initiative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Cohen, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Simon, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 1001. A bill to reform regulatory procedures, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S 9447]]\n\n\n\n              the regualtory procedures reform act of 1995\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I believe very strongly in the need for \nregulatory reform. I do not believe that is something that is debatable \nback and forth across the center aisle, where we so often have our \ndifferences. I think we are united as Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate of the United States in saying that we all feel a need for \nregulatory reform.\n  Now, while I recognize the tremendous value of many rules in \nprotecting public health and safety and the environment, I also \nunderstand that Federal agencies too often ignore the costs of \nregulation on businesses, State and local governments, and on \nindividuals who feel they are put down and overregulated. They see \nregulations that do not make any sense. They resent that. And I resent \nit right along with them.\n  But through sensible reform, we can restore common sense to \nGovernment decisions, and thereby improve the quality and reduce the \nburdens of Federal regulations.\n  Mr. President, any bill on the subject of regulatory reform to be \ndeserving of support, I feel, must pass a test that is twofold. No. 1, \ndoes the bill provide for reasonable, logical, appropriate changes to \nregulatory procedures that eliminate unnecessary burdens on businesses \nand on individuals? And, No. 2, does the bill maintain the Government's \nability to protect the health, the safety, and the environment of the \nAmerican people?\n  Now, if the answer is yes to both questions, then the bill should be \nsupported. But any bill that relieves regulatory burdens and at the \nsame time threatens the protections for the American people in health \nand safety and the environment should be opposed. Now, maybe that is \nobvious. Maybe those two conditions are obvious. But I think they need \nto be stated so that we set the ground rules for the debate that will \noccur on this legislation.\n  What regulatory reform should not become is a backdoor way to stop \nand reverse the progress made over the past 25 years in protecting the \nhealth and the safety of the American people and the environment. And I \nvery firmly believe that we can retain those protections for food and \nfor water and air, and those things that protect every family and \nindividual in this Nation, and at the same time cut out the excessive \nregulatory requirements that have truly and unnecessarily plagued \nbusiness and individuals.\n  Regulatory reform should not mean tying up Federal agencies in \nneedless paperwork and throwing the regulatory process into disarray. \nAnd it should not become a lawyer's dream, creating endless ways for \nindividuals to sue the Government. Our goal should be to make the \nGovernment become more efficient and effective, and less prey to \nspecial interests.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Committee on Governmental Affairs has been \ninvolved in this issue for many years. This goes clear back into the \nmid-1970's, and even before. This year, under the leadership of Senator \nRoth, the chairman of our committee, the committee crafted a \ncomprehensive regulatory reform bill, S. 291. It was reported out of \ncommittee by a unanimous, bipartisan vote. I repeat that: A unanimous \nvote out of committee. We have eight Republican members on our \ncommittee. We have seven Democratic members on our committee. And this \nlegislation, basically this same legislation, was reported out of \ncommittee by a unanimous bipartisan vote. I think it proves beyond any \nshadow of a doubt that we can have bipartisan action on this subject in \nthis Congress, and in this Senate.\n  Last week, Senators Dole and Johnston entered into the Record a \n``discussion draft'' for regulatory reform. And yesterday, a revised \nversion of that draft was also entered into the Record. In response to \nthese drafts, I have sent to the desk for introduction a bill entitled \n``The Regulatory Procedures Reform Act of 1995.'' This bill is based \nprimarily on our bipartisan Governmental Affairs Committee bill.\n  Now, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Roth for his \nleadership and hard work in making the Governmental Affairs Committee \nbill a strong and fair regulatory reform bill--a strong and fair \nregulatory reform bill. Through Senator Roth's efforts, we have a solid \nfoundation for real regulatory reform. I am happy to have worked with \nSenator Roth in the committee and again, our work together is largely \nreflected in this bill.\n  Like the Governmental Affairs bill, the bill that I introduced today \nis bipartisan.\n  I offer the legislation for the Record because I have serious \nquestions about the balance in the current version of the Dole-Johnston \ndraft and whether the reforms it contains are outweighed by the \ncreation of new opportunities to stop environmental and health and \nsafety protections for the American people.\n  We are not trying to retain everything in every regulation that has \nbeen proposed or is even in effect now. We know that many must be \nreconsidered. But when we set the ground rules for how rules and \nregulations will be promulgated in the future, there must be balance, \nweighing the regulatory concerns against the benefits that may come \nfrom that regulation.\n  Whether the current version of the Dole-Johnston draft and the \nreforms it contains are outweighed by its limits to environmental \nhealth and safety protections for the American people is what I mean \nwhen I mention the word balance.\n  I want to provide an opportunity for our colleagues to approach this \nvery important issue of regulatory reform from another angle, and I \ninvite Members to compare these proposals. I would like each Senator to \nask himself or herself which proposal or which combination of both \nproposals--a melding--which combination of these proposals better \nfulfills the twin tasks of eliminating unnecessary regulatory burdens \non business and individuals, while at the same time providing no \ndiminution of the ability of the Government to protect the health and \nsafety and environment of the American people.\n  I believe that the legislation I am submitting is a very strong \nreform proposal. It requires cost-benefit analysis. It requires risk \nassessment. It requires peer review. It requires congressional review \nof significant rules. And it requires review of existing rules. It \nprovides much-needed reform without paralyzing agencies. Issues, such \nas judicial review and how we should handle existing rules, are \ncritical to this debate. Discussions on these issues are continuing, \nand we wish to make a positive contribution to these discussions by \nproviding an alternative for consideration on the floor.\n  It is my hope that the principles embodied in this alternative will \nfind their way into the final legislation that will be adopted by the \nSenate, because I am convinced that we will pass a bill. This bill may \nbe one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass this year. I \nknow it is arcane. I know it is uninteresting. I know sometimes it is \nabout as interesting as watching paint dry or mud dry. These issues \ninvolve peculiarities of law and one-word interpretations in the \ncourts, and things like that. But these are the things of which this \nlegislation is made, and these are the things that are so important to \nevery business and person in this country.\n  So discussions on these issues are continuing, and we want to make a \npositive contribution to that. I hope that this legislation I am \nproposing can be considered in that regard.\n  Let us look at some of the principles we see that I think should be \nour guideposts for regulatory reform:\n  No. 1: Cost-benefit and risk assessment requirements should apply \nonly to major rules, which has been set at $100 million for executive \nbranch review since before President Reagan's time. I think actually \nthe $100 million threshold goes back to President Ford's time.\n  Our bill applies to rules that have an impact on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more. The Dole-Johnston bill applies to rules that have an \nimpact on the economy of $50 million or more.\n  It is my view that a $50 million threshold overloads the capability \nof most agencies to do the job because there are probably few rules \nproposed that could not be construed to have a $50 million impact on \nthe country. While agencies are being cut back and staffs are being cut \nback and dollars are being reduced in the agencies, it would seem to me \nadvisable to start at the $100 million level. If we find later that the \nagencies are fully capable of \n\n[[Page S 9448]]\nadministering everything at the $100 million level, then we can add \nthis requirement for the $50 million level.\n  No. 2: Regulatory reform should not become a lawyer's dream opening \nup a multitude of new avenues for judicial review. By judicial review, \nwe mean can a court case be filed against it, in simple terms.\n  Our bill limits judicial review to determination of, first, whether a \nrule is a major rule, in other words, $100 million impact on the \ncountry; and second, whether a final rule is arbitrary or capricious, \ntaking into consideration the whole rulemaking file developed in \narriving at that final rule.\n  Specific procedural requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment, of which there could be hundreds of unlimited opportunities \nto delay for no legitimate reason is not subject to judicial review in \nour bill except as part of the whole rulemaking file. The final rule, \nhowever, before it could be put into effect, would be subject to \njudicial review. The current Dole-Johnston bill will lead to, I feel, a \nlitigation explosion that could swamp the courts and could bog down \nagencies, because it would allow review of many steps in risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis, in addition to the determination \nof a major rule and of agency decisions to grant or deny petitions.\n  The petitions, the assessments, the cost-benefit analysis, whether it \nis a major rule or not, these all provide a myriad of places where the \nDole-Johnston legislation would allow suits. If the court turned one \ndown, they would still be free to file at the next stage, the next \nstage, and the next stage. The Dole-Johnston bill simply provides a \nmeans, as I see it, for almost unending delay of whatever rule is being \nconsidered.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill further alters the APA, the Administrative \nProcedures Act, standards in ways that undermine legal precedent and \ninvite lawsuits. Finally, it seeks to limit agency discretion in ways \nthat will lead inevitably to challenges in court.\n  No. 3: Regulatory reform legislation should focus on procedures and \nnot be a vehicle for special interests seeking to alter specific laws \ndealing with health, safety, the environment or other matters. Our bill \nfocuses on the fundamentals of regulatory reform and contains no \nspecial-interest provisions.\n  The current Dole-Johnston bill provides relief to special business \ninterests that more properly should be considered in the context of \nsomething other than regulatory reform legislation. And I am referring \nto the Dole-Johnston language that has the effect of restricting, for \ninstance, the Toxics Release Inventory, It also limits the Delaney \nclause and it delays and increases costs of Superfund cleanups.\n  I will not go into all sorts of details on these things now, but the \nToxics Release Inventory provides that plants in communities have to \nput together information so people will know what it is they are \nbreathing or what is happening to the water in their communities.\n  To take that up in regulatory reform and alter the requirements of \nthat legislation without the appropriate committees or without everyone \nbeing heard on this seems to me not the right way to go.\n  With regard to the limitation on the Delaney clause, I happen to \nthink the Delaney clause does need some modification, but this would \nchange it dramatically. I am sure most people would agree this is not \nsomething we want to go into lightly. Again, regulatory reform is not \nthe place to take up a specific program reform.\n  It would also fundamentally affect Superfund cleanups, causing \nsignificant delays and increasing costs.\n  No. 4: Regulatory reform should make Federal agencies more efficient \nand more effective and not tie up agency resources with additional \nbureaucratic processes.\n  Our bill requires cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for major \nrules and requires agencies to review all their major rules by a time \ncertain,\n not just prospectively, but also existing rules that have a $100 \nmillion impact or more. So we do go back and try and correct some of \nthe problems that are so vexing to business people in particular.\n\n  Now, the current Dole-Johnston bill covers a much broader scope of \nrules and has several convoluted petition processes for what are called \n``interested parties,'' for example, to amend or rescind a major rule \nand to review policies or guidance. These petitions are judicially \nreviewable and must be granted or denied by an agency within a \nspecified timeframe.\n  Now, I think the petition will eat up agency resources and allow the \npetitioners, not the agencies, to set agency priorities. What we want \nto do is not swamp agencies, we want to make changes that are workable, \nones that are of benefit to everyone in the whole country.\n  No. 5: Regulatory reform legislation should improve analysis but not \noverride existing statutes, including environmental, safety, and health \nlaws. This is what has been referred to as the ``supermandate''.\n  We have spent a generation or more putting into effect environmental \nlaws, safety laws, and health laws for the benefit of the people of \nthis country. I am not standing here to defend all of those laws. Some \nmay have gone too far. Some rules and regulations written pursuant to \nthose statutes, I am the first to say, have gone too far. But we also \nhave made major improvements in our environment, in clean air and clean \nwater, and health standards for our people. And to say that we will \njust pass a bill that says all that previous legislation--no matter how \neffective and how important--is automatically wiped off the book, I \nthink, goes too far.\n  Our bill does not override existing statutes. It requires agencies, \nhowever, to explain whether benefits justify costs and whether the rule \nwill be more cost-effective than alternatives. It does not allow cost-\nbenefit determinations to override existing statutory requirements. It \nleaves intact environmental, safety, and health laws. But we do require \nall major current rules to be reviewed and set up a process for those \nthat are considered inappropriate now to be reviewed.\n  Now, the current Dole-Johnston bill has three separate decisional \ncriteria that control agency decisions, regardless of the underlying \nstatutes. These overriding provisions are created for major rule cost-\nbenefit determinations, for environmental cleanups, and for Regulatory \nFlexibility analysis. The Reg Flex override actually conflicts with the \ncost-benefit decisional criteria. The cost-benefit test limits agencies \nto the cheapest rule, not the most cost effective.\n  No. 6: There should be sunshine in the regulatory review process. Our \nbill ensures that agencies and OMB publicly disclose the status of \nregulatory review, of related decisions, documents, and communications \nfrom persons outside of the Government. The current Dole-Johnston bill \nhas no sunshine provision to protect against regulatory review delay, \nunsubstantiated review decisions, or undisclosed special interest \nlobbying and political deals.\n  Now, we have gone through a period in the past decade or so where we \nhad people doing things more in secret than in public in the executive \nbranch of Government. We have come to regret that. Some of it we were \nable to stop. Some only stopped after this administration came in and \ntook strong action against secrecy. I do not need to open up some of \nthose old wounds at this point. But there is still a need to cut out \nthe secrecy that can happen when rules are put through OMB and the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Again, in the past, we \nhave had some real problems with this. That is the reason why we feel \nso strongly that openness in Government--sunshine in the regulatory \nreview process--should be included as any part of regulatory reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the text of this alternative bill is almost identical \nto S. 291, the regulatory reform act of 1995, which, again, was \nreported unanimously from the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  This discussion bill--I put this forward for discussion--is like S. \n291 in the following ways: No. 1: It covers all major rules with the \ncost impact of $100 million or more. I will explain a slight change we \nmade to what was in S. 291, which I will address a bit later.\n  No. 2: It requires cost-benefit analysis for all major rules.\n  No. 3: It requires risk assessment for all major rules related to \nenvironment, health, or safety. There is also a small technical change \nto the risk provisions \n\n[[Page S 9449]]\nin S. 291. I will address that later as one of three changes in the \nlegislation.\n  No. 4: It requires peer review of cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessments.\n  No. 5: It limits judicial review to the determination of major rules \nand to the final rulemaking file.\n  No. 6: It requires agencies to review existing rules every 10 years \nwith a Presidential extension of up to five years. This has changed \nslightly from the original S. 291, also. I will address that later as \none of the three changes from the original bill.\n  No. 7: It provides judicial review of Regulatory Flexibility Act \ndecisions, allowing 1-year for small entities to petition for a review \nof agency compliance with the Reg Flex Act.\n  No. 8: It requires public disclosure of regulatory analysis and \nreview documents to ensure sunshine in the regulatory review process.\n  No. 9: It provides legislative veto of major rules to provide an \nexpedited procedure for Congress to review rules. In other words, every \nmajor rule will come back to Congress for 45 days for review by the \nCongress before it becomes effective. We passed a similar measure in \nthe Senate 100-0 3 months ago.\n  No. 10: It requires risk-based priority setting for the most serious \nrisks to health and safety and the environment.\n  No. 11: It requires regulatory accounting every 2 years on the \ncumulative costs and benefits of agency regulations. In other words, \nagencies have to report back to Congress at least every 2 years agency \non how this legislation is working, and what the costs and benefits are \nof the rules and regulations.\n  So, in other words, we put this in to so Congress can better monitor \nthe cumulative burden and benefits of regulations. We no longer can \njust pass laws and forget the rules that follow. We are required to \nmonitor these rules, because we will be advised at least every 2 years \non the cumulative costs and benefits of agency regulations.\n  I mentioned three changes. The bill I am introducing differs from S. \n291 on basically three points.\n  No. 1: It does not sunset rules that fail to be reviewed. Rather, it \nestablishes an action-enforcing mechanism that uses the rulemaking \nprocess. It is not an arbitrary reversal of a major rule without public \ncomment and review, which could occur if we ran out to a certain time \nperiod without review. The rule would have been declared no longer in \neffect because it had not been reviewed in that 10-year period. Instead \nof this automatic sunset, we have an action-enforcing mechanism that \nuses the rulemaking process.\n  No. 2: We do not include any narrative definitions for ``major \nrule.'' For example, one that would be a major rule because it has an \nadverse effect on wages, or something like that,\n or similar narrative definition. So we leave those out.\n\n  No. 3: It incorporates some technical changes to risk assessment, to \ntrack more closely recommendations made by the National Academy of \nSciences, and to cover specific programs and agencies.\n  Now, those are the only three changes we made from the legislation, \nS. 291, that was voted out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nunanimously--Republicans and Democrats.\n  This alternative discussion bill, I repeat, discussion bill, \npresents, I believe, a comprehensive approach and a very tough, but \nworkable requirement for regulatory reform.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to examine this draft closely. We \nhave a week and a half while we are out of session. I want it to be \npublished in the Record so it can be available for staff to consider, \nand consider parts of it they think can supplement the proposal that is \nbefore the Senate now on the floor, or use this as a substitute and \nperfect this with amendments that people might wish to put forward.\n  It is my intent that further negotiations on regulatory reform go \nforward. It is my hope that ways will be found to incorporate the \nprinciples that I have enunciated this evening that ultimately could be \nsupported by everyone.\n  I believe an appropriate melding of language of this bill with that \nof the Dole-Johnston draft could be the basis for a widely supported \nbill that produces tough and workable--tough and workable--regulatory \nreform, at the same time keeps intact the ability to protect the \nhealth, safety, and environment of the American people.\n  That kind of balanced bill will truly be in the public interest.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio for his excellent statement and for the leadership he has \ndemonstrated over the last several months on this important issue. No \none has worked more tirelessly and more effectively to accomplish what \nthe legislation he has introduced today represents.\n  The legislation now enjoys bipartisan support, and a growing number \nof people have examined it and found it much to their liking. That is \nno accident. It has happened as a result of the tireless efforts of the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio and his staff.\n  I look forward to working with him in the coming weeks to see if we \ncan bring this effort to a successful resolution.\n  As the Senator from Ohio said, this is not the end. It is just the \nbeginning. We hope we can work in a bipartisan fashion to take into \naccount all the good work that has been done by others, as well.\n  The senior Senator from Louisiana, the senior Senator from Utah, and \nmany other Senators have worked a good deal to bring the Senate to this \npoint.\n  I leave tonight with the expectation that, indeed, we can resolve the \nremaining differences and work through many of the difficulties that \nremain. I certainly hope that is the case.\n  Indeed, I think it is true that Democrats and Republicans agree on \nthe need for regulatory reform. But we also agree on the need for \npublic safety. We also recognize that it is critical the American \npeople retain confidence in their health and safety and the regulations \nand laws that promote and protect that health and safety.\n  The Senator from Ohio has provided us an excellent way to begin the \ndebate when we get back, with the expectation that, indeed, this is an \nissue on which there can be accommodation and compromise.\n  Again, let me commend him for his excellent efforts and join with \nmany others in cosponsoring this piece of legislation this afternoon.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Johnston, \n        and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1002. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against income tax to individuals who rehabilitate historic \nhomes or who are the first purchasers of rehabilitated historic homes \nfor use as a principal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the historic homeownership assistance act\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, all across America, in the small \ntowns and great cities of this country, our heritage as a nation--the \nphysical evidence of our past--is at risk. In virtually every corner of \nthis land, homes in which grandparents and parents grew up, communities \nand neighborhoods that nurtured vibrant families, schools that were \ngood places to learn and churches and synagogues that were filled on \ndays of prayer, have suffered the ravages of abandonment and decay.\n  In the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing units \nthrough abandonment, Philadelphia 10,000 and St. Louis 7,000. The story \nin our older small communities has been the same, and the trend \ncontinues. It is important to understand that it is not just buildings \nthat we are losing. It is the sense of our past, the vitality of our \ncommunities and the shared values of those precious places.\n  We need not stand hopelessly by as passive witnesses to the loss of \nthese irreplaceable historic resources. We can act, and to that end I \nam introducing today the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act along \nwith my distinguished colleagues Senator Graham of Florida, Senator \nPryor, Senator Johnston and Senator Simon.\n  This legislation is patterned after the existing historic \nrehabilitation investment tax credit. That legislation has been \nenormously successful in stimulating private investment in the \nrehabilitation of buildings of historic importance all across the \ncountry. Through its use we have been able to save and re-use a rich \nand diverse array of historic buildings: landmarks such \n\n[[Page S 9450]]\nas Union Station right here in Washington, DC, the Fox River Mills, a \nmixed use project that was once a derelict paper mill in Appleton, WI \nand the Rosa True School, an eight-unit low/moderate income rental \nproject in an historic school building in Portland, ME.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, Federal tax incentives stimulated \nthe rehabilitation and commercial reuse of more than 266 historic \nproperties. The properties saved include the Hotel Manisses on Block \nIsland, the former Valley Falls Mills complex in Central Falls, and the \nHonan Block in Woonsocket.\n  The legislation that I am introducing builds on the familiar \nstructure of the existing tax credit, but with a different focus and a \nmore modest scope and cost. It is designed to empower the one major \nconstituency that has been barred from using the existing credit--\nhomeowners. Only those persons who rehabilitate or purchase a newly \nrehabilitated home and occupy it as their principal residence would be \nentitled to the credit that this legislation creates. There would be no \npassive losses, no tax shelters and no syndications under this bill.\n  Like the existing investment credit, the bill would provide a credit \nto homeowners equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation \nexpenditures made on an eligible building that is used as a principal \nresidence by the owner. Eligible buildings would be those that are \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places, are contributing \nbuildings on National Register Historic Districts or in nationally \ncertified State or local historic districts, or are individually listed \non a nationally certified State or local register. As is the case with \nthe existing credit, the rehabilitation work would have to be performed \nin compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's standards for \nrehabilitation, although the bill clarifies that such standards should \nbe interpreted in a manner that takes into consideration economic and \ntechnical feasibility.\n  The bill also makes provision for lower-income homebuyers who may not \nhave sufficient Federal income tax liability to use a tax credit. It \nwould permit such persons to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage \ncredit certificate which they can use with their bank to obtain a lower \ninterest rate on their mortgage.\n  The credit would be available for condominiums and co-ops, as well as \nsingle-family buildings. If a building were to be rehabilitated by a \ndeveloper for sale to a homeowner, the credit would pass through to the \nhomeowner. Since one purpose of the bill is to provide incentives for \nmiddle-income and more affluent families to return to older towns and \ncities, the bill does not discriminate among taxpayers on the basis of \nincome. However, it does impose a cap of $50,000 on the amount of \ncredit which may be taken for a principal residence.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will make ownership of a \nrehabilitated older home more affordable for homebuyers of modest \nincomes. It will encourage more affluent families to claim a stake in \nolder towns and neighborhoods. It affords fiscally stressed cities and \ntowns a way to put abandoned buildings back on the tax rolls, while \nstrengthening their income and sales tax bases. It offers developers, \nrealtors and homebuilders a new realm of economic opportunity in \nrevitalizing decaying buildings.\n  In addition to preserving our heritage, extending this credit will \nprovide an important supplemental benefit--it will boost the economy. \nEvery dollar of Federal investment in historic rehabilitation leverages \nmany more from the private sector. Rhode Island, for example, has used \n$24 million in public funds over the years to generate $216 million in \nprivate investment. This investment has created more than 10,000 jobs \nand $187 million in wages.\n  Mr. President, this bill is no panacea. Although its goals are great, \nits reach will be modest. But it can make a difference, and an \nimportant difference, in communities large and small all across this \nNation. The American dream of owning one's own home is a powerful \nforce. This bill can help it come true for those who are prepared to \nmake a personal commitment to join in the rescue of our priceless \nheritage. By their actions they can help to revitalize decaying \nresources of historic importance, create jobs and stimulate economic \ndevelopment, and restore to our older towns and cities a lost sense of \npurpose and community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan explanation of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Historic Homeownership \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

To provide homeownership incentives and \n     opportunities through the rehabilitation of older buildings \n     in historic districts under the Federal Historic \n     Rehabilitation Tax Credit. To stimulate the revival of \n     decaying neighborhoods and communities and the preservation \n     of historic buildings and districts through homeownership.\n       Rate of Credit: Eligible Buildings. The existing Historic \n     Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which provides a credit of 20% of \n     qualified rehabilitation expenditures to investors in \n     commercial and rental buildings, would be extended to \n     homeowners who rehabilitate or purchase a newly-rehabilitated \n     eligible home and occupy it as a principal residence. In the \n     case of buildings rehabilitated by developers and sold to \n     homeowners, the credit would be passed through by the \n     developer to the home purchaser. Eligible buildings would be \n     buildings individually listed on the National Register of \n     Historic Places or a nationally certified state of local \n     register, and contributing buildings in districts listed in \n     the National Register or in state or local historic districts \n     that have been nationally certified.\n       Both single-family and multifamily residences, through \n     condominiums and cooperatives, would qualify for the proposed \n     credit. In addition, the credit could be claimed for that \n     portion of a building used as a principal residence, \n     notwithstanding the use of other \n\n[[Page S 9452]]\n     portions of the building for other purposes, including residential \n     rental and commercial uses for which the existing Federal \n     Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit could be used. The \n     proposal would make no changes in the limitations on the use \n     of the credit.\n       Maximum Credit: Minimum Expenditures. The amount of the \n     homeownership credit would be limited to $50,000 for each \n     principal residence. The amount of qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures would be required to exceed the greater of \n     $5,000 within a 24-month period or the adjusted tax basis of \n     the building (excluding the land) except for buildings in \n     census tracts targeted as distressed for Mortgage Revenue \n     Bond purposes under IRC Section 143(j)(1) and Enterprise and \n     Empowerment Zones, where the minimum would be $5,000. At \n     least five percent of the qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures would have to be spent on the exterior of the \n     building.\n       Pass-Through of Credit: Carry-Forward: Recapture. In the \n     event that a certified rehabilitation is performed on an \n     eligible property by a developer who sells the residence to a \n     home buyer, the credit would accrue to the home buyer and not \n     to the developer, who would, in effect, pass it through to \n     the home buyer. The entire amount of the credit could be used \n     to reduce Federal Income Tax liability, subject to\n      Alternative Minimum Tax limitations, in the year in which \n     the expenditures were made by the taxpayer either directly \n     (if the taxpayer makes the expenditures himself or \n     herself) or at the settlement, if the taxpayer purchases \n     the newly-rehabilitated residence from a developer. Any \n     unused amounts of credit would be carried forward until \n     fully exhausted. In the event the taxpayer failed to \n     maintain his or her principal residence in the building \n     for five years, the credit would be subject to ratable \n     recapture.\n       No ``Passive Loss''; No Income Limit. The credit would not \n     be treated as a ``passive loss'' because the taxpayer would \n     be actively living in the building. Further, since the \n     proposed legislation is intended not only to foster \n     homeownership and encourage rehabilitation of deteriorated \n     buildings, but also to promote economic diversity among \n     residents and increase local ad valorem real property, income \n     and sales tax revenues, individual taxpayers would be \n     eligible for the credit without regard to income.\n       Secretary's Standards: Interiors. Rehabilitation would have \n     to be performed in accordance with the Secretary of the \n     Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The proposed \n     legislation would clarify the directive, set forth in 36 CFR \n     67, that the Standards are to be interpreted in a manner \n     which takes ``into consideration economic and technical \n     feasibility.'' It would provide that in determining whether \n     to certify rehabilitation of a building, all or a portion of \n     which is to be used as an owner-occupied residence that is a \n     ``targeted area residence'' within the meaning of IRC Section \n     143 (J)(1) or is located within an Enterprise or Empowerment \n     Zone and is not individually listed in the National Register \n     of Historic Places, the Secretary give consideration to (I) \n     the feasibility of preserving existing architectural or \n     design elements of the interior of such building, (ii) the \n     risk of further deterioration or demolition of such building \n     in the event that certification is denied because of the \n     failure to preserve such interior elements, and (iii) the \n     effects of such deterioration or demolition on neighboring \n     historic properties.\n       Cooperative Agreements: Earmarking of Fees. The Secretary \n     of the Interior would be authorized to enter into cooperative \n     agreements with State Historic Preservation Officers \n     (``SHPO's'') granting to the states (and, upon the \n     recommendation of a SHPO and with the consent or the \n     Secretary, to a Certified Local Government within that state \n     deemed qualified to perform such functions), subject to the \n     terms and conditions of such cooperative agreements, \n     authority to certify the rehabilitation of certified historic \n     buildings within their respective jurisdictions. The states \n     would have authority to levy fees for processing applications \n     for certification, provided that the proceeds of such fees \n     are used only to defray expenses associated with processing \n     the application.\n       Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificates. Lower \n     income taxpayers may not have sufficient Federal Income Tax \n     liability to make effective use of a homeownership credit. In \n     order to make the benefits of the credit available to such \n     persons, the proposed legislation would permit any recipient \n     of a credit to convert it into a mortgage credit certificate \n     which can be used to obtain an interest rate reduction on his \n     or her home mortgage loan.\n       Taxpayers entitled to the credit would be able to elect to \n     receive in lieu of the credit an Historic Rehabilitation \n     Mortgage Credit Certificate in the face amount of the credit \n     to which the taxpayer is entitled. The election would be made \n     at the time of receipt by the taxpayer of the approved Part \n     III certification of the historic rehabilitation \n     (certification that the completed rehabilitation meets the \n     Secretary's Standards, and setting forth the taxpayer's \n     estimate of the costs solely attributable to the \n     rehabilitation, to which the 20 percent credit is applied).\n       The taxpayer would then transfer the certificate \n     (evidencing the right to claim a federal tax credit in an \n     amount equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures) to the mortgage lender in exchange for a \n     reduced interest rate on the home mortgage loan. The mortgage \n     lender would be permitted to reduce its own federal income \n     tax liability by the face amount of the certificate, subject \n     to Alternative Minimum Tax limitations. However, the credit \n     claimed by the bank would not be subject to recapture. The \n     amount of reduction in the mortgage interest rate which the \n     homeowner would obtain in exchange for the certificate would \n     be determined by a ``buy-down'' formula.\n       Although the right to receive an Historic Rehabilitation \n     Mortgage Credit Certificate would be available to all persons \n     entitled to the credit, the certificate could not be used by \n     a person precluded from using the credit because of the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax limit at the time of original \n     entitlement to the certificate.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 1003. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain \nmotorcycles brought into the United States by participants in the \nSturgis Motorcycle Rally and Races, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 motorcycle duty suspension legislation\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would allow for the temporary suspension of duties on \nmotorcycles originally manufactured in the United States, exported, and \nbrought back into the country for the purpose of participating in the \nSturgis Motorcycle Rally and Races.\n  The Sturgis Rally and Races, held annually in Sturgis, SD, is the \nlargest motorcycle show in the world. Created in 1938 by Sturgis \nmotorcycle shop owner J.C. ``Pappy'' Hoel, the rally has evolved from a \nsmall gathering of 19 motorcycle enthusiasts, to a major international \nevent. Besides attracting American motorcyclists from all 50 States, \ncitizens from more than 60 foreign countries travel to attend. This \nyear, the 55th Annual Rally and Races will be held from August 7-13, \nand is expected to draw in more than 200,000 people, including nearly \n3,000 participants from abroad. The rally is, without question, one of \nthe most important tourism events in South Dakota. With ever-increasing \ninternational participation, it quickly is becoming a significant \nelement of foreign tourism revenue. As the new co-chair of the Senate \nTourism Caucus, I want to do everything I can to increase the \ninternational flavor of tourist events like the Sturgis Rally and \nRaces. Our economy only stands to benefit.\n  Although the Rally has, in recent years, expanded its program to \ninclude guided tours of the Black Hills area and motorcycle \nexpositions, the central attraction remains motorcycle racing. For \nSturgis participants, the vehicle of choice is the Harley-Davidson. As \nmy colleagues know, the Harley--Davidson company is the only remaining \nAmerican manufacturer of motorcycles. Its two plants, located in \nMilwaukee, WI, and York, PA, are the sole remaining facilities where \nHarley's are made. In 1994, approximately 70 percent of the motorcycles \npresent at the Rally were Harleys.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, international participation is on the \nrise. We certainly welcome these foreign tourists and want to do all we \ncan to encourage their participation. However, when foreign travelers \nbring their motorcycles with them, the temporary importation \nrequirements of the U.S. Customs Service come into play. Specifically, \nwhen a foreign-owned motorcycle is admitted into the country, a bond \nmust be posted that is equal to approximately twice the value of the \nmotorcycle's import duty--or, roughly 6 percent of its total value. The \npurpose of the bond is to safeguard against motorcycles being brought \ninto our country presumably for vacation purposes, but then are sold, \nwhich circumvents our import quotas and tariffs. Although the bond is \nrefundable, administrative fees associated with securing the bond are \nnot. Mr. President, Harley-Davidsons are American-made. As I have \nmentioned, the purpose of these bonds is to prevent foreign goods from \nbeing sold in this country duty free. Therefore, there is no need to \nimpose the bonding requirement on American-made Harleys brought back \ninto this country. This requirement is becoming increasingly onerous \nfor foreign Rally participants, creating what I view as an unnecessary \nroadblock for increased foreign participation.\n  This problem was brought to my attention during a meeting I had with \nSouth Dakota tourism leaders in Rapid City, SD earlier this year. In \nparticular, I want to acknowledge and thank \n\n[[Page S 9453]]\nFrancie Reubel Alberts, executive director of the Sturgis Motorcycle \nRally and Races, for all her help in this matter. Those involved in the \nSturgis Rally and Races know of her dedication and hard work over the \nyears to make this yearly event such an enormous success. When we \nstarted work on this matter, it was our hope\n that the situation could be resolved administratively through existing \nCustoms regulations. It now appears legislation is the only solution.\n\n  Therefore, the legislation I am introducing today would temporarily \nsuspend the duties on foreign-owned Harley-Davidson's that are being \nbrought back into our country for the purpose of participating in the \nSturgis Motorcycle Rally and Races. Under my bill, foreign rally \nparticipants would be allowed to forgo the costly, time-consuming \nprocedure of securing a bond for the few weeks their motorcycles would \nbe in the country.\n  Mr. President, this bill, by encouraging foreign participation in the \nSturgis Rally and Races, is good for South Dakota tourism. It is good \nfor American tourism in general. Furthermore, it sends a message that \nthis Congress is serious about promoting America as a tourist \ndestination.The Sturgis Rally and Races is quintessentially all-\nAmerican, but it has become a world-renowned, world-class event. With \nthis legislation, it is my hope that this grant event in the great \nState of South Dakota will attract even greater world-wide \nrepresentation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Just \nas important, I hope to see friends, neighbors, and motorcycle \nenthusiasts in Sturgis later this summer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the U.S. Coast Guard, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               THE COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nbipartisan legislation to authorize spending for the important \nactivities of the U.S. Coast Guard in fiscal year 1996.\n  I am joined by Senators Hollings, Kerry, and Chairman Pressler on \nthis bill.\n  On March 15, 1995, we held a Commerce Committee hearing to review the \nCoast Guard's request for the authorization of appropriations and for \nvarious changes to the law that will allow it to more effectively carry \nout its mission.\n  I believe the package we are presenting today includes all of the \nhighest priorities identified by the Coast Guard for action this year.\n  It also includes authorization levels for fiscal year 1995, since we \nwere unable to pass a bill at the end of the last Congress.\n  Before my summary, I want to point out that the package only includes \nprovisions requested by the Coast Guard.\n  Simultaneous to our introduction of today's legislation, we are \nworking on a more comprehensive package of amendments the Subcommittee \non Oceans and Fisheries will present to the full Commerce Committee at \na markup, hopefully in July.\n  We will try in the comprehensive package to include as many of the \nprovisions that we can that are of interest to members of the Committee \nand the Senate.\n  We are also reviewing the provisions included in the Coast Guard \nauthorization bill passed by the House (H.R. 1361) for possible \ninclusion in this subcommittee package.\n  I appreciate the interest and support of Commerce Committee Chairman \nPressler in our efforts on this reauthorization.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the other subcommittee \nmembers in the coming weeks to complete our larger package for the full \ncommittee's consideration.\n                         summary of legislation\n\n  The bill would authorize appropriations for the Coast Guard in the \namounts of $3.69 billion in fiscal year 1995 and $3.71 billion in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The end of year military strength for active duty Coast Guard \npersonnel would be set at 39,000 for fiscal year 1995 and 38,400 for \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The bill would also authorize several personnel management \nimprovements requested by the Coast Guard.\n  In the area of marine safety and waterway services management, the \nbill would increase civil penalties for documentation, marine casualty \nreporting, and uninspected vessel manning violations.\n  The bill would renew authorization for several advisory committees \nthat provide the Coast Guard with key private sector input.\n  It would also authorize the electronic filing of certain vessel \ncommercial instruments, making filing easier both for vessel owners and \nthe Coast Guard.\n  The bill would improve the management of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, a \n36,000 member volunteer organization that provides the Coast Guard with \nlow-cost assistance in its boating safety mission.\n  First, it would define the status of, and provide certain protections \nfor auxiliary members while they are performing official Coast Guard \nduties. It would also improve their ability to cooperate with State \nauthorities and obtain excess Coast Guard resources.\n  The bill makes an important change in recreational boating safety by \nrestructuring the process for providing States with recreational \nboating safety grants and stimulating nontrailerable vessel facility \nconstruction.\n  A key provision of the bill would reduce the regulatory burden on \nU.S. commercial vessel operators by: Shifting away from excessive U.S. \nvessel standards toward accepted international standards; authorizing \nthe use of third party and self-inspection programs as alternatives to \nCoast Guard inspections; and extending U.S. vessel inspection \nintervals.\n  Both the Coast Guard and industry strongly support these changes. \nThey will enable Coast Guard inspectors to focus more on the problem of \nsubstandard foreign vessels calling on U.S. ports.\n  The bill also includes numerous technical changes to establish \nalternate vessel measurement requirements that will enable U.S. vessel \ndesigners and operators to be competitive in the international vessel \nmarket.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1004\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I am pleased to cosponsor the \nCoast Guard authorization bill for the current and next fiscal years. \nThe Coast Guard is one of our Nation's oldest agencies, tracing its \nroots to the year 1790, but it also is one of our most efficient. The \nCoast Guard has broad ranging responsibilities, from enforcing \nAmerica's maritime laws to ensuring the safety of recreational boaters \nin places like the beautiful Lewis and Clark Lake in my home State of \nSouth Dakota.\n  I believe this bill makes a serious effort to improve the Coast \nGuard's efficiency while maintaining its effectiveness. It is clear the \nAmerican taxpayers are demanding a smaller, more accountable Federal \nGovernment. At the same time, the demand for certain Government \nservices, including those provided by the Coast Guard, continues to be \ngreat. I intend, by working with my colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee and along with other Senators who are interested in the Coast \nGuard, to meet this challenge.\n  Mr. President, the core provisions of this bill are consistent with \nthe agenda of the new Congress. For example, the bill includes \nimportant provisions that enhance recreational boating safety for the \nNation's 50 million boaters by providing vital funding to the States to \ncontinue essential boating safety programs while eliminating the need \nto fund the program through annual appropriations. It also provides a \nstable source of funding to improve the safety of highway bridges that \ncross navigable waters. It reduces unnecessary and costly regulations \non industry, thereby improving the competitiveness of the U.S. maritime \nindustry. It also addresses the operation of the Coast Guard auxiliary, \na 36,000 volunteer organization, and it improves the management and \nefficiency of the service.\n  I am pleased to have the very capable Senator Stevens of Alaska, \nchairman of our Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, spearheading this \nauthorization process. I'm hopeful the Commerce Committee will be able \nto act on this bill in an expedited fashion. I ask my colleagues to \nwork with me as we authorize the Coast Guard.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1005. A bill to amend the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to improve \nthe process of constructing, altering, purchasing, and acquiring public \nbuildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                the public buildings reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I introduce the Public Buildings \nReform Act of 1995.\n  This law will change the way our Government puts up Federal \nbuildings.\n\n\n                        spending on courthouses\n\n  Montanans want Government to cut waste, and spending on Federal \nbuildings is a place where you can find a lot of waste.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee last year, \nI investigated several large Federal courthouse construction projects. \nI found that there is little control over the design and costs of \nFederal courthouse projects.\n  Courthouses sound small, but they are big money. Last year, GSA \nrequested over $420 million for courthouse projects.\n  And for this fiscal year, GSA is asking for a courthouse construction \nbudget more than 50 percent higher. GSA wants more than $645 million \nfor courthouses. About two out of every three tax dollars spent by GSA \ngoes to build courthouses.\n\n\n                          waste in courthouses\n\n  Mr. President, these are huge numbers--a billion dollars in 2 years \nfor Federal courthouse construction. And, to be charitable, this money \nis not always spent wisely.\n  Many courthouses are way too expensive. Quite a few have cost us over \n$200 million, and one has run up bills in excess of $500 million. And \nwhat is particularly galling, some of these courthouses are practically \npalaces.\n  You can find courthouses around the country with such extravagant \nfurnishings as mahogany and rosewood interior panelling, brass \ndoorknobs, private kitchens for judges, boat docks, and more. There is \nno reason for it. We would be better off not spending the money for \nthese things at all.\n  There are even cases where the judges have set such high design \nstandards for courthouses that they can only be satisfied by building a \nnew courthouse, even though renovating the existing building may \nactually make more sense.\n\n\n                  the general services administration\n\n  So why has this happened? To find out, we have to look at an obscure \nagency called the ``General Services Administration'' or GSA.\n  The GSA is the Federal Government's landlord. It leases and builds \nFederal office buildings, courthouses, border stations, and other \nFederal structures. And GSA has the responsibility to make sure the \nGovernment spends its money wisely for real estate transactions. But \nunfortunately, GSA does not have the legislative tools to make wise \nreal estate decisions.\n  First of all, it does not set priorities. Each year, GSA submits a \nbudget request to Congress that delineates the projects to be funded, \nthere is no way for Congress to know which projects are the most \nimportant based on need.\n  And GSA is not solely to blame. It is often forced to adopt pet \nprojects on behalf of individual Members of Congress, rather than \nbasing its decisions on an overall vision of what construction is \nnecessary. Each year, Congress approves projects, especially courthouse \nprojects, that are not necessary and worthy but rather frilly and \nwasteful.\n  Second, responsibility for final designs is spread among different \nareas of Government, meaning that no one person is finally accountable \nfor making \n\n[[Page S 9463]]\nsensible fiscal decisions. I was stunned to find, for example, that the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts set its own design guidelines for \ncourthouses. This is one reason you suddenly find that a relatively \nresponsible building has suddenly sprouted fountains and grown rosewood \npanels.\n  In effect, the courts themselves design their own courthouses just as \na king can design his own palace. The temptations are obvious even in \ntheory. And they are glaring when you go to visit some of the \ncourthouses we investigated last year. To make matters worse, the \ndesign guidelines are constantly changing at the whim of the AOC. \nVirtually nobody knows what they are. And, according to the General \nAccounting Office, the AOC frequently inflates the projected number of \njudges to be housed in a particular courthouse.\n                            time for reform\n\n  Mr. President, it is time for reform. A more rational, accountable \nprocess can cut waste, save money and make Government more responsive \nto taxpayers, that is what my bill would do: To improve oversight, it \nwill require GSA each year to submit a biennial plan to Congress that \nprioritizes Federal building projects; to ensure accountability, it \nwill rewrite the courthouse design guide and require GSA to establish a \nuniform, responsible set of design standards; To improve oversight, it \nwill require GSA to submit more information to Congress on each \nproject, such as a realistic projection of the number of judges to be \nhoused by a new courthouse; To cut waste, it will require GSA to fully \njustify the need and cost of each project. This must include a \nbenchmark cost, to let the public see whether a project is extremely \nexpensive for that particular area of the country, and on top of that, \nit will impose a 9-month moratorium on the spending of money for any \nnew construction projects so we can get these other reforms in place.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, we all have to prioritize our own personal budgets and \nneeds. GSA and the courts should do the same. This bill will help them \ndo that.

Each prospectus shall \n     include:\n       (a) a brief description of the project, including scope and \n     tenant agency;\n       (b) the location of the project and the estimated maximum \n     cost;\n       (c) the cost benchmark for the project;\n       (d) the current number of Federal judges and courtrooms as \n     of the date of submission of the prospectus; and\n       (e) the projected number of Federal judges and courtrooms \n     expected to be accommodated by the proposed project;\n       (1) the projected figures must be justified by including \n     information on the authorized judicial positions and Federal \n     judges expected to be in senior status.\n       Gives GSA the emergency authority to submit a prospectus \n     for a project not contained in the biennial plan if there is \n     an overriding interest. Should such a prospectus be submitted \n     under this emergency authority, the prospectus must still be \n     approved by the appropriate committees.\n       Allows the Administrator to enter into an emergency lease, \n     of no more than 5 years, if there is a Presidentially \n     declared disaster issued pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\n       Provides that should GSA seek a reprogramming request from \n     the Congressional Appropriations Committees for a project, \n     GSA must notify the appropriate committees of the reasons for \n     the request and the reprogramming amount.\n       Ensures that an 11(b) project request made by Congressional \n     committees are considered as part of the overall biennial \n     planning process and not authorized separately.

Federal Government Asset Management.\n       This section establishes a central repository at GSA to \n     house the asset management information of the Federal \n     Government. Each agency will identify--through a long-term \n     plan--unneeded, obsolete and underutilized public buildings \n     and annually report the information to GSA. The GSA, in turn, \n     will find cost-effective uses for the public buildings, \n     including asset sales.\n       Section 5. Addressing Long-Term Government Housing Needs.\n       This section provides that within one year, each agency \n     shall report to Congress on the long-term housing needs of \n     the agency in an attempt to reduce the Federal space needs. \n     GSA will designate managers to each agency to assist in this \n     review. By the end of the third year, each Federal agency \n     shall, to the maximum extent practicable, reduce by no less \n     than 10 percent its aggregate office or storage space.\n       Section 6. Moratorium on the Construction of Public \n     Buildings.\n       This section provides for a nine month moratorium on new \n     construction, purchase or acquisition projects.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I heard of \nthe passing of Chief Justice Warren Burger earlier this week. Today, I \nam thankful for this opportunity to reflect upon the life of a tireless \npublic servant; he was committed to the judicial system and faithfully \ndevoted to the Constitution. These two thematic strands permeated his \npublic life, both during his legal career and after he had left the \ncourt. Serving as Chief Justice of the United States for 17 years, he \nlead the Court through a gradual, centric shift, presiding with \nimpartiality and fairness.\n  The Chief proved the terms liberal and conservative inadequate in \ncharacterizing his perspective on the Constitution. This pragmatism was \nput to the test in 1974 when he wrote the majority opinion in a \nunanimous decision which led to the resignation of the president who \nappointed him. The Court ruled that President Nixon must surrender \ntapes of recorded conversations, which had been subpoenaed during the \nWatergate investigation.\n  Much of his life's work focused on improving the operations and \nadministration of the courts. Unsatisfied with status quo, the Chief \nbegan raising his voice against the problems in the judicial system. He \nadvocated improving legal education with emphasis on practical skills \nand ethics. The Chief was a consummate victim's advocate, sympathizing \nwith their rage, frustration, and bitterness.\n  He carried his dedication for efficiency into the halls of the \nSupreme Court. Faced with a litigation explosion, the Chief took pro-\nactive measures to expedite the courts' handling of cases. He and he \nalone masterminded the consolidation of judicial services, now housed \nin the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judicial Building. His dedication to \nimproving the structures of the courts was reflected in a 1986 \nresolution by the Conference of State Chief Justices and State Court \nAdministrators to say that the Chief had done ``more than any other \nperson in history to improve the operation of all our nation's \ncourts.''\n  His veneration for the Constitution did not cease at the end of his \njudicial career. In 1978, in a speech at the National Archives, Chief \nJustice Burger proposed a 3-year-long observance of the bicentennial of \nthe Constitution with the intent of reeducating citizens about the \nfounding principles and ideals of this Nation focusing especially on \nyoung people. He wanted young minds to recognize the Constitution as a \nliving document that continues to reflect the philosophies of its \nFramers and contemporary American virtues. Just 8 years later, the \nChief stepped down from the position of Chief Justice to become \nchairman of the Bicentennial Commission. Under his direction this 5 \nyear observance became a comprehensive program of activities, including \nprojects in schools and colleges, major judicial gatherings, \npublication of books and pamphlets, massive distribution of copies of \nthe Constitution, and the creation and preparation of television \ndocumentaries. He succeeded in giving the Nation a history and civics \nlesson.\n  The legacy of the Chief's promotion of civics education can be \nwitnessed among the thousands of high school students who participate \nannually in the We the People * * * the Citizen and the Constitution \nProgram. This program culminates in a competition where students test \ntheir knowledge of the founding documents before a panel of \nconstitutional scholars. Lincoln High School has attended the national \nfinals as State champions from Oregon, since the program's inception in \n1987. This school's winning tradition has twice led them to the \nnational title. As I watched Warren congratulating these students from \nOregon, his devotion to the Constitution and his desire to transmit \nthis enthusiasm to the students was evident. It was as if someone had \ngiven him a shot of adrenalin.\n  In the various tributes and salutes done in the publications around \nthe country, the human side of Warren Burger is often overlooked. I was \nfortunate to share a personal relationship with the Chief. We had \nsimilar interests, from our love of history and antiquities to our \nmutual quest for the perfect garden. We were two green thumbs serving \nthe public in our civic capacities. Warren was a man of many \ndistinctions. Historians will remember him for his professional \nachievements, I will remember him as an admirable colleague and dear \nfriend.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9468-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9468-S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     SMOKE-FREE CLASS OF 2000 FORUM\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nfollowing letters from students in my State be printed as a part of the \nRecord. Kevin LeSaicherre and Leah Poche were youth ambassadors to the \nannual Smoke-free Class of 2000 Forum.\n  The letters follow:\n\n                                   Ponchatoula, LA, March 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Livingston,\n     Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Livingston: This week in school I \n     learned quite a bit in regard to how hazardous smoking is to \n     my health. I am a seventh grader at St. Joseph School in \n     Ponchatoula. I heard about the Smoke-Free Class of 2000 and \n     wanted to become involved. I am writing this letter to \n     suggest that all the buildings in Louisiana become smoke \n     free. Can you assist me in this goal?\n       When I go to restaurants with my family, I can still smell \n     cigarette smoke even if we sit in a non-smoking section. That \n     most likely means that my family is receiving second-hand \n     smoke. I believe that people do not deserve second-hand smoke \n     if they are not the ones smoking.\n       According to a graph of high school seniors using 1993 \n     information, 19\\1/2\\% of boys surveyed smoked and 18\\1/2\\% of \n     the girls surveyed smoked. This shows that many people are \n     young when they begin smoking. According to the law, most \n     seniors are not even old enough to buy cigarettes. Stores are \n     not supposed to sell cigarettes to people under the age of \n     18.\n       If people cannot smoke in the buildings of Louisiana, it \n     would make it more difficult of them to smoke. Maybe that \n     would make some of them stop smoking. In addition, the non-\n     smoking public would not be exposed to second-hand smoke.\n       Another plan I have is to change the Surgeon General's \n     warning on the cigarette ads, cartons, and billboards. It \n     should be readable instead of being so small and all the \n     dangers and risks of smoking should be listed. Thank you for \n     your help in these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kevin LeSaicherre.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Ponchatoula, LA, March 12, 1995.\n     Mayor Julian Dufreche,\n     City Hall, Ponchatoula, LA.\n       Dear Mr. Mayor: Hi, my name is Leah Poche'. I'm a seventh \n     grader at St. Joseph School. I would like to call your \n     attention to the obstacle facing Ponchatoula's youth. I am \n     talking about the pressure set upon us in regard to \n     cigarettes and spit-tobacco.\n       Cigarettes, we have detected are harmful to our body. In \n     1965 Congress passed a law requiring packages of cigarettes \n     to have a health caution label. Since 1971 commercial ads on \n     cigarettes and spit-tobacco were banned from television and \n     radio. In 1972 manufactures agreed to include health caution \n     labels in all cigarette advertisements. In 1984 a system of \n     four different warning labels were created.\n       These are all great improvements. But unfortunately people \n     just keep buying. My class has seen video after video about \n     people who smoke and do spit-tobacco. That is great, but some \n     people still think that it is a major joke. It isn't. I know \n     from former experiences that smoking anything can destroy \n     your life and the life of the people who love you. Many \n     people do not realize this until it is too late.\n       My question is why. Why do people even grow tobacco? We \n     know that it is harmful to the body. So what purpose does \n     tobacco serve in life but to just destroy life.\n       Many people believe that the government should raise taxes \n     on cigarettes. I have thought about this and I personally \n     believe that if this takes place that the results will \n\n[[Page S 9469]]\n     be harmful to everyone. We do not know how far people would go to get \n     cigarettes. For example, if teenagers were not to have enough \n     money to buy the cigarettes that they would go to extreme \n     measures to obtain the money. They would start to rob people, \n     houses, and businesses. Innocent people would just get hurt. \n     Already the violence in Ponchatoula has increased. And if \n     taxes go up the violence might get totally out of control.\n       Now I would like to make a suggestion to use the tax money \n     that we already receive from the purchase of cigarettes and \n     spit-tobacco to inform people more about the dangers of it's \n     use.\n       I would like to thank you for your time to read this letter \n     and ask that you do something about this major problem.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Leah Poche'.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9468-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  EULOGY FOR DEBRA LYNN SIMMONS STULL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is nothing that confounds \nour logic and our sense of justice more than life cut short before its \ntime. And when a person of special character and giftedness dies young, \nthe loss casts a long shadow over everyone who knew the individual. The \nmemory never completely recedes into the past, nor do we ever find a \npoint of comfortable reconciliation with it.\n  Such is the case with the recent and untimely death of Debra Lynn \nSimmons Stull, sister of my director of communications, Kyle Simmons. A \nwife, a mother, a sister and a daughter, Debbie had already led a life \nthat was rich with family bonds, with church service, and with \ncommunity involvement. She was so energetic and vibrant that everyone \nwho knew her naturally expected she would long outlast them all. But \nthat was not to be. An accident at home suddenly interrupted this \nshining life, leaving the many who loved her the difficult task of \nsorting it all out.\n  Debbie's brother Kyle composed a beautiful eulogy for his sister, \nwhich I would like to read into the Record. It tells the story of a \nremarkable individual--who was not a person of title or lofty position, \nnot someone whose name was regulary mentioned on the weekend talk \nshows, nor someone who even remotely desired such attention--yet Debbie \nStull lived her life in a way that made the world she inhabited \nimmeasurably better and that profoundly touched each person she knew.\n  In this time of mourning, I would like to extend my sympathy to the \nStull and Simmons families. May you find the grace and strength to help \nyou through this present hardship.\n                 Eulogy for Debbie Stull, June 24, 1995\n\n       It doesn't surprise me or my family one bit that the \n     occasion of my sister Debbie's death has produced such an \n     outpouring of public support and comfort.\n       Debbie wasn't neutral or ambivalent about anything--so, \n     consequently, it was impossible to be neutral or ambivalent \n     about her. And, in her case, everyone loved her.\n       She was one of life's active participants. If you were ever \n     around her, you knew that she engaged you with her smile, her \n     laugh, her warmth. As my Mom said recently, Debbie came at \n     life with a balled-up fist--determined to ring from it all \n     the vitality it could offer. And she did.\n       For some, emotion is like water collecting behind the wall \n     of a dam, but for Debbie it was a never ending spring which \n     flowed freely and would wash over anyone lucky enough to be \n     nearby. As someone said to me last night at the visitation, \n     she always made you feel special.\n       No doubt she touched your lives in many ways. Some of you \n     will recall her wonderful singing voice. She always loved \n     music and singing in church was always her favorite.\n       And let me say to the many children in her choir, Miss \n     Debbie loved you. Nothing would make her happier than for all \n     of you to go on singing.\n       Others may remember her as the always ready volunteer, \n     ready to pitch in and help. Still others will recall the glow \n     of her irrepressible smile--she smiled more than any other \n     person I ever knew. And I'm sure others were on the receiving \n     end of one of her hugs which said, ``I understand.''\n       Of course, she touched us, too.\n       My Dad moved the family in 1952, to St. Petersburg, \n     Florida, where he began his career as a Baptist minister. Not \n     yet 30, he and Mom raised Anne, Debbie, and Bob in a world of \n     real togetherness.\n       It didn't take Debbie long to make her mark.\n       In his early childhood, Bob was slightly more interested in \n     the world that turned inside his head that what was happening \n     elsewhere. You could call him a dreamer.\n       Ordinarily, this quality would have marked him as an easy \n     target for some of the other kids except that Debbie--in \n     addition to being his sister--was also the neighborhood \n     enforcer. It was widely known that if you messed with Bob, \n     you messed with Debbie. And, of course, that fact was enough \n     to make Bob's interior world safe from harm. Years later, Bob \n     would remark that Debbie would march through the gates of \n     Hell for you. And he was right.\n       Anne and Debbie sang together. When they were teenagers the \n     task of washing and drying the dishes fell to them. They \n     didn't seem to mind too much because it gave them chance to \n     sing hymns. With Anne's rich alto and Debbie's clear soprano, \n     their voices were beautiful together. As they grew older, \n     they sang together less and less, but what we wouldn't give \n     to hear their sisterly voices wrap around each other one more \n     time in harmony.\n       Mom and Debbie were best friends. Debbie's social ease and \n     grace came from Mom. And it was only Debbie who could match \n     Mom's enthusiasm for shopping.\n       The last time they were together, they woke at 6 a.m. to \n     drive three hours to Jacksonville for a day of shopping--nine \n     full hours worth. Although I've not asked, I have no doubt \n     the radio was never turned on during that long drive home--\n     they simply had too much to talk about. With those two, the \n     apple did not fall from the tree.\n       All the way to the end, my Dad's nickname for Debbie was \n     ``flea.'' It was his fatherly way, I think, of capturing at \n     once her boundless energy and how sweet and small and \n     precious she was to him. Debbie always loved his special name \n     for her. And it was always with love that he used it.\n       Anne Kathryn, I don't need to tell you how much your Momma \n     loved you. You were the light in her life. I cannot recall a \n     single conversation with your Mom when she didn't tell me how \n     and what you were doing--and she was always so proud of you.\n       David, what can be said? We love you. Debbie's life force \n     was so strong it made us believe she would be here forever, \n     but we were wrong.\n       And so we huddle together today to say goodbye to Debra \n     Lynn Simmons Stull; sister and daughter, mother and wife, \n     friend and neighbor, partner in song.\n       We commit her body to the earth, her soul to the heavens--\n     but her spirit lives on in every last one of us who ever knew \n     her.\n       We will miss her very, very much.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9469-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9469-S9470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        THE DEATH OF EFREM KURTZ\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to report to the Senate \nthe sad news of the death, in London, of the beloved American conductor \nEfrem Kurtz. He passed away at the great age of 95 after a career \nunequaled in the history of music in the 20th century, which he all but \nspawned. He was, of course, born in St. Petersburg in 1900, later \nmoving to Berlin where he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic, thence to \nStuttgart where he directed the philharmonic there from 1924 to 1933. \nAs a Jew, he left what was by then Nazi Germany. He became a guest \nconductor of the New York Philharmonic, the NBC Symphony, the San \nFrancisco and Chicago Symphonies, and for the longest while the Kansas \nCity Symphony. He was a guest conductor of many orchestras in Europe, \nJapan, Australia, Canada, Israel, the Soviet Union, and much of the \nrest of the world. But the ``International Who's Who,'' 1994-95, \nidentifies him as American conductor, the term I used earlier. He was \nawarded a gold disc by Columbia Records after the sale of three million \nof his recordings with the New York Philharmonic alone. He was loved \nand admired the world over, but most especially here in the United \nStates. We shall miss him even as we have the treasure of his memory. \nOur great sympathy goes to his beloved wife, Mary.\n  In order that the Record might show the range of his achievements, I \nask that there be included at this point the entry of Efrem Kurtz from \n``Current Biography,'' 1946, at which time he had just begun conducting \nthe Kansas City Philharmonic. Finally, I would ask that a flag be flown \nover the Capitol in his honor and presented to his widow.\n  The biography follows:\n\n                     [From Current Biography, 1946]\n       Kurtz, Efrem Nov. 7, 1900--Conductor.\n       Address: b. c/o Kansas City Philharmonic Orchestra, Kansas \n     City, MO.\n       One of the younger men who have been gradually \n     demonstrating their competence in the orchestral field is \n     Efrem Kurtz, permanent conductor of the Kansas City, \n     Philharmonic Orchestra. After an impressive debut in Berlin \n     in 1920 as a last-minute substitute, he became known as a \n     conductor of symphony, and as musical director of the Ballet \n     Russe de Monte Carlo, in Europe, South America, Australia, \n     and the United States.\n       One of four children, all musical, Efrem Kurtz was born in \n     St. Petersburg Russia, on November 7, 1900. He is the son of \n     Aron and Sima Kurtz. His father, a storekeeper, loved music \n     but did not play an instrument. His mother, however, played \n     the piano, and his grandfather had conducted a military band \n     for Czar Nicholas I. Through his grandmother he is distantly \n     related to Mendelssohn. Young Kurtz received most of this \n     musical education at the conservatory in St. \n\n[[Page S 9470]]\n     Petersburg, where he studied with Tcherepmine, Glazunov, and Vitol.\n       In 1918 he was graduated from the Peter the Great High \n     School there, and from 1918 to 1920 he was a student at the \n     University of Riga. When the Kurtz family was later forced to \n     flee Russia because of the Revolution, the young musician \n     resumed his studies at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, with \n     special classes in conducting under Carl Schroder, and was \n     graduated in 1922. His first big opportunity has come in 1920 \n     when at the last moment he was asked to substitute for Arthur \n     Nikisch as conductor of a recital by Isadora Duncan. A highly \n     successful debut brought the novice an immediate guest \n     contract for three performances with the Berlin Philharmonic.\n       During the next several years Kurtz followed a heavy \n     schedule which took him to forty-eight German cities and \n     later to Italy and Poland. Then, in 1924 he was appointed \n     chief conductor of the Stuttgart Philharmonic and musical \n     director of the radio station servicing all southern Germany. \n     In these posts Kurtz remained for nine years, until the rise \n     of the Nazis to power. His activities, however, were not \n     confined to Stuttgart. In 1927, for instance, Anna Pavlova, \n     the dancer, heard his conducting and engaged him to conduct \n     her ballet company at Covent Garden. The ten-day season was \n     followed by a South American tour with the Pavlova Ballet, \n     during which period Kurtz also conducted symphony concerts in \n     Buenos Aries and Rio de Janeiro. The South American \n     engagement led to an invitation to wield the baton in \n     Australia, and the Australians were so enthusiastic that they \n     extended to him three separate offers to remain. Kurtz, \n     however, preferred to return to Europe. While permanent \n     conductor at Stuttgart he also filled engagements in Holland, \n     Belgium, and other European countries, and in 1931 and 1932 \n     he conducted a series of Handel concerts at the Salzburg \n     Festival.\n       In 1933 Kurtz, a Jew, left Germany for France. There, in \n     Paris, Colonel Wassily de Basil asked him whether he would \n     aid in an emergency by conducting the Ballet Russe de Monte \n     Carlo without rehearsal, and on the strength of his \n     performance appointed Kurtz musical director of the Ballet \n     Russe. This position the young conductor was also to occupy \n     for nine years, touring extensively throughout Europe, South \n     America, and the United States, and at intervals appearing as \n     guest conductor in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, with the \n     New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra at Lewisohn Stadium \n     for several seasons, and with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, \n     the NBC Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Detroit \n     Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and others. His ballet \n     work encompassed both the classical repertoire and new \n     choreographies some composed to the music of the great \n     symphonies. Although, unlike some balletomanes, he believes \n     that the latter should be included in the repertoire, or \n     ballets utilizing symphonic scores the Ballet Russe's former \n     musical director was on one occasion reported to have \n     remarked. ``Oh, I never see them. I keep my eyes closed. But \n     it is not so cruel to use the music that way, because it is \n     experimental. [Although] it is true that when I am conducting \n     something like Brahms's Fourth I do not want to see a Mickey \n     Mouse come out and cavort.''\n       Kurtz has, however, written seriously of ballet. ``The \n     ballet as an art form,'' he said in 1941, ``offers to the \n     conductor problems which are inherent in the combination of \n     two heterogeneous elements: bodily movement and tone. The \n     ballet requires absolute synchronization of music and \n     physical movement, and in this synthesis lie the problems \n     peculiar to the ballet. . . .I am a conductor and a musician \n     first, but ever since the days when I was associated with \n     Anna Pavlova I have been impressed by the manifold \n     possibilities involved in the relationship of music and the \n     dance. If the conductor is sensitive to the problems \n     involved, he might very well come to the point where he \n     doubts his ability to preserve the highest standards of \n     musicianship while, at the same time, maintaining \n     interpretation, synchronizing the accompaniment to the \n     movements of the dancers, and fully expanding the \n     choreographer's ideas. . . .When one conducts classical \n     ballet, he must follow the dancer in finest detail. He must \n     be thoroughly conversant with the steps of the dancers; more, \n     he must have developed an intuitive feeling for equilibrium. \n     . . .All the problems involved in classical ballet are \n     pertinent to the modern with an additional important element. \n     As contrasted to the classical ballet which is merely the \n     projection of a mood, the modern is conceived for the \n     execution of a story. . . .Composer and choreographer have \n     produced the modern ballet in closest collaboration. Tempo \n     becomes a matter of a work's content, of a dance's very \n     essence. The dancer becomes the instrument of the \n     choreographer who, in turn, is a much the servant of the \n     composer's ideas as the composer is willing to integrate his \n     composition with the potentialities\n      of pantomiming. . . . Music originally written as ballet \n     music is without doubt better than music arranged for \n     ballet. The possibilities for young composers in the field \n     of ballet music are tremendous.''\n       Kurtz has been called ``the finest of ballet conductors,'' \n     but although he enjoyed his work with the Ballet Russe, he \n     readily admitted his preference for symphonic conducting. In \n     the autumn of 1943, therefore, he accepted an invitation to \n     become conductor of the Kansas City Philharmonic Orchestra, \n     to succeed Karl Krueger who had left for Detroit. The next \n     season Kurtz was re-engaged for another two years. His first \n     thought on taking over in Kansas City, he has said, was how \n     to bring his music to the masses, how to make them come to \n     understand and like it; and despite opposition he began to \n     offer ``pops'' concerts featuring good music at very low \n     prices, annual free concerts, ``name'' soloists, and special \n     concerts for school children in an endeavor to attract \n     audiences. ``The most important thing is to get them in,'' he \n     said, ``and then sell myself and the orchestra.'' The \n     response proved that he was right, for by the end of his \n     second season the orchestra was out of the red for the first \n     time in many years and seemed well on its way to becoming \n     self-sufficient.\n       He moves Kansas City audiences, it is said, because ``he \n     knows how to inject his dramatic flare into programming, at \n     the same time maintaining the highest musical standards.'' \n     Both in Kansas City and during his guest appearances it is \n     his habit to include modern compositions and the works of the \n     Russian masters on his programs, and he has won commendation \n     for his conducting of these works as well as of the standard \n     repertoire. (Igor Stravinsky \\40\\ Kurtz has known for many \n     years; he has seen ``many of the composer's works come into \n     being and has been their consistent advocate.'') He is \n     likewise eager to foster new instrumental and vocal talent, \n     in this regard being a sponsor of Carol Brice, contralto, and \n     William Kapell, pianist, both of whom have been especially \n     well received by the critics; and for 1947 he planned \n     engagements for eight young American solosists during the \n     Kansas City winter ``Pops'' season. In 1944 Kurtz's Kansas \n     City Philharmonic was selected as the first orchestra to be \n     presented on NBC's new radio program Orchestras of the \n     Nation, with reappearances scheduled for the following \n     seasons.\n       In addition to his regular tasks Kurtz has led a specially \n     assembled orchestra for several Warner Brothers' shorts of \n     the Ballet Russe and has conducted the London Philharmonic \n     Orchestra in the scores for two motion pictures starring \n     Elisabeth Bergner. A ``tall, gaunt Russian,'' Kurtz was \n     married in 1933 to Katherine Jaffe, whom he describes ad an \n     authority on cooking, ceramics, and painting. Kurtz himself \n     makes a hobby of art, specializing in water colors and \n     caricature. So well known has his interest in art work by \n     children become that, it is pointed out, mothers now send him \n     the paintings of their talented offspring for criticism. In \n     addition, he collects letters from famous contemporaries, \n     possessing many from Einstein \\41\\, Hindemith \\41\\, Prokofiev \n     \\41\\ and others; and he has built up an unusual collection of \n     stamped letters which have some interesting historical \n     significance. Of one of his constant companions, his French \n     poodle Dandy, the conductor says, ``You can talk to him and \n     he understands, but he doesn't answer. That is so good \n     sometimes.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9469-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9470-S9471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AN ARAB IDENTITY IN THE CAPITAL\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the issues that will \neventually have to be confronted is the status of Jerusalem.\n  No Israeli Government can survive that divides Jerusalem. We should \nunderstand that, and we should not create false impressions among our \nArab friends that there is going to be any other status.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen a recent President and Secretary of State \nunnecessarily raise doubts about Jerusalem.\n  But there will have to be some practical, symbolic adjustments made. \nRecently, I saw an article in the Jerusalem Post by Abraham Rabinovich, \na member of the Jerusalem Post editorial staff, which had some \nobservations. I am not, at this point, ready to endorse those \nobservations, but what they do involve is fresh and practical thinking \non this issue.\n  My own guess is that the current peace negotiations will stumble \nahead. It will not be a graceful march, but Israel will be ahead and \nthe Arab people, of whatever nationality, will be ahead. A full-scale \nwar will gradually diminish as a probability.\n  But wars can erupt again and frequently erupt over symbols as much as \nover substance. The Rabinovich article is one that, I believe, merits \nreading by people who are looking for practical answers.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Jerusalem Post, May 27, 1995]\n\n                    An Arab Identity in the Capital\n\n                        (By Abraham Rabinovich)\n\n       The terrifying scent of sanctity mixing with politics in \n     the mountain air probably accounts for the fatuousness from \n     normally sober politicians on the subject of Jerusalem.\n       Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sought to justify this month's \n     expropriations in east Jerusalem as an attempt to meet the \n     needs \n\n[[Page S 9471]]\n     of an expanding population. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres suggested \n     that it was an evenhanded taking from Jews and Arabs in order \n     to build for Jews and Arabs. Mayor Ehud Olmert said that any \n     housing shortage in the Arab sector is their fault--even as \n     he raises funds for Jewish messianists who, like detonators, \n     insert themselves ever deeper into Arab quarters. The \n     expropriations, of course, have nothing to do with urban \n     considerations or even-handedness. They are the opening shots \n     in what Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer has called the \n     battle for Jerusalem.\n       What makes this relatively small expropriation different \n     from previous massive ones is that the latter were made in a \n     context of political confrontation, while the current one \n     comes in the midst of a delicate and troubled peace process. \n     The controversy may serve a useful purpose, however, if it \n     jars us collectively into beginning to think about the \n     unthinkable: finding a political solution for Jerusalem.\n       An undivided city under Israeli sovereignty is a slogan, \n     not a solution. There will be no solution unless Arab and \n     Moslem sensitivies concerning Jerusalem are taken into \n     account. Rabin's pledge of religious freedom will not carry \n     far. The Arabs, who have lived here for 1,400 years, want \n     political rights too, not just religious rights.\n       Jerusalem's Arabs are already entitled to almost 30% of the \n     seals on the City Council, although they have thus far chosen \n     not to take up the option. It is entirely conceivable that, \n     in the not-too-distant future, an Arab-haredi coalition will \n     leave Israel's capital in the hands of a non-Zionist city \n     governments (a possibility hastened by the current \n     expropriation, which the government says is intended for \n     haredim and Arabs).\n       The Arabs, however, want more than that. They want an \n     expression of their national identity in Jerusalem as well. \n     It is possible to give it to them without endangering \n     Israel's dominant status.\n       Creative diplomacy could permit the Palestinians to have \n     their capital in a place called Jerusalem without negating \n     Israel's position that it will not share its capital with \n     them.\n       Eizariya, for instance, is outside the city limits--outside \n     Israel, in fact--but is closer to the Old City, the heart of \n     Jerusalem, than is the Knesset.\n       What if the Palestinians were to call this Jerusalem too--\n     even if Israel does not acknowledge it as such--and establish \n     their seat of governance there?\n       Boroughs and areas of jurisdiction that partly overlap and \n     partly don't are other elements that have been proposed for a \n     Jerusalem solution. The Temple Mount remains the core of the \n     problem. Moshe Dayan's proposal to permit an Arab flag to fly \n     there is still one of the most constructive on the table. The \n     current boundaries of Jerusalem are not biblical writ. They \n     were drawn up in our own time by mortal men, guided by \n     strategic and demographic, not religious, considerations. The \n     new boundaries of 1967 tripled the size of Israeli Jerusalem \n     by incorporating not only Jordanian Jerusalem, but numerous \n     Arab villages around it. There is no reason those boundaries \n     could not be fuzzed in working out a solution both sides can \n     live with. Israeli construction in east Jerusalem has far \n     surpassed what was envisioned in the immediate aftermath of \n     the Six Day War. The main objective then was to link west \n     Jerusalem--via Ramat Eshkol and French Hill--with the \n     isolated Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus. When this \n     had been achieved and the diplomatic sky did not fall, bolder \n     expropriations were carried out.\n       Eventually one-third of east Jerusalem was expropriated. In \n     addition, a corridor left open east of Jerusalem in \n     anticipation of a Jordanian solution was eventually sealed \n     off by Ma'aleh Adumim. As geo-political strategy, this policy \n     worked brilliantly. The main-stream Palestinian camp, \n     watching the hills in Jerusalem and the territories being \n     covered with Israeli housing finally sued for peace. Such \n     heavily charged skirmishing, however, and even war itself or \n     intifada, seems simple compared to the prospect of Jews and \n     Arabs trying to share the city in political peace.\n       The absence of an assertive Arab political voice since 1967 \n     has made it relatively easy for Israel to run Jerusalem. A \n     Jewish-Arab council is easier to imagine as a cockpit of \n     rancorous conflict than of co-existence. (It is rancorous \n     enough, let it be said, as an all-Jewish council.) For the \n     Arabs, there will be an ongoing grievance at least as massive \n     as the Jewish housing estates covering the hills around \n     Jerusalem. For the Jews, the most authentic Arab voice will \n     long remain the one that drifted over the walls of the Old \n     City from the Temple Mount loudspeakers on the first dawn of \n     the Six Day War--itbach alyahud, slaughter the Jews.\n       It will not be easy. With wise leadership on both sides, \n     ever mindful that we are lying down and rising up together in \n     a mine field, it may be possible.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9470-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9471-S9472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  DISMANTLING THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have been a longtime advocate of \nstreamlining government and making it more effective to address the \nchallenges of the global economy and information age as we move into \nthe 21st century. While I have focused on these issues for many years \nas chairman and former ranking Republican of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I have never witnessed as great an interest in this critical \nissue than I have this Congress. I welcome this interest because I \nbelieve it offers great opportunity to achieve major and overdue \nstructural reform of the executive branch. We can and will achieve the \ngoal of smaller, better, and less costly government.\n  Most recently, attention has centered on eliminating the Commerce \nDepartment. It is endorsed as part of the budget resolution. The \nproposal introduced recently by Senator Abraham, the majority leader, \nand others provides a specific plan on how to dismantle the Department.\n  I have long endorsed the idea of dismantling the Commerce Department \nin the context of elevating, streamlining, and reconfiguring major \ntrade functions in the executive branch. It is very difficult to defend \nthe status quo as it exists today at the Commerce Department, and I \nbelieve the initiatives that have been introduced are an important step \ntoward the establishment of a government that is structured to deal \neffectively with the challenges of tomorrow, not yesterday.\n  I have worked on organizational issues for many years and I realize \nhow difficult it is to bring about needed and constructive change. Turf \nusually overwhelms the process, whether it is in the administration or \nCongress, and the private sector is often either unexcited about the \nissue, or they don't want to upset those with whom they have to work in \nthe current structure. So it is not surprising that the recent \nlegislation is controversial and that the trade provisions have \nengendered the greatest amount of concern. I, too, have concerns about \ncertain provisions.\n  I would like to turn briefly to some of the trade concerns that have \nbeen raised in the initial debate on this issue so far. First, I firmly \nbelieve a vast majority of us agree on the vital importance of trade to \nthis Nation and recognize that our Government plays a crucial role in \nthis area. This role includes performing key functions as negotiating \nagreements to open markets, enforcing and implementing trade \nagreements, administering trade laws and facilitating exports.\n  For many years now, I have called for significant reform of executive \nbranch trade functions and the case for reform has never been stronger \nthan today. Uniting major trade responsibilities under the clear \nleadership of one person and establishing a more effective trade voice \nfor our Nation is the direction in which we should head. It is time to \nrecognize that much of the Commerce Department's trade activities are \nintegrally involved with those of the USTR. There is no clear dividing \nline between them, except for the divided lines of authority. This has \ncaused, and continues to cause, wasteful duplication of effort, \nconfusion as to who is in charge, serious turf battles, and divide-and-\nconquer tactics by our trading partners. It is time that they become \npart of the same team with one coach in charge.\n  I have heard some disturbing accounts of how our trading partners \ntake advantage of our\n divided trade leadership. For example, I've been told of instances \nwhere the lead trade negotiator from one of our fiercest trading \npartners would play the USTR and Commerce trade negotiators off one \nanother by telling one that the other was willing to agree to something \nthat the other would not agree to.\n\n  Ambassador Kantor's recent testimony before a House Appropriations \nsubcommittee demonstrates the blurred nature of responsibilities \nbetween the International Trade Administration [ITA] and the USTR. He \nstated that the USTR's three top priorities are to ensure that the \nUruguay round agreements are implemented fairly, to enforce trade \nagreements, and to expand trade to new markets that offer the greatest \npotential for increased exports of American products. That sounds a lot \nlike what much of the ITA is doing.\n  I have an extremely high regard for the dedicated and talented staff \nat the USTR, but it is unrealistic to expect that they can continue to \nmanage effectively a trade agenda that is ever more demanding and \ncomplex, under the current structure of divided trade leadership and \nresponsibility. The fact \n\n[[Page S 9472]]\nthat there are some 40 detailees at the USTR--about 25 percent of its \ncurrent size--is indicative of the burdens the current structure is \nworking under. Furthermore, it is my understanding that two major \ncomponents of ITA--the international Economic Policy and Trade \ndevelopment offices spend about one-half of their time on trade \nnegotiations and policy development.\n  While we need to maintain a coordinating function on trade that \nallows for input from different parts of our government that may be \nimpacted by a particular trade matter, the USTR relies mostly heavily \non ITA for negotiating support and backup. Even Commerce's main export \npromotion entity, the U.S. And Foreign Commercial Service, is actively \nsupporting the USTR. For example, it plays an important role in the \nUSTR's annual National Trade Estimates Report. There is logic behind \nbringing Commerce and USTR trade functions together under one cabinet-\nlevel voice.\n  I would like to comment briefly on some of the concerns that have \nbeen raised with respect to merging these functions. One major concern \nis related to moving import Administration functions to the USTR \nbecause of possible trade-offs that might be made between trade \nnegotiations and administration of our trade laws. I would simply make \ntwo points in this regard. The first point is that the administration \nof antidumping and countervailing duty laws is a quasi-judicial process \nand must be implemented strictly according to law. The second point is \nthat these functions are already part of a department that has trade \nadvocacy as one of its primary function, something which one could \nargue would exert more pressure for trade-offs than would negotiations. \nIt is my understanding that Commerce's Office of Import Administration \nis kept separate from other trade functions and that is how it should \nremain under any single trade structure. At the same time, we should \nrecognize that, while the administration of these laws must be isolated \nfrom other primary trade functions, these issues are in fact part of \ntrade negotiations--they were a major issue in the WTO and are an \nactive part of past and current free trade talks.\n  Other strong concerns have been raised about the USTR's role as an \nhonest broker and interagency coordinator. While I appreciate some of \nthe concerns that have been raised, and I agree that there must be an \nhonest broker in the White House at the highest levels on major trade \ndecisions, it is not the USTR that seems to be performing that role. As \nfar as I can tell, every President has created his own small White \nHouse office to broker controversial trade\n decisions. Ambassador Kantor has himself testified that of the three \ntiers of the interagency coordinating mechanism, and I quote, ``(a)t \nthe highest level is the National Economic Council (NEC).'' At the \nlower levels, there is no reason why the USTR or a single cabinet trade \nstructure should not perform the lower level interagency process that \nexists.\n\n  Things have dramatically changed since the USTR, then the STR, was \ncreated in 1962. We are no longer simply negotiating occasional GATT \nrounds of tariff talks. While we have made some organizational changes \nalong the way, they have been relatively limited in scope, and the last \ntime we made any significant change was in 1979. Since then, our trade \nnegotiating agenda has taken center stage and has grown tremendously. \nThe issues are much broader and more complex than ever before, and the \nimplementation of trade agreements has also grown enormously in \nsignificance. Our Government's foreign commercial presence is often on \nthe front lines in discovering trade problems that might need to be \nnegotiated or are related to lack of implementation of certain \nagreements. Our current institutional structure that divides these and \nother major trade functions among separate entities is not, I would \nargue, in our national trade interest.\n  It is in our national trade interest to restructure trade functions \nin a way that builds on and improves the best features that exist. We \nwant to preserve the lean and mean negotiating structure of the USTR \nand to also ensure that there is an effective interagency and private \nsector advisory process that allows for legitimate input from other \nagencies and voices as needed. But our negotiators should have the \nnecessary support structure in place to achieve ambitious negotiating \nobjectives. We also should be implementing and administering trade \nagreements and trade programs in one house. There is not a whole lot of \nsense, for example, to the USTR administering the GSP program, while \nCommerce implements major bilateral trade agreements such as the \nsemiconductor agreement.\n  The specific business concerns that have been raised about the trade \nprovisions of the Commerce Dismantling Act must be examined very \nclosely, and the Committee on Governmental Affairs will be holding \nhearings on these and other aspects of the bill after the July recess. \nI share some of the concerns that have been raised, including those \nrelating to the international economic policy and trade development \nfunctions of the Commerce Department. I also believe greater \nconsolidation should be accomplished. A cabinet level trade structure \nshould include, for example, the Commerce Department's existing export \ncontrol functions.\n  Mr. President, citizens are demanding a government that works better, \nas well as costs less. An integrated trade structure within our \nGovernment will not only work better for our citizens, but it will also \nachieve efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.\n  In closing, I would just to like to say that there is a window of \nopportunity here to reflect in a comprehensive way about how we should \nbe organized to address the many trade challenges ahead of us. I hope \nwe can prevent jurisdictional concerns from becoming the driving force \nin this debate, and that we move it instead in a positive and \nconstructive direction. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nachieve the best trade structure for our country, one which will \npromote an effective national trade agenda for the 21st \ncentury.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9471-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9472-S9474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SINO-U.S. RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise today to voice my concern over a \ndisturbing trend which I see making itself manifest in certain \ngovernment and other circles in the People's Republic of China: the \ngrowing view that the sole driving force in the United States' policy \ntowards China is a desire on our part to weaken China and prevent its \nemergence as a player on the world stage. I have seen this view--in \nsome cases bordering on the paranoid--reflected in statements from the \nForeign Ministry, articles in the official and semi-official Chinese \nmedia such as a June 12 story by Wang Guang in Renmin Ribao entitled \n``Where Is the United States Taking Sino-American Relations?'', and in \ntalks with some Chinese government representatives.\n  This viewpoint worries me primarily because it is wrong, but it also \nconcerns me because of the underlying thinking which it reflects. If \nthe Chinese are sincere in their beliefs, then this view reflects a \ncomplete misunderstanding of us and how we as a country operate. On the \nother hand, if the view is being disseminated by conservative party \nfactions as part of a xenophobic campaign designed to bolster their \ncredentials during the present struggle to replace Deng Xiaoping, then \nit demonstrates a willingness on their part to baselessly poison our \nrelationship for domestic political gain. Finally, it is not outside \nthe realm of possibility that certain factions in the government are \nmanufacturing the entire thing in an effort to place the United States \non the defensive and wring a unilateral concession or two out of us; \nthey have done it before with other countries. Under any scenario, the \nresult is disturbing.\n  I believe that Beijing's new view is well summed up in the Renmin \nRibao article:\n\n       Over the past few years, only after going through setbacks \n     and difficulties has the United States improved and developed \n     relations with China. After the disintegration of the Soviet \n     Union, one view prevailed in the United States, which \n     maintained that ``China was a counterweight to the Soviet \n     Union\" during the Cold War and that it was ``no longer \n     important'' to set store by relations with China in the wake \n     of the Cold War. In September 1993, Washington came to \n     understand that ``China is a crucially important country and \n     that China's importance \n\n[[Page S 9473]]\n     has been neglected in the preceding few years.'' The United States then \n     modified its China policy. After that, while pursuing its \n     ``total contact'' policy, the United States continued to put \n     pressure on China over a series of issues. In May 1994, \n     Washington realized that the United States' pressures was \n     hardly effective for ``a country with a population of 1.2 \n     billion people,'' that ``China is a very large and very \n     important country,'' that ``its economy has the fastest \n     growth rate in the world,'' that its international status and \n     role are important, and that the United States needs to \n     maintain and develop relations with China. The United States \n     then separated the so-called human rights question from \n     China's MFN trading status. Only since then have Sino-\n     American relations developed vigorously.\n       During this time, however, another tendency in United \n     States-China policy grew. Following China's economic \n     development, Americans are vigorously advocating the ``China \n     threat theory.'' On 17 April, the Los Angeles Times carried \n     an article saying `` United States officials ``are beginning \n     to pay close attention to China and view it as a possible \n     long-term rival and threat to United States interests in the \n     Asia-Pacific region.'' U.S. officials have repeatedly denied \n     that the United States will isolate and contain China. \n     However, what is notable is that, while briefing the House of \n     Representatives International Relations Committee on 9 \n     February, a U.S. State Department official in charge of East \n     Asian and Pacific Affairs said: China ``does not pose a \n     direct threat to us. But what is obvious is that as we look \n     over the next decades, China will become increasingly strong. \n     Therefore, we are pursuing several policies so as to curb \n     this potential threat through all possible means.\n\n  Mr. President, let me try to dispel this conspiracy theory. First of \nall, the basic flaw in the Chinese position is that it assumes a \nmonolithic China policy on our part; but anyone who actually thinks \nthere could be such a thing is sorely misinformed. With a liberal \nDemocrat President drifting aimlessly through the sea of foreign policy \nand a conservative and assertive Republican Congress feeling the need \nto fill the void, the probability of there being a grand unitary U.S.-\nChina plan is about zero. The thought of the amount of accommodations \nthat would be necessary to achieve such a goal almost boggles the mind.\n  The second flaw in such a position is that the disparate events which \nthe Chinese draw together to form their conspiracy theory are just \nthat--disparate events each with its own, mostly unrelated, causes. For \nexample, the PRC views stronger U.S. interests in Taiwan, Tibet and \nHong Kong as a concerted effort on our part to, as a Library of \nCongress senior analyst recently put it, ``keep [them] preoccupied with \ntasks of protecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and \nless able to exert influence elsewhere.'' The PRC also sees \nconfirmation of this view in a recent spurt in the growth of our \ninterest in these areas. The Chinese, however, completely miss both the \nreal sources of our interest and the reason for the perceived \nacceleration therein.\n  Principle among these three is the Taiwan issue; or, as Beijing is \nfond of calling it, the ``Taiwan card.'' With the recent decision to \nadmit President Lee Teng-hui to the United States for a private visit, \nthe PRC is convinced that we have embarked on a new path to upgrade our \nrelationship with Taiwan at their expense. The PRC, however, must \nremember to view the decision within the overall context of our \nrelationship with Taiwan. We have been close friends with Taiwan for \nover 40 years, a considerably longer period of time than with the PRC. \nTaiwan is a fellow democracy in an area not known for its commitment to \ndemocratic ideals, and is one of our strongest trading partners. There \nare also strong cultural ties between us; for example, many of Taiwan's \nleaders, President Lee included, have attended university in this \ncountry.\n  Yet for years we have officially relegated Taiwan to less than \nsecond-class status among our friends, principally out of fear of \noffending mainland sensibilities. This treatment has included \nprohibiting its President from visiting our shores, even for a private \nvisit, a position which has long been viewed by Congress and the \nAmerican people as completely inequitable. As I have previously noted \non several occasions, the only persons to whom we regularly deny entry \nto this country are terrorists and criminals. It was strongly felt in \nCongress, and the country as a whole, that to add President Lee to that \nlist was a gratuitous insult to our friends. With the coming of a \nRepublican-controlled Congress, the desire to remove that insult found \na voice which, finally and rather sensibly, the administration heeded. \nThe PRC should remember, then, to view the decision in these simple \nterms--not as a major policy shift, not as a rejection of the Three \nCommuniques, not as a desire to create--in their parlance--``two \nChinas'' or ``one China one Taiwan,'' and not as a part of some hidden \nagenda. It was, rather, a gesture of equity to a friend. Furthermore, \nthe reason for the sudden acceleration in this process is not because \nof some deliberate plan, but for a more simple reason. Republicans have \ntraditionally been stronger supporters of Taiwan than Democrats, and in \nNovember of last year took control of both Houses of Congress for the \nfirst time in decades. As a result, we finally found ourselves in a \nposition to be able to effectuate our policies . . . thus the sudden \nspurt of activity.\n  Our interest in Tibet is also one unrelated to some sinister desire \nto preoccupy Beijing; rather, it is based on our desire to see that the \nTibetan people are not physically or culturally extinguished. Since \nTibet was forcibly incorporated into China by the PLA, the Beijing \nGovernment has committed acts in that country which shock the \nconscience. Thousands of irreplaceable Buddhist temples have been \ngutted and destroyed, many hundreds of Tibetans have been arrested and \nkilled, Han Chinese have been encouraged to relocate to Tibet in a \nclear effort to make the Tibetan people a minority in their own land, \nTibetan culture has been sinocized . . . the list goes on. There is \nenough there to spark our interest, without us having to manufacture an \nissue to keep the Chinese busy. And as with Taiwan, Republican control \nof Congress is likely\n behind the increased interest. Senator Helms, the present chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations, has long been a strong and vocal champion \nof the Tibetan people, and is now in a position to be able to \neffectuate some of his desired policy changes.\n\n  Similarly, our preoccupation with Hong Kong is not the third leg of \nsome organized scheme. Rather, while our interest in Taiwan stems from \nour long friendship and our interest in Tibet stems from concern about \nhuman rights, as I have also noted on previous occasions our Hong Kong \nconcerns are predominantly economic. Since I have already spoken at \nlength about this issue both on the floor and in my subcommittee, \nsuffice it to say here that we have a substantial economic stake in the \ncontinued viability of Hong Kong as a international financial center \nafter its reversion to Chinese sovereignty after 1997. While issues \ninvolving that transfer are primarily bilateral ones between China and \nthe United Kingdom, where decisions made by the two parties may effect \nour legitimate concerns we have a legitimate interest in speaking out \nabout them. The explanation for why our interest there has grown \nrecently is quite simple: 1997 is getting closer and closer, and the \ntwo parties are making more and more decisions about the colony's fate \nwith each passing day.\n  These, then, are the reasons for our strong interest in Taiwan, Tibet \nand Hong Kong, and for any recent increase in that interest. Each has \nits own set of distinct causes, and are not part of some unified plot \nto keep the Chinese sufficiently busy at home so as to prevent their \nemergence abroad.\n  The Chinese have also begun to see an evil intent in the attention we \nhave been paying to their trade and other economic practices. Over the \nlast year we have pressed China to observe its commitments to a series \nof multilateral and bilateral obligations in areas such as intellectual \nproperty rights, arbitration, the WTO, and so forth. The Chinese have \nbegun to see these moves as part of an attempt to keep them \neconomically less powerful and influential than they would otherwise \ngrow to be. Such a conclusion stretches the bounds of reason, though, \nand completely overlooks the underlying basis for our actions. China \nhas insisted that it be treated as a player on the world economic \nstage. Well, Mr. President, along with the benefits such a role brings \ncome certain responsibilities. Unfortunately, the PRC has made it \n\n[[Page S 9474]]\nclear through its actions that it intends to live up to those \nresponsibilities only when it feels like it. Therein lies the problem.\n  Intellectual property rights became an issue not as some manufactured \nattempt to weaken China's economic expansion but because the Chinese \nwere allowing, even encouraging in some cases, widescale piracy in \ncontravention of a series of international and bilateral agreements. \nChinese companies were, in effect, stealing from us to the tune of \nseveral billion dollars a year. Is it any wonder, then, that we showed \nan interest in the topic? As for its entry into the WTO, China's \nposition on accession can best be likened to wanting to have its cake \nand eat it too. It wants to have the benefits of that international \nagreement, but will not live up to others it has signed such as the \nConvention on Arbitration. It wants to be treated as a developed \ncountry where such treatment suits its needs, but as a developing \ncountry in other areas. For example, although the Chinese Minister of \nChemical Industry Gu Xiulian has proudly noted that China's soda ash \nproduction has ``leapt to the front row in the world'' and is one of \nthe top three chemicals produced in China--a statement one would \nlogically assume is concomitant with developed status--it has instead \ndemanded developing status for this chemical industry. This would allow \nit to continue to leave in place artificially high tariffs imposed \nagainst United States imports of soda ash. China cannot have it both \nways, and our calling them on this and similar attempts is simply a \nmatter of equity and nothing more. It is of some interest to note at \nthis juncture that if we were involved in some overall scheme to hinder \nChina's economy, the President would hardly have recommended renewing \nthat country's MFN status as he did this month. And, as I strongly \nsuspect it will, Congress would have hardly gone along with that \nrenewal.\n  There are other areas where the PRC appears to see the conspiracy at \nwork: the restriction on sales to that country of United States \ntechnology with possible military applications, calls for greater \naccess to Chinese markets, statements of concern about the possibility \nof regional conflict in the Spratly Island group, et cetera; but I will \nnot belabor my point lest our Chinese friends decide that I protest too \nmuch. Let me just state that while the paranoid can manufacture a \nconspiracy out of any given set of facts, regardless of how unrelated \nthey may be, I hope that the Chinese will reflect on the issues as I \nhave briefly outlined them and see that there is no unified plan to get \nthem.\n  It is unfortunate that Sino-American relations have taken a downturn \nover the past few weeks, and that there might be some who view that \ndownturn as evidence of the so-called conspiracy in United States/China \npolicy. I can assure our Chinese friends that such a downturn was not \ndesired, and should not be allowed to linger. Having said that, let me \nalso state emphatically that it will not behoove some isolated circles \nin the PRC to exacerbate or overreact to the present situation for \nulterior reasons; I have seen some disturbing signs that there may be a \ngrowing tendency on the Chinese side for some to do just that. It may \nbe thought that by placing the United States on the defensive, United \nStates officials-- ``anxious to restore meaningful dialogue with China \npresumably would be expected to `prove' their intentions with some \ngestures designed to show the Chinese that their conspiratorial view of \nU.S. policy is no longer correct.'' As proof of our goodwill, the \nChinese side might suggest a series of unilateral gestures on the part \nof the United States.\n  This is not just hypothesizing on my part; I have already seen a few \nexamples of it. For instance, a June 27 KYODO news agency broadcast \nreported that Zhou Shijian, deputy head of the Research Institute of \nInternational Trade at MOFTEC--the Ministry of Foreign Trade and \nEconomic Cooperation--had said in an interview that the United States \nshould take three steps to sooth the PRC's rancor over the President \nLee visit: send a special envoy to Beijing to apologize, support PRC \nmembership in the WTO, and lift restrictions on technology transfers to \nChina.\n  Mr. President, let me note first that I--and I believe most other \nMembers of Congress--would strongly oppose any move by the \nadministration to make any unilateral concessions of this magnitude \nunder this type of circumstance; it would set a very distasteful \nprecedent. Moreover, Mr. Zhou could not have picked a less likely three \nareas in which to expect gratuitous action on our part. Let me explain.\n  First, while we regret the effect of President Lee's visit on the \nUnited States-China relationship, and regret that it has upset the \nChinese side, sending an envoy to apologize presupposes that the \ndecision to admit Lee was wrong. It was not; and given the votes \ncalling for Lee's visit in both the House and the Senate, I think one \nwould be hardpressed to find more than three of the 535 Members who \nwould agree that was.\n  Second, we have made clear that our support for the PRC's accession \nto the WTO is dependent on China's adherence to the provisions of other \nmultilateral economic agreements to which it is a party such as \ninternational IPR and arbitration conventions. While the PRC has made \nstrides in the IPR field, its compliance in others has been less than \nsatisfactory. For example, although a signatory to the international \narbitration convention, the Chinese have steadfastly refused to honor a \n$6 million award against a Shanghai firm in favor of a United States \ncompany named Revpower. Until China lives up to commitments such as \nthis one, I and many others do not believe that our support should be \nforthcoming, especially on a unilateral basis.\n  Finally, we come to restrictions on technology transfers. These \nrestrictions were put into place after the Tienanmen massacre, and are \ndesigned to keep technology with military applications out of the hands \nof the PLA. Although there had been some discussion here of loosening \nthe restrictions, that possibility has pretty much evaporated in light \nof credible information that the Chinese have been involved in \ntransfers of technological and military hardware to rogue countries \nsuch as Iran. Given the very real possibility that were we to resume \nsome transfers China might simply transship our materials to these \ncountries, I do not think that the Chinese will see a change in that \nposition anytime soon.\n  Mr. President, let me close by reiterating that there is no grand \ndesign to keep China from occupying its proper place in the world. And, \nas for the present souring in the relationship, I hope that, like the \nripples in a pond after a stone is thrown into it, the ripples in the \nrelationship will continue to grow smaller until things are once again \nsmooth.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9472-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9474-S9475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    IMPORTATION OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL FROM FOREIGN RESEARCH REACTORS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to comment this morning on \nthe Department of Energy's proposal to import spent nuclear fuel from \nforeign research reactors through commercial ports such as Tacoma, WA.\n  Before I begin, I would like to thank DOE, and in particular Mr. \nCharles Head, for the outstanding efforts put forward by DOE to ensure \nthat the citizens of Tacoma have had adequate opportunities to review \ninformation and make comments on DOE's proposal. The additional public \nhearing held last week was well received and well attended and the \nextension of the public comment period until July 20th is appreciated. \nDOE's efforts have not gone unnoticed.\n  Mr. President, I fully appreciate the United States nuclear \nnonproliferation policies and objectives. I also understand the \nimportant role that removing spent nuclear fuel from the global \nmarketplace plays in those policy objectives. Nonetheless, I would like \nto express my serious concerns regarding DOE's proposal. DOE's draft \nenvironmental impact statement on the handling of foreign spent nuclear \nfuel does not adequately assess the potential risks that alternative \n#1, the importation and interim storage of foreign spent nuclear fuel \nin the United States, could pose to the citizens of the United States, \nparticularly those who reside in the port communities suggested as \npoints of entry in the DEIS and those near proposed waste storage \nfacilities.\n  Along with my colleagues from the State of Washington, I recently \nsent a \n\n[[Page S 9475]]\nletter to Secretary O'Leary outlining the reasons behind our concerns. \nI ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record. In summary, \nwe raised concerns over the evaluation of the potential exposure of the \ngeneral public to radiation, the inadequate training and equipment \npossessed by Tacoma emergency response units to deal with a radiation \nemergency, the failure to address the potential for terrorist \nactivities during the importation process, and the proposal to use the \nHanford nuclear facility as an interim storage facility. Given these \nconcerns, we asked DOE to no longer consider using commercial ports \nsuch as Tacoma, but to limit further consideration of alternative #1 to \nmilitary ports.\n  It has recently come to my attention that alternative #2 in the DEIS, \nfacilitating the management of the spent nuclear fuel overseas, may be \na better choice. Although the DEIS presents a number of difficulties in \nimplementing alternative #2, it may be more feasible than previously \nthought. There is a processing facility in Scotland that is apparently \nboth able and willing to take the spent nuclear fuel and reprocess it \ninto more stable, less threatening material. I want to encourage DOE to \nfully investigate this possibility. It could ensure that we meet our \nnuclear nonproliferation goals without threatening the health and \nsafety of United States citizens.\n  I look forward to working with DOE and the administration to ensure \nthat we meet our nuclear nonproliferation objectives while \nsimultaneously protecting the citizens of the United States.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n     Hazel O'Leary,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary O'Leary. We are writing to express our \n     concerns over the alternatives proposed in the Department of \n     Energy's (DOE) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on \n     the management of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from foreign \n     research reactors. We are concerned about the proposed option \n     of importing the foreign SNF through commercial ports such as \n     Tacoma, WA.\n       While the desire to encourage other nation's research \n     reactors to switch to low-enriched uranium (LEU) from highly-\n     enriched uranium (HEU) is an integral component of the United \n     States overall nuclear nonproliferation policy, importing \n     foreign SNF through commercial ports may not be necessary. \n     The DOE DEIS lists two military ports among the ten possible \n     ports of entry for the SNF. We feel that DOE should limit \n     further consideration of importing SNF to these or other \n     appropriate military ports because of the considerable \n     concern amount citizens and city officials about importing \n     SNF through commercial ports.\n       First, there is significant apprehension about the threats \n     to public health importing this SNF through commercial ports \n     would create. Although DOE has stated that the threats to \n     public health are not significant given the state of the \n     material and the overly cautious design of the storage casks, \n     we are not convinced that no public health threat exists. \n     There is public concern that longshoremen, sailors, and \n     average citizens could potentially become exposed to \n     significant radiation levels. Whether this risk is real or \n     only perceived is irrelevant. Importing foreign SNF through \n     commercial ports would at best threaten public confidence and \n     citizens' sense of security and at worst pose a significant \n     threat to public health.\n       Second, the DEIS states: ``Primary responsibility for \n     emergency response to a foreign research reactor SNF incident \n     would reside with local authorities.''. Although the port and \n     city of Tacoma have emergency response plans for hazardous \n     materials, neither the Police and Fire Departments nor the \n     Port workers are properly equipped or trained to contend with \n     a significant radiation emergency. Properly equipping and \n     training these people would add a significant and unnecessary \n     cost to the overall proposal. In addition, it is not clear \n     that Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and port workers would \n     be willing to undergo such training, knowing that it opens \n     them up to potential future radiation exposure. In fact, port \n     workers in Tacoma may declare their unwillingness to handle \n     the material during even routine transport procedures, let \n     alone emergencies.\n       Third, importing foreign SNF through commercial ports runs \n     contrary to the overall policy objective of reducing the \n     world-wide availability of HEU and other nuclear waste. If \n     lengthy, unnecessary and relatively low-security \n     transportation of SNF occurs through commercial ports, the \n     increased opportunities for theft, hijacks, and sabotage \n     could result in greater accessibility to the SNF than \n     desired. As current events have unfortunately revealed, the \n     United States is not immune to terrorism, either foreign or \n     domestic. Even if this material could not be used in the \n     making of nuclear weapons, and some of it could, the very \n     fact that it is radioactive makes it dangerous. Transporting \n     this material through commercial ports would create an \n     unnecessary threat to national security.\n       These concerns present a compelling case for DOE to \n     preclude further consideration of commercial ports like \n     Tacoma, WA for the importation of foreign SNF. While removing \n     HEU and other nuclear waste from the global marketplace is an \n     essential aspect of nuclear nonproliferation, importing this \n     material through military ports may prove more reasonable \n     given the increased protection that could be provided to \n     public health and safety and national security.\n       We are also concerned about the proposal to store the \n     foreign SNF at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This idea is \n     unacceptable given the current state of affairs at that \n     facility. The current environmental problems associated with \n     the storage of nuclear waste at the Hanford site have \n     resulted in clean up costs near $50 billion. In addition, \n     current budget pressures will make it difficult for DOE to \n     meet its legally enforceable clean up schedule. Additional \n     waste management responsibilities could further hamper the \n     Department's efforts at the site.\n       In summary we would appreciate DOE limiting further \n     consideration of this proposal to military ports and adequate \n     storage facilities.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patty Murray.\n     Jim McDermott.\n     Norm Dicks.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9474-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9475-S9476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 EBOLA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the Americans who has a great \ndeal of firsthand knowledge of Zaire, the troubled country in Africa, \nis Dr. William Close, a physician who spent a number of years in Zaire.\n  He is a remarkable person whose 16 years were not only given to \nservice of the people of Zaire but given to keen observation.\n  Dr. Close, whose instincts and insights I have come to trust, \nbelieves that the United States should be backing Prime Minister Kengo \nmore firmly. It is the peaceful way out for a nation that is now \ndestitute. It is a way out from Mobuto dictatorship.\n  He has written a novel about the disease that we have heard so much \nabout, ebola. That is also the title of his book. I have not read the \nbook, but I understand it provides real insights into Africa.\n  I have read the epilog to the book, which is not fiction. The book is \nfiction but based in large part on facts. The epilog contains insights, \nnot only into Zaire but into international tragedies, as well as \ndomestic tragedies.\n  For example, when Dr. Close writes: ``Devastating diseases breed in \nthe cesspools of poverty,'' he could be writing about other countries, \nbut he could also be writing about our country.\n  He prods our consciences when he writes:\n\n       When the people of one nation are crushed by destitution, \n     disaster from revolutions or plagues are inevitable. Then, \n     countries such as ours, which with small amounts of timely \n     assistance could have prevented the worst from happening, are \n     forced into more massive involvement. Recent history proves \n     the point.\n\n  I ask that Dr. Close's epilog to his book, ``Ebola,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The epilog follows:\n\n                                 Epilog\n\n       After the first explosion of Zaire's Ebola virus in 1976, \n     the country continued on its inexorable decline into economic \n     collapse and political chaos. A different strain of Ebola \n     erupted in south Sudan three years later. As before, it came \n     . . . it killed . . . it disappeared.\n       Ten years after the tragedies in Yambuku, I had settled \n     into a remote rural medical practice in Wyoming. One morning \n     I opened the newspaper and read that the United States Army \n     intended to build an aerosol lab at Dugway Proving Ground \n     near Salt Lake City to test hemorrhagic fever viruses, \n     including Ebola, for ``defensive purposes.'' With Salt Lake \n     City only a three-and-a-half-hour drive from my Wyoming home, \n     I felt a tightening in my gut: there would be no defense \n     against a laboratory accident. An outcry from the people of \n     Utah delayed the project--for the time being.\n       Four years ago, Zaire was again on the front pages. Like a \n     coup de grace, a violent mutiny gripped the country by its \n     throat. The troops, backed by a desperate, hungry population, \n     rampaged through the major cities and destroyed what little \n     remained of industry, commerce, and the rotting \n     infrastructure.\n       In August of 1994, I returned to Zaire at the invitation of \n     the Prime Minister of the transitional government, Mr. Kengo \n     wa Dondo, an old friend. With Zairian and Belgian\n      colleagues, we reviewed the medical crises that continue to \n     overwhelm the country. Sleeping sickness, river blindness, \n     goiters and cretinism, and malaria had been under \n     effective \n\n[[Page S 9476]]\n     control during the decades before independence and into the sixties and \n     early seventies. But, with the disintegration of Zaire's \n     economy, exacerbated by gross corruption and \n     mismanagement, by the early 1990s these diseases were \n     again ravaging large segments of the population and AIDS \n     played out its slow-death scenario in every city. I \n     visited the capital city's general hospital, called ``Mama \n     Yemo'' after the president's mother. Her bronze bust still \n     stands among fetid, skeletal buildings of what had been a \n     proud and efficient referral center of two thousand beds. \n     Old midwives walk four hours to come to work. Doctors \n     thumb rides to be on call. The personnel is there, trained \n     and ready to work, but there is no equipment, no \n     medicines, no IV fluids worth mentioning. The medical \n     staff come, still hoping that they can do something for \n     people.\n       Prime Minister Kengo's government has started up the long \n     and dangerous road to reforming the national economy. This \n     means eliminating powerful and wealthy forces that have \n     profited from the virtual collapse of government. This means \n     countering political egos and stepping on sensitive toes. \n     Communications, schools, medical services, and normal \n     government functions like tax collecting and customs at the \n     ports of entry must be rebuilt from scratch. For this to \n     happen, roads, telephones, postal services, water supply, and \n     sewer systems must function properly. The disintegration of \n     these combined services signifies an infrastructure that has \n     plummeted to catastrophic levels. In such conditions, it is \n     not surprising that major epidemics are flourishing, and \n     devastating diseases like hepatitis, AIDS, ``red diarrhea,'' \n     and now, once more, Ebola, are threatening the population \n     and, possibly, the world.\n       In 1976, Zaire was still a client state of the West, and \n     although President Mobutu's long, all-powerful dictatorship \n     had stifled progress and milked profits for himself and his \n     entourage to the detriment of his people, some services were \n     still working, especially the mission hospitals and schools. \n     Today this situation is far worse. Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi \n     are examples of countries whose strategic value to the West \n     all but disappeared when the Berlin Wall came down. ``Africa \n     has fallen off the horizon.'' ``We will help you, Mr. Kengo, \n     when you have straightened out the country.'' Catch-22 \n     nonsense dressed in meaningless, diplomatic jargon and \n     papered with documents that begin, ``We deplore . . .'' It \n     takes a corrupter to exploit the leader of a client state.\n       The present resurgence of Ebola in Zaire, the deaths in \n     Kikwit of patients along with their Zairian doctors, nurses, \n     hospital workers, and Italian nursing sisters, can either \n     generate fear and more panic-provoking films, or it can give \n     rise to an awakening in all of us. We live in a small \n     community of nations. When one nation coughs, others cannot \n     sleep. When the people of one nation are crushed by \n     destitution, disaster from revolutions or plagues are \n     inevitable. Then, countries such as ours, which with small \n     amounts of timely assistance could have prevented the worst \n     from happening, are forced into more massive involvement. \n     Recent history proves the point.\n       Devastating diseases breed in the cesspools of poverty. \n     Many Zairian doctors and nurses are well-trained, competent \n     professionals, but they have little or nothing with which to \n     work. Maintenance and even the most basic supplies are \n     lacking in government hospitals because of the gross \n     mismanagement characteristic of regimes that preceded Mr. \n     Kengo's government.

Mr. President, it is with great pride and \nanticipation that I join all of Connecticut in extending our warmest \nwelcome to the athletes, families, coaches and friends of the 1995 \nSpecial Olympics World Games. Right now, more than 6,700 athletes from \nevery State in the Union, and from 125 nations around the world, are \ntraveling to New Haven, CT, to compete in a world-class sporting event \nfrom July 1-9. These games constitute the largest sporting event in the \nworld this year.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Eunice Kennedy Shriver established the Special \nOlympics--an international sports organization for people with mental \nretardation. She envisioned bringing joy and pride, developed through \ncompetition, to those about whom the world had forgotten, and believed \ncould not compete. We are thrilled to have the privilege of hosting an \nevent that has been an inspiration to the world. It is impossible to \nwatch these games, witness the tremendous skill and courage of these \ntruly special athletes, and not be changed in some way.\n  It is in that spirit that thousands of people have worked for more \nthan a year to help make the dreams of these athletes a reality. I \nwould like to commend the Shrivers, former Governor Weicker, the entire \nWorld Games Organizing Committee, the towns and families throughout \nConnecticut, and the thousands of volunteers who have so generously \nopened their hearts and homes to the athletes and their families.\n  In a world where professional athletics has often become synonymous \nwith multimillion-dollar contracts and endorsements, the Special \nOlympics remind us of what sport is truly about--the thrill of \naccomplishment and the satisfaction that comes from giving your all.\n  The excitement and splendor of the Special Olympics extends beyond \nsports competition. The worlds of science, diplomacy, art, culture, and \nentertainment unite to honor the spirit of Special Olympics and \nachievements of people with mental retardation. There will be \nextraordinary events juxtaposing the drama of world-class sports with \nthe power of courageous competitors achieving their personal best \nbefore the eyes of the world.\n  The talent and dedication of these athletes, their love for their \nsport, and their extraordinary sportsmanship are an inspiration to us \nall.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9476-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the negotiations \nare still in the process of negotiation on H.R. 1944, the rescissions \nbill. We are not quite in a position yet to say whether or not there \nwill be a vote when it comes to the Senate, if it passes the House or \nif it is taken up by the House. And we are advised we will not know \nthat for another additional 2 hours. So it seems to me, after \ndiscussion with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, that our best \nhope is to come back in the morning. I regret I cannot absolutely \nguarantee Members there will be no votes tomorrow. But it is our hope \nthat, if the House acts and if the rescissions bill comes to the \nSenate, we can do it quickly. It may require a vote on final passage. \nIt may require additional votes. But I hope we can do it by noon or 1 \no'clock tomorrow.\n  Is that satisfactory with the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the distinguished leader would yield, it is \nsatisfactory. I think Senators ought to be aware that there is a \npossibility of votes tomorrow. But like the majority leader, I would \nlike to see if we can resolve whatever differences remain and work \nthrough this and hopefully even come up with a way by which a vote \nwould be unnecessary. But as the distinguished leader said, the \nnegotiations are still under way on the House side, and it is unclear \nwhen or if sufficient progress would be made to bring the issue to a \nclosure on the House side. So, all we can do at this point is to wait \nand assume that sometime tomorrow we could bring it up. So, I think the \ndistinguished leader's recommendation is a good one. And I hope we can \nfinally come to closure on it sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. So, I would say to my colleagues, we hope there will not be \nany votes tomorrow. I cannot promise that. We believe--not certain--but \nbelieve on this side we have cleared action on H.R. 1944 without votes. \nBut that could change depending on what the House does. I can say that \nfor certain.\n  We will be working together tomorrow morning--myself and the \nDemocratic leader--to let our colleagues go at the earliest possible \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/29/senate-section/article/S9476-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9476-S9477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 343\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
