Madam President, the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy recently released the latest ``Pulse Check'' on drug use and \ndrug abuse in America. The ``Pulse Check'' provides an opportunity to \nsee what is happening with drug use in markets across the country. The \nnews is not good. Other Senators and I have spoken often on this floor \nat the alarming trend in drug use. We have told the Nation that drug \nuse is rising; that drug users are getting younger; and that the drugs \nare getting stronger and more dangerous.\n  We are heading down a dangerous road. ``Pulse Check'' does not report \non trend lines. Instead, it provides a snapshot of what is happening, a \nroad sign to what lies ahead. Here is what the most recent ``Pulse \nCheck'' shows:\n  Heroin is gaining in popularity in many areas of the country. We are \nseeing higher purity and lower prices. The increased purity has allowed \nnew users to avoid using needles. The result is increased use and \npopularity. In some areas, cocaine and crack dealers are being \npressured by their South American distributors to diversify and also \nsell heroin.\n  The news on cocaine and crack use is also disturbing. While use \nremains stable throughout most areas of the country, availability \nremains high. Prices are fairly stable throughout the United States. \nAlthough it is losing some of its appeal in southern California, New \nYork, and Colorado, it is gaining in popularity in areas in Texas, \nDelaware, Georgia, and Washington, DC, especially among female drug \nusers. This supports recent reports that drug use no longer has a \ngender gap.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing news of all, marijuana use is up all \nover, especially among younger users. This is particularly disturbing \nin light of marijuana's role as a gateway drug. As a recent study by \nthe Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse shows, the earlier someone \nstarts using marijuana, the more likely they are to move onto harder, \nmore dangerous substances. Perhaps the first sign of this occurring can \nbe seen in reports of increasing incidence of marijuana cigarettes \nlaced with crack or PCP or even\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nembalming fluid. ``Pulse Check'' reports that these marijuana users are \ngenerally younger and represent the gamut of socioeconomic groups. \nAlso, the quality of marijuana is higher than previous years. This \nmeans a much stronger drug is available today than was available during \nthe last drug crisis.\n  Besides these three more traditional menaces, methamphetamine use \ncontinues to rise in the West and Northwest, and is headed toward the \neast coast. It was once considered mainly a biker drug and found mainly \nin the Southwest. Now, Mexican organized crime organizations have moved \nin and are incorporating this new product into their existing networks \nfor cocaine and heroin. Meth is a drug which can be injected, inhaled, \nor made into pills. It appeals to wide variety of users. Earlier I \nmentioned that cocaine was losing some of its appeal in southern \nCalifornia and Colorado, where it has developed a lowlife reputation. \n``Pulse Check'' reports that in its stead, methamphetamine has moved in \nand has become the new hip drug.\n  Even though little of this makes the nightly news, there is an \nalarming story to tell here. Perhaps the only one of these dangerous \ndrugs that is getting as much national press coverage that it deserves \nis Rohypnol. As the DEA works toward rescheduling this date rape drug \ninto the same category as LSD and heroin, it is becoming increasingly \nprevalent in the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic region. Senator Biden first \nwarned us of the coming threat of this powerful sedative. And it is a \ngrowing problem.\n  Other so-called club drugs continue to rise in popularity, as well as \nso-called natural products found in health food stores and mail order \ncatalogs. Often these natural products contain ephedrine--one of the \nkey components of methamphetamine--and they induce similar effects. \nThese drugs are especially popular among younger drug users. They are \nmarketed by comparing their effects with those of other street drugs, \nand portraying them as health supplements.\n  This is what is happening now. The ``Pulse Check'' gives us a feel of \nwhere we are at in the fight against illegal drug use. We are still on \nthe same downward spiral that we have been on since 1992. Drug use is \nclimbing, acceptance is climbing, and all of the associated problems \nand difficulties are climbing.\n  The sad part is, this comes after years of declines in drug use. From \n1979 to 1991, drug use fell dramatically. We were winning the fight for \nthe future of our children. For some reason, we seem to have hit a \nroadblock in this success. We have moved off this successful road and \nhave found an hauntingly familiar course where drug use numbers are \nagain headed in the wrong direction.\n\n  Some have said that raising this concern is merely partisanship, \nplaying politics. But kids using drugs is not political. Rising \nincidence of drug use is not political. Talking seriously about the \ndrug problem in America is not partisan. It is an exercise in \nresponsibility. I would welcome the President to come out and say \n``Drugs are bad. Don't do drugs. If someone offers you a joint, if \nsomeone offers you a snort of cocaine, just say no.'' Unfortunately, \nafter a few public remarks on the issue, the President has, once again, \nlapsed into silence. We have had a stealth drug policy. It is clear, \nhowever, that this approach has simply not worked.\n  But let's not mistake criticism for partisanship. Since 1992, teenage \ndrug use has surged. Acceptance of drug use by teens has also risen \ndramatically. These are not partisan conclusions. These are the facts. \nModern music, movies, and even clothing depict drugs as ``hip.'' This \nis a radical change from the eighties when the message was loud and \nconsistent: ``Just say no!''\n  Here in the Capitol, both sides of the aisle have spoken often on \nthis issue. Many have issued the warning that we must change our \nmessage now. There are 39 million members of the ``baby bust'' \ngeneration who are beginning to face the choice of whether or not to \nuse drugs. They will be faced with the choice of saying no, or trying \ndrugs that are more potent and more addicting than what was available \nbefore. When this generation looks around to see what their leaders are \nsaying, we need to be there loud and strong. We have been down this \nroad before. And we know what strong leadership can accomplish. From \n1979 to 1992, drug use fell at a fairly steady pace. It was not always \na smooth ride, but we were headed in the right direction.\n  Congress, too, needs to do its part. We cannot be satisfied with \nrhetoric and hearings. I would encourage my colleagues to support the \ndrug czar's proposal to reprogram $250 million from the Department of \nDefense to the Office of National Drug Policy, as well as increased \nfunding for the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Effort at \nthe State Department.\n  Madam President, we need to get back on the right track. Congress \nneeds to do its part and support funding. In March we started along \nthis path with a $3.9 million appropriation to restaff the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy. We should continue by supporting the \nreprogramming of $250 million I just mentioned from DOD to the \ncounterdrug effort. And I would hope that the President would join us \nin support and show some leadership by speaking out more on the dangers \nof drugs and drug use.\n  In closing, I hope that when the next ``Pulse Check'' on drug use is \nreleased, I will have some good news to share with my colleagues. \nUnless we change directions, without a change in message, and without a \nshow of strong moral leadership, I fear this will not happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7797-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7798-S7806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GETTING AMERICA'S BUSINESS DONE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, we heard a really stern leader \nyesterday talking to both sides of the aisle and to America about \ngetting the job of America's business done. I think he made a very \neloquent case in delineating the strategy on the other side of the \naisle to bog the Congress down, to keep it gnarled up. At the base of \nit is a political strategy, and that political strategy is ignoring \nAmerica's needs and interests.\n  Just yesterday, the other side brought forth an outline of a program \nthey call families first. But in the 104th Congress they have made \nAmerican families and America last by stalling and filibustering and \ndragging their feet on issues that are of enormous interest to the \nwelfare and benefit of millions of American families.\n  I can think of none more important than health care reform. Getting \nthat done would put American families first. And stalling it and \nfilibustering it is putting American families last.\n  Madam President, just to recount for a moment what the leader \nendeavored to move forward on behalf of America yesterday evening, he \nasked unanimous consent that the Senate insist on an amendment to H.R. \n3103 and that the Senate agree to the request for a conference with the \nHouse and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  Well, that is a lot of process. What that means is moving forward on \nhealth care reform, something that every American family is looking to \nthe 104th Congress to do. And 87 percent of the American public want us \nto move forward on targeted health care reform, but we are in the 80th \nday of filibustering by the Senator from Massachusetts. The leader came \nto the floor and to the assembled body and said, ``I ask unanimous \nconsent we go ahead, get the conferees and move forward on health care \nreform.'' The other side objected.\n  The leader then asked for unanimous consent to proceed with the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. One of the fundamental \nresponsibilities of the Government, of the Federal Government, is to \nprovide for the defense of the Nation and the keeping and care of our \nintegral defense establishment. The other side objected.\n  The leader then asked for unanimous consent to move forward with the \nimmediate consideration of the White House Travel Office. As he said \nhere on the floor, in all probability when that legislation finally \ncomes to a vote, it will pass overwhelmingly. The other side objected. \nThe leader asked for unanimous consent to proceed with the legislative \nmatter that the Presiding Officer has had an interest in for so long, \nthe stalking bill. That bill will\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nprobably ultimately pass 100 to 0. But for days after days it has been \nstalled on the other side.\n  When he asked for unanimous consent to turn to the calendar and bring \nup stalking legislation, which the Senator from Texas has pursued for \nso long, what happened? The other side objected.\n  He asked for unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the nuclear \nwaste bill. There is probably not a single piece of legislation that \nhas more significance to the environment and the safety of every \nAmerican than the nuclear waste bill. I mean, we have over half the \nStates that are deeply involved with how to manage nuclear waste. The \nleader spoke eloquently on the floor before yesterday about the \nimportance of this legislation and the environmental impact it would \nhave on our country. So he asked unanimous consent to proceed to this \nvery important piece of legislation. The other side objected.\n  He asked, once again, to proceed to the health insurance reform \nconferees--twice now. There is probably no single piece of legislation \nthat would have such a profound effect on the anxiety of working \nfamilies in America than untying health care reform. So again he asked \nfor unanimous consent, and, yes, there was an objection on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  So here, for all of these important pieces of legislation, it was \ndemonstrated conclusively yesterday that the strategy of the other side \nis to just bog everything down. America last, politics first.\n  To reinforce the point that I am endeavoring to make, the number of \nlegislative items having cloture--that means trying to stop a \nfilibuster, Madam President--we in the 104th Congress have 28 times \ntried to shut off a filibuster.\n  The minute we return next Tuesday, our first task will be to try to \nshut down these filibusters from the other side.\n  The Republican majority has filed 54 percent of their cloture motions \non the first day a measure was considered. There was an argument that \nwe have been doing that too often. But the other side, in the 103d \nCongress, has done it 60 percent of the time. America needs to know, \nparticularly in light of a theme that they are putting American \nfamilies first, that on 73 occasions they put American families last. \nThey have had 73 filibusters in the 104th Congress on the other side of \nthe aisle. The President has conducted 15 major vetoes of legislation \nthat the 104th Congress sent to the President in response to America \ncalling for major change in America. He vetoed balanced budgets, the \nPresident vetoed welfare reform, the President has vetoed tax relief, \neven after promising tax relief to the middle class. Over and over \nagain, 73 filibusters and 15 vetoes.\n  Mr. President, we will talk about a few of the filibusters. Unfunded \nmandates: We began the 104th Congress discussing an issue that had \nbecome, nationwide, highly visible. America was saying to Washington, \n``Quit mandating costs to our local governments.'' It is like \nappropriating our property taxes at the local level. The Federal \nGovernment would try to fulfill the need of some special interest up \nhere in Washington, send it down to the States and local governments \nand say, ``Here, here is a new program. You pay for it.''\n  Finally, in an unprecedented piece of legislation that was introduced \nto begin to control these unfunded mandates, wide support, bipartisan \nsupport, headed by the junior Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, \nSenate bill 1, we had to file four motions to shut off filibusters--\nfour of them--and then when we finally got it to a vote, it was 98 to \n2--98 to 2, overwhelming support for this legislation. Yet, we had to \nspend 3 weeks, 3 precious weeks, of the 104th Congress and had to, 4 \ntimes, try to shut off the filibuster on the other side.\n  It could not be clearer. It does not take a rocket scientist to \nunderstand that from day one, it was the intent of the other side to \nbog this Congress down. That was their reaction to the 1994 election \nmandate, drag it out, slow it down, see if we cannot get to another \nelection so that all these changes that were talked about in the 1994 \nelections could somehow be throttled or choked. Maybe it is just an \ninterim phenomena and America will forget all these changes of wanting \nunfunded mandate control, taxes lowered, and welfare. Maybe we can get \nby by stalling and keeping that from happening. We will have 73 \nfilibusters. We will veto all this legislation and see if we cannot get \nthrough it.\n  The balanced budget amendment, balanced budget amendment, House Joint \nResolution 1, we had to try three different times to shut off the \nfilibuster before we could actually get to a vote. I can go on, from \nproduct liability to interstate waste.\n  Try this one: Antiterrorism. We had to even cut off a filibuster on \nantiterrorism before we could get to that bipartisan proposal. Welfare \nreform, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act took three \nattempts--three--to bring that to a vote. Then, after a tragic \noccurrence, the President wants the legislation to sign. Time and time \nagain, 73 times.\n  The President, as I said, has vetoed 15 propositions. Product \nliability was one, something the whole country has been endeavoring and \ncalling for, product liability reform, the debt ceiling limit, the \nBalanced Budget Act, welfare reform--twice shut it down, stall and see \nif we cannot get to another election.\n  There was a story by Carolyn Lockheed, the Washington bureau of the \nChronicle, appearing July 8. She says: ``For Democrats, the hope is to \ndeprive Republicans of any accomplishments.'' Now, is that putting \nAmerican families first, or is that using all of this legislative time \nof the 104th Congress for political strategy? If you are going to put \nAmerican families first, you are not going to have 73 filibusters and \n15 vetoes and veto balanced budgets and tax relief and welfare reform. \nShe says, ``For Democrats, the hope is to deprive Republicans of any \naccomplishments.''\n  Taking a page from the Republican playbook, unified Senate Democrats \nare filibustering or otherwise blocking and delaying almost anything \nthat threatens to move. She says that the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas succeeded in discombobulating the Republican majority with the bill \nto raise the minimum wage and has led the fight to stop--stop--the \nhugely popular health insurance reform legislation he cosponsored with \nKansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum.\n  I might just say, Mr. President, on this issue of health care reform, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts often indicates the reason he is into \nhis 80th day of filibustering a bill, that millions of Americans are \nsuffering because it is not the law, the reason he says he is doing it \nis because we have a possibility that a conference report would include \nmedical savings accounts, and that is just not the right thing to do \nbecause it was not in the Senate version, but it is in the House \nversion, Madam President. It is in the House version. That is what \nconference reports are about, to work out the differences between House \nand Senate proposals. I guess he is going to filibuster this until he \ngets some assurance that he can manage what the White House thinks is \nappropriate for health care reform, and override the fact that almost \nhalf the Members of the Senate agree with the House on medical savings \naccounts.\n  Madam President, I will talk for a moment about this filibuster that \nwe have from the Senator from Massachusetts on health care reform. That \nis probably the single largest and most extended filibuster that we \nhave been dealing with. As I said, Madam President, we are into our \n80th-plus day.\n  In the Washington Post, an article quotes a fellow by the name of \nDavid Nexon, who is Senator Kennedy's health policy director, and the \nquote reads: ``If it''--that is the health care reform proposal--``[the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health care bill] fails, just a narrow political \ncalculation, it helps us''--that is the Democrat side--``more than \nthem''--that is the Republican side--``because then we can credibly \nblame the Republicans for killing it.''\n  In other words, again, as I said earlier, American families last. The \nAmerican workplace is trying to find an insurance environment that is \neasier for them to deal with, that comes secondary to having a \npolitical advantage and being able to blame somebody for the fact that \nhealth care reform, which is so needed, could not get passed. Well, I \nthink it is eminently clear that this idea is not going to work. If we \ndo not\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nhave health care reform, it will rest squarely on the shoulders of the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts and this administration because it \nwill be clear, and there will be no mistake that they have been engaged \nin an extended filibuster over the interests of American families, who \nare trying to find a better and friendlier health insurance marketplace \nfor them and their spouses and their children.\n  How about this quote: ``Certainly, his views haven't changed.''\n  That is, President Clinton's views. He was addressing an audience of \nhealth care executives, hospital trustees, and others, at a symposium \nsponsored by the Hospital Association of Rhode Island. Ira Magaziner--\nif we remember, he was, along with Mrs. Clinton, a principal architect \nof Government health care, a huge Government-run system. We all \nremember the charts that were shown here on this massive Government \ntakeover of medicine. Well, Ira Magaziner said, ``The American public \nstill cries out for a comprehensive health care system, and President \nClinton remains committed to this idea. Indeed, the President will try \nagain if a more receptive Congress is ever elected.''\n  Well, that means to try again for a massive Government-run health \ncare program. That brings up an interesting point.\n  Now, the President promised tax relief to the middle class. Just \nyesterday, I pointed to the book called ``People First,'' where, on \npage 15, he promised a middle-class tax cut. But that became virtually \na half-trillion-dollar tax increase--the exact opposite of what was \npromised. Then, yesterday, we had the Families First Program--from \nPeople First to Families First. CBO says that could cost another half-\ntrillion dollars. This Government-run health program that America \nrejected, for which is still harbored hope on the other side to \nresurrect, that was about another $200 billion in tax increases. The \nnet effect of all of that, I might add, requires that the average \nworking family in America forfeits about another $6,000 to $8,000 of \ntheir income to the Government. That is what all this adds up to.\n  Another quote: ``We're going to get this done, and we're going to \nkeep coming back at it * * *. If we can have a big sweep for the \nDemocrats in the House and the Senate, we'll get single payer.'' That \nmeans Government-run health care. Who said that? Well, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts said that.\n  So maybe now it is becoming a little clearer as to exactly why this \nfilibuster is going on. The idea is, do not get the targeted health \ncare reform that Americans have asked for. Let us throttle that and let \nus see if we cannot stall the 104th Congress, and maybe the American \npeople will change the balance here and we can get back to pursuing our \nultimate goal, which is a national Government-run health care program, \nwith massive new taxes to run it, and an opportunity for the Government \nto be expanded even beyond 50 percent of the American economy.\n  This is Senator Kennedy's quote: ``I'm strongly in favor of universal \ncomprehensive health care for all Americans.'' That was Senator Kennedy \non ``Larry King Live,'' May 8, 1996.\n  Senator Kennedy's key aide said, ``It may be that, ultimately, the \neffect of our bill is to lead the Government to take further steps to \nincrease coverage and control costs of health care. My boss still wants \nuniversal coverage with cost containment * * *.''\n  So from his point of view the foot is in the door and that is a good \nthing. There can be no mistake that we are engaged in an attempt to \nthrottle targeted health care reform, to stall, and to wait to see if \nthere is an opportunity to move to broader health care reform.\n  Now, Mr. President, one of the centerpieces of contention that is \nalways brought up about the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, is that the other side, the House, has a proposal called \nmedical savings accounts, and somehow that is objectionable.\n  Madam President, it has been determined by the General Accounting \nOffice that 25 million Americans could be helped by this targeted \nhealth care reform proposal. We need to understand that, in this \nproposal, there are a number of features that the American public are \nwaiting for. One is that it ensures portability. What does that mean? \nThe health care reform proposal is designed so that the health care \ninsurance can move with the employee if they change jobs. Currently, in \nthe workplace, many of the insurance policies, if the employee wants to \nmove from job A to job B, the insurance stays with the old employer. So \nthey become vulnerable. They have to leave their job, and their \ninsurance does not travel with them. That is a very, very important \nproblem, one which the health care reform that is being filibustered \nsolved.\n  The proposal fights fraud and abuse. It creates a national health \ncare fraud and abuse control program to coordinate Federal, State, \nlocal law enforcement actions. Funding is increased for investigation \nand prosecution. I do not talk to many citizens, Madam President, that \nI do not hear a deep concern, usually followed by anecdotal incidents. \nThey know of somebody that got in an ambulance and was taken 300 miles \nto another hospital and it was at the cost of the insurance or to the \nGovernment. They will name some incident they have seen, some bill that \nthey got--a bill that is three times the normal cost. They want us to \npursue this fraud and abuse. This health care reform proposal \naccomplishes that.\n  Madam President, this legislation will make health insurance far \neasier to obtain in our workplace, because it deals with the issue of \npreexisting conditions. It makes it more possible for individuals to \nget insurance who do not have it. That is an important ingredient. You \nhave many, many Americans today that are worried and concerned that \nthey have a preexisting condition and even though they want to be \nresponsible and they want to obtain health insurance, they cannot do it \nbecause they have had a preexisting condition, some health problem in \ntheir past.\n  This measure begins to get at that problem and begins to make it \neasier for people with preexisting conditions to get their insurance.\n  Madam President, it also, in the House version, includes a provision \nfor medical savings accounts. This is the issue that the Senator from \nMassachusetts focuses on. He uses that as the principal reason for his \nfilibuster.\n  I suggest that my quotes earlier said that there is another reason. \nHe wants to see if he can stall this and block it so that maybe there \nis another chance to go back to the total Government-run health care \nsystem that America says it clearly does not want. It wants the \ntargeted reform, just as I have described. So he has taken this medical \nsavings account and set it out as the red herring, as I would call it.\n  Just what is a medical savings account? A medical savings account is \na great new idea and product for the marketplace. It would lower costs \nfor people trying to get health insurance. A lot of small companies in \nAmerica do not offer health insurance. A large number of Americans who \ndo not have access to health insurance are employed by the very, very \nsmall companies who cannot afford a health insurance program. The \nmedical savings account gets at this target and would take millions of \nAmericans off the uninsured rolls and get them into insurance.\n  It is a great idea because it basically eliminates the front-end \ndeductible and the back-end copayment and at the same time lowers \ncosts. I am going to come back to that in just a moment and talk some \nmore about medical savings accounts.\n  We have been joined by the assistant majority leader, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma on \nthis subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you very much, Madam President. I compliment my \nfriend and colleague from Georgia for bringing to the attention of the \nAmerican people issues which the Senate needs to work, and it needs to \nmove forward with the Nation's business. We have found it increasingly \ndifficult because we have been frustrated by the obstructionist tactics \nby Members of the Democratic Party in the Senate.\n  The Senate is a great body in which to serve. It is a body that has \nrules that are open for debate. I like that. It is a body where it is \neasy to have\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\namendments. You can amend anything. You can have any amendment on any \nissue. It does not have to be germane. I happen to like that. I will \ndefend that right. It gives the minority enormous power to influence \nand delay and obstruct. Right now we have seen the minority using a lot \nof the Senate rules to obstruct, to delay, and to make it very \ndifficult to pass legislation. Unfortunately, a lot of that legislation \nis very much needed.\n  We have before the Senate right now for example the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. I have been around here a long time. I \ncannot remember anybody ever filibustering that bill because we all \nknow it needs to pass. We know we need to fund the military. We need to \nmake decisions on how many people we are going to have in the Armed \nForces and what we are going to pay them. We need to have decisions \nmade on what we are going to buy as far as airplanes, as far as \nequipment, as far as munitions, and as far as research and development. \nWe may have differences of opinion on how much, but we have to make \nthose decisions. You cannot make the decision unless you have the bill \non the floor.\n  In this case, we have Senators Inouye and Stevens, two of our more \nrespected Members and two of our more talented legislators, who have \nbeen totally frustrated for 3 days trying to bring that bill to the \nfloor. They are ready to go to work. I remember seeing both Senators \nhaving their notebooks and ready to go to work. That was on Wednesday \nafternoon. We have yet to have any substantive, real debate on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill because a couple of \nSenators--and I respect their rights--are filibustering that bill \nbecause they think this will delay consideration of the nuclear waste \ndisposal bill, which may come up after DOD. So, if they can filibuster \nand tie up the DOD appropriations bill, maybe that will help protect \nthem as far as the nuclear waste bill. I disagree with that strategy.\n\n  I respect the Senators from Nevada, and I respect their right to try \nto protect their State. But by delaying action on the Department of \nDefense bill, I do not think they are helping their case one iota as \nfar as Nevada is concerned. That is just the latest tactic. That is \nrather unusual--very unusual, I might say--to filibuster one bill, \nparticularly a bill as important as the Department of Defense bill, to \nhopefully influence legislation on the nuclear waste bill, or a bill \nthat is coming subsequently; very unusual in my opinion; not a good \ntactic, in my opinion; not helpful for the Senate.\n  The Senate needs to do its work on the appropriations bills. If \npeople have philosophical differences on different issues which they \nfeel strongly about, they have a right to filibuster those, but not \nreally on appropriations bills. It does not make any sense to \nfilibuster appropriations bills. We know we have to pass these \nappropriations bills. They are all important. They probably all spend \nmoney that we should not spend, however, if Senators disagree with the \nway some of the money is spent, they can have amendments to strike that \nspending, to reduce the spending or to increase the spending. That is \nthe way the system should work.\n  We should not filibuster appropriations bills. We should give \npriority to appropriations bills over many others because we know we \nhave to do that. We have to pass these bills.\n  Again, we can fight, wrestle, argue, and amend over what the amount \nof money should be in those bills. But I think all of them agree that \nwe should spend some money in each one of those 13 accounts for \nappropriations. To date, in the Senate, unfortunately, we have only \npassed one--military construction. We need to pass the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. Hopefully, we will be able to get back to \nthat on Tuesday and move forward.\n  That is not the only case of obstruction that we have seen from our \nDemocratic colleagues. Senator Coverdell mentioned the health care \nbill, the so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. That bill passed the Senate \nin April by a vote of 100 to 0. The House has already passed it. The \nnormal course of procedure is that we would appoint conferees and work \nout the differences between the House and the Senate.\n  We have some differences between the House and the Senate--however, \nthese are not real substantive differences in too many areas. But we \nneed to go to conference to work them out. Senator Kennedy has \nobstructed that. He has objected to appointing conferees indicating he \nwould filibuster any effort to appoint conferees. He may well have the \nopportunity to filibuster it.\n  I think we need to make a decision. Are we going to allow one Senator \nto deny us the opportunity to go to conference for final action on a \nbill that passed the Senate 100 to 0? I think Senator Kennedy is wrong \nin objecting to this bill. This bill is an important bill. It bears his \nname--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. It has a lot of provisions that are \nagreed upon with strong bipartisan support. We made some improvements \nin that bill as originally introduced.\n  I remember some of our colleagues saying that we cannot amend that \nbill, that, if we amend it, we threaten the bill. We did amend it.\n  We put in a provision that I know is of interest to the Presiding \nOfficer that allows the self-employed to have deductions for health \ninsurance rising from 30 to 80 percent. That is a very important \nprovision, a good provision, one that passed. Nobody objected to it. We \nincluded it in the Finance Committee action. No one objected to it on \nthe Senate floor. It must be a great provision. It certainly is common \nsense. It has some equity for taxes as far as health care is concerned. \nMajor corporations get to deduct 100 percent. Why would a self-employed \nperson only get to deduct 30 percent? It does not make sense. Now at \nleast that is increased to 80 percent. It takes 7 years to get there. \nBut that is a positive provision.\n  Senator Kennedy right now is objecting to that provision because we \nare not able to get this bill to conference. I find that very \nimportant. He has objected now for 80 days; almost a record. I cannot \nfind any bill that anybody has objected to longer for appointing \nconferees. If he wants to filibuster the bill when it comes out of \nconference, he has that right, and I respect that right. I may not \nagree with him, but at least I respect somebody who is abiding by the \nrules. Under the rules, you can filibuster appointment of conferees. \nThat is what he is doing. But what he is doing is denying 25 million \nAmericans portability between group insurance and individual insurance. \nIn other words, if they leave a group--maybe they are working for a \ncompany that has health insurance and they are fired, or they quit, or \nthey have to move, for whatever reason, and they want to go into a \ndifferent plan--this bill says they will be able to move their \ninsurance. They will be able to get coverage either in an individual \npolicy or another group policy.\n  That is a good provision. It has strong bipartisan support. By \nblocking the appointment of conferees, Senator Kennedy is not allowing \nus to take that up and pass it, and put it on the President's desk and \nhave it become law.\n  Ostensibly the reason the Democrats are objecting to appointing \nconferees is they do not like medical savings accounts. The House has a \nmedical savings accounts provision that basically makes it available as \nan option for, I believe, most Americans. The Senate had a close vote, \n52 to 46, on medical savings accounts. We were not successful in having \na broad medical savings accounts provision. And so since the Democrats \ndo not want medical savings accounts they have refused to let the \nconference go forward. Even yesterday, the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, said if you will give us the medical savings accounts \nprovision or let us define it, then we will go to conference.\n  That is not the way we do business. If we did business that way, the \nminority would say, well, we will not let you go to conference until we \nsee the final outcome. In other words, the conference does not make any \ndifference; we will write the final package or we do not have a bill or \nwe will not go to conference.\n  I disagree with that. That is a crummy way to legislate. That is not \ngood, and we should not let it happen. And, frankly, we are not going \nto let it happen.\n  The proposals we have made in an effort to compromise on this bill \nare several. We have already said that we\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nwould drop medical malpractice liability reform that the House had in \ntheir bill and we did not have in our bill. We have already said, well, \nthat will be dropped. We dropped purchasing alliances for small \nbusinesses. In my opinion, we should not have dropped it, but we did.\n  So we have made several compromises. On medical savings accounts, we \nsaid that instead of making the medical savings accounts open for all \npeople in the country, as I think we should, we will confine it to \nsmall business, to businesses with 50 or less, and the self-employed. I \nthink that is a very minimal move toward medical savings accounts. As \nof yesterday, Senator Kennedy and others think that is still too \ngenerous. They do not want to give self-employed people the right to \nhave a medical savings account or they do not want to give a small \nbusiness with 50 or less employees the right to start a medical savings \naccount.\n  What are they afraid of? That it is going to work? Are they afraid \nthey are going to be popular? Are they afraid they are going to take \noff and be a real success? Frankly, they will be. They will prove you \ncan save money and you can provide an option.\n  We are not mandating that anybody in America has to have a medical \nsavings account. We are saying that should be an option. And if they \nchoose it, great. If they do not choose it, that is great. It would be \ntheir option. It would be another method of obtaining health insurance. \nIndividuals and small companies could decide for themselves where they \nwould take that couple of thousands of dollars a year and say, well, if \nI do not use it on medical care, I can save if for long-term care.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I yield another 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So we would allow small businesses the right to offer to \ntheir employees medical savings accounts as an option--not a mandate, \nas an option--so they could use that money. It would be their money. \nPeople are a lot more frugal with their own money than they are with \nGovernment money or they are with their employer's money. So there will \nbe savings involved. That is positive. That is good.\n  What is Senator Kennedy afraid of, that this is going to work? I have \nheard him say something about, well, this would be utilized by the \nwealthy and the healthy. I disagree with that. We had hearings and \nlistened to people, school teachers and others, who really like this \nopportunity.\n  The States have given them a small tax advantage. What we would do on \nthe Federal level is allow them to have medical savings accounts, treat \nit somewhat like an individual retirement account, and if they do not \nuse it for health care purposes, they could use it for long-term health \ncare purposes. If they do not use it today, they would accumulate it. \nThey do not have to use it or lose it. So people would have an \nincentive not to run up their medical expenses. They could save it and \nuse it, if not this year, next year. They could save it for a real \nproblem in the future or perhaps save it for dental care that their \nhealth care did not cover. Or maybe they could use it for long-term \nhealth care, which most people in this country do not save for, which \nmakes eminent good sense.\n\n  Madam President, I am very disappointed that my colleagues on the \nDemocrat side have objected to appointing conferees on the health care \nbill which benefits up to 25 million Americans. We should move forward \non that bill, and we should move forward on it now.\n  I appreciate the fact that the majority leader yesterday tried to get \nunanimous consent to move to the health care bill, and once again, I \nthink for probably about the eighth time, the Democrats have objected. \nI know that he will be making that motion again on Tuesday. I hope that \nthey will reconsider. I have stated my intention to make sure that we \nmove toward the health care conferees before we appoint conferees on \nthe minimum wage. I think both conferences should be appointed. I do \nnot make any bones about that. Both conferences should be appointed.\n  We should not be objecting to conferees. We should let the majority \nwill of the Senate go forth. But I do think it is important, for a \nlittle leverage, for Senator Kennedy and others, if they really want \nminimum wage, they are going to have to allow appointment of conferees \non the health care bill. I hope they will see the wisdom in allowing \nthe conferences go forward on both and see that the will of Congress \ncan go forward on two very important issues.\n  Madam President, again, I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia \nfor his time and also for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the assistant majority leader for his \npresentation and knowledge on this subject, his assistance in \nparticipating in our controlled time.\n  Madam President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia for his \nleadership and giving us an opportunity to express ourselves on what \nappears to be the state of the Senate today.\n  Far be it for me to come over here and argue that it is inappropriate \nfor someone to filibuster, and I will not make that argument. The \nSenator from Kentucky is familiar with the procedure, has employed it \non numerous occasions over the years, to good end, for the Nation.\n  What I would like to say to my colleagues this morning, Mr. \nPresident, is I am not trying to turn the Senate into the House here. I \nunderstand the Senate is not the House. We all know from high school \ncivics that in the House of Representatives, if you have a majority, \nyou can run the place. The House of Representatives can be sort of like \na triangle, with the Speaker and the chairman of the Rules Committee at \nthe top of the triangle, and with the concurrence of a mere majority \nthe place can be run like a fast train out of the station. The House of \nRepresentatives was constructed by the framers of our Constitution to \nbe a place of great passion and quick reaction. That is the way it has \nalways been, and we understand that.\n  Many people in the House over the years have referred to the Senate \nas ``the House of Lords,'' with some degree of derision. The Senate was \na ponderous place, a place in which things were contemplated for quite \nsome time. And, boy, that is the way it has worked for 200 years, and, \nin fact, that was the way it was designed. Frequently, we heard the \nSenate described as the saucer underneath the coffee cup where the \ncoffee sloshed down the cup into the saucer and cooled off.\n  I am here to object to none of that. I am not in favor of changing \nthe rules of the Senate. I am not in favor of diminishing the rights of \nthe minority. But it seems to me what is going on right now in the \nSenate is different in several measurable ways from what has been \nexperienced in the past. I could be wrong about this, but I cannot \nremember in any of the years I have been here in the minority that we \ntried to stop appropriations bills. It is one thing to attempt to stop, \nto pull together 41 people to try to do what you think is best for \nAmerica by stopping a bad piece of legislation.\n  We saved the country from ``Clintoncare,'' the Nation's most \naggressive effort to take over all of health care by the Federal \nGovernment through the use of the filibuster. I make no apologies about \nthat. I am proud of that. We stopped the stimulus package in 1993 \nthrough the use of the filibuster, saved 20-odd billion dollars in \nwaste. I make no apologies about that. We stopped an effort by the \nGovernment to take over all of the political campaigns and snuff out \nthe voices of Americans and hand the check to the Treasury to support \npolitical campaigns. I make no apologies for that.\n  However, never in the years I was here in the minority did we try to \nstop appropriations bills, the essential element of operating the \nGovernment.\n  It seems to me that is what is going on here; an orchestrated effort \non the\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\npart of our friends on the other side of the aisle, maybe in \nconjunction and concurrence with the administration, to simply create a \nsituation where the Government must come to a standstill, and to try to \ndo it subtly, somehow to try to get it done in a way that everybody \ndoes not figure out what is going on.\n  By any standard that is a new low. That is not trying to stop an \nissue on the merits because you think it is bad for America. That is \nsaying we will not engage in the elementary, basic function of \nGovernment for which the Congress remains responsible, and that is \ndiscretionary spending. We cannot control interest on the national \ndebt; we cannot control, at least on an annual basis, the entitlements; \nbut the one thing we do do around here every year, at a bare minimum, \nis the 13 appropriations bills, the fundamental function of Government.\n  So let me cite an example. I am chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee. It is not a huge amount of money in the grand scheme of \nthings around here, but this year we will be appropriating about $12 \nbillion to pursue America's interests around the world through the use \nof means other than sending in the troops; another tool for the No. 1 \ncountry in the world to pursue its interests around the world without \nthe deployment of troops.\n  Last year we had nine different votes on the foreign operations \nappropriations bill in the House and the Senate on the issue of \npopulation control, admittedly a very divisive issue upon which Members \nof this body and the other body are divided, on a bipartisan basis. But \nfinally, after 5 months of ping-ponging this bill back and forth from \nthe House to the Senate, trying to work out some kind of compromise on \nthe population control issue that would bring the President's \nsignature, we were able to do that. The President signed the bill. He \nsigned the bill.\n  This year I would say, Mr. President, in an effort to secure a \nsignature on the foreign operations bill, the House of Representatives \ninserted into their version of the foreign operations bill exactly the \nlanguage that the President signed in February--exactly. It was an \neffort to reach out to the administration and say, ``Let's not have a \nfight over this issue this year. It was a difficult compromise to \nachieve last year, so we will just put in exactly the language you \nsigned in February--now.''\n  ``Oh, but that is not good enough. What was good enough in February \nis not good enough now. We will not sign it again. The standard somehow \nhas evolved from February until now.''\n  What is going on here, Mr. President? There is no other conceivable \nexplanation for that, than that the President would like to veto this \nappropriations bill. We have not sent it down to him yet. Hope springs \neternal. Maybe that will not happen. But it is very difficult to deal \nwith an administration that will not stay stuck to any position. These \npeople can change positions in the middle of a sentence, and do--\nfrequently. Why? They are looking for a reason to stop the Government.\n  Mr. President, that is what is going on here. I do not know whether \nthere is sort of daily coordination between the White House and our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle or not, but the effort here is \nto do the country harm--harm, by creating a crisis that does not exist. \nBecause we are not arguing, here, in many of these instances, over \nfreestanding policy matters. Although we are having a dispute here on \nthe minimum wage and the health care bill, I want to say to the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, as someone who has filibustered \nappointment of conferees in the past myself, I think it was entirely \nappropriate for the assistant majority leader to take the position that \nwhat is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we are going to \nobject to going to conference on health care, then why not object to \ngoing to conference on the minimum wage and small business tax bill? I \nthink that linkage is appropriate. I think it makes sense. It seems to \nme it might bring about a condition where we can pass two bills that at \nthis point clearly ought to pass the Senate and the House.\n  But what I fear we are going to see here in the next few months, not \nonly on that side of the aisle but also downtown, is an effort to \ncreate reasons to not engage in the basic function of Government, which \nis to pass these annual appropriations bills. I think it is important \nfor the American people to understand what is going on here; basic \nfunctions of Government, not big ideological disputes about the future \nof the country, but the fundamental activity of the Congress.\n  Hopefully, this will not continue much longer. I commend the majority \nleader, who is not on the floor at the moment, but I want to commend \nthe majority leader for finally going on and talking about it in \npublic. We have been sort of sensing what has been going on around \nhere. Everybody has been sort of exasperated about it. You kind of hate \nto admit publicly this body has declined to that level, but it is time \nto talk about it and I commend him for doing that. Hopefully our public \ndiscussion of this will bring about a more cooperative framework for \nadvancing the business of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Kentucky \nleaves, he has given us a good civics lesson on the nature of the \nSenate, with which I agree. I concur that the rules ought not to be \nchanged. But, if I might just make one point that I made before the \nSenator arrived, the Senator has conducted filibusters, and on very \ncontentious issues for which there were deep divisions. But we opened \nthe 104th Congress on the unfunded mandate bill which passed here 98 to \n2, which was filibustered by the other side for 3 weeks. That is a \ndistinction. That was not a filibuster over the issue embraced in the \nbill. It was a strategic design to thwart the interests of the American \npeople and it is not families first, it is America last.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator makes a very important point. I thought we \nwanted to pass a health care bill. This is essentially the same bill we \nwanted to pass in 1991. I thought they wanted to pass the minimum wage \nbill. The Senator from Georgia, I think, makes a very important point \nas to what is going on here. This is not about principle. There is no \nprinciple involved here. This is pure sabotage. I thank my friend from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Kentucky and I turn to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas and yield up to 10 minutes to Senator \nHutchison of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia, who \nwanted to talk about the gridlock that has come over the Senate, really \nin the last year and a half. But I think it is beginning to show, \nbecause our distinguished majority leader made the eloquent effort \nyesterday to bring up nine separate bills, and had objections raised to \nevery one of them.\n  These are bills that range from the health care reform bill that was \npassed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which is being held up from even \nhaving conferees appointed for it, to a stalking bill that was passed \nunanimously by the House of Representatives and would be passed \nunanimously out of the U.S. Senate but for the objection of one \ncolleague from the Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, we have had, in the last year and a half since Senator \nDaschle became minority leader, over 65 cloture motions that have been \nrequired to try to get on with the business of the Senate. Let me just \ngive a list of a few of those.\n  Unfunded mandates, to keep the States from having to pay for the \nmandates that are dreamed up in Washington, D.C. It took four cloture \nmotions to bring the bill up, and once it was brought up the bill \npassed nearly unanimously.\n  Balanced budget amendment to the Constitution: That is what the \npeople of this country have been asking for, a balanced budget \namendment so that when we do finally balance the budget, hopefully, we \nwill never again see the spectacle of a Congress that will tax our \nfuture generations for the programs that we ask for today. It took\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nthree cloture motions before we could debate that bill. And when we \nfinally did, we lost it by one vote.\n  Striker replacement, line-item veto, health insurance tax deductions \nfor the self-employed and the small businesses of this country: Every \none of these required cloture votes before we could even talk about \nthem on the floor, debate the differences and pass them.\n  Let's go one step beyond. When we are talking about gridlock, it is \nnot just the Democrats in the Senate, it is also President Clinton. It \nis the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. President Clinton has vetoed \n15 bills, 15 bills that have finally made it through this Congress, and \nof those 15, I want to read you what they are, because I think it is \nimportant to see the differences between President Clinton and the \nDemocrats in Congress and what they would do versus what the \nRepublicans would do, as shown by what we have passed in Congress.\n  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Self-Defense Act, vetoed by the President. \nThis would have allowed the Moslems to arm and train themselves so that \nwe might not have had to send Americans with a NATO force to bring \npeace to that country. They might have settled it 2 years earlier if we \nhad given them the right to have free access to defend themselves. It \nwas vetoed by the President.\n  Seven-year balanced budget: The President promised the American \npeople a balanced budget. So did Members of Congress. Congress \nproduced, and the President vetoed it.\n  Securities litigation reform: We were trying to have litigation \nreform that would cut the costs of the securities industry in this \ncountry and for the investors in this country. It was vetoed by the \nPresident. That one was overridden.\n  Welfare reform: Another promise of the President to the American \npeople, a promise kept by the Republican Congress, vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  A ban on partial-birth abortions; a ban on killing babies that are \nhalfway out of the mother's womb: Vetoed by the President.\n  Product liability reform: The single most important litigation reform \nbill that has been passed by this Congress that would have tried to \nbring down the costs of regulation and the prices to consumers, product \nliability reform, vetoed by the President.\n  The rest of the bills vetoed by the President were appropriations \nbills for specific agencies and departments of Government or \nauthorization bills to run the departments of Government.\n  I think we are beginning to see a pattern here, a pattern of gridlock \nand obstruction, a pattern of broken promises. I think the American \npeople deserve to know what Congress is trying to do and what we are \nbeing obstructed from doing.\n  Let's talk about some of the items that our majority leader tried to \nbring up yesterday. He mentioned the stalking bill. The stalking bill \nis my bill. It was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. \nIt is being held up because one Senator wants to put a gun control \namendment on the bill.\n  Other Senators had amendments that they had hoped to offer on this \nbill. Senator Feinstein had an amendment. Senator Gramm of Texas had an \namendment. They were willing to step back because they knew if we \nopened up the bill, we might not be able to get it passed, and, of \ncourse, we were hoping to send it directly to the President after its \nunanimous passage by the House of Representatives. So they agreed to \nstep back and not change it so that it could go directly to the \nPresident and give to the stalking victims of this country another \nmeasure to help protect them from threats and harassment that might be \nfulfilled, because we have not passed this bill that would allow the \nFBI to come in and track a stalker that goes from one State to another.\n  This is especially important in a State like New York, where many of \nthe people who work in the New York metropolitan area live in \nConnecticut or New Jersey. It is especially important where the threats \nbecome so great that a victim moves to another State to elude the \nthreat and harassment and is followed by the stalker, and there is no \nway to have the ability to clamp down on that stalker before he \nfulfills his mission of beating up or murdering the victim. This bill \nis being held up for no good reason.\n  Why would we have a holdup on health insurance reform? The American \npeople have asked for health insurance reform. They have asked for \nportability so that if they lose their jobs, they will not worry about \nlosing their health care coverage. They have asked that we do away with \npreexisting condition clauses because they are worried that if they do \nchange jobs, their insurance company will say, ``No, I'm sorry, we \ncannot take you on because you or someone in your family has an illness \nthat might be expensive.''\n  That is what the bill does that was passed overwhelmingly by the \nSenate and by the House. Why would it be held up? Why would it be \nfilibustered for 2 months?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has raised the objections because----\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. It is medical savings accounts that the Senate turned down, \nand the conferees are all for MSA's. Therefore, we will get something \nthat the Senate turned down, and that is the basic objection.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How would we know----\n  Mr. FORD. We absolutely know, if you know what is going on in the \nSenate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If you do not even appoint conferees----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will go through the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. To the conference committee, because we do not know \nhow it is going to come out. MSA's were passed by the House--they were \nnot passed by the Senate--by a narrow majority. So why should we not be \nable to work that out? Why would one Senator object to even appointing \nconferees so that we could sit down and work out the differences \nbetween our two bills? Is that not the way this process works?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, we have already gone beyond \nthe 11 o'clock period of time. I had changed appointments to be here at \n11 o'clock because that was the unanimous-consent agreement. I do not \nwant to interfere with the distinguished Senator from Texas, but \nsomehow or another we are going to have to stay on track. That was the \nunanimous-consent agreement last night, that we would have 11 o'clock. \nNow it is 11:10. And if I give----\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if I might, for parliamentary \ninformation, our control of time, as adjusted by unanimous consent, \nruns to 11:10, so it would be under my control to determine whether I \nextend additional time to the Senator from Texas. I yield another 2 \nminutes because we have other speakers besides the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has that right.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I think it is unconscionable to hold up health care \nreform that the people of this country expect and that both Houses of \nCongress have passed because we do not want conferees to sit down and \nwork out a compromise on medical savings accounts.\n  Medical savings accounts, Mr. President, are something very important \nfor health care reform in this country. It allows a business to give to \nan employee the amount of money that that employee would have anyway \nand have choices, so that the employee could take that money and \nperhaps save by going to different health care coverage or perhaps save \nmoney for future rainy day expenses for their health care needs for \nthemselves and for their families. What we want is for them to have \nthat option and to have the tax breaks to be able to save for those \nhealth care needs.\n  So, Mr. President, we are talking about not allowing the appointment \nof conferees so we can move health care reform as we have promised the \nAmerican people we would do. Mr. President, I also have to say I do not \nknow why the Senator from Massachusetts would be so concerned about the \nability to have medical savings accounts. I will\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\njust read from his very own health care reform bill in 1994, just 2 \nyears ago, where his bill says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources of the Senate that provisions encouraging the \n     establishment of medical savings accounts be included in any \n     health care reform bill passed by the Senate.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts' own bill includes \nlanguage encouraging the establishment of medical savings accounts. So \nwhy will the Senator from Massachusetts not allow us to have conferees \nappointed for that reason? Is he afraid that we cannot sit down and \ndiscuss it and get the health care reform?\n  Mr. President, it does not wash. There is gridlock in the Senate, and \nit has to stop. The majority in the Senate is trying to make that \nhappen. I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Texas. I think she makes an \nexcellent point when she reminds us that medical saves accounts--which \nis apparently what is holding this up--was an issue for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts in his own legislation. That is a very important \npoint. I commend the Senator for bringing that to the attention of the \nSenate.\n  I now yield 8 minutes, if I might, to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, although I am a new Senator, in my first term, I have \nhad association with the Senate going back some 30 years. I started as \nan intern between school years some 30-odd years ago. I have served on \nthe Senate staff, been associated with the Senate for a number of \nyears. I want to draw on that experience to give a little historical \nperspective to what I think is going on in the Senate here.\n  I remember in the days that I have referred to that filibusters used \nto be very rare. When a filibuster occurred, it was a real filibuster. \nI remember the time when the Senators were told, ``Get out the cots. \nYou're going to be here around the clock. We're going to have quorum \ncalls at 3 o'clock in the morning and do everything we can to break the \nfilibuster.'' It was reserved, if you will, for those issues about \nwhich certain Senators felt most powerfully. The filibuster was not an \nordinary tool that was used whenever a bill came up that a Senator \nobjected to.\n  You contrast that to today's strategy when the filibuster is used \nalmost routinely, when cloture votes are the most common votes that we \ncast, and you realize something rather fundamental has happened in the \nSenate.\n  I think what has happened is that people have discovered that through \nthe use of the filibuster, in the present circumstance, they can change \nthe political dynamic. It is no longer necessary to have a majority in \norder to work your will in the Senate. Through the use of the \nfilibuster, all you need is 40 votes and you can control the Senate and \nyou can force your opposition to cast votes that they might not want to \ncast so that you can then go home and campaign against them. The Senate \nhas ceased to be a legislative arena and has turned into a campaign \narena that seems to be ongoing and continuous.\n\n  I will obviously confess to having participated in filibusters in the \nlast Congress. There were two issues that were very important, in my \nview, that we engaged in filibusters on. No. 1 was the stimulus package \noffered by the President of the United States. A group of us felt that \nwas a serious mistake. We took the floor. We held the floor. We \nultimately forced the President to back down on that issue. Looking \nback on it, we were right. The stimulus package that he was calling for \nwas clearly nothing more than pork. I do not apologize for having tied \nup the Senate to prevent the $19 billion worth of pork that the \nPresident proposed.\n  Other filibusters--I will not take the time to describe them--but the \none common thread was I participated in filibusters against bills I was \nopposed to. We have seen that going on here now. The two Senators from \nNevada are involved in a filibuster against a bill that they are \nopposed to.\n  What is different in this Congress is that we are seeing filibusters \nagainst bills that people are for. Yes, they are doing their best to \ndelay consideration of bills they intend to vote for. I have had to ask \nmyself, what is the motivation behind a filibuster against a bill you \nare for? I have come to this conclusion, Mr. President--I may be wrong; \nand I will be happy to have someone demonstrate that I am wrong--but \nuntil that demonstration is convincing, I have come to the conclusion \nthat the reason filibusters are currently being mounted against bills \nthat the participants in the filibuster are, in fact, for is that they \nwish to embarrass the current leadership of the Senate for political \npurposes in November.\n  I could understand that when the majority leader was the Republican \nnominee. I did not approve of it, but I could at least understand it, \npeople saying, ``OK, we will filibuster this bill. We will make it look \nas if Bob Dole is impotent as a leader so that we can then attack him \nas being an ineffective leader as the nominee.'' Senator Dole \nrecognized that that was going on, so he did the thing that surprised \nall of us, and I think perhaps probably disappointed the opposition a \nlittle, he said, ``OK. I will resign as the majority leader. I will \neven resign from the Senate.''\n  He made an interesting comment to us when he announced to Members of \nhis own party that he was resigning. He said, ``The people of Kansas \ndeserve a full-time Senator, and I can't do that being the nominee. The \nRepublicans deserve a full-time leader, and I can't do that being the \nnominee. And the people who nominated me deserve a full-time nominee, \nand I can't do that and stay in the Senate.'' So out of a great sense \nof duty and responsibility, Senator Dole resigned his position in the \nSenate, obviously stepping down as majority leader.\n  I thought that would solve it. I thought once Senator Dole was gone \nas a target, that the filibusters slowing down the work of the Senate \nwould stop and we could then get ahead with the work of the Senate. It \nturns out I was wrong. I have come to the conclusion that there is a \ndeliberate strategy to try to make the leadership of the Senate look \nbad in an effort to then go to the people in the election and say, \n``Change leadership. We will be able to get things through.'' I hope I \nam wrong, but I have come to the conclusion that that is the strategy \nand that that is why people are filibustering bills that they favor.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will step back and look at this in a \nhistoric context and say, is this the right thing to do in the Senate? \nIs it the right thing to get us in the habit and the pattern of \ndeciding everything that comes before us in a purely political context, \nboth sides perhaps equally guilty if we get into that circumstance? Or \nshould we all say, let us step back, let us recognize that the \nPresidential campaign is going to be between Bob Dole, no longer a \nSenator, and Bill Clinton, who is not a Member of this body, and let \nthem fight their issues out? Let us take our constitutional \nresponsibilities seriously and get on with the business of the Senate.\n  Let us stop dilatory tactics that are geared not to change the \ncontent of legislation but to simply slow down the process and tarnish \nthe image of the leadership. Let us take our lumps. If we lose, we \nlose. If we feel passionately about an issue, use the filibuster about \nthe issue we feel passionately about; but if there is an issue that can \nbe decided and will be decided by a majority vote, go ahead and decide \nit by a majority vote and not try to tarnish the effectiveness of the \nleaders we have chosen.\n  I voted for Senator Lott as the leader because I feel he is committed \nto moving the business of the Senate forward in a proper, professional \nway, regardless of his ideological position. I think we should give him \nthe chance to do that. I think we owe him the courtesy of doing that. I \nthink the same would be true if Senator Daschle were the majority \nleader. I would not engage in a filibuster myself on any bill I \nintended to vote for. I think it should be reserved for those bills \nthat we opposed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. I yield \nup to the balance of the time remaining to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Out of curiosity, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Georgia, and I thank my colleagues \nfor their indulgence.\n  Mr. President, I am worried about our ability to serve the American \npeople. I am worried about the impression that we are creating and \ngiving the taxpayers of America that sent us here to do their work to \nachieve a better Government, to meet the needs of those in our society \nwho are less fortunate than we, to fulfill our obligations to national \nsecurity as embodied by the Department of Defense appropriations bill. \nThere is no higher calling that this body has than to provide for \nnational security. All of that has obviously ground to a halt.\n  Mr. President, a lot of things have been said about the gridlock that \nis here today. Unfortunately, it seems to be continuing, particularly \nin light of the fact that we have only a handful of weeks left \nremaining in session.\n  Mr. President, I have only been here about 10 years. It is a pretty \nlong time in the view of some, too long in the view of a few--I hope \nonly a few--but not nearly as long as some Members of the Senate. One \nof the Members of the Senate that I have grown to admire over the \nyears, that I have engaged in fierce and sometimes partisan debates \nwith, is the senior Senator from the State of West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, who all of us respect and revere as sort of the institutional \nconscience here.\n  Not too long ago, Mr. President, Senator Byrd stated it most \nsuccinctly and in a most compelling fashion. Senator Byrd, back in \nDecember of last year, December 15, 1995, said in the Congressional \nRecord:\n\n       Under the Constitution, the only real responsibility we \n     elected Members of Congress have to worry ourselves with is \n     that of ensuring the passage of the 13 appropriations bills \n     that fund the Federal Government. That is all we really have \n     to do. This year, while Members of Congress have spent months \n     and months raising the public's expectations for an end to \n     the legislative gridlock and a new blueprint for governing, \n     we seem to be more preoccupied with one petty nuance after \n     another. Instead of ensuring that the people's needs are met, \n     we are arguing over the size of the negotiating table, how \n     many people can attend, and which door of the airplane we can \n     use. All of this is an unnecessary and unwarranted diversion. \n     This year, as always, there are differences in priorities \n     between the Democrats and Republicans and the Congress and \n     the White House.\n\n  Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching a position where we cannot \ncarry out what Senator Byrd described as the only real responsibility \nwe have in Congress. Mr. President, it is interesting what a difference \na couple years can make in one's viewpoint. It is always interesting to \nme, because back on October 26, 1994, the Vice President of the United \nStates, Vice President Gore, was quoted in an Associated Press story of \nOctober 26, 1994, which read, in part:\n\n       With the President overseas, Vice President Al Gore stepped \n     in to launch a blistering attack on Republicans, who he said \n     were ``determined to wreck Congress in order to control it, \n     and to wreck the Presidency in order to recapture it.'' \n     Urging Americans to rethink their votes 3 weeks before \n     election day, Gore, on Tuesday, labeled Republicans \n     ``advocates of isolationism and defeatism abroad and of a \n     reckless strategy of partisan paralysis at home,'' chastised \n     by name several GOP leaders and a handful of Republican \n     candidates in close Senate races, saying ``their campaign \n     platform would result in giant tax breaks for the wealthy.''\n\n  He takes particular aim, Mr. President, at Senate GOP leader Bob Dole \nand House GOP whip, then-GOP whip, Gingrich. Gore mocked their recent \nstatements that they are already planning a transition to a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress. ``We must not and we will not let the future of \nAmerica be trapped in the dark corner of Dole and deadlock Gingrich and \ngridlock reaction and recession,'' Gore said.\n  I hope the Vice President of the United States would come over and \ntreat us to his views today as to what is going on here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I believe and we all believe that the rights of every \nSenator and the minority party have to be protected. Mr. President, for \n8 of the 10 years I have been here, I was in the minority party. I \nunderstand and jealously guard those prerogatives and those rights.\n  Mr. President, I can cite example after example--and I see my friend \nfrom Kentucky here on the floor, one of the ferocious defenders of his \nparty and its principles and a person who I have grown to know, admire \nand respect in many ways. On this issue, I think the Senator from \nKentucky would agree with me that there is a time when we have to do \nthe people's work we are sent here to do, and we must give the votes \nand the debate to the issues of the day or we are basically derelict in \nour duty.\n  Mr. President, I cite several issues I was involved in for years, the \nline-item veto, which I was able to bring up time after time on the \nfloor of this body. The gift ban, recently the campaign finance reform \nbill, which, through bipartisan agreement, was allowed a vote. The \nrecent progress we made in the Department of Defense authorization \nbill, an agreement we made in order to move forward with a vote on the \nchemical weapons convention, and others. We should be able to sit down \nand reach agreements on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I am not in the business of predicting. I always keep \nin mind the words of the great philosopher, Yogi Berra, who said, \n``Never try to predict, especially when you are talking about the \nfuture.'' But I do predict that the American people will display their \ndissatisfaction in these upcoming elections with Members of both \nparties, if they see we are unable to do the work they sent us here to \ndo. I believe they will exact some kind of retribution on both parties \nand send people here who are committed to working out these issues \nwhich transcend partisanship and transcend personal agendas.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we will all appreciate that their excuse \nthat Senator Dole, now departed, now candidate Dole, is responsible for \ndeadlock is no longer valid, for gridlock is no longer valid. I suggest \nwe, together on both sides of the aisle, should sit down and work out \nan agenda for the rest of this year so we can, at a minimum, work out \nthe 13 appropriations bills that are necessary--a continuing resolution \nis an abrogation of our responsibilities--and also the authorizing \nlegislation, including important issues such as the chemical weapons \nconvention and other issues that are important to the future of this \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Arizona his \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that, under the previous \norder, the time until 12:10, by an earlier unanimous-consent agreement, \nshall be under the control of the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford].\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Ford, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Heflin pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 1951 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota may desire from the time that we have. I \nyield my portion of the time remaining to his control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota for the balance of the time until the hour of 12:10 p.m.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I inquire, following 12:10, is there \nanother 30 minute block of time under the control of the minority \nleader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from North \nDakota that there would be another 30 minutes under the control of the \nDemocratic leader or his designee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7798-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7806-S7813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GRIDLOCK IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that information. This \nmorning, I listened with great interest to a menu of opinions that was \noffered on the floor of the Senate about why the Senate has not moved \nforward more expeditiously to address this issue or that issue, and why \nthe Senate is not working as well as it really ought to work, who is at \nfault, what is wrong. The chorus was a well-rehearsed chorus. \nObviously, a fair amount of time was spent on this tune, because \neverybody was singing almost in complete harmony on these issues.\n  Let me take the most obvious and the easiest one. The U.S. Senate\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\npassed, by a vote of 100 to 0, a bill dealing with health care. It was \na piece of legislation that almost every American believes is long past \ndue. It says the kind of commonsense things like this: You ought to be \nable to take your health care with you when you move from one job to \nanother. Your health care plan ought to be portable. This legislation \nsays to every American family that when you move from one job to \nanother, you are not going to be threatened by losing your health care \nbenefits for you or your children.\n  It says that we ought not have a circumstance where insurance \ncompanies insure people as long as they are well and then cancel \ncoverage when they are sick. It says we will not allow insurance \ncompanies forever now to say, if you have a child with a heart defect, \na child with a preexisting condition of some sort, or a member of a \nfamily with a preexisting condition, that you are not going to get \ninsurance coverage because that preexisting condition means you are no \nlonger insurable.\n  This piece of legislation addresses all of those issues and more. It \nis a piece of legislation that every American family will want. It is \nsomething that should be done. And it was passed 100 to 0 in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  When we debated that bill, however, the then majority leader insisted \nthat something else be added to it--something that was extraneous, an \nissue that was outside of the purview of what was in the Kennedy-\nKassebaum or the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill called medical savings \naccounts. I must say, at least from my own standpoint, that I think it \nis useful to evaluate with a test program whether medical savings \naccounts are a good idea or bad idea, whether they work or do not work. \nThat is fine with me. It is a new idea certainly. Let us figure out \nwhether it works.\n  But to insist on a massive new approach--medical savings accounts, \nwhich many economists and other analysts say would undermine the whole \ncircumstance of how we pay for health care costs in this country, I do \nnot know whether they are right; I am just telling you there is a \nsubstantial amount of testimony about that--to suggest that must be \nadded to this commonsense health care bill in order for it to move just \nis out of line. But the then majority leader insisted. He said this \nmust be added to that bill.\n  So he brought it to the floor of the Senate, and we had what you call \na democratic vote; two ways. A democratic vote means that we all have a \nchance to express our opinion; and, second, the then majority leader \nfailed. Senator Dole failed. The Senate said no, we do not want to add \nmedical savings accounts to the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. No, we do not \nwant to do it. We did not weigh the votes. We counted the votes. When \nthe votes are counted, those who have the most votes win. The votes \nthat had the largest tally were votes that said let us not laden this \nbill with something else. Let us pass this commonsense health care bill \nby itself the way it is, the way the Senate has crafted it. That is the \nway it left the Senate.\n  What has happened since that time? The bill is held hostage. No; not \nby the Senator from Massachusetts, or not by a dozen unnamed villains. \nThe bill is held hostage by those who insist that the only way this \ncommonsense health care bill will get through this Republican Congress \nis if it has medical savings accounts attached to it. If they are not \nattached to it, they have no interest in passing this legislation.\n  That is what is holding this legislation hostage. We are told that \nthis Senator, that Senator, or some other unnamed Senator holds this \nbill, or that bill in the palm--well, it is nonsense. This bill, the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, has not moved because of some people's \ninsistence that the only way this will pass the Congress is if other \nthings are included with it. If we are not able to put other freight on \nthis train, then we are not going to let the train move. That is the \nattitude of some in this Chamber.\n  We heard a discourse yesterday about gridlock in the Senate. I think \nit is a curious thing to see in the U.S. Senate, which is a body where \none would expect the issues of the day to be not just debated but \ndebated fully, understood and thought out, reasoned, and compromised. I \nthink it is unusual to see in the Senate a tactic in which the party \nthat has the majority says the following: We are going to today, on \nTuesday, or Wednesday, or whatever day it is, lay down a piece of \nlegislation before the Senate. This will be the pending business of the \nU.S. Senate. This piece of legislation is what we will now begin \nworking on today. Then on the same day--the same day--the majority \nparty says, ``By the way, we have now decided today we will begin \ndebate. We will also file cloture to shut off debate.'' The same day on \nwhich a bill is filed to begin debate, repeatedly cloture motions are \nfiled to end debate.\n  Yesterday we heard from the majority leader that this has been done \nbefore. We are simply learning lessons from what happened in previous \nCongresses.\n  Well, we looked at the 103d Congress. On only one occasion did that \nhappen, and then it happened because there was uniform agreement on the \nprocedure by which it would occur. There was no disagreement about it. \nIt was on product liability. There was agreement by which a procedure \ncalled for two cloture votes and then the bill being withdrawn. It was \nthe only occasion on which the Democrats would have ever done that in \nthis Chamber in the 103d Congress. It has been done repeatedly in the \n104th Congress--not by consent of anyone, but in a way that is shoved \ndown someone's throat, a demand that although we begin debating the \nbill today, we also insist on shutting off debate today.\n  That is no way to run the U.S. Senate. If someone wants cooperation \nin the Senate on issues, to debate the issues that are important to the \npeople of this country and to others in the Senate, then they must \nallow debate on these matters--not concoct a strategy that says, ``By \nthe way, we will offer our legislation as we have crafted it behind our \nclosed doors without your involvement, and the day we offer it we will \ntell you, `No debate; no debate.' We are going to shut off your ability \nto amend. We are going to shut off your ability to debate, and that is \nthe way we legislate.''\n  If you come into this Chamber with that attitude and then wonder why \nyour vehicle does not develop any speed, I will tell you why it does \nnot develop any speed. Because that is not the kind of a vehicle you \ncan drive through a legislative process in something constituted like \nthe United States is constituted.\n  There have to be some people who serve in the Congress who believe \nthat we ought to be debating, amending, and improving legislation that \ndeals with real issues people are concerned about. There are, to be \nsure, substantial disagreements in our philosophies about how to \ngovern. I understand that.\n  I think it is really interesting, by the way, that we have a bill on \nthe floor of the Senate now that calls for $11 billion more in spending \nthan the Pentagon asked for pushed primarily by people who insist they \nwant to cut Federal spending--a bill that said let us spend hundreds of \nmillions more for national missile defense, or a star wars program \nwhich the Pentagon does not want to deploy; a bill that chooses \npriorities that say we can afford the extra $11 billion but we have \ndecided we cannot afford enough money to fully fund a Head Start \nProgram. So we are going to tell a bunch of little kids that we do not \nhave any room for you anymore in the Head Start Program. We know that \nprogram works. Do you believe that program does not deal with American \nsecurity? Do you believe that program does not strengthen this country? \nThat is the difference we have in priorities, I guess, in how we spend \nour money and how much we spend.\n\n  But I just think it is ironic that those who talk so much about \nwanting to cut spending on one of the biggest bills before Congress \ndemands and insists that they spend $11 billion more than the generals \nand the admirals in this country felt was necessary to defend our \ncountry.\n  I am hoping that we will move ahead and deal with a series of issues \nin this Congress. I do not want a do-nothing Congress. I want a do-\nsomething Congress. I want to participate in a Congress that makes \nprogress. I want to do something about the issue of jobs. I want to do \nsomething about shutting down the tax incentives that encourage runaway \nplants. I want to do something about health care. I want to pass\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill; invest in education to make sure that every \nlittle kid in this country has an opportunity to go to Head Start.\n  There is a litany of issues that we need to address, and address in a \nthoughtful and an appropriate way.\n  I want the majority leader to be a successful majority leader. I \nconsider him a friend. I want the Senate to succeed--not as Republicans \nor Democrats. I want us to succeed as a Senate by addressing the issues \nwhich we think are appropriate and necessary to address at this point.\n  But it does no good, it seems to me, for the Senate to spend all of \nits time just standing around in a circle pointing fingers saying, \n``Well, this person is at fault; that person is at fault.'' The fact is \nthat you cannot be laying down bills in the U.S. Senate and demanding \non the same day that you are going to shut off debate and then say, \n``Well, boy, I am surprised that you object to that. I mean, it doesn't \nmake any sense that you would object to a procedure by which we say we \nhave concocted what we want in a locked room someplace outside your \nview. Now we bring it to you to show it to you and demand that you have \nno voice in determining how it is going to be shaped. Shame on you.''\n\n  Well, no, not shame on us. If those who would begin developing this \nprocess would understand the quick way, the best way to get the Senate \nto act on these issues is to involve everyone and to reach sensible \ncompromises and then faithfully represent those compromises as we move \nahead, we would pass far more legislation that is far more beneficial \nto the American people than this 104th Congress has done to date.\n  I have some other things to say, Mr. President, but I will hold them \nfor a bit. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, is here, and \nSenator Wyden from Oregon is present.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as may be consumed to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from North \nDakota for this time.\n  Mr. President, I was in my office this morning listening to activity \nin the Chamber of the Senate, and I must say I was amazed to hear the \ncharges leveled at the minority side by those in the majority. I was \nlistening in my office, and I heard a litany of complaints against the \nminority for bringing gridlock to this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, it was as if the majority has forgotten that they were \nonce in the minority and it is though they have forgotten that they are \nnow in the majority and they are controlling the flow of business in \nthis Chamber.\n  I especially found it fascinating that our friends across the aisle \naccuse us of stopping Government when it was their side who shut down \nthe entire Government just a year ago--shut down the entire Government \nin order to try to dictate the results of the legislative process. It \nwas their side that shut down the entire Government of the United \nStates to try to dictate the results in this Chamber.\n  That is not the way this Chamber is supposed to function. It is not \nthe way democracy is supposed to function. If we go back and try to \nrecall what they were trying to do, I think we can understand why they \nhad to try to be so heavy-handed. What was it they were trying to do a \nyear ago? They were trying to cut Medicare $270 billion in order to \nprovide a $245 billion tax cut that would have been directed mainly at \nthe wealthiest among us.\n  That is what they were up to. And there was a reaction against that \nbecause it was too heavy-handed. The other side themselves described \nwhat they were trying to do as ``a revolution.'' That is what they were \nseeking to impose on the American people, a revolution, and they did \nnot want anybody standing in their way. They wanted to trample minority \nrights. They wanted to proceed. They had the arrogance of power, and \nthey abused their power. And as a result there was a strong reaction \nagainst them not only in this Chamber but in the country as well \nbecause the American people did not want a revolution. They wanted \nchange; they wanted us to get our fiscal house in order; they wanted to \nreform the welfare system; they wanted this country to work better; \nthey wanted more opportunity; but they did not want a revolution, and \nthey did not want folks taking from those who are middle class to give \nto those who are the wealthiest among us. That was not what the \nAmerican people wanted.\n  The other side has engaged in a whole series of tactics to try to \nchoke off the rights of the minority. We use a lot of words around here \nthat are foreign to most people--cloture, cloture motion. What do those \nthings mean? For most people it is not in their vocabulary. Most people \nI talk to back home in North Dakota have no idea what cloture is. I am \nnot sure my colleagues understand all of what cloture means.\n  Very simply, the tactic that has been engaged by the other side is to \nprevent the minority here from being able to offer amendments. Now, \nthat is basic to the legislative process. The majority leader said \nyesterday, ``I just learned this tactic from your leader.'' No, they \ndid not. Not once when we were in the majority did we lay down cloture \nmotions on bills that could be amended unless there was an agreement by \nthe two sides that were in dispute, and that only happened once. That \nonly happened once, that a cloture motion was laid down which choked \noff amendments on the day the bill was introduced. And the only time we \ndid was when there was agreement between the two sides in dispute. The \nother side has engaged in that practice repeatedly, laying down a \ncloture motion to choke off, to prevent the minority from offering \namendments, to act as though the minority is not even here, to act as \nthough the Democratic Party does not exist in the U.S. Senate, to act \nas though we have one-party rule.\n\n  Mr. President, we do not have one-party rule, and we are not going to \nhave one-party rule in this country or in this Chamber, and the \nmajority, I hope, will recognize that that kind of dictatorial stance \nhas led us to the gridlock we have today. They want to know why there \nis gridlock? It is because they have tried to choke off legitimate \nminority rights. That is not democratic, that is not American, and it \nis not going to be accepted.\n  There is another way. There is another way. We see what works. We \nsee, when we work together and we respect each other, that things can \nactually get done here. This week we got the minimum wage bill through \nthis Chamber by an overwhelming vote. This week we got through this \nChamber a significant package of tax cuts for small businesses and \nreforms in the pension system and a whole series of other measures to \nassist small business. How did it happen? It happened by working \ntogether, not by one side, in a heavyhanded, arrogant way, trying to \ndictate to the other side. That way creates gridlock. But, instead, if \nwe work together, if we respect each other, things can actually get \ndone here. It happened in the telecommunications bill this year--a \nmajor piece of legislation--when both sides were allowed to participate \nin the legislative process.\n  I hope the majority will remember, this is an institution with two \nsides. This is an institution that was formed by our forefathers so \nthat minority rights would not be trampled. This is a body that was \nformed by our forefathers to prevent a monopoly of power. This is a \nbody that was formed by our forefathers to prevent the arrogance of \npower from trampling the legitimate rights of the minority.\n  I heard other things said on the floor this morning that require a \nresponse. I heard the attack on the President for vetoing some of the \nbills that were passed by the Republican majority. You bet the \nPresident vetoed some of those bills. He should have vetoed them. They \nwere opposed by a majority of the American people.\n  The American people did not want to have a $270 billion cut in \nMedicare in order to finance tax cuts that disproportionately went to \nthe wealthiest in our country. That is not what the American people \nwanted. Of course the President vetoed that legislation. I applaud him \nfor it. He did exactly the right thing, and the American people agreed \nwith him.\n  I also heard on the floor of the Senate this morning that we defeated \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I am very proud to \nhave been one who rose in opposition to that\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\nphony balanced budget amendment. Boy, if there was ever a hoax tried to \nbe perpetrated on the American people it was that so-called balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. I tell you, as more people found \nout how they were proposing to balance the budget by looting every \npenny of Social Security trust fund surplus over the next 7 years and \ncall that a balanced budget, the American people would be in \noverwhelming opposition to it. That is not any kind of honest balancing \nof the budget.\n  If a private company tried to take the retirement funds of their \nemployees and throw those into the company's pot and call that a \nbalanced budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. They would \nbe headed to a Federal institution, and it would not be the Congress of \nthe United States. They would be headed to a Federal prison, because \nthat is a violation of Federal law. But that is exactly what our \nfriends on the other side were proposing, that we have a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution that would have enshrined in the \nConstitution of the United States the definition of a balanced budget \nthat included looting every penny of Social Security trust fund surplus \nover the next 7 years to call it a balanced budget. They were going to \ntake $525 billion of Social Security surpluses, throw those into the \npot, and call it a balanced budget. What a charade. What a hoax, to \ncall that a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator recalls the discussions we had, \nactually inside the Cloakrooms, in which some members of the majority \nparty were, in private, saying to us, ``We will stop using the Social \nSecurity funds in 2008,'' while others were out on the floor saying, \n``We are not using Social Security funds to balance the budget.'' I \nsaid it was three stages of denial. Actually, there was a third person \non the floor saying, ``There are no Social Security funds.''\n  So the three stages of denial that were orchestrated, all at the same \ntime, in total harmony, and I might give them credit for that, are: \nFirst, there are no Social Security trust funds; or, second, there are \nSocial Security trust funds, but we are not misusing them; and then, \nthird, back in the Cloakroom here, in their own handwriting, which I \nstill have, by the way, there are Social Security funds, we are \nmisusing them, and we promise to stop by the year 2008.\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I recall it very well. The other side was negotiating \nwith the Senator from North Dakota and myself. On the floor, they were \nsaying, ``Oh, no, we have no intention of using Social Security \nsurpluses. We have no intention of doing that.'' But right in that \nroom, right in that Cloakroom, they were telling us, ``Well, yes, we \nare going to use them, but we will stop doing it in the year 2008.''\n  First they said, ``We will stop doing it in the year 2012,'' and we \nchecked and we found out they were going to be using trillions of \ndollars of Social Security surpluses by that time. We said absolutely \nnot.\n  They went back out and came back in and said, ``Well, we will stop \nusing the Social Security surpluses in 2008.'' Again, they would have \ntaken over $1 trillion of Social Security surpluses, spent every dime, \nevery penny, and then said they would balance the budget. What a fraud \nthat would be.\n  You know, as I was thinking about it, in considering my vote on that \nquestion, I thought if I was the only vote in this Chamber against that \nproposition, and if every one of my constituents was on the other side, \nI would vote no. Because I would never want it said of me that I had \nhelped to put in the Constitution of the United States, the organic law \nof this country, the document that has made this the greatest country \nin human history, something that says you balance the budget when you \nhave looted trust funds in order to call it balanced.\n  I just want to conclude by saying, there is gridlock here. There is \ngridlock. And there is gridlock because the majority has tried to \nstifle the rights of the minority. They have tried to dictate \nlegislative results. That is not the American way. That is not \ndemocracy. That is not the constitutional role of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  The way to get things done here is to respect the legitimate rights \nof everyone, to respect everyone and to work together. When we do that, \nwe get things done. We got the minimum wage passed that way. We got the \ntelecommunications bill passed that way. We got a substantial package \nof tax relief for small business and reform of pension laws of this \ncountry that way. If anybody is serious about trying to get things \ndone, the way to achieve results is to work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me say, as somebody who is new here, as \na new Senator who campaigned for months on the idea that we have to \ncome together, we have to find common ground, we have to get beyond \nsome of the partisan labels, I want to come today and speak for a few \nmoments about the importance of that approach and why I feel it is the \nonly answer, and how I hope the Senate can get back on track and look \nat issues that way.\n  First, let me say, I have never considered myself particularly a \npartisan person. I come from a part of the world, the beautiful \nNorthwest where we have a history of fresh and creative approaches to \nissues before the Government. Our citizens do not get up in the morning \nand say, ``Well, whose got the partisan answer? Is it a Democratic \nanswer? Is it a Republican answer?''\n  They get up and talk about tackling major issues in a way that is \nfair and responsible and meets the needs of the public.\n  So I have tried to take that kind of philosophy, first as a Member of \nthe House and now as a new Senator, in terms of attacking the need to \naddress the concerns of the public.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said very clearly, it is obvious \nthat is how the Senate has made progress. Look at this minimum wage \nissue, for example. It seems to me when workers put out the maximum \neffort, they deserve a decent minimum wage. The Senate agreed and, \nfortunately, Senators of both parties came together, and passed an \nimportant small business package. My State is just chock-full of small \nbusinesses. We have only a handful of big businesses in the State of \nOregon. You can almost count the big businesses on one hand, so we are \na small business State, and those tax incentives that were passed with \nbipartisan support are going to make a real difference at home in \nOregon and on Main Street in our country.\n  The same kind of bipartisan approach was used in the Kennedy-\nKassebaum bill. I think that the health insurance system in our country \nneeds to work for more than the healthy and the wealthy, and yet, so \noften, when somebody gets sick, the whole system falls apart. For a lot \nof families, you can only get coverage when you really do not need it, \nwhich is when you are well.\n  So the Senate came together, a bipartisan bill was passed, and it is \ngoing to make a real difference, because, for the first time, when \ncitizens are trying to get ahead, when they work hard and play by the \nrules, they will not be limited in terms of their job advancement \nbecause they cannot get health insurance as they try to climb up the \nladder in the free enterprise system.\n  So there have been real successes since I have been here, when \nDemocrats and Republicans worked together on issues like health and the \nminimum wage. I am very hopeful that over the next 7 or 8 weeks of the \nsession--and I just remind again our colleagues and our friends that \nthere are only a handful of weeks left in the session. To get real \nresults on issues like welfare and crime and aviation reforms--many of \nus are concerned about the situation with aviation in this country and \nwant to pass real changes to make sure that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's mandate is safety first; that there can be public \ndisclosure of the safety records of airlines in our country. To get \nthis kind of work done on crime and welfare and transportation, we are \ngoing to have to have a bipartisan kind of approach, once again, in the \nSenate.\n  I think it has been very unfortunate. I have seen it over the last \ncouple of\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nweeks and hope that it will not be the practice in the last few weeks \nin the session that as soon as a bill is essentially introduced--and my \nfriends from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad, are very \nright to say, let's get away from some of these arcane, technical \nterms--``cloture'' and the like.\n  What the bottom line is all about is that for the last few weeks, as \nsoon as a major bill has been introduced, there has been an effort to \nimmediately cut off the debate. That bars the minority, especially, but \ncertainly Members of the majority may have differing views on some of \nthese issues, and debate, reasonable debate, is what the Senate is \nsupposed to be all about.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] and I both served in the \nHouse. One of the things that we thought was possible about service in \nthe Senate was to have a bit more time, a reasonable amount of time, \nfor all sides to have a fair airing of an issue. Sometimes that time is \nnot available in the House, and sometimes the public's business suffers \nas a result of it. So I think this practice of, in effect, trying to \nshut off debate, almost as soon as it starts, is something that is \nespecially unfortunate and is going to make it tougher to get the \npublic's business done in the last few weeks of this session.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, let me reiterate my interest \nand desire in looking at these issues in a bipartisan way. I think, for \nexample, there are a variety of procedural reforms that would be very \nhelpful in terms of the work of the Senate.\n  We know, again, for the last few weeks of the session, one of the \npractices that is often abused is a Senator puts a hold on a bill and \ndoes it all in secret. I think the Senator's procedural rights ought to \nbe protected, but I think there ought to be public disclosure. The hold \nis not the problem, but I think secrecy is. So what I have been trying \nto do is work with Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to try to make a change, to try to get public disclosure \nwhen there is a hold that will make the Senate more open, more \naccountable and more efficient and be in the interest of the public, so \nthat the public's right to know is protected.\n  I am not trying to do that in a partisan kind of way. I am talking to \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, because I think that is the way we \nhave to do the public's business.\n  (Mr. STEVENS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. So, Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I come to take \nthe floor today to say that in these last 7 or 8 weeks of the session, \nwhen there is so much important work to be done, let us make sure that \nthe procedural rights of the minority are protected, let us get away \nfrom this unfortunate practice we have seen in the last few weeks of \nliterally cutting off the debate almost as soon as it starts, and let's \ntake the kind of approach that folks in my home region, the Pacific \nNorthwest, take, and that is a bipartisan one.\n  I believe that it is possible to get some important work done in \nthese next 7 weeks, to get a welfare reform bill. We have done that in \nOregon. Senator Hatfield, my senior colleague, has done yeoman work in \nterms of our jobs plus program. It has a tough work requirement, but we \nare also helping with child care and medical care. That kind of \nbipartisan approach can be an ideal model for helping the Senate to \ncome together, Democrats and Republicans, to reform the welfare system \nin the last few weeks of this session.\n  But to reform welfare, to get a good crime bill, to have an important \ntransportation bill--the Presiding Officer, Mr. Stevens, for so many \nyears has done outstanding work on these aviation issues. He knows I am \nanxious to work with him in the days ahead--to really have progress in \nthese last few weeks of the session, we are going to have to protect \nthe rights of the minority; we are going to have to work in a \nbipartisan way. That is how we best address the public's needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by the Senator \nfrom Oregon. We are delighted he is in the Senate. I expect he expected \nto come to the Senate from the House of Representatives where they have \nsubstantially different rules and be in a body where there is \nsubstantial debate. Probably a surprising discovery for him is a new \ntrend here in the Senate of filing cloture motions on amendable issues \nin order to prevent amendments and shut off debate on the same day that \na bill is filed in the Senate for debate.\n\n  I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Oregon [Senator Wyden]. We \nhave heard a good many Members come to the floor earlier this morning \ndescribing all the ills of the Senate to be laid at the feet of the \nPresident or the Democrats in the Congress.\n  Frankly, it is not our interest, it is not my interest, I think it is \nnot Senator Wyden's interest to impede the progress of the Senate in \naddressing the real issues that people want addressed. We are not going \nto roll over and play dead when we have people coming to the Senate \nsaying to us, ``Here's our agenda. If you don't like it, tough luck. \nWe're going to ram it down your throat and send it to the White House \nand demand the President sign it.''\n  There was a complaint this morning about President Clinton's veto of \nsome bills. Well, let me say as well, I am glad he vetoed the piece of \nlegislation that says, by the way, let us take $270 billion out of what \nis needed to fund Medicare, and let us use the funds we get by taking \nthat out of what is needed for the Medicare Program and use it to give \ntax cuts, the majority of which will go to the wealthiest Americans. I \nam glad the President said, ``Not on my life you are going to do \nthat.'' He vetoed that. He vetoed that. So a whole series of \noverreaching and ill-proposed issues that came to the floor of the \nSenate last year the President had to veto.\n  Now the question is, are we going to do this in a serious way? I \nnoticed in the paper the other day, ``GOP To Press Missile Defense as \nClinton Test.'' They are going to load the defense bill down with \nhundreds of millions of dollars extra for national missile defense, \ndemanding that money be spent on the system the Pentagon says it does \nnot want and the defense community says this country does not need, \ndemanding it be done in order to confront the President with a defense \nissue so they can say the President is weak on defense. That is not \nfrom people who are serious about wanting to balance the budget. It is \nfrom people who want to use these issues as a political wedge.\n  My own interest is that we address the central questions facing \nAmerican families. Are there good jobs available for them and for their \nchildren? Is there some security with those jobs? Do they pay well? \nWhat about the schools you send your kids to? Are they doing well? Do \nwe have enough money for the Head Start Program, enough money for the \nWIC Program? Are we able to take care of the children in our country? \nWhat about welfare in this country? Are we going to get able-bodied \npeople off welfare and to work?\n  I am proud to have helped construct something called the Work First \nProgram. It does help enable people to go to work, but not injure the \nchildren. Do not say to a 10-year-old or 8-year-old, get off your \nbehind and go to work. Two-thirds of those who are on welfare are under \n16 years of age. I do not think anyone is suggesting we shove them out \nthe door and say, ``Get a job.'' Let us take care of the children in \nthis country, but let us insist able-bodied people go to work.\n  Let us reform the welfare system. There ought to be enough agreement \non both sides of the aisle to do this in a way that is not politically \ngamed so they can construct it and have a veto at the White House, but \nin a way that really does reform the welfare system and in a \nthoughtful, sensible way.\n\n  Health care. I have said before, let us just pass the bill. Let us \npass it through the House and the Senate that has already been passed. \nIt passed the Senate 100 to 0 dealing with the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill.\n  Portability, preexisting condition, so many things the American \nfamily needs. Pass it. Be done with it. Get the President to sign it. \nHe will. We will significantly advance the health care that the \nfamilies need in this country in the right way.\n  There are other things that I want to see done. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Oregon shares that.\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\n  Crime. I tell you, I very much want to see us do another initiative \non crime in the right way. I want everyone on parole and probation in \nthis country to be drug tested, period. End of story. Everyone on \nparole and probation in America ought to be drug tested while they are \non parole and probation. If they fail their drug test, it ought to be \nrevoked.\n  I also want to change the system so that in every circumstance in \nthis country, if you are convicted of a violent crime, if you are a \nviolent criminal and convicted of a violent crime, you spend all of \nyour time in jail, you do not get good time off for good behavior. No \ngood time off for people who commit violent crimes. If you go to jail, \nyou stay in jail and do not get out until the end of your term. Very \nsimple. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. There is no good \ntime off for good behavior. I would very much like to see us do that.\n  I would like to see us advance the proposition of victims' rights. \nFrankly, there is now a law, which I authored, dealing with, at least \nin the Federal court system, if you are a victim in the Federal court \nsystem you have a right to be in court and testify at the sentencing \ninvestigation. The victim has the right to come and say, ``Here is what \nthis crime meant to me.''\n  What happens? The criminal comes in, the person that has been \nconvicted comes in. They get them a new blue suit and haircut and they \nbring the minister and the neighbors in and say what a quiet young boy \nthis was, what a wonderful young person. And you have this story about \nwhat the criminal is about. I want the victim to say, ``Here is what \nthis person did to me and my family,'' or the victim's family to say, \n``Here is what this meant to me.''\n  I am pleased to tell you that is now in Federal law because I wrote \nthat provision in the last crime bill. But as you know, the Federal \nsystem only deals with less than 10 percent of the criminal justice \nsystem. I would like to see that in every State and local jurisdiction, \nin criminal justice all across America--victims' rights.\n  The issue of jobs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This crime issue is so important. I share the Senator's \nview. I just add, this question of violent juvenile crime is especially \nimportant. Again, you see Senators of both parties who have done \nexcellent work on this, Senators Hatch and Thompson--I have watched \nSenator Biden--all of whom have been very helpful to me and my staff in \nmy early days as a Senator. I think they can help us put together a \npackage dealing with violent juvenile crime.\n  In a lot of communities--the adult crime rate is still too high but \nhas sort of leveled off--but the rate of violent juvenile crime has \njust gone through the stratosphere. In fact, the Justice Department had \na study recently that showed, particularly between 3 and 7 o'clock, 3 \nin the afternoon and 7 in the evening, when you have these at-risk \nkids, that is when you really have a great portion of the violent crime \nin America.\n  There is nothing partisan about tackling violent juvenile crime. \nThere are Senators of both political parties that have dealt with it \nand come up with innovative ideas. There are people like the \ncriminologist, James Q. Wilson, who are advancing approaches that could \nbe backed by both political parties to try to particularly make sure \nthat these violent juvenile offenders are accountable.\n  But we are not going to get the important work done that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is talking about without thoughtful debate that \nensures that both sides have a reasonable opportunity. I hope the \nSenator from North Dakota takes the lead on this crime issue as a \nMember of leadership, and the kind of bipartisan approach the Senator \nis talking about will prevail, because issues like violent juvenile \ncrime are issues that we can bring this body together on in a \nbipartisan way to deal with. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The fastest growing area of crime in this country is \njuvenile crime, especially violent juvenile crime. I find it \ninteresting that if you access the NCIC or the III, the Interstate \nIdentification Index, to find out who is on there, who committed crimes \nin this country, what you find is some of the most violent crimes \ncommitted are not in those records because they are committed by a \njuvenile. You will not have access, as a judge or a police officer, by \naccessing the identification index.\n  One of the things we worked on for years is very simple, and we are \nnot there yet. It requires a lot of attention by Congress. That is \nhaving a computer system, so that on a computer in this country we have \nthe records of every convicted felon in America.\n  If the Senator from Oregon would go to a department store this \nafternoon to buy a shirt and use a credit card to buy a shirt, they \nwill take that credit card and run it through a little machine that is \nan imager that determines the magnetic strip on the card, and then in \n20 seconds they will tell the Senator from Oregon whether his credit \ncard is good or not. Let us assume the Senator from Oregon has a credit \ncard that is good. But immediately they will tell everyone, is this a \ngood credit card or is it not? Twenty seconds.\n  They can keep track of 200 million credit cards--more than 200 \nmillion credit cards--that way, and access in 20 seconds the credit \nstatus of someone going to buy a shirt. The question is this: Why do we \nnot have access, for the several millions of people who have committed \nviolent crimes in this country, to every criminal record that exists in \nAmerica for judges when they sentence, for law enforcement officials \nwhen they pick someone up on the streets, to determine, after a crime, \nis this a suspect? Is this someone who has committed three other \nviolent crimes?\n  The fact is, we have a system now in which about 80 percent of the \navailable criminal records are not available in the one criminal \njustice record system we have. I know the FBI and others will say, \n``Gee, this is a wonderful system. It works well.'' The fact is, a \nwhole lot of States do not participate in it or do not participate \nfully in it, and the system does not have a lot of the criminal records \nwe need.\n  To start addressing the crime issues, one of the first things we need \nto do is make sure we have a computer record of all convicted felons in \nthis country, know who they are, what they have done and where they \nhave done it, so that everyone--judges, law enforcement people and \nothers--will have access to it instantly, in a complete manner.\n  The other thing I say to the Senator from Oregon on other issues, the \ncentral issues for most families is, are we going to have a decent job? \nWill our kids have opportunities to get a decent job after they have \nhad an opportunity to go to a good school? Schools and jobs and your \nkids--that is what this is all about.\n  One of the things I would like to pass on the floor of the Senate is \nshutting down this insidious provision that says, ``Move your jobs and \nyour plants overseas. We will give you a tax break.'' I tried last year \nto do that. They turned it down. I was promised they would hold \nhearings. They have not, but we will do it again this year. If you \ncannot take the first baby step of shutting down the tax incentive that \nsays ``ship your jobs overseas and the American taxpayer will reward \nyou to the extent of $2.2 billion''--$2.2 billion--``reward those who \nship their jobs overseas,'' if we cannot shut that down, then, thinking \nhas stopped in the U.S. Congress, in my judgment.\n  Finally, I do not want to hold the Senator from Oregon up, but one of \nthe things I think is interesting, which this Congress ought to deal \nwith, is not just the trade deficit--which I will talk about next week \nwith some of my colleagues; I will introduce a piece of legislation on \nthe trade deficit--but the trade deficit, merchandise trade deficit \nenjoyed in this country is higher than the fiscal policy, different by \na substantial margin, and there is not a whisper of attention to it. \nBut you can only repay the trade deficit with a lower standard of \nliving in our country.\n  It is a threat to this country, and we must deal with it, not by \nshutting our borders, but by dealing with those countries with whom we \nhave large trade deficits, dealing with those circumstances where it is \nresulting in a substantial export of American jobs. We have a $170 \nbillion merchandise trade deficit, and this country has to\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nbegin to confront the question of why do we have that and what do we do \nabout it.\n  I wanted to mention one additional item today on the floor of the \nSenate. There was a story in the Washington Post this week that says, \n``Federal Reserve policymakers are watching wages for clues to whether \nthey need to raise interest rates again.'' Now, the point of this is \nthat Federal Reserve policymakers are watching wages. What is the \nmessage there? The message is that we better not see an increase in \nwages, we better not see something that is good for American families, \nor we will clamp down. That is the message.\n  Now, what does this mean? It is because the financial markets took it \non the chin last week. They said, ``A key factor was the report from \nthe Labor Department that average hourly earnings jumped .8 of a \npercent last month, the largest increase since 1982.''\n\n  What John Berry, the reporter, does not say, and they never say, is \nthat the increase in wages last month, which was a large jump, only \ntakes wages back to where they were last December. You do not get a \nreport in the Washington Post by Mr. Berry, month after month, that \ntalks about how far wages have come down, and if you take a look at the \ndrop of American wages month after month after month in real purchasing \npower, you do not see many stories or much in the headlines about that. \nBut have a spike up in wages in 1 month, only to take us back to where \nit was in December of last year, and all of a sudden the market and all \nthose who write about the market have an apoplectic seizure.\n  Every time you get a bit of good news for the family that maybe wages \nare stabilizing or going to start to come up just a little bit, what \nhappens? Wall Street does a somersault. Wall Street looks for a window \nto jump out of. The unemployment rate drops to its lowest level in 6 \nyears, a July 6 headline, ``Stocks, Bonds, Plunge on Jobs Report.'' \nUnemployment goes down, more people are working, it means the economy \nis better, and Wall Street says, ``Oh, my God, look what is happening \nto America. Woe are us. What on Earth is going to happen to our \ncountry? More people are working, and they are getting higher wages. \nAmerica must be going to hell in a handbasket. What on Earth is going \nto happen to our economy next?''\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This issue is really an interesting issue. I say, it seems \nto me, in today's economy we can have more noninflationary economic \ngrowth than you could in the past. You look at technology, for example, \nand technology is driving so much of today's economy. I think the \nSenator is making a very important point with respect to the role of \ngrowth and the Fed and the issues that, frankly, are not getting the \nkind of attention they ought to receive.\n  My sense has been the Government does not even really measure today's \nmodern economy in an accurate kind of way. I served on the Joint \nEconomic Committee for a period of time, and I was concerned that the \nBureau of Labor Statistics was not in a position to have the resources, \nit was not in a position to have the tools to really measure the modern \neconomy.\n  This whole idea about the relationship of inflation and growth, I \nthink, really needs a fresh look. My sense is that because of \ntechnology, we can have a higher degree of noninflationary economic \ngrowth than we could in the past. I look forward to working with the \nSenator on these issues.\n  I also say, once again, we are talking about something that is not a \npartisan kind of issue. Everybody in this body wants to make sure that \nwe grow the economy, that we incent the private sector in a way to have \ngood-paying jobs, and we do not want to fan the fires of inflation.\n  These are not partisan kinds of issues. The Senator, talking about \nwages and the Fed, he did not mention Democrats, he did not mention \nRepublicans. We are talking about kinds of approaches this body ought \nto be looking at in terms of the modern economy.\n  When I talk about noninflationary economic growth, I submit that what \nis driving it is the technological revolution, which, again, is not the \nspecial prerogative of Democrats or Republicans.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree. There are two things that drive it. One is the \ntechnological revolution and the second is the global economy. Two or 3 \nbillion new workers in the world are now eligible and able to compete \nin an open market, especially with the lower skilled American workers, \nthe bottom two-thirds of the American work force, and those 2 or 3 \nbillion people living elsewhere can make 10 cents an hour, 20 cents an \nhour, or 60 cents an hour. In many cases, what you have is 12-year-olds \nmaking 12 cents an hour, working 12 hours a day, competing against \nAmerican workers, which drives down American wages. When American wages \nstart to firm up a little bit, we simply climb back out of the hole to \nwhere we were last December, the stock market has a heart attack.\n  Let me go through a couple other headlines: ``Job and Wage Data Put \nPressure on Fed,'' July 8; ``Unemployment Rate Hits 6-Year Level While \nPay Posts Big Monthly Gains.'' Again, it just crawled back up to where \nit was the previous December. If you read this all in the Wall Street \nJournal, it would give you great cause for alarm if you are on Wall \nStreet and have another agenda. So what happens is the stock market and \nthe bond market has a seizure.\n  July 8, ``Jobs Data Sparks 115-Point Plunge.'' You would think maybe \nthe jobs data was that it showed America was in deep trouble, deep \nunemployment, headed toward a massive recession. That is not what the \njobs data was. The jobs data showed that fewer people were unemployed, \nmore people were employed and the economy was getting better. What \nhappens? A deep plunge in the stock market. News that even unemployment \nis at a 6-year low is not good news for Wall Street. NBC nightly news \nlead: ``The Economy Is Too Good for Markets.''\n\n  The data in February and March. ``Employment revealed increases in \njobs prompting steep sell-offs on Wall Street.''\n  ``Economy Surge Hailed by President, but Markets Fall.''\n  ``Wall Street plummeted Friday''--this is March--``and major sell-off \ntriggered by what seemed to be splendid economic news, a drop in \nunemployment, and the biggest jobs gain in more than a decade.''\n  February. ``When Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted \nin testimony that the economy could grow at a 2.5 percent rate this \nyear, the market gulped. The ensuing speculation sent the Dow Jones \ndown 45 points.''\n  Just to show that it is not all irrational, some of it is politics, \nthis says, ``Gingrich blames White House for stock market plunge.'' But \nthat is an aberration.\n  ``U.S. Stocks Make Steep One-Day Drop.'' This is October of last \nyear, on good economic news. But it is not all clearly irrational on \nthat side. You get good economic news, and Wall Street looks for a \nwindow to jump out of. It happens the other way as well. ``Last year, \nbonds rose after the Labor Department said Friday morning that \nunemployment claims had risen by 5,000 last week.'' So you had some bad \neconomic news, and Wall Street goes, ``Thank God, we got some bad \neconomic news. That is good news for us on Wall Street.''\n  What kind of twisted logic is this? Felix Rohatyn wrote a piece that \nI will send to my colleagues, in which he said that many corporate \nleaders agree and believe that it is a false choice in this country \nnow. Wall Street and the Fed, especially, have led us to believe that \nit is a false choice that we must choose between economic growth and \ninflation--a fundamentally false choice. But those who believe we must \nchoose between either growing as a country or inflation are the ones \nwho are causing us to drop anchor at the first hint of wind that gets \nin the sales of this economy. The first time the economy starts moving \na bit, it is time to drop anchor.\n  What does all that mean? It means that the ups and downs--this casino \nin which there is daily betting with trillions of dollars, where people \nmake money going up and make money going down, and people buy what they \nwill never get from people who never had it, and they make money on \nboth sides of the transaction--is all at the expense of working \nfamilies, who sit around eating supper asking themselves: Well,\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nwhat is our life like? What about us? What is the situation in my job? \nAm I being paid more or less? Am I making progress or falling behind? \nIs my wage up, or is it deteriorating? Is my job more or less secure? \nWhat about my child, who is ready to go to college? Is the economy \nexpanding sufficiently so that that child is going to have an \nopportunity to get some interviews and maybe have a choice of a job or \ntwo?\n  That is the central question. Those who believe they should scare \nthis country into accepting a rate of economic growth of 2 or 2.5 \npercent, and decide that the standard practice in this country is to \nrevel in bad economic news and despair in good economic news, have done \na real disservice to the potential of this country's economy. Felix \nRohatyn is fundamentally right. It is a false choice for us now in the \nglobal economy when wages have been going down, not up, to say that we \nmust choose between economic growth or more inflation.\n  I do not want more inflation. I do not think it serves this country's \ninterest. Inflation has been coming down for 5 years in a row. If you \nbelieve Alan Greenspan, that the consumer price index overstates \ninflation by a percent and a half, we have almost no inflation in \nAmerica today. Yet, we have all these micromanagers who see themselves \nin the hold or the engine room of a ship of state, operating the \ncontrols to try to slow the ship down. My Uncle Joe could slow the ship \ndown. If that is the job description of the Fed for serving on Wall \nStreet, my Uncle Joe can do that job. I want this country to have an \neconomy that expands and produces more jobs and better wages.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I share the Senator's interest in this Rohatyn analysis. \nWhat is interesting is that there really is a link between the growth \nissue and those concerns of working families that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is right to zero in on.\n  There was a study a couple of weeks ago, a Census Bureau study, that \nshowed that the gap between those at the very top and those at the \nbottom is widening again and, well, it confirms what a lot of us \nsuspected. But there was also another study that did not get the \nattention, frankly, it should have, which said that the education gap \nis widening between folks at the top and folks at the bottom.\n  So there really is a link, a kind of interdependence between the \nissues that the Senator is talking about. We ought to be looking at a \nnoninflationary economic growth rate that I think is increased beyond \nwhere we are today. I think we can get it if Democrats and Republicans \nin this body come together and pass the kind of policies that will \ncomplement that.\n  For example, if you want to attack that education gap, which was the \nstudy I mentioned last week, which complemented what the Census \nDepartment said, education is really the key. A lot of us here have \nsaid that what we ought to do, on a bipartisan basis, is say that when \nworking families are making payments for college or vocational \neducation, let us make that tax deductible. Let us let them write that \noff, so that we have a tax cut geared directly toward working families \ntrying to deal with that wage crunch that the Senator from North Dakota \nis talking about. It gives us an opportunity to have the kind of growth \nthat Felix Rohatyn and others are talking about.\n  I think the Senator is very much on target in bringing these issues \nup. There certainly is not anything partisan about these kinds of \nquestions. I hope that as we go into the last few weeks of the session, \nthis is the kind of approach we should take. I thank the Senator for \nletting me work with him on this morning's discussion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, Senator \nWyden, for coming this morning, as well as Senator Conrad and Senator \nFord. Again, what he said last is, I think, most important. The Senate \nwill work its will on issues. But we cannot have a circumstance where \nwe are told we have made the decision in some room someplace, and we \nare bringing it to the floor, and we are cutting off your right to \ndebate it and accept it, or else. That is not the way the Senate can \nwork.\n  Most of us are anxious to work with the majority to get things done. \nI say that, despite the anxiety of the end of the week on the \nlegislation that was pending, this was actually a pretty productive \nweek in the Senate. We passed some very substantial pieces of \nlegislation dealing with the minimum wage, with small business \nregulatory issues, and tax issues that will be very helpful to small \nbusiness. The Defense authorization bill was passed on final passage. \nThis was actually a productive week. I hope future weeks will be as \nproductive. Our intention is to work, in a serious and conscientious \nway, with the majority. But we will not be rolled over by people who \ninsist on doing things that prevent us from being part of the debate. \nThat is a message that they need to understand, and I hope they will \nunderstand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Alaska, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7806-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF LEE SCHOENHARD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nLeland ``Lee'' Schoenhard, a good friend and one of the most charitable \nmen South Dakota has ever known.\n  At the age of 4, Lee Schoenhard moved with his family to South Dakota \nin 1924. At the young age of 17, he moved to Chamberlain, SD, to begin \na career in farming. He would change careers often in life. At \ndifferent times, he made a living in the construction, trucking, and \nthe lumber businesses. In 1965, he built and opened Lee's Motor Inn, a \n60-unit motel that is still one of the finest places to stay in Central \nSouth Dakota. From 1973 to 1977, he owned and operated the Missouri \nValley Grain Co. as well as a feed lot in central South Dakota that fed \nover 80,000 cattle. Lee's hard work and keen sense of business turned \nalmost every opportunity he encountered into a success. Despite having \nattained only a sixth grade education, he became one of the most \nsuccessful and wealthy businessmen in the State of South Dakota.\n  But, Lee Schoenhard's wealth extended far beyond his earnings.\n  After he passed away last month, Lee was remembered, not as a man of \nriches but rather as a man of compassion, and the fond recollections of \nthe people he helped will forever remain the most powerful public \nstatement that can be made about his life. People will remember him \ndriving over 18,000 miles in 4 months to raise money for a hospital in \nLyman County. They will remember the 22 carloads of scrap iron and the \n500 carloads of wheat straw that he bought and delivered to the Army \nfor material purposes in World War II. They will remember the $9,000 he \ngave every year in scholarships for area school children, and the $1 \nmillion foundation he created to fund community projects in his \nhometown and surrounding areas. Through these and other numerous gifts, \nhis wealth will continue to help South Dakotans into the next century, \nand it is in these acts of kindness that the memory of Lee Schoenhard \nwill continue to live.\n  I will remember Lee Schoenhard as a dear friend, and can truly say he \nwas among the wisest and most caring men I have known. He embodied the \nSouth Dakota spirit with a kind and honest heart, and we will all miss \nhim greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7813-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7813-S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SAUDI ARABIA BOMBING\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a disturbing trend I \nsee arising in the aftermath of the terrorist killing of our military \npersonnel in Saudi Arabia. I am concerned because I believe we may be \ndeveloping a response that plays right into the terrorists' hands.\n  I frankly question some of the responses coming out of the Congress. \nSome of these responses neglect answering the fundamental question: Why \ndid the terrorists choose to kill Americans in Dhahran on June 25, \n1996? This question is fundamental because if you answer it, you will \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\nreach some conclusions about the right and wrong response to the \nbombing.\n  I say to my colleagues, in order to understand the next steps we \nshould be taking as a nation, you must try to put yourself in the mind \nof the terrorists to determine what they want. Based on all of the \nrhetoric and the history of terrorism in this region, there are, in my \nview, as least three things the terrorists want to have happen as a \nresult of their attacks. First, they want to divide Saudi Arabia from \nthe United States. Second, they want to force the United States out of \nSaudi Arabia. Third, they want to make it more difficult for the United \nStates to deploy its forces overseas.\n  If these are in fact the goals of the terrorists, and I believe they \nare, some reactions in Congress and the media are playing right into \nthe terrorists' hands. I have heard implications that cast doubt on the \ncompetence of the military chain of command to protect the troops. I \nhave heard doubt cast on the sincerity and willingness of an important \nally to cooperate with the United States. I have heard speculation \nabout the stability of the government of that important ally. If I were \nthe terrorist, I'd be pleased at these reactions and be confident that \none more spectacular attack might just be good enough to finish the job \nand drive the Americans out of the region.\n  I say to my colleagues, these are not the appropriate responses when \nwe are at war. And believe me, whoever they may be, the terrorists have \ndeclared war on the United States. And I think we can all agree, when \nwe are at war, the appropriate response is not to do what your enemy \nwants.\n  The appropriate response is to support our military and its \ncommanders. The appropriate response is to praise the airmen at Al \nKhobar Towers for the dedication and alertness which prevented greater \ncasualties in the attack. The appropriate response is to pile on all of \nthe intelligence and war-fighting resources we can marshal so as to put \nthe perpetrators out of business and to punish their state sponsor, if \nwe find one. The appropriate response is to be sure our troops enjoy \nthe maximum protection consistent with the mission. The appropriate \nresponse is to continue with our vital mission in Saudi Arabia.\n  Mr. President, we should be making it clear, right now, the United \nStates is angry. But we are not angry because a barrier was too close \nto a building. We should be making it very clear we are angry because \nsomeone attacked us. That someone should understand they are the focus \nof our anger, not our military commanders. We should be confirming our \ncommitment the United States will not leave Saudi Arabia. We should \nmake sure our enemy understands they will be punished and their \norganization will be destroyed. And this will happen to them no matter \nhow far we have to go our how long it takes.\n  We Americans proved during Desert Storm that we will support a 72-\nhour war. We now need to prove we will support a war that lasts 72 \nweeks--or however long it takes to defeat this enemy.\n  The nervousness over vulnerabilities, the second-guessing of the \nchain of command, the search for an exit strategy should be going on in \nthe terrorists' lair--not in the United States. Let's focus the anger \nwhere it belongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7813-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLAWED ELECTIONS IN NIGER\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, early this week, the people of the \nRepublic of Niger were denied their right to choose their own \nleadership and control their destiny. I want to express my deep \ndisappointment in the Nigerian elections and in the military regime \nthat chose to retain power through fraud and intimidation rather than \nhonor its word to hold free and fair elections.\n  In January, immediately after Gen. Ibrahim Barre Mainassara deposed \nNiger's democratically elected president in a military coup, he pledged \nto return the country to democracy as soon as possible. At that time, \nthe United States rejected the use of military solutions for political \nproblems by suspending bilateral development and military assistance, \nas well as support for Niger in multilateral financial institutions. We \nurged Barre to keep his word and encouraged the military government to \nreestablish democracy quickly and transparently.\n  Balloting started on Sunday, despite the fact that the Independent \nElectoral Commission had twice requested a postponement in order to \nensure that accurate voter lists and voter cares were in place. General \nBarre rejected these requests and, instead, extended the voting through \nMonday. On this second day of balloting, the general deployed security \nforces to the homes of his opponents, shut down private radio \nstations--including the Voice of America affiliate--and dissolved the \nIndependent Electoral Commission.\n  Barre appointed a new commission which declared him the winner only \nhours later. Quickly after that declaration all demonstrations and \npublic assemblies were banned. Political leaders are under house \narrest, and political activists are being detained.\n  Mr. President, I join with the administration and other members of \nthe international community in condemning these recent events. The age \nof accepting military coups and authoritarian regimes in Africa is \nover. France, with its unique influence in Niger, can have an \nespecially powerful voice in articulating this message. For this \nreason, it is particularly disturbing that the bilateral French \ndelegation on the ground claimed that, by Nigerian standards, this \nweekend's election was a sound one.\n  In this era of change and growth throughout much of the African \nContinent, Niger now stands out as a country moving against the tide of \nopenness and progress. Development and economic growth cannot be \nachieved in a climate of instability, and human potential cannot be \nrealized in an atmosphere of fear. If the people of Niger are to find \ntheir much-deserved place among the emerging markets and developing \nnations of Africa, Niger must return to democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7814-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7814-S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REPUBLICAN BUDGET SUPPORTS STUDENT AID\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I would like to express my \ncontinued support for Federal student financial aid programs. I relied \non student loans to fund my college education at the University of \nSouth Dakota, so I understand the importance of these loans for \nstudents and families. Low income levels should not deny young people \nthe opportunity to achieve their dream of a college education. Programs \nsuch as Stafford loans, Pell Grants, and work study programs enable \nyoung people to fulfill that dream and pursue their ultimate dreams of \npersonal and professional success.\n  One of the great challenges for American families is the rising cost \nof a college education. For the past two decades, tuition costs have \nrisen twice as fast as inflation. Financial aid has not kept pace with \nthese soaring price increases. The result? More and more students and \ntheir families are struggling to pay for college today. In my home \nState of South Dakota, 83 percent of students attending public colleges \nreceive some type of Federal financial aid. As the number of students \nreceiving loans continues to grow, the overall student aid debt \naccumulates along with it. Even more of a concern, the rising cost of \ntuition increases the size of the debt students pay off after college. \nSouth Dakota students now graduate with an average debt of more than \n$10,000. This means that college graduates are forced to divert a \nhigher share of their earnings in order to pay off their student debts.\n  Students struggle to find ways to pay off these huge debts. \nIncreasingly, they work while attending school. This trend tends to \ndeflate the student's educational experience.\n  I am pleased the Republican budget that passed Congress earlier this \nyear would respond to these trends. The budget includes responsible, \ncost-efficient reforms to student financial aid programs. These \nprograms can be improved without harming the actual aid levels that \nstudents depend on. Reform can be achieved by eliminating small, \nspecialized scholarship programs and Federal bureaucracy.\n  Unfortunately, liberal interests have tried to use the issue of \nstudent financial aid to their benefit. They have used false propaganda \nto scare young people and their parents. I urge Americans to look at \nthe facts, not the falsehoods. The Republican plan for student aid \nwould increase the amount of aid available to students, while \ndownsizing inefficient Federal bureaucracy.\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\n  The Republican budget for student financial aid would do three \nthings. First, it would increase the maximum Pell Grant level to \n$2,470--the highest level ever. Second, it would maintain current \nfunding levels for the Federal Work-Study Program and the supplemental \neducation opportunity grants. Lastly, it would maintain the in-school \ninterest subsidy and postgraduation grace period for all students. I am \nproud we were able to maintain this funding during these tough budget \ntimes. Student aid is a priority in this Congress.\n  We could provide more for student aid if we abolished the Clinton \nadministration's wasteful, expensive direct lending program. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers would save more \nthan $1.5 billion over 7 years if the direct lending program were \nabolished.\n\n  Faceless bureaucrats in Washington are not able to provide students \nand families in South Dakota with the same personal service offered by \nhometown banks and credit unions. This is just common sense. The people \nof South Dakota greatly prefer one-on-one consultation with a small \nbank or credit union in their hometown, not the endless maze of redtape \nthat accompanies the direct-lending program. This is another example of \nhow the Clinton administration believes big government is the answer \nand should be involved in our daily lives.\n  Frankly the single best way to show our support for student financial \naid programs and most importantly, for our children, is to balance the \nbudget and reduce the massive national debt. These issues are entwined. \nYoung people today stand to inherit the responsibility of the national \ndebt, which now totals $5 trillion. Interest payments on the debt alone \nare a considerable burden--more than $200 billion each year and rising. \nAs the interest grows, it diverts Federal resources from programs like \nstudent financial aid. A balanced budget would protect worthwhile \nGovernment programs, reduce the debt and the size of interest payments. \nJust as important, it would lower overall interest rates, and increase \nmore jobs. This means college graduates would have an easier time to \nfind that first job, buy that first home, pay off their student loans, \nand provide for their children.\n  I believe the continuation of student financial aid programs is \nvital. These programs not only give students the opportunity to receive \nan education that is essential in today's society, but they also allow \nAmerica to keep a competitive edge in competition in our increasingly \nglobal economy. It is essential that the U.S. work force be an educated \none that is ready to compete with other countries of the world. \nProviding adequate financial support for students will achieve this \nessential goal. Young people should have the opportunity to fulfill \ntheir potential and achieve their dreams.\n  I will continue fighting for affordable, accessible student financial \naid programs and to secure a better future for the young people of \nSouth Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7814-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove the quality of coastal recreation waters, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n   THE BEACHES ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT, CLOSURE AND HEALTH ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Beaches \nEnvironmental Assessment, Closure, and Health [BEACH] Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, coastal tourism generates billions of dollars every \nyear for local communities nationwide. Moreover, our coastal areas \nprovide immeasurable benefits for millions of Americans who want to \nbuild sand castles, cool off in the water, take a walk with that \nspecial someone, or just relax. New Jersey's tourism sector is the \nsecond largest revenue-producing industry in the State. Without a \ndoubt, the lure of my State's beaches generates most of this revenue--\nover $7 billion annually.\n  Mr. President, alarmingly, this heavily used natural resource can \nactually pose a threat to human health if it is not properly managed. \nStudies conducted during the past two decades show a definite \nrelationship between the amount of indicator bacteria in coastal waters \nand the incidence of swimming-associated illnesses.\n  Viruses are believed to be the major cause of swimming-associated \ndiseases--gastroenteritis and hepatitis are the most common ones \nworldwide. And because an individual afflicted with these diseases is \ncontagious to others in his or her household, the risk of sewage-borne \nillness does not end with the bather. Additional diseases that can be \ncontracted by swimmers include an infection caused by the toxigenic \nbacteria E. coli--the bacteria found in Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers \nwhich caused an outbreak of illnesses a few years ago.\n  Yet many current, EPA approved techniques to measure marine water \nquality appear to underestimate the true number of viable pathogens \nthat are entering the marine environment. Existing EPA guidelines allow \nStates to decide whether their beach waters are safe for swimming based \non monthly averages. Waters may appear safe in the long term, but \nshort-term violations of the public health standard go unrecognized.\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n  The existing EPA guidelines are not useful for decisionmakers, who \nneed to decide whether they should allow people to swim at the beach \ntomorrow or during the coming weekend. Using monthly water quality \naverages to determine if the beach is safe for swimming is like taking \na patient's temperature average over a week to see if the patient is \nsick. The patient's average temperature could be just about normal. But \nin the meantime, the patient could die. EPA must develop new standards \nbecause existing EPA guidelines simply fall short.\n  While some States use these inadequate EPA guidelines, others have no \nprograms for regularly monitoring their beachwater for swimmer safety. \nIn a report released today, Testing the Waters: Who Knows What You're \nGetting Into, the Natural Resources Defense Council [NRDC] found that \nonly five States--New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, and \nIndiana--comprehensively monitor their beaches, and a mere five States \nconsistently close beaches every time bacteria water quality standards \nare violated. Additionally, NRDC found that a high-bacteria level can \ncause a beach closure in one State while in another State people may be \nallowed to swim in the water despite equal health risks. This \ndiscrepancy among coastal States threatens public health.\n  The NRDC report also found that high levels of bacteria in coastal \nwaters--primarily from raw human sewage--are responsible for the \noverwhelming majority of beach closures and advisories in the United \nStates. In 1995, U.S. ocean, bay, and Great Lakes beaches were closed, \nor advisories were issued against swimming, on more than 3,522 \noccasions.\n  New Jersey has been aggressive when it comes to protecting public \nhealth at the beach. New Jersey is the only State to have a mandatory \nbeach protection program that includes a bacteria standard, a \nmonitoring program, and mandatory beach closure requirements when the \nbacteria standard is exceeded. The program is designed to address water \nquality from both a health and an environmental perspective. Beaches \nare closed when bacteria levels exceed the standard regardless of the \npollution source.\n  Ironically, New Jersey suffers because it does more to protect public \nhealth. In some years, annual losses from beach closures in New Jersey \nhave ranged from $800 million to $1 billion.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will address the uneven coastal \ncommitment to protect beach goers by establishing uniform testing and \nmonitoring procedures for pathogens and floatables in marine recreation \nwaters. This bill also requires EPA to establish a nationwide public \nhealth standard for determining when States should notify the public of \nhealth risks due to pathogen contaminated waters.\n  This bill requires the EPA to establish procedures to monitor coastal \nwaters to detect short-term increases in pathogenicity and to set \nminimum standards to protect the public from pathogen contaminated \nbeach waters. And it will assure that the public is notified when beach \nwaters exceed the standards and public health may be at risk.\n  Whether they're in the Carolinas or in California, in New Jersey or \nNew York, people across the country have a right to know when the water \nis and is not safe to swim in. Beach goers should be able to wade or \nswim in the surf without the fear of getting sick. Going to the beach \nshould be a healthy and rejuvenating experience. A day at the beach \nshouldn't be followed by a day at the doctor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nimportance of protecting public health at our Nation's beaches by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Beaches Environmental \n     Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's beaches are a valuable public resource \n     used for recreation by millions of people annually;\n       (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many out-of-\n     State and international visitors;\n       (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of \n     dollars annually;\n       (4) increased population has contributed to the decline in \n     the environmental quality of coastal waters;\n       (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State \n     and other political boundaries;\n       (6) each coastal State has its own method of testing the \n     quality of its coastal recreation waters, providing varying \n     degrees of protection to the public; and\n       (7) the adoption of standards by coastal States for \n     monitoring the quality of coastal recreation waters, and the \n     posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during \n     periods when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public \n     health and safety.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require uniform \n     procedures for beach testing and monitoring to protect public \n     safety and improve the environmental quality of coastal \n     recreation waters.\n\n     SEC. 3. WATER QUALITY CRITERIA AND STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Issuance of Criteria.--Section 304(a) of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Coastal recreation waters.--(A) The Administrator, \n     after consultation with appropriate Federal and State \n     agencies and other interested persons, shall issue within 18 \n     months after the effective date of this paragraph (and review \n     and revise from time to time thereafter, but in no event less \n     than once every 5 years) water quality criteria for pathogens \n     in coastal recreation waters. Such criteria shall--\n       ``(i) be based on the best available scientific \n     information;\n       ``(ii) be sufficient to protect public health and safety in \n     case of any reasonably anticipated exposure to pollutants as \n     a result of swimming, bathing, or other body contact \n     activities; and\n       ``(iii) include specific numeric criteria calculated to \n     reflect public health risks from short-term increases in \n     pathogens in coastal recreation waters resulting from \n     rainfall, malfunctions of wastewater treatment works, and \n     other causes.\n       ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `coastal \n     recreation waters' means Great Lakes and marine coastal \n     waters commonly used by the public for swimming, bathing, or \n     other similar primary contact purposes.''.\n       (b) Standards.--\n       (1) Adoption by states.--A State shall adopt water quality \n     standards for coastal recreation waters which, at a minimum, \n     are consistent with the criteria published by the \n     Administrator under section 304(a)(9) of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(9)), as amended by \n     this Act, not later than 3 years following the date of such \n     publication. Such water quality standards shall be developed \n     in accordance with the requirements of section 303(c) of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(c)). A \n     State shall incorporate such standards into all appropriate \n     programs into which such State would incorporate other water \n     quality standards adopted under section 303(c) of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(c)).\n       (2) Failure of states to adopt.--If a State has not \n     complied with paragraph (1) by the last day of the 3-year \n     period beginning on the date of publication of criteria under \n     section 304(a)(9) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(9)), as amended by this Act, the water \n     quality criteria issued by the Administrator under such \n     section shall become applicable as the water quality \n     standards for coastal recreational waters for the State. The \n     State shall use the standards issued by the Administrator in \n     implementing all programs for which water quality standards \n     for coastal recreation waters are used.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to ensure the competitiveness of the United States \ntextile and apparel industry; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         THE CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AND MARKET ACCESS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that is \nbadly needed by the American textile and apparel industry and its \nworkers. It complements an effort in the other body spearheaded by John \nSpratt of South Carolina and supported by over 100 Members of the \nHouse. My legislation is aimed at opening markets around the world and \nat enforcing the rules of the road that govern trade in textile goods. \nBroadly speaking, it will do so in four ways.\n  First, by extending the same authority that now exists for enforcing \nintellectual property rights to opening markets for U.S. textile and \napparel products. Second, by supporting U.S. textile and apparel \nproducers in their ongoing efforts to modernize and become more \ninternationally competitive. Third, by strengthening U.S. laws against \nillegal trading practices like piracy, undervaluation, and \ntransshipment in the textile and apparel area. And lastly, by beefing \nup the ability of the U.S. Government to enforce its trade laws and \ntrade agreements.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, Congress passed the GATT implementing \nbill which will end all limits on textile imports by the year 2005. Our \ntextile and apparel industry, which argued for a longer phase-out \nperiod, very reluctantly accepted this outcome.\n  The industry accepted this outcome because it had already made a \ncommitment to compete in the global economy. Our textile and apparel \nindustry has invested billions of dollars in becoming more \ncompetitive--about $12 billion just since the GATT implementing bill \nwas passed.\n  They've supported the aggressive efforts of the President and USTR to \nopen markets to American products. And our industry has committed to \nexporting.\n  But what happens when American textile and apparel producers go to \nforeign markets to sell their products? Too often, they find a closed \ndoor. Worse still, those same countries that ship the most to the \nUnited States are often the ones whose markets are closed to U.S. \nproducts. China, for example, which is our No. 1 source of textile and \napparel imports, shipped $6.6 billion worth of textile and apparel \ngoods in 1995, but allowed the sale of only $63 million of United \nStates goods. Likewise, our textile and apparel exports to India and \nPakistan were just $19 million last year, while those two countries \nsent us $2.8 billion worth of textile goods.\n  Clearly, we can't tell our industry to sell its products overseas if \noverseas markets are closed to American goods. My bill will help by \nrequiring that textile agreements include specific market access \ncommitments and by providing for a regular evaluation of the market \naccess given to U.S. products.\n  Mr. President, nearly 1.5 million Americans are employed directly in \nthe textile and apparel industries, about 40,000 of them in my State of \nKentucky. American textile and apparel workers are among the most \nproductive in the world and make some of the finest goods anywhere. \nUnfortunately, during 1995, 150,000 of those workers lost their jobs, \ndue in large part to surging levels of textile imports. Most of these \nworkers live in rural areas where jobs, particularly good jobs, are not \nalways easy to come by. For those workers, when the local textile mill \nor apparel facility closes, there simply aren't other jobs.\n  Now, it's bad enough that many of those imports and lost jobs are due \nto trade agreements that we should not have passed, like the NAFTA. But \nwhat's much worse is the fact that thousands upon thousands of jobs are \nlost because of illegal textile imports. This bill will give the \nCustoms Service badly needed tools to fight against textile and apparel \ntransshipments and counterfeit textile goods. And, it will raise the \npenalty for those who break our laws in textile trade.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank those Senators who have agreed to join \nme in\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nintroducing this important legislation. I am particularly pleased that \nwe have been able to work on this in a bipartisan fashion, as we have \nso many times in the past on the issues that affect our textile and \napparel workers.\n  This bill is not about protectionism. It's not about special favors \nfor a particular industry. It's about basic fairness in how we trade \nwith other nations. It's about enforcing our trade laws and standing up \nfor American textile and apparel workers.\n  Mr. President, my bill's message is a simple one: Our textile and \napparel industry and its workers are ready to compete. We should pass \nthe Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act this year to make sure \nthey can compete, both here in the United States and in markets around \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the \nRecord at this time, along with the cosponsorship of Mr. Hollings, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Warner, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Cohen, and \nMr. Byrd, and that it be referred to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record \nremain open until the close of business today so that other Senators \nmay add their names to the bill as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1951\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Customs Enforcement and \n     Market Access Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the textile and apparel industry is a key part of the \n     United States manufacturing base and the third largest \n     manufacturing sector in the United States economy;\n       (2) textile and apparel facilities are often located in \n     economically sensitive regions;\n       (3) the industry has demonstrated an ability to compete in \n     the global economy where market access is available;\n       (4) the domestic textile and apparel industry has committed \n     significant resources to be competitive and productive;\n       (5) workers in the industry make the highest quality \n     textile and apparel goods in the world and are the world's \n     most productive;\n       (6) the industry is preparing to compete in the world \n     market without the protection of import quotas authorized by \n     the Multifiber Arrangement; and\n       (7) United States trade policy should be oriented toward \n     expanding exports and ensuring that United States trade laws \n     are vigorously enforced.\n       (8) The Committee for the Implementation of Textile \n     Agreements, the Office of Textiles, Apparel, and Consumer \n     Goods of the Department of Commerce, and the Ambassador for \n     Textiles and Apparel in the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative--\n       (A) play central and indispensable roles in administering \n     the laws governing trade in textile and apparel goods;\n       (B) have diligently carried out laws enacted by the \n     Congress and under powers delegated to them by the President; \n     and\n       (C) have acted in accordance with United States and \n     international law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Any determination by CITA under the preceding \n     sentence shall be made in accordance with the standards set \n     forth in section 8.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, a reduction \n     in a country's textile and apparel quotas is a reduction in \n     quantitative limitations otherwise applicable to imports into \n     the United States of that country's textile and apparel \n     products that is equal to--\n       (1) the quantity of the goods involved in the circumvention \n     if the circumvention is the first within the most recent 36-\n     month period;\n       (2) twice the quantity of goods involved in the \n     circumvention if the circumvention is the second in the most \n     recent 36-month period; or\n       (3) three times the quantity of goods involved in the \n     circumvention if the circumvention is the third or more in \n     the most recent 36-month period.\n       (c) Policy for WTO Members.--In any case in which a WTO \n     member is found by CITA to have circumvented the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing or any other textile agreement, CITA \n     shall pursue the maximum penalty consistent with the WTO.\n\n     SEC. 7. CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT ACTION.\n\n       (a) Sharing of Customs Information With CITA.--The Customs \n     Service shall, upon initiating an investigation relating to a \n     violation of the laws of the United States governing \n     international trade in textile and apparel goods, inform CITA \n     of the investigation in any case in which the alleged \n     violation, if true, would constitute a circumvention of any \n     textile agreement. In any such case, the Customs Service \n     shall provide to CITA--\n       (1) all information CITA requests that is relevant to the \n     alleged violation and required in order for CITA to pursue a \n     charge against the quotas on imports of textile and apparel \n     products of that country as a result of the violation; and\n       (2) notification, at least every 30 days until the \n     investigation is referred to the Department of Justice or the \n     Customs Service closes the investigation, of the progress of \n     the investigation.\n       (b) Factors in Proceeding With Charges Against Quotas.--In \n     deciding whether to pursue a charge described in subsection \n     (a)\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n     as a result of an alleged violation described in subsection \n     (a), CITA, in addition to any other relevant factors which \n     CITA may consider, shall weigh the impact of proceeding with \n     such charge on potential prosecutions or civil penalties and \n     future enforcement of textile agreements, and shall consider \n     the amount of the alleged violation, the probability of \n     successful criminal prosecution, the degree of compliance by \n     the true country of origin with textile agreements, and the \n     damage the alleged violation would inflict on the domestic \n     textile and apparel industry.\n       (c) Decision Not To Pursue a Charge.--In any case in which \n     CITA decides under subsection (b) not to pursue a charge, the \n     Customs Service shall, as long as that decision is in effect, \n     report to CITA, in lieu of the reports under subsection \n     (a)(2)--\n       (1) at least once every 6 months from the date on which the \n     Customs Service initiated the case, on the status of the \n     investigation; and\n       (2) within 10 business days after the Customs Service \n     obtains new information or evidence materially relevant to \n     the alleged violation.\n       (d) Standing Not Provided.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to provide standing in any court or administrative \n     proceeding for legal action against the United States arising \n     from actions taken in carrying out the laws governing trade \n     in textile or apparel goods.\n       (e) Referral of Cases to Department of Justice.--In any \n     case in which--\n       (1) the Customs Service refers an alleged violation \n     described in subsection (a) to the Department of Justice for \n     prosecution, and\n       (2) no indictment has been brought in the case within 6 \n     months after the referral,\n\n     the Attorney General shall provide to CITA all information \n     relevant to imposing a charge against the quotas on imports \n     of textile and apparel products of the country concerned as a \n     result of the violation. CITA may extend the 6-month period \n     referred to in paragraph (2) if requested to do so by the \n     Attorney General.\n       (f) Disclosure of Certain Confidential Information Not \n     Required.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     require the disclosure by the Customs Service or the \n     Department of Justice of confidential information relevant to \n     possible imposition of criminal or civil penalties when that \n     information is not relevant to the imposition of a charge by \n     CITA against the quotas on imports of textile and apparel \n     products of a country.\n       (g) Initiation of Investigations.--\n       (1) Basis for initiation.--Subject to paragraph (2), \n     whenever the Customs Service receives credible evidence that \n     circumvention of a textile agreement has occurred, the \n     Customs Service shall initiate an investigation, to which a \n     customs officer shall be assigned, to determine if such \n     circumvention has occurred, unless such evidence is directly \n     related to an open investigation commenced prior to the \n     receipt of such evidence.\n       (2) Waiver.--The head of the Division of Textile \n     Enforcement established under section 10 may determine not to \n     initiate an investigation under paragraph (1) if he or she \n     transmits to CITA a report setting forth the reasons for that \n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 8. STANDARDS OF PROOF.\n\n       (a) In General.--CITA may determine that a country has \n     circumvented a textile agreement if CITA determines, after \n     consultations with the country concerned, that there is a \n     substantial likelihood that the circumvention occurred.\n       (b) Failure of Country to Cooperate.--\n       (1) Reliance on best available information.--If a country \n     fails to cooperate with CITA in an investigation to determine \n     if a textile agreement has been circumvented, CITA shall base \n     its determination on the best available information.\n       (2) Acts constituting failure to cooperate.--Acts \n     indicating failure of a country to cooperate under paragraph \n     (1) include, but are not limited to--\n       (A) denying entry of officials of the Customs Service to \n     investigate violations of, or promote compliance with, any \n     textile agreement;\n       (B) providing appropriate United States officials with \n     inaccurate or incomplete information, including information \n     demonstrating compliance with United States rules of origin \n     for textile and apparel products; and\n       (C) denying appropriate United States officials access to \n     information or documentation relating to production capacity \n     of, and outward processing done by, manufacturers within the \n     country.\n\n     SEC. 9.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on October 1, 1996.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of \nmy good friend from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and the tireless efforts of \nmy colleague in the House, Congressman John Spratt. Mr. President, in \nthe last year alone we have lost over 150,000 jobs in the textile and \napparel industry. Just last week, Springs Industries announced it would \nclose several plants and lay off 850 employees.\n  Our trade deficit in textiles and apparel stands at an appalling $35 \nbillion.\n  As bad as that number is, the sad fact is that $35 billion \nunderestimates the true size of the trade deficit. Because of the \nmassive amounts of transhipment that have flooded our shores, the \nactual trade deficit is some $6 billion larger. What is left of the \nquota system has become a porous sieve, subject to the manipulation of \nshady importers and retailers who look the other way at fraudulent \nschemes designed to evade our quota system, and steal jobs from the \nAmerican worker.\n  The legislation being introduced will shut down the illegal evasion \nof our quotas. It slaps harsh penalties on customs offenders, and it \nprovides customs with adequate resources to enforce our textile \nagreements.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the administration to crack down \non this lawless behavior and stand up for the American worker.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is important legislation that will be \nbeneficial to an enormous number of Americans because it will open \nforeign markets to U.S. products and countries that engage in dishonest \nactivities in international trade. Those that violate trade laws and \ntrade agreements will pay for it. This bill establishes a level playing \nfield for U.S. textile companies and takes an unmistakable stand for \nAmerican workers. If foreign markets can be opened, and U.S. trade with \ncountries overseas increased, it will be a tremendous boost for U.S. \njobs.\n  Mr. President, the economic name of the game as we approach the 21st \ncentury lies in increasing our exports.\n  This bill addresses a pressing need. American workers, as matters now \nstand, are being squeezed from every direction. Many countries, \nespecially Mainland China, are deliberately violating their trade \nagreements; they are transshipping their goods through other nations \ndeliberately to circumvent United States textile import laws. American \nworkers should not be forced to compete against foreign companies that \ndeliberately engage in illegal and immoral trade practices.\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n  Such countries, Communist China, India, Macau, Hong Kong, to name a \nfew, pump billions of dollars of products into our markets, cheating \nevery step of the way. The Winston-Salem Journal pointed out the other \nday that the United States Customs Service estimates that China alone \nillegally transships $4 to $6 billion per year. This banditry costs \nAmerican businesses--and, therefore, consumers--up to $4 billion a \nyear, not to mention the loss of countless thousands of American jobs.\n  Mr. President, S. 1951--the Textile and Apparel Global \nCompetitiveness Act of 1996--will, when it becomes law, impose stiff \nsanctions on countries that transship textile products into the United \nStates. Current penalties will be doubled--in some cases tripled--and \nmore reliable proof of the country of origin will be required for \ntextile imports entering the United States. S. 1951 enables the Customs \nService to seize goods imported illegally by the use of false or \nmisleading statements or acts.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill S. 1951, of which I am a principal \ncosponsor, is about fair trade and reciprocity. Since U.S. markets are \nopen, it is only fair to demand that other countries open their \nmarkets. As matters now stand countless countries close their markets \nto American products while pouring their exports through our open \ndoors. China, Pakistan, and India together ship 9.4 billion dollars' \nworth of goods to United States markets--more than 100 times the $92 \nmillion in United States goods that were, at last reports, allowed into \ntheir countries.\n  S. 1951, when enacted, will require United States negotiators to \nsecure effective access to foreign markets for United States textile \nand apparel products; in other words, it will press open markets of \ncountries that have shut their doors in Uncle Sam's face. If we are \ngoing to be hospitable to foreign imports, it's only fair to require \nthe same of them. One specific benefit of this bill is that it will \ndeny to China the free trade benefits of the World Trade Organization \nuntil China dismantles her iron fence against United States textiles. \nChina must not be permitted to hold membership in the WTO until China \nremoves her arrogant trade barriers.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, Communist China competes with American \nworkers with unspeakable use of slave labor and child labor. Chinese \nslave laborers are often political prisoners. Exploitation of children \nas workers is rampant, especially in Asia.\n  Mr. President, the United States must never forget that we become a \npart of what we condone. Therefore, the need for this bill is obvious \nin the light of the tremendous loss of U.S. jobs inflicted on American \nworkers--particularly in North Carolina--by the illegal practices of \nforeign countries. The United States lost 53,000 textile jobs last \nyear. North Carolina lost as many as in the 3 previous years combined, \nwith plant shutdowns and layoffs costing 11,316 North Carolina jobs. \nFruit of the Loom alone was forced to abolish 3,200 jobs in 1995, and a \nFruit of the Loom spokesman blamed it on ``the cumulative impact of \nNAFTA and GATT'' trade agreements.\n  Headline after headline has announced major company shutdowns or job \nlayoffs. An eye-popping review article in the Winston-Salem Journal \nprovided a long list of companies--including, among others, Sara Lee, \nFieldcrest Cannon, Dupont, and Tultex--that have closed plants and laid \noff workers in North Carolina in the first part of this year. Overall, \n2,918 layoffs in 26 North Carolina cities and towns were announced in \nthe first 4 months of 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nWinston-Salem Journal article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, while foreign imports are pouring in like a \ntidal wave, North Carolina workers are being forced onto the \nunemployment lines. This obviously is having a devastating impact on \nfamilies and communities across America. Mr. President, this bill isn't \n``protectionism,'' it's ``survivalism.'' United States business \nshould--and must--demand access to the international market so that \nAmerican workers can have a fair shot in world competition.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From Winston-Salem Journal, July 7, 1996]\n\n                            Sock It to 'Em?\n\n\n               congress takes aim at asia in textile bill\n\n                           (By John Hoeffel)\n\n       Washington.--Stories of textile plants closing and laid-off \n     workers scrambling to find scarce low-skilled jobs in this \n     high-tech world have been commonplace for at least 20 years. \n     The number of textile employees has been in a steady slide.\n       But the news appears to be getting worse.\n       Last year, North Carolina lost as many textile jobs as in \n     the previous three years combined. Plant closing and layoffs \n     cost the state 11,316 jobs.\n       In the first four months of this year, 22 companies \n     announced 2,918 layoffs in 26 North Carolina cities and \n     towns.\n       North Carolina is the nation's No. 1 textile-producing \n     state, and it has almost a third of the employees.\n       Nationwide, 53,500 textile jobs were lost in 1995.\n       Even with those stunning losses, textiles and apparel are \n     still the top manufacturing industry in North Carolina, with \n     annual sales averaging about $25 billion. Three of the \n     state's top five employers are textile companies, including \n     Sara Lee Corp., which has several divisions based in Winston-\n     Salem.\n       At the end of last year, 261,641 North Carolinians still \n     worked in the industry, which is concentrated in the \n     Piedmont. Forsyth, Guilford and Surry counties all rank in \n     the top 10 counties for textile and apparel employment.\n       The politically powerful companies have a long record of \n     looking to Washington for help, and the South's congressmen \n     have an equally long record of hastening to erect barriers to \n     cheap imports.\n       But this is a new economic era.\n       Free trade is now the mantra of centrists in both the \n     Republican and Democratic parties. The North American Free \n     Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade dismantled many trade barriers, including protectionist \n     textile quotas that will be completely eliminated by 2005.\n       Faced with mounting job losses, congressmen from the South \n     cast about for another avenue and found it with a bill that \n     was introduced last month.\n       That bill, called the Textile and Apparel Global \n     Competitiveness Act, aims not at keeping imports out, but at \n     cracking open foreign markets that are closed to American \n     exports. ``We expect their door to be more than slightly \n     ajar,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, the 6th District Republican \n     who is the chairman of the House textile caucus and an \n     original co-sponsor of the bill. ``We're not building a wall \n     around ourselves and trying to block imports.''\n       The bill also aims at ending transshipments, the illegal \n     practice of sneaking textiles from one country into the \n     United States under another country's quota by diverting them \n     through that third country. The bill is targeted at Asia in \n     general and China in particular.\n       The United States exported $1.96 billion in textiles to the \n     top 14 textile producing countries in Asia. Those countries \n     exported $24.79 billion in textiles to the United States.\n       A source with the U.S. Customs Service says that China \n     transships $4 billion to $6 billion through such places as \n     Hong Kong and Macau, where the products are relabeled ``Made \n     in Hong Kong'' or ``Made in Macau.''\n       Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is no fan of China and has \n     railed against transshipping, plans to sponsor a version of \n     the bill in the Senate. ``It requires retaliation against \n     countries that just flout honest and decency in international \n     trade and countries that are closed to us and do business in \n     our country,'' he said. ``It's time for us to stand up for \n     American workers.''\n       The bill strengthens the roles of the U.S. trade \n     representative in negotiating agreements and the Customs \n     Service in investigating illegal shipments. It establishes \n     steep penalties for violations. It doubles some fines and \n     reduces quotas by an amount equal to three times the volume \n     of transshipped goods when a country is caught transshipping \n     for the third time.\n       Textile importers, who could be socked with stiff penalties \n     for importing illegal products, oppose the bill.\n       ``It's the same industry coming back after many, many years \n     of protection wanting more special favors from government,'' \n     said Laura E. Jones, the executive director of the U.S. \n     Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel. ``They \n     still don't want to compete.''\n       The bill's supporters, sensitive about their protectionist \n     past, react defensively, bringing up the subject of \n     protectionism on their own. ``We're going to have to do a \n     good marketing job in making it clear that this is not a \n     protectionist proposal,'' Coble said.\n       But Jones said that the bill amounts to back-door \n     protectionism, making it easier for a select industry to \n     pursue sanctions against importers and foreign countries. \n     ``They do not need to have standards lowered for them so they \n     can go around harassing our industry,'' she said.\n       As with the old protectionist legislation, Jones said, the \n     consumers lose. ``I just think the consumers end up paying \n     more in the end.'' she said.\n       She also charged that Customs has not discovered massive \n     transshipment because they\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n     don't exist. ``The Customs Service can find cocaine and \n     heroin, but they can't find bras and underpants,'' she said \n     sarcastically. ``If they can't find it now, this isn't going \n     to be an incentive to them to find it later.''\n       The bill is not expected to pass this session because the \n     schedule is too crowded.\n       ``We just don't want this shoved off the table,'' Coble \n     said.\n       Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., was the main author and \n     introduced the bill. But in an election-year press release, \n     Rep. Richard Burr, the 5th District Republican and an \n     original co-sponsor, claimed credit for introducing it.\n       By all accounts, Burr worked hard to collect co-sponsors to \n     help demonstrate wide support for the bill. It has more than \n     100.\n       Some in the industry have criticized the Clinton \n     administration, arguing that it has done little to enforce \n     textile treaties. Helms, though, was more expansive in \n     directing his criticism. ``I have got to be honest and say \n     that previous administrations and the present administration \n     have not done enough. It's a bipartisan folly,'' he said.\n       Work on the bill seemed to rattle the administration's \n     cage.\n       Customs announced last month that it was taking measures \n     designed to stem Chinese transhipments through Macau and Hong \n     Kong, requiring greater verification that textiles shipped \n     from those countries were made there. Customs just this month \n     received the power to block shipments from factories that \n     won't allow Customs investigators inside.\n       Whether the bill and this Customs effort, will half the job \n     losses is unclear. Burr said that it is imperative to \n     introduced the bill because of continuing plant closings, \n     citing the two that Sara Lee Knit Products announced in \n     Sparta, costing 250 jobs, and in Jefferson, costing 589.\n       But Sara Lee officials said that both plants closed because \n     of weak domestic sales and that opening foreign markets would \n     not have prevented the move. ``It's really completely \n     unrelated,'' Nancy Young said.\n       Textile and apparel companies are suffering through an \n     extended retail slowdown. But the companies are also cutting \n     jobs, as Gordon A. Berkstresser III notes, because of \n     continuing automation and other efficiencies.\n       And Berkstresser, a professor of textile and apparel \n     management at N.C. State University, also questioned whether \n     the companies are prepared to sell in Indonesia or Malaysia.\n       ``We haven't gone over and done the kind of market research \n     to see what kind of products we can sell in Asia,'' he said.\n       But Dennis M. Julian the executive vice president of the \n     N.C. Textile Manufacturers Association, said he thinks that \n     the bill would help stabilize the industry.\n       Jerry Cook, the director of international trade for Sara \n     Lee Knit Products, said: ``Anything that helps open market \n     access, I think we'd be really supportive of. It's a tough \n     market out there.''\n\n\n                        textile trade with asia\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nU.S. Exports to:\n    Bangladesh......................................................\n    China..........................................................63.0\n    Taiwan.........................................................93.5\n    Hong Kong.....................................................268.3\n    India..........................................................14.9\n    Indonesia......................................................21.4\n    Japan.........................................................145.6\n    South Korea...................................................136.7\n    Macau...........................................................\n    Malaysia.......................................................23.0\n    Pakistan........................................................\n    Philippines....................................................53.1\n    Singapore.....................................................103.6\n    Thailand.......................................................41.3\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total.....................................................1,964.4\n\n                                                               ==========\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nU.S. Imports from:\n    Bangladesh..................................................1,114.5\n    China.......................................................4,802.5\n    Taiwan......................................................2,757.8\n    Hong Kong...................................................4,390.8\n    India.......................................................1,614.9\n    Indonesia...................................................1,336.2\n    Japan.........................................................481.1\n    South Korea.................................................2,271.1\n    Macau.........................................................764.3\n    Malaysia......................................................745.2\n    Pakistan......................................................964.8\n    Philippines.................................................1,704.0\n    Singapore.....................................................425.5\n    Thailand....................................................1,419.8\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total....................................................24,792.5\n\n  TEXTILE AND APPAREL PLANT CLOSINGS AND LAYOFFS IN NORTH CAROLINA--ANNOUNCED IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THIS  \n                                                      YEAR                                                      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Company                         Location             Jobs lost              Reason given         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChampion Products....................

Employment Security Commission.                                 \n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the bill that the \nSenator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] has just introduced. The Textile and \nApparel Global Competitiveness Act of 1996 will provide needed \nprotections for struggling U.S. textile and apparel producers from \nunfair competition caused by overseas producers who seek to exceed U.S. \nquotas. These overseas producers ship excess goods through circuitous \nroutes so that they appear to originate in third countries whose U.S. \nimport quotas have not been met. The Customs Service and industry \nestimates put the cost of this practice to American industry and its \nworkers at $2 to $4 billion.\n  The Textile and Apparel Global Competitiveness Act requires more \nequitable trade negotiations on textile and apparel goods, with greater \naccess to foreign markets for U.S.-produced textile and apparel goods. \nIt also provides for increased enforcement of existing trade laws, with \nhigher fines providing additional trade adjustment assistance to U.S. \ntextile and apparel producers.\n  In West Virginia, two companies that sew clothing proudly bearing \n``Made in the USA'' labels, Hodges Apparel and Safety Stitch, have been \nfeeling the squeeze created by that kind of overseas competition. This \nspring, both manufacturers were notified that their major supplier \nwould be forced to move its work offshore in order to regain \nprofitability. Unless these West Virginia firms can garner other \norders, the last 200 talented and dedicated garment workers in \nHarrisville will be out of work. In this economically challenged area, \njob losses on this scale constitute more than a minor unravelling of \nthe economic fabric of Ritchie County--they are a tear in the very \nfabric of American society.\n  Mr. President, these potential job losses are not occurring because \nthe quality of clothing produced in the United States is poor; quite \nthe contrary. U.S.-made clothing and textiles are competitive with \ntheir overseas competitors on the basis of design, quality, and any \nstandard other than cost. But U.S. production costs must include \npension and health care payments for workers, and costs to meet \nworkplace safety and environmental standards. Overseas producers are \nnot required to cover these costs and meet these standards. They may \noverwork and underpay their workers, forcing\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nthem to labor in unsafe factories that pollute the air and water around \nthem.\n  The United States is proud of its laws protecting workers and the \nenvironment. The Senate this week voted to increase the minimum wage, \nso that working men and women can provide an adequate standard of \nliving for their families. None of us wants to reduce that standard of \nliving, or give up workplace safety or clean air and water in order to \n``compete'' with inexpensive goods produced by workers paid just \npennies a day before they return to squalid homes under skies laden \nwith pollutants. But if we are to preserve our jobs in the face of such \nundercutting competition, we must ensure that U.S. producers are needed \nin order to meet the demand for clothing and textile goods. That is, in \npart, why quotas exist--to prevent overseas producers from saturating \nthe market for U.S. goods, undercutting U.S. products produced at \nhigher cost.\n  Attempts by these overseas producers to evade U.S. import quotas, or \nto evade other U.S. trade laws and treaties, must be firmly and \neffectively halted. Enforcement, fines and other remedies must be \nsufficient to deter this kind of behavior. The bill introduced by the \nSenator from Kentucky accurately targets these problems. It also \nprovides a source of additional revenue for trade adjustment assistance \nfor U.S. textile and apparel producers, helping them to modernize and \nmore effectively compete on a cost basis with overseas competitors, \nboth here and in foreign markets. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I \nthank Senator Ford for his leadership in introducing this bill.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nKentucky and others in introducing the Textile and Apparel Global \nCompetitiveness Act. This important legislation addresses a problem of \ngrave consequence in my State and others where the textile and apparel \nindustry has been hurt dramatically in recent years due to job \nrelocation and factors resulting from the enactment of NAFTA and GATT. \nThis bill does nothing to undo these agreements, but it does go a long \nway toward strengthening protections for the textile and wearing \napparel sector of the economy and the millions of workers affected by \nthe changes which are occurring.\n  This legislation requires the U.S. Trade Representative, when \nnegotiating textile agreements with nations who are not members of the \nWorld Trade Organization to secure effective market access for American \ntextile and apparel producers. It includes provisions allowing \npenalties for noncompliance with these market-access agreements under \nWTO rules and U.S. law. Furthermore, it creates a special 301 list for \nmarket access for these products and requires the Secretary of Commerce \nto issue a report to Congress each year that outlines the economic \ncontribution of the American textile and apparel industries.\n  While the industry enjoys broad support in Congress and in the \nadministration, it has been the target of aggressive attacks during the \nlast several years. Most of these attacks have been thwarted, but they \nhave come at a time when the textile and apparel industry is undergoing \nmajor transformation as it pushes to increase productivity and to \nbecome more global in its perspective and methods of operation.\n  The American textile and apparel industry is seeking to make a \nsuccessful transition to a quota-free environment within a 10-year \ntimeframe. This transition must have the safeguards provided by this \nmeasure in order to allow the industry to realize that success.\n  I congratulate Senator Ford for his leadership on this issue and urge \nmy colleagues to join us in supporting the Textile and Apparel Global \nCompetitiveness Act.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with several of my \ncolleagues to sponsor the Customs Enforcement Act of 1996. This \nlegislation is designed to strengthen our laws which fight illegal \ntrade in textile and apparel items and open foreign markets to more \nAmerican products. A companion measure, H.R. 3654, was recently \nintroduced in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I have often stated that trade with other countries \nshould be fair, as opposed to free. This means that when exporters from \nanother country seek unlimited access to our markets, then our U.S. \nproducers should likewise have open access to their country's markets. \nMany examples exist where the United States has given another country \naccess to our marketplace, only to have our access limited in their \ncountry. The legislation we are introducing today attempts to mitigate \nthis practice. This measure will require the USTR to secure effective \nmarket access for U.S. produced textile and apparel products. Further, \nif these markets are not opened, the USTR has the ability to impose \npenalties in an attempt to force these markets open.\n  Mr. President, another major concern this legislation attempts to \naddress is transshipping. This is a practice where an exporter ships \ngoods through a third country to avoid U.S. import quotas. The worst \noffenders in the area of transshipment countries are China, India, and \nPakistan. It is estimated that transshipments account for at to least 4 \nbillion dollars' worth of the textile and apparel items shipped into \nthe United States in a year and this figure could be as high as $8 \nbillion. This bill, Mr. President, tightens the requirements for \nimporting items into this country and provides for better documentation \nso that transshipping can be more easily traced. Further, penalties are \nincreased for each transshipping violation.\n  Mr. President, this is not a protectionist bill. Nor does it limit \ntextile imports. This measure attempts to level the playing field for \nthe domestic textile and apparel industry. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this measure and move it expeditiously through the legislative \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7816-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1397\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1397, a bill to provide for \nState control over fair housing matters, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill to amend the \nDeepwater Port Act of 1974 to promote the use of deepwater ports to \ntransport Outer Continental Shelf oil by reducing unnecessary and \nduplicative regulatory requirements, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1938\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner] and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1938, a bill to enact the model Good Samaritan Act \nFood Donation Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1943\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1943, a bill to \namend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt inmates from the \nminimum wage and maximum hour requirements of such Act, and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7825-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7825-S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 278--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

THOMAS J. BALSHI\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nconstituent and fellow Pennsylvanian, Dr. Thomas J. Balshi. For almost \na quarter of a century, Thomas J. Balshi, a fellow of the American \nCollege of Prosthodontists, has enhanced the health of thousands of \nindividuals worldwide by contributions to research, education, and the \nclinical practice of prosthetic dentistry.\n  Dr. Balshi is a pioneer in the field of implant prosthodontics and \noperates a state-of-the-art dental clinic in Fort Washington, PA. Dr. \nBalshi and his staff of 23 have touched the lives of many, replacing \ncountless lost, damaged, or diseased teeth with secure, permanent \nprosthetic smiles. Dr. Balshi specializes in saving dental cases \ndiagnosed as hopeless and has renewed dental health, nutritional \nhealth, and self-confidence for many.\n  Dr. Balshi is a recent recipient of the prestigious George Washington \nMedal of Honor from the National Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, \nPA. This award was bestowed to honor Dr. Balshi's contributions to \ndental science through education. The Freedoms Foundation honors \nAmericans whose lives reinforce and exhibit the patriotic values of our \ncountry's Founding Fathers.\n  In his youth, Thomas Balshi was an Eagle Scout. He later graduated \nfrom the Villanova University in 1968, and, following graduation from \nTemple University School of Dentistry in 1972, became a fellow of the \nAmerican College of Prosthodontists [FACP] in 1976.\n  A former captain in the U.S. Army, Dr. Balshi was chief, Department \nof Fixed Prosthetics, Mills Army Dental Clinic, Fort Dix, NJ. He \nreceived the Army Commendation Medal for Extraordinary Service.\n  Today, he is a clinician, teacher, mentor, researcher, public \neducator, and devotee of health care. He welcomes students from around \nthe world to his clinic, teaching them not only his clinical skills, \nbut also his business skills as well. He is committed to making the \npublic aware of quality dental care.\n  Dr. Balshi has trained a specialist from Bosnia-Herzogovina to bring \nhealing and restoration to the war-torn population where United States \nmilitary service personnel are now keeping the peace. He has championed \nthe benefits of prosthetic care throughout India, Uruguay, and \nColombia, and has spoken before the Royal Society of Medicine in \nLondon.\n  Serving as editor of the International College of Prosthodontists \nNewsletter for its inaugural 10 years, Dr. Balshi actively participated \nin establishing worldwide communication among practitioners of his \nspecialty. He recently published a cookbook for dental patients \nentitled ``From Soup to Nuts.'' The book offers soft and nutritious \ngourmet recipes for healing patients, as well as keys to returning to \ndental fitness and the recipes that accompany that opportunity.\n  Dr. Balshi continues a very giving and philanthropic presence in the \ncommunity awarding scholarships as the chair of educational foundations \nas well as giving countless time and dental care resources to charity.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to share Dr. Balshi's background and \nexperiences with my Senate colleagues today. I hope you will all join \nme in honoring and recognizing his presence and contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7835-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7835-S7836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORIZING SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a Senate resolution submitted \nearlier today by Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the case of State of Florida versus Kathleen \nBush is a criminal prosecution brought by the State attorney for \nBroward County, FL, alleging aggravated child abuse and organized \nfraud. The case, which has received significant publicity, presents \nallegations that the defendant deliberately made her child ill to \nobtain attention from medical personnel, the media, and others. The \nState asserts that the defendant engaged in a letter-writing campaign \nto numerous government officials as part of her fraudulent and abusive \nactivities. Indeed, the public record reflects that, through the \ndefendant's efforts, the defendant and her daughter had personal \nmeetings with Mrs. Clinton and Senator Graham, among others.\n  The State intends to introduce into evidence at trial the letters \nthat the defendant wrote to government officials about her daughter. \nThe prosecutor has requested that Senator Graham's office provide \ntestimony to authenticate the correspondence between the defendant and \nthe office. This resolution would authorize an employee on Senator \nGraham's staff to testify and produce documents in this case, with \nrepresentation from the Senate Legal Counsel.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 278) and its preamble are as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 278\n\n       Whereas, in the case of State of Florida v. Kathleen Bush, \n     Case No. 96-6912 CF10(A), pending in the Circuit Court for \n     Broward County, Florida, testimony and document production \n     has been requested from Mary Chiles, an employee on the staff \n     of Senator Bob Graham;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent Mary Chiles, and any other employee from whom \n     testimony or document production may be required, in \n     connection with State of Florida v.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed are as follows:\n\n       W. Craig Broadwater, of West Virginia, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Northern District of West Virginia.\n       Andrew S. Effron, of Virginia, to be a Judge of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for the term of \n     fifteen years to expire on the date prescribed by law.\n\n\n              statement on nomination of craig broadwater\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, during my years as a United States Senator, \nI have had the opportunity to speak in support of the confirmation of \nmany outstanding West Virginians who have sought to serve on our \nFederal judiciary. On this occasion, I am pleased to urge my colleagues \nto swiftly confirm W. Craig Broadwater to serve as a Federal District \nJudge for the Northern District of West Virginia.\n  Since 1983, Craig Broadwater has served on the First Judicial Circuit \nof West Virginia, most recently as Chief Judge. His path to the state \njudiciary included experience with a general law practice, service as a \nspecial prosecuting attorney, and a stint as a hearing examiner for \nstate government.\n  Craig Broadwater has also demonstrated a special concern for children \nand families in distress. He chaired the Committee formed to develop \nchild abuse and neglect rules for the West Virginia Supreme Court of \nAppeals, as well as guidelines for family law masters in West Virginia. \nHe has written articles and taught on the subject of domestic violence \nand prevention, and he is widely regarded and respected for the \nexpertise and sensitivity he has demonstrated in this particularly \npoignant area of the law.\n  After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from West Virginia University in \n1972, Craig Broadwater entered the United States Army and even today \ncontinues to serve his country as a Lieutenant Colonel in the West \nVirginia Army National Guard.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to lend my support to this exceptional West \nVirginian. I believe Craig Broadwater's experience, keen legal mind, \nand personal integrity embody the qualities envisioned by the first \nSenate when the Judiciary Act created the third branch of Government. I \nam confident these talents will serve him well on the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to recommend a very \ndistinguished West Virginian be confirmed today to the post of Federal \ndistrict judge for northern West Virginia. I'm honored to have joined \nwith my senior colleague, Senator Byrd, in recommending that the \nPresident present this nomination.\n  Senator Byrd and I have recommended Judge Craig Broadwater to this \nimportant post because he represents the very best of our State. He is \nthe perfect blend of talent, energy, strength, and commitment to his \nfellow human beings--and, Mr. President, his life and his career are \nevidence of this fact.\n  I had the privilege of appointing Judge Broadwater to the West \nVirginia First Judicial Circuit in 1993, when I was Governor. He was \nthereafter elected to the post in 1984. Since then, he was rated by the \nWest Virginia State Bar as the No. 1 judge in the circuit, became \nchairman of the West Virginia Judicial Investigation Commission, and \nthen chief judge for the first circuit in 1987, 1988, and 1995. To \nfully appreciate this remarkable man, you need to understand that Judge \nBroadwater is only 45 years old, and he has already had a outstanding \njudicial career.\n  Craig's career is rooted in a lifetime of incredible service to this \ncountry and his community. Craig was born and raised in Paden City, WV, \nalong the Ohio River. He graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, and \nwas a Distinguished Military Graduate, Army ROTC, from West Virginia \nUniversity in 1972. He received his law degree from West Virginia \nUniversity in 1977.\n  He served in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, from 1972 to 1974, \nand is still an active reservist in the West Virginia Army National \nGuard. He has been awarded a Special Forces tab, master parachutist \nbadge, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal for Korea in 1973 and 1974, the Humanitarian \nService Medal, and the West Virginia Emergency Service Medal.\n  Yet, I also know that Judge Brodwater may be most proud of his \noutstanding record on behalf of West Virginia's children. He has been a \ngreat leader in our State in the area of child abuse and neglect laws \nand has been a longtime member of the executive board of the Boy Scouts \nof America.\n  I am also fortunate to know Craig's family--his wife, Chong, two \nbeautiful daughters, Chandra and Taeja, and son, Shane. They, too, are \ntestament to his deep commitment and values.\n  Everywhere you turn in our State's northern panhandle, you see the \nimprint of Judge Broadwater's intellect and commitment. He knows the \nimportance of family. A close examination of his record as a judge will \nreveal a very tough, yet fair man, whose life experience have prepared \nhim to sit on the Federal bench as a judge before his fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, Senator J. William Fulbright said in 1961:\n\n       It is not our affluence, or our plumbing, or our clogged \n     freeways that grip the imagination of others. Rather, it is \n     the values upon which our system is built. These values imply \n     our adherence not only to liberty and individual freedom, but \n     also to international peace, law and order and constructive \n     social purpose. When we depart from these values, we do so at \n     our own peril.\n\n  Every American, and certainly every West Virginia, should be \ncomfortable knowing that Craig Broadwater and the values upon which his \nlife has been built will be a part of our judicial system. As his U.S. \nSenator and his friend, I'm proud to recommend his confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/12/senate-section/article/S7836-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
