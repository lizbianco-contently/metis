Mr. President, if I might inquire of the Chair, it is my \nunderstanding that on the Bryan amendment, there is a time agreement in \nwhich the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee has 15 \nminutes allotted to him and the proponents of the Bryan amendment have \n15 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes out of my \nallocated time.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, for six decades, the \nfoundation upon which public confidence in the American securities \nmarket has been built rests upon two fundamental premises: First, \neffective regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission; second, \nthe right of individual investors who have been defrauded to pursue a \nprivate cause of action against those wrongdoers.\n  Mr. President, I greatly fear that S. 240, as it is being processed \nthrough this Chamber, will, for all intents and purposes, emasculate \nthat private cause of action, which has been so important in keeping \nthe American securities market safe and sound and investor confidence \nhigh. Those are not just statements made by the Senator from Nevada. \nThe former Chairman of the SEC, Mr. Breeden, the last Republican \nChairman, made similar statements in \n\n[[Page S 9110]]\ntestimony before the Banking Committee during his tenure. The current \nChairman, Mr. Levitt, has also made that proposition.\n  The amendment before us seeks to correct a decision by the Supreme \nCourt decided last year by a narrow 5-to-4 margin that wipes out \nliability for aiders and abettors.\n  Now, there has been much debate on the floor of the Senate about \nproportionate liability, joint and several liability, intentional \nmisconduct, knowing misconduct, and reckless misconduct. None of those \ndistinctions makes a whit of difference if this amendment is not \ngranted, because under the current State of the law, no aider and \nabettor is liable under that theory, irrespective of his or her \nmisconduct. Everyone is home free.\n  I cannot conceive of a public policy that would support that \nconclusion. And, indeed, the prime sponsors of this legislation have \npreviously written--I refer to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and the senior Senator from New Mexico--expressing their \nsupport for restoration of aider and abettor liability.\n  Interspersed throughout all of this debate has been a great antipathy \nto plaintiff's lawyers. I understand that antipathy and I do not, for a \nmoment, doubt that there has been some misconduct, and some provisions \nin S. 240 deal with that misconduct. But let me point out that aiders \nand abettors are also lawyers, and if misconduct on the part of the \nplaintiff's bar ought to be addressed--as it ought to--under what \ntheory of social or economic justice, can we assert that those who are \npart of the conspiracy itself--lawyers and accountants, primarily, and \nto some extent bankers--in effect, be given a blank check? If they did \nnot sign their names to any of the statements, in effect, they have no \nliability.\n  Now, is this theoretical? Is it esoteric? No. If the state of law at \nthe time of the Keating actions--one of the most notorious securities \nfrauds of this century--were in the form that it is today, here is what \nwould occur. My colleagues will recall that Mr. Keating, the primary \nwrongdoer, was bankrupt. No recovery from him. Some $262 million were \nrecovered as a result of the Keating fraud by private investors. Jeri \nMellon, a retired woman who lives in Henderson, NV, a suburb of Las \nVegas, who came back, most of her savings were lost as a result of the \nfraud. She joined with others similarly situated in a class action to \nrecover money. They recovered $262 million.\n  If that action were brought today, because aiding and abetting is no \nlonger a part of the law as a result of the Central Bank of Denver \ncase--I might add, the Court, in deciding that case, said, look, we do \nnot believe that the statute can be construed to apply to aider and \nabettor liability, but we sure as the devil believe that there ought to \nbe liability. So this was not a value judgment made by the Court that \naiders and abettors ought not to be available. Here are some of the \naiders and abettors: Parker Milliken, Kay Sholer, Sidley & Austin, \nMichael Milken; $121 million of the overall value of $262 million would \nbe wiped out if that action was filed today. So we are down now to $141 \nmillion.\n  Previously, I offered for the consideration of the Senate a \nrecommendation shared by the SEC, by the State Securities Association, \nby every regulator, by consumer groups, by those charged with public \nfinance responsibilities at the State and local government level, to \nextend the statute of limitations, which is currently limited to 1 to \n3, to make it a 2-year to 5-year statute of limitations.\n  Had the action against Charles Keating been brought today, 20 percent \nof the class claims would have been barred because of this restricted \nstatute of limitations. Another $28 million in recovery, wiped out.\n  These are people like the Jeri Mellons. I suspect that virtually \nevery Member of this Senate has had individuals who lost money as a \nresult of the Keating fraud.\n  The recovery is down $262 million, to $113 million. Joint and several \nliability: Under the provisions of S. 240, in order to be jointly and \nseverally liable, you have to either have knowing misconduct or \nintentional misconduct. Reckless misconduct no longer does it.\n  Although I recognize a distinction can be made between the two of \nthose, the amendment that Senator Sarbanes and I sought to offer in one \nform or another, sought to make sure that if the primary violator is \ninsolvent, that those who are guilty of reckless misconduct--it is not \nordinary negligence, not simple negligence--if a Member of this Chamber \ngoes out this evening, gets in his or her automobile, is involved in an \naccident and is negligent, that Member is responsible to the party to \nwhom he or she has inflicted the injury. Not so with securities law. \nOnly if they are guilty of reckless misconduct.\n  In effect, as a result of the changes we make in the joint and \nseveral liability, those who are proportionally liable pay only their \nshare. It is estimated that another $67 million would be wiped out in \nterms of investor recovery if the Keating case were brought today. S. \n240 also wipes out the Rico treble damages provision, and another $30 \nmillion.\n  So if the Keating case were brought today, with the state of the law \nas it exists on this morning as this debate continues, rather than $262 \nmillion recovered by innocent investors, many of whom lost their life \nsavings--and a disproportionately large number, small, elderly, retired \ninvestors who had little likelihood of ever regaining their loss--$262 \nmillion of recovery would be reduced to $16 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, under what theory of social or \neconomic justice do we want to do this? Sure, we want to get at the \nplaintiff's lawyers that file frivolous actions, and the enhanced \nprovisions of rule 11 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \naddress that issue.\n  The amendment before the Senate would simply restore aiding and \nabetting liability. Zippo, no recovery at all. Intentional misconduct, \nknowing misconduct, reckless misconduct--not 1 cent could be recovered \nunder a theory of aider and abettor liability under the state of the \nlaw today, unless the Bryan amendment is enacted.\n  May I inquire, I have used my time; how is the time being charged at \nthis point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator has approximately \n3 minutes remaining on his side.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this is, admittedly, a very complex \nsubject. We must distinguish between knowingly and intentionally having \ncommitted a fraudulent act and recklessly committing an act.\n  What is the difference between reckless conduct and intentional and \nknowing fraud? What standard of proof is there between gross \nnegligence, negligence, and recklessness? These are not clear \ndistinctions and it is because of these blurred distinctions that there \nhas been a large body of case law, over the years, trying to make the \ndefinitions clear. This is particularly true in the area of reckless \nconduct; over the years a number of courts have given the \ninterpretation that someone who was not the primary wrongdoer, but \nparticipated in the fraud and knowingly and substantially assisted in \nthe fraud could be held liable. This does not seem to me to be reckless \nconduct but knowing fraud.\n  Courts have found, over the years, that a firm could be held fully \nliable for conduct which the average person would consider imprudent, \nnegligent, or careless. Some circuit courts have recognized this so-\ncalled aiding and abetting liability as part of the recklessness \nstandard.\n  Aiding and abetting liability holds the business community to an \nincredibly high standard, particularly when they can be held liable for \ndamages that are far greater that any damage that they have caused. \nThere is a real culprit to hold liable. The primary wrongdoer is \nsomebody that has really committed fraud, who has practiced avarice and \ngreed, who has wantonly and knowingly broken the law.\n  The Supreme Court decided that aiding and abetting liability applies \nto someone who is not the primary wrongdoer but participated in a fraud \nand knowingly and substantially assisted in the fraud. In the Central \nBank of Denver case, the Court decided there was no aiding and abetting \nliability for private lawsuits involving fraud.\n  The Supreme Court did not believe that section 10(b) intended to \ncover aiding and abetting liability. Providing for aiding and abetting \nliability under \n\n[[Page S 9111]]\nsection 10(b) would be contrary to the goals of this legislation.\n  This bill is aimed at reducing frivolous litigation. Even the Supreme \nCourt recognized that expanding 10(b) to include aiding and abetting \nliability would lead many defendants to settle to avoid the expense and \nrisk of going to trial.\n  The Supreme Court said, ``Litigation under rule 10b-a presents a \ndanger vexatiousness, different in degree and in kind, and would \nrequire secondary actors to expend large sums even for pretrial defense \nand the negotiation of settlement.''\n  As I have said, aiding and abetting liability would require secondary \nactors--not the primary wrongdoer, the person who has committed the \nfraud--to expend large sums, even for pretrial defense, and the \nnegotiation of settlement.\n  Indeed, I do not believe that just because people have made \nsettlements that they were guilty of fraud or that it was right and \nproper that they were sued.\n  When 93 percent of the cases--and I know not all the defendants were \nbrought in to these suits for aiding and abetting, I grant that--but 93 \npercent of the defendants settled. These aiders and abettors are people \ntangentially involved in the fraud; they are brought into the suits \nonly because they were involved with a scoundrel--a Keating--who was \ndeliberately breaking the law. Often these aiders and abettors are \naccountants who did not notice the fraud, but possibly should have, yet \nwe would hold them liable as if they committed the fraud. The Supreme \nCourt said last year that aiding and abetting liability did not belong \nin private lawsuits involving fraud.\n  Of course, if someone has knowingly, intentionally, misled investors \nor been involved in committing fraud, they are no longer just aiders \nand abettors, and can be held liable for their actions.\n  Under S. 240, people who commit fraud will be treated as primary \nwrongdoers, as the culpable party, and can be held jointly and \nseverally.\n  Further, S. 240 grants the Securities and Exchange Commission express \nauthority to prosecute cases against wrongdoers who knowingly aid and \nabet primary wrongdoers.\n  This issue is both very interesting and very complex. It is not easy. \nFirst, the circuit courts recognized aiding and abetting liability, \nthen the Supreme Court decided there is no place in these lawsuits for \nthis liability. Using the aiding and abetting liability to proceed \nunder rule 10(b) with a lawsuit, which is what this amendment would do, \nwould take us to a standard that the Supreme Court decided should not \nbe applied. Again, I quote that this liability standard ``presents a \ndanger of vexatiousness, different in degree in kind and would require \nsecondary actors to expend large sums, even for pretrial defense and \nnegotiations of settlements.''\n  This amendment would actually destroy a good part of what this \nlegislation attempts to do in terms of keeping lawyers honest and \nprotecting those people who did not commit fraud, but were associated \nwith those who did. It is my belief that these firms, the so-called \naiders and abettors, are only brought in to these suits because of \ntheir deep pockets.\n They are professionals; securities analysts, accountants, and bankers \nwho are involved in some way with the fraudulent party. They get \nbrought in to the lawsuits and have to spend millions of dollars \ndefending themselves. And their lawyers tell them that there is a \nchance that ``you may be held liable for the full amount.'' Why? \nBecause when the name of a primary wrongdoer like Keating comes up, you \nare ``guilty by association.''\n\n  Any prudent lawyer would have to say that there is a chance you will \nbe held liable if you were involved with a rogue--and there will be \nmore rogues, make no mistake about it. I do not care what kind of \nlegislation we pass here, there will be others who break the laws, who \nwill do terrible things. It is not right that an accountant, law firm \nor securities broker is dragged in and linked to the fraud because they \nwere asked to counsel and they gave some advice. They did not tell the \nwrongdoers to lie, they did not participate in fraud, but if they \nrendered some professional service, by virtue of their being linked \nwith by that fraud they may be held liable by a jury. Do you think that \na defendant is going to be able to establish clearly what is reckless \nconduct and what is not? The jury can find against them and then hold \nthem for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. That risk is why \nyou have the incredible percentage of settlements.\n  You heard Senator Dodd last evening explain how it was that a \nprominent firm, one of the big six accounting firms, did $15,000 worth \nof work, a contract to review something, and was then brought in to the \nsuit. This accounting firm did defend itself and won the case, but in \nwinning the case expended over $6 million. We cannot subject people to \nthat kind of choice. I tell you when that accounting firm is hauled in \nthe next time, it will settle. This amendment would allow a firm that \nwas associated with the fraudulent firm to be fully liable for the \ndamages. This would move us in the wrong direction, so I have to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire what the state of time is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 2\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from New York has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me, in 2\\1/2\\ minutes, tell my \ncolleagues this amendment has nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits, \nabsolutely nothing. This amendment simply indicates whether or not the \nSenate of the United States believes that those who counsel, who aid, \nwho provide assistance to those who perpetrate investor fraud, ought to \nbe held responsible. Under the current law, aiders and abettors are not \nliable. Among that group are the lawyers who have been the focus of \nmuch criticism during the course of the debate.\n  Sidley & Austin, Jones Day. These are law firms. A vote against the \nBryan amendment places the individual Senator and this Congress on \nrecord as saying this kind of conduct--misconduct in my view--ought to \nbe tolerated, approved, and tacitly accepted. I cannot conceive of such \na result.\n  A decade ago the Congress of the United States enacted a piece of \nlegislation, Garn-St Germain, that led, within a decade, to a savings \nand loan industry which cost the American taxpayers tens and tens of \nbillions of dollars.\n  It is my view that S. 240, in its present form, without the kinds of \namendments the distinguished Senator from Maryland and I have tried to \nadd, will cause investor losses of those magnitudes over the ensuing \nyears, and essentially private causes of action will be destroyed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Am I correct, under the legislation before us, there \ncould be no liability whatever imposed in a private action for aiding \nand abetting?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct, no liability.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the Keating case, a large part of the recovery of \nthe victims came from aiders and abettors, did it not?\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might respond to the Senator, out of $262 million \nrecovered in a private cause of action--because Mr. Keating himself was \nbankrupt--$121 million of the $262 million was recovered from aiders \nand abettors. Under the state of law currently, that $121 million is \nwiped out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What public policy reason could there possibly be for \nletting aiders and abettors go completely free? I understand there \ncould be an argument about what standards to impose. But on what basis \nin public policy is it that aiders and abettors go free?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Might I inquire if the acting floor manager will yield me \n1 minute to respond to the question of the Senator from Maryland?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator be \nallotted 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in responding to the question of the \nSenator from Maryland, I am at a total loss. It \n\n[[Page S 9112]]\nis beyond my comprehension, whether one positions himself or herself in \nthe political spectrum to the left of Fidel Castro or to the right of \nthe Sheriff of Nottingham, under what theory you could say this kind of \nconduct ought to be encouraged and to simply say to these folks, by and \nlarge: Hey, as long as you are looking the other way and not signing \nany documents, you can, with total impunity under the private cause of \naction, counsel, aid, and provide tangible help to perpetrators of \ninvestor fraud. It is simply incomprehensible, I respond to my good \nfriend.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Colorado seek \nrecognition? You have 2 minutes left. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, I \nthink, is a very thoughtful Member and brings persuasive arguments to \nthe floor on this and other issues that he takes on. The concern I \nfind, as I listen to this, is the potential of holding someone liable \nfor another's actions when they had no idea that fraud, that action, \nwas taking place. That is what this amendment does. This would hold \nsomeone, an accountant, someone else involved in this process who has \nno idea that a fraud is taking place, this would hold them liable even \nthough they did not commit the fraud and they did not even know about \nthe fraud.\n  Making someone liable, taking millions of dollars away from them, \nputting them through this when they did not even know about the action \nseems to me to be outrageous.\n  We yield the remainder of our time on this side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1475\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes debate on the Boxer amendment No. 1475, to be equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, if the Senator from California is willing, \nI would like to address an inquiry to her concerning her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly.\n  Mr. BROWN. On the first page of the amendment, on page 98, following \nthrough line 100, you put in a subsection and insert the following \nsubsection that reads:\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date on which a notice is \n     published under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), the \n     court shall determine whether all named plaintiffs acting on \n     behalf of the purported plaintiff's class who have moved the \n     court to be appointed to serve as lead plaintiff under \n     paragraph (1)(A)(ii) have unanimously selected a named \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs to serve as lead plaintiff or \n     plaintiffs of the purported plaintiff class . . . .\n  I did not read all of that. My question relates to it, and I frankly \nfind it a bit confusing. When we say ``all named plaintiffs acting on \nbehalf of the purported plaintiff class,'' who is it we are describing?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Everyone in the class. We took it right from your bill. I \nguess the bill the Senator is supporting; that you have to advertise \nthat class actions are about to take place and every named plaintiff \nhas a chance to vote on who the lead plaintiff shall be. We think this \nis very democratic. Unlike your bill, the richest investor will be the \nlead plaintiff.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator would, my question is I think very \nspecific. When it says all named plaintiffs, who are those? Are those \nsolely the ones who brought the suit?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Every plaintiff of the class who responded to become part \nof the suit. There is a 90-day period where they go out and advertise.\n  Mr. BROWN. It would be the people who brought the suit as well as \npeople who decided to add their names?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Everyone; all plaintiffs who are interested in being part \nof the suit gets to vote on who the lead plaintiff shall be.\n  Mr. BROWN. If that is the case, why do we have language ``acting on \nbehalf of the purported plaintiff class who have moved the court to be \nappointed to serve as lead plaintiff?'' What if one of the outside \nplaintiffs has not moved the court to serve to be plaintiff?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator is confusing a very simple \nstraightforward point. We take the language straight out of S. 240. In \n90 days, there are newspaper advertisements of general circulation, and \neveryone who is part of the class is invited to join in the class. At \nthat point in time, all the plaintiffs who are in the suit--and \neveryone is invited to be in--get to vote on who they want the lead \nplaintiff to be. If there is not a unanimous selection then the judge \nappoints.\n  Mr. BROWN. My question was very specific. The question I have is \nthis: If the intention is to have it include all plaintiffs, why do we \nmodify this by saying ``who have moved the court to be appointed to \nserve as lead plaintiff''? What if one of the outside plaintiffs that \njoined the suit does not petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff? \nDoes that mean that they have no voice under subparagraph (a) and they \nare not required to consent to the naming of lead plaintiff?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding of this amendment is clear. Everyone who \nhas joined in the suit has an equal say. And if they cannot agree, then \nthe court shall appoint. In S. 240 it is the richest investor. So the \nanswer is all the plaintiffs get to choose.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me just say, at least for this Member, I was intrigued \nby the arguments of the Senator from California last night. As I read \nthe bill, it appears to me that the language here seems to imply that \nsomeone who is not in the original filing, or more specifically had not \nmoved the court to be appointed to serve as lead plaintiff, would not \nhave a voice in that unanimous consent required under selection for \nsubparagraph (a).\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I would address my friend to page 3 on the selection \nof lead counsel. The lead plaintiff or plaintiffs appointed under \nparagraph 2 shall be subject to the approval of the court selecting the \nnamed counsel. So everyone has a chance. All the plaintiffs have a \nchance to vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. My suggestion would be if the Senator does not want to \nlimit that plaintiff class, having the words ``who have moved the court \nto be appointed to serve as lead plaintiff,'' I think gives the \nimpression that you have to have been in that group. But the Senator \nmentioned ``rich'' under the bill. I have looked in the bill. I do not \nfind that term. Could she show me where in the bill this indicates that \nthe richest one determines?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly I will. Unfortunately, at this point I would \nneed a quorum call to find the exact place because I am working off my \namendment. My friend did not tell me he was going to question me about \nthe exact wording of the bill itself. So could we put a quorum call in \nplace? I could find the section.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will withhold, the bill says ``in the \ndetermination of the court has the largest financial interest in the \nrelief sought by the class'' on page 99 of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield so I may respond to his \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWN. Surely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On page 99 of the bill, the language is ``in the \ndetermination of the court has the largest financial interest in the \nrelief sought by the class.'' That is the language.\n  Mr. BROWN. That was not the question. That is an unresponsive answer. \nThe question was where in the bill is ``rich''? The Senator had made \nthe point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. ``The largest financial interest in the relief sought \nby the class.''\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator from Maryland is telling me ``rich'' is not in \nthe bill, that they use terms with regard to the ``largest financial.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. The richest person in the sense of having the ``largest \nfinancial interest in the relief sought by the class'' is the one you \nare putting forward.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let me simply note this.\n  Mr. SARBANES. ``The largest financial interest.''\n  Mr. BROWN. I believe it is my time.\n  Mr. President, who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we all make mistakes in debate on the \nfloor. I certainly am included. The point I wanted to make was that the \nterms used by the Senator from Maryland \n\n[[Page S 9113]]\nand the Senator from California are in fact not in the bill. The \nrecitation and description of what was in the bill is not in the bill. \nWhat was said was inaccurate. Mr. President, I think there is an \nimportant point here.\n  Let us assume you have two lawyers from New York who bring a class \naction against Wells Fargo. Each one of them is worth $10 million each. \nThe public employees pension fund is also a shareholder of Wells Fargo. \nThe manager of that public employees association has total assets about \none-tenth of what the lawyers from New York have. Who is rich? Who is \nthe richest? Are the people worth $10 million, the lawyers in New York, \nwho are professional plaintiffs, the poor ones in this? The answer is \nobvious. The professional plaintiffs who are worth $10 million each are \na lot richer than the person who happens to work for a living and \nmanage the assets of the California employees' pension fund. But the \nCalifornia employees' pension fund has a great deal larger financial \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to assure the Senator from California, \nfor whom I have great respect, that if she is concerned about improving \non who we select to be the lead plaintiff, I will join her. But setting \nup a provision where professional litigants get to name the lead \nplaintiff and close other people out I think is a problem. The way I \nread this measure is it says that the people who bring the suit agree, \nand they may only have one share each. They may be in this only for the \npurposes of getting a lawsuit and naming the plaintiff and getting to \nname the lawyer. But if the people who are professional litigants agree \nand bring the suit, they can name the lead plaintiff. They can control \nthe lawsuit. They can name the lawyer and they can benefit indirectly \nfrom the attorney's fees. That is what this is all about.\n  The Senator has indicated that it is not her intention to exclude \nthose who did not specifically move the court to be appointed as lead \nplaintiff. It is not her intention to exclude plaintiffs. It may not \nhave done that. But that is the wording of the amendment. If that is \nnot the intention, the language ought to be corrected.\n  Mr. President, more important than anything else, if her purpose is \nto get the best lead plaintiff possible, I would suggest that we ought \nto focus on that question, and that we should not carve out an \nexception for those who are professional litigants who may have brought \nthe suit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have heard a lot of distortions on this floor, but this \none takes the cake. I say to my friends on the other side, if you ask \nthe public who they stand and represent, most people would say it is \nthose in the upper income brackets. And this argument proves the point \nbetter than I ever could.\n  That is correct, I said the ``richest'' investor, and my friend takes \ngreat umbrage with that. Let us just say largest investor. That is what \nyou say in the bill. Let us stick with that. Because let me tell you, \nif S. 240 had been the law of the land during the Keating case, you \nknow who the largest investor was? A company that turned out to be \nguilty in that case, a codefendant in that case. So just because \nsomebody has the largest investment should not make them automatically \nthe lead plaintiff.\n  Now, my friend can ignore it all he wants, all he wants, but that is \nexactly what S. 240 does. And I think it is elitist, I think it is \nantidemocratic, and I say to my friend that just because you may be \nwealthier, richer, if you will--and I am not going to change my \nlanguage--have a bigger investment than everyone else does not make you \nbetter than anyone else. And if America stands for anything, it stands \nfor that premise.\n  Now, I want my friend to know--and he cares a lot about process--that \nthis provision he defends here today--and I ask my friend, was my \nfriend involved in the writing of this bill? I ask my friend from \nColorado, did he participate in the markup on this bill?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am not a member of the committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think that is a point. He stands up here, and he argues \nabout something he never marked up. The fact is we held a lot of \nhearings on this, and no one ever brought this issue forward about \nselecting the lead plaintiff. It was brought 4 days before the markup, \nwith not one hearing. The SEC has concerns about it. The SEC is very \nconcerned about it. They do not know how it would work. They think it \nis going to lead to more litigation, because what if what the Senator \nfrom California says is accurate, that in many cases you are going to \nhave the lead plaintiff be someone who is eventually named as a \ncoconspirator, a codefendant? Imagine the kind of lawsuits that would \nbring about.\n  Look, I do not care who is appointed attorney. I could care less. \nThere is going to be an attorney for the class. The question is, should \nit be automatically the prerogative of the largest investor to \ndetermine the course of the case?\n  Now, in the Boxer amendment, we say, if the plaintiffs cannot agree \nunanimously--and any plaintiff can be part of that discussion--then the \njudge gets to select the lead plaintiff based on a number of criteria.\n  I am very proud that Senator Bingaman and many others are supporting \nme in this amendment. We can twist and turn and chastise people for \nusing plain English on this floor, and maybe my friend just wants to \ntalk about the exact language in the bill. I never thought we did that \naround here. I thought we tried to get it down to where people can \nunderstand. My friend wants me to say the ``largest'' investor? I say \nthe ``richest'' investor, and he takes me on as if I have committed \nsome kind of a sin. I stand by it. I think we need the Boxer amendment. \nI think we need to send a message from this Chamber that just because \nyou are the largest investor does not give you the right to take over \nfrom everybody else, because let me tell you sometimes the largest \ninvestor does not really stand that much to lose because maybe he has a \nvery large dollar investment but in accordance with his net worth it is \nnot much, and someone who has invested $5,000 or $10,000 or $20,000 has \nmuch more to lose.\n  I brought to my colleagues' attention yesterday a woman from \nCalifornia who was bilked of $20,000 by Charles Keating. That may not \nsound like a lot to my Republican friend on the other side, who \nchastised me for using the word ``rich,'' but I can tell you that \n$20,000 was the difference for this woman in being able to sleep at \nnight and pay her bills and have a sense of security.\n  Mr. President, at this time I reserve the remainder of my time and \nask, if there is a quorum call, it be divided from each side equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I feel bad that the Senator from California \nhas responded the way she has. At least my experience in this Chamber \nand the legislative process is that when you read the language and \nthere is a problem with the language and you offer to work on that, \nSenators are grateful. All of us have an interest in good legislation.\n  As I read this amendment--and I have quoted the exact language--it \nsays, ``acting on behalf of the purported plaintiff class who have \nmoved the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff.''\n  As I read that--and I certainly could be wrong; I do not mean to hold \nmyself out as the authority--I think it suggests in very plain English \nyou have to move the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff to come \nunder that category. That means some people could be plaintiffs that \nwould be excluded. That is a drafting problem. It may not be a drafting \nproblem, but it certainly ought to be clarified, and it ought to be \nclarified for the benefit of the Senator from California.\n  Now, the Senator from California has talked about democracy in this \nprocess. Mr. President, what we are involved with here today, if this \namendment passes, is stuffing the ballot box. And let me be specific. \nYou can have one share of stock and bring the class action, and the \nCalifornia public employees trust fund that may have a \n\n[[Page S 9114]]\nmillion shares of stock and represent 100,000 people may be excluded \nfrom the process of selecting the lead plaintiff.\n  Now, that is not right, and that is not democracy. Should the \nCalifornia public employees trust fund, a retirement fund, that owns a \nmillion times as many shares as a professional plaintiff, have more \nvoice? I think they should. If they own a million times as many shares, \nthey surely should have a larger voice in the selection of this.\n  This amendment stuffs the ballot box. It says the people who brought \nthe suit and who have moved the court to be appointed to serve as lead \nplaintiff end up, under the first option, being able to dictate who the \nlead plaintiff is and end up being able to dictate who the lawyer is \nwho gets the fees and ends up being able to help guide the case.\n  Now, that is wrong. To have a person with one share or five shares \ncontrol an action where the California public employees trust fund may \nhave a million shares is wrong.\n  Let me reiterate. If there is interest in adding fairness to this \nprocess, we ought to do it. One thing I might mention, because I think \nwhat was mentioned on this floor was that the person who has the \nlargest financial interest may well have a conflict of interest, the \nbill deals with that on page 100.\n\n       1. Will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n     the class.\n\n  Now, that is one of the grounds in which you can exclude someone, \neven though they may have the largest financial interest.\n\n       2. Is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff \n     incapable of adequately representing the class.\n\n  Both of those, Mr. President, would apply as we have talked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California has 7 minutes 52 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me just 1 minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from \nColorado that my perception of the dispute that arose as between him \nand the Senator from California was his taking issue with her reference \nto the ``richest'' plaintiff being named as the lead plaintiff under \nthe bill.\n  The Senator says, well, the word ``richest'' is not in the bill. That \nis correct. But what is in the bill is that the lead plaintiff shall be \nthe one who has the largest financial interest, and in that sense I \nthink it is fair to say that is the richest of the plaintiffs, the \nlargest financial interest.\n  Now, second, the Senator says, well, we have covered the problem of a \nconflict of interest in the bill. That is a rebuttable presumption and, \nas someone said last night, it is really written to be almost \nirrebuttable.\n  The SEC, which examined this provision of the legislation, having \nlooked at it and having looked at the very provision the Senator is \nmaking reference to, said that:\n\n       It may create additional litigation concerning the \n     qualifications of the lead plaintiff, particularly when the \n     class member with the greatest financial interest in the \n     litigation has ties to management or interests that may be \n     different from other class members.\n\n  So clearly there is a problem here. And the way the bill is written \nit may place the lead plaintiff position in the hands of people about \nwhom the SEC has raised large and significant questions.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BROWN. May I respond?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time does the Senator from Colorado have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has none.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield if I have time at the end, but we \nare getting down to the last 5 minutes of this discussion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado have 1 minute--I had 1 minute--to make a point in \nresponse, so the Senator from California can preserve her time in order \nto make her closing statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Colorado has an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor his kindness. I simply want to join the Senator from Maryland to \nindicate that I think he has a valid point. If someone has a conflict \nof interest, obviously that ought to be addressed.\n  I believe the plain language of the bill on page 100 covers that: \n``will not fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class.'' I \nthink that covers it. But if there is better language or more language, \nI want to assure him I will support it, and I will be glad to join him \nin that effort.\n  But, Mr. President, the point remains, we are not dealing with \ndisqualifications on that basis. What we are dealing with is a whole \nnew way to stack the deck, where someone with very few shares who \nbrings the suit can control the action and pick the attorney, and \nsomeone who has a lot more shares and yet not be as rich, as has been \nused on this floor, will be closed out of the process. Stacking the \ndeck is the problem with this amendment. If we eliminate that portion \nof it, I think we would have something that all parties could work \ntogether on.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to ask my friend from Colorado a \nquestion. My friend from Colorado made two attacks on this Senator's \namendment, certainly not on the Senator, so I do not take it personally \nat all. The two attacks were, one, that the Senator from California \nsaid the richest investor and he took umbrage and said, ``Well, wait a \nminute, the word 'richest' is not in the bill.'' OK, that is right, the \nlargest investor--I say the richest investor. I stand by that, with all \ndue respect.\n  Second, the Senator says that only a certain number of the plaintiffs \ncan, in fact, vote on who the plaintiff should be. The fact is if the \nBoxer amendment becomes law, every single potential plaintiff in the \ncountry, member of the class action, has an opportunity to be part of \nthe selection. This is not some secret thing of stuffing the ballot \nbox. Any plaintiff who joins the class, petitions the court, votes.\n  Now, if the Senator believes that the largest investor would not get \ninvolved in that, I do not know what the Senator thinks. But the fact \nis I do not care who the attorney is who gets to represent either side. \nIt does not make a whit's worth of difference to me. What I care is \nthat the lead plaintiff be selected in a way that is fair.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Banking Committee never held a \nhearing on this and it shows up in the bill 4 days before the markup. \nIt is wrong to legislate this way. I believe it is elitist.\n  I pointed out to this Chamber last night that if S. 240 had been law \nduring the Keating case and the richest investor, or as my friend would \nprefer, the largest investor had been named lead plaintiff, it would \nhave been someone who was guilty along with Keating, someone who \nactually wound up paying to make those----\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield at this time. I have very little time. I \nask my friend from New Mexico if he wishes to have a couple of minutes \nin this debate. I will reserve that for him.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will respond that I would like a \ncouple minutes to support the amendment by the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 2 minutes to my friend, and then I will conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me briefly say I support the effort of the Senator \nfrom California to amend the bill in this regard. This provision, this \nmost adequate plaintiff idea, as I understand, was proposed as part of \na substitute in committee. There was no hearing held on it. I believe \nthat is the case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could say, the Senator is correct, there have been \nno \n\n[[Page S 9115]]\nhearings on this issue. It was not considered at any point until it \nappeared in the draft.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think one of the hallmarks of our \nlegal system has always been that a person's right to go to court or a \nperson's right to have his or her case presented in court should not be \nstrictly tied to the person's financial condition. We should not means \ntest justice, as the saying goes.\n  I think where you get a provision like this where there is a \npresumption that the plaintiff who has the most invested is the most \nadequate plaintiff and, therefore, should control the litigation, that \ncomes very close to means testing justice. It causes me great concern \nthat we would have this kind of a provision.\n  Clearly, there have been groundless lawsuits brought, and that is the \npurpose. The purpose of this legislation is to deal with that. I \nunderstand that. I support this legislation. I am a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, but when I cosponsored it, there was no provision in it \nfor most adequate plaintiff.\n  Now there is a presumption that those who have the most invested \nshould control the litigation. I do not know that that is always true. \nI do not know that that should always be the case. Therefore, I do have \nproblems with the bill as it now stands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator another 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will just say, the Senator from California has made a \nvery good-faith effort to correct this. I support her efforts. I hope \nthe Senate will adopt her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 43 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I gave an example of if S. 240 was the law \nand who would be the lead plaintiff in the Keating case. Let me give \nanother example.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last night that a Wall Street \ninvestment bank filed a class action suit against Avon Products for \nsecurities fraud. That Wall Street bank was supposed to represent the \ninterest of small investors, but the Journal reported that that Wall \nStreet bank tried to get Avon to settle the case by giving them $50 \nmillion to invest. That is the way they thought they would act in the \nbest interest of the class.\n  Now I say to my friends, this is absurd. There is no way that small \ninvestors would have benefited from that type of a settlement, and this \nbill would prevent those small investors from discovering the secret \ndeal because they would have to know about it before they could use \nsubpoenas.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Boxer-Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Section 102 of the legislation would require courts to \nconsider a motion by a purported class member to become a lead \nplaintiff and would require courts to appoint as lead plaintiff the \nclass member ``most capable of adequately representing the interests of \nthe class member.'' The bill sets up a rebuttable presumption that the \nmost adequate plaintiff is the person who has made such a motion, who \nhas the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class, \nand who satisfies the requirements of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. This presumption may be rebutted if a member of the \nclass proves that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff will not \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class or is subject \nto unique defenses.\n  What is the purpose of this provision?\n  Mr. DODD. This provision has two essential purposes. First, it will \nimprove class member choice, by giving class members an opportunity to \nrequest service as lead plaintiff. Second, it will enhance a court's \nability to appoint as lead plaintiff any class member who has requested \nservice and who otherwise meets the conditions of the provision.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would this provision require courts to name any \ninstitutional investor as lead plaintiff?\n  Mr. DODD. No. Under the bill, a court may only appoint a plaintiff \nwho has asked, in a motion to the court, to serve as lead plaintiff. \nMoreover, the institutional investor who asks to serve must satisfy the \nconditions of rule 23, which authorizes the court to determine whether \nsuch a party should serve as representative plaintiff in order to \nfacilitate management of the case. The court also has to determine that \nthe party who asks to serve has the largest financial interest in the \nrelief sought. Finally, the presumption as to most adequate lead \nplaintiff could be rebutted under the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would the bill require any institutional investor to \nrequest that its be appointed as lead plaintiff?\n  Mr. DODD. No. The bill merely gives each class member the opportunity \nto request service. In no way does it obligate any member to do so. \nInstitutional and other investors would continue to have the right \nsimply to remain class members and not serve as lead plaintiff, and \nthey may select that approach independent of any responsibility to the \nother class members or to anyone else.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Does this bill impose any new fiduciary duty on an \ninstitutional investor to its shareholders or beneficiaries, or to \nother class members, to request service as lead plaintiffs?\n  Mr. DODD. No. The bill imposes no fiduciary or other obligation on \ninstitutions or other plaintiffs to serve or not to serve as lead \nplaintiffs. Moreover, the court would have no authority to impose such \nan obligation. For example, rule 23 authorizes the court to make \ncertain determinations about who should serve as representative \nplaintiff. These determinations concern management of the case, and \nthey do not authorize the court to require a plaintiff to serve as \nrepresentative due to any perceived responsibility to the other class \nmembers or to anyone else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1474\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now is \non agreeing to amendment No. 1474, offered by the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Bryan]. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered. The \nSenator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I believe under the procedure we are \nfollowing, the Senator has 1 minute to set out his amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 2 minutes for debate prior to the \nsecond vote.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 minute equally \ndivided for Senator Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not believe the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. As relates to the Boxer amendment, have the yeas and \nnays have been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make this very clear. I have said \nit ad nauseam. The Bryan amendment has nothing to do with frivolous \nlawsuits. The question is whether or not the Senate wants to go on \nrecord as tolerating, allowing, and permitting the conduct of aiders \nand abettors, whether intentional, knowingly, or reckless, to go \nunpunished. That is the state of the law.\n  This amendment would say that lawyers, accountants, bankers, and \nothers that aid and abet securities fraud will be held liable. That was \nthe law until the Central Bank case was decided, and the Supreme Court \nin deciding that case made it clear that they were not saying that \naiders and abettors ought not to be liable. They just very narrowly \ninterpreted the statute. We have hit the plaintiffs' lawyers for their \nfrivolous actions, but how can we ignore the conduct of lawyers who \ncounsel \n\n[[Page S 9116]]\nthose perpetrating securities fraud? If we fail to adopt the Bryan \namendment, we are simply saying to that group of lawyers that you can \ncontinue and be free to continue your activities, and that may cost \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars to innocent investors.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, what the Senator from Nevada \nis doing here is raising a whole new standard that was never \nuniversally the case prior to the Central Bank of Denver. Here, in the \namendment, the standard is knowing and reckless--knowing or reckless. \nAnd to include recklessness here, a standard that is so vague the \ncourts have had great difficulty defining it, would be to open up a \nwhole new area of law and allow proportionate liability to be gutted as \na result of this amendment. What we have done with this bill is, of \ncourse, allowed the SEC to bring a Government action in the aiding and \nabetting.\n  Where you do have fraudulent intent, joint and several applies. \nProportionate liability does not. In that case, where you have even the \ncasual conduct of an aider and abettor, they would be trapped. We try \nto avoid when you do not have that standard being met, just a small \nmistake, which can be the case of a lawyer or accountant, In the \nprocess, should not be held fully accountable for the entire cost. So \nthe adoption of this amendment would destroy that very effort which is \ncentral to this bill. So, for those reasons, because recklessness is \nused here--were this to be an actual knowledge--words of art in \ndescribing that--I might have some different views on this amendment. \nBut the fact of it is, using the recklessness standard, I think, takes \nthis far beyond where we even were before--before the Supreme Court \nruled in the Central Bank of Denver case, where certain courts in this \nland held it to a much higher standard than recklessness.\n  So for that reason, I reluctantly urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I inquire? I did not know if the Senator from \nCalifornia wanted to use her 1 minute now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In between the votes, I believe, is what the unanimous-\nconsent says. I would prefer it before the next vote, before the vote \non the Boxer amendment, which is what it said in the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, very briefly, if S. 240 as currently \nwritten had been the law then, the lead plaintiff in the Keating case \nwould have been one of the guilty parties in the Keating case. That is \nbecause S. 240 says the judge must choose the largest investor as the \nlead plaintiff and the largest investor in the Keating case turned out \nto be a party to the fraud.\n  Let us not allow this outrage. This ``largest investor'' language was \nadded, without public hearings, 4 days before markup. The SEC has \nproblems with it.\n  The Boxer-Bingaman amendment says the following, that after \nadvertising for 90 days, all the plaintiffs----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold until we have order. \nThe Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Boxer-Bingaman amendment says that after advertising \nfor 90 days, all the plaintiffs get to select the lead plaintiff. If \nthey cannot agree unanimously, then the judge will choose the lead \nplaintiff, taking into consideration all factors, including conflicts \nof interest, who the largest investor is, et cetera. Just because \nsomeone is rich should not automatically make them the lead plaintiffs. \nSupport Boxer-Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, our bill stops the kind of outrageous \nconduct where the same handful of plaintiffs bring multiple complaints. \nMr. Cooperman has been a plaintiff 14 times and has always chosen the \nsame law firm.\n  Mr. Shore, 10 times, a professional plaintiff.\n  Mr. Shields, seven times.\n  Mr. Steinberg, seven times.\n  William Steiner, six times. They become the lead plaintiffs, they \npick the attorneys. Our legislation would prohibit that.\n  This legislation would give due deference to lead the case to someone \nwho has a real financial stake, not a phony professional plaintiff. \nThis amendment would keep alive that race to the courthouse. That is \nwhy I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe under the consent order my \nfriend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, is to be \nrecognized for the purpose of offering an amendment. I have asked him \nto give me the opportunity--and if it looks like I am looking around, I \nam, because staff was supposed to prepare an amendment dealing with the \nissue of safe harbor. And in that provision we call for knowingly, \nintent, and expectation.\n  If I could have a copy of the bill itself, at page 121 of the bill it \nsays, ``knowingly made.'' These are statements that are knowingly made \nwith the expectation, purpose and actual intent of misleading \ninvestors.\n  There is a very real question as to what do we mean by \n``expectation,'' and do we go too far? I do not believe it is a word \nthat is necessary. I think it is gilding the lily, and for that purpose \nI would submit an amendment, the purpose of which is to delete the word \n``expectation,'' so that it would then read: ``knowingly made with the \npurpose and actual intent of misleading investors.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that I might be able to submit this amendment \nand have it considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1476:\n       On page 121, line 1, delete the word ``expectation,''.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have no illusions. I recognize that \nthis amendment does not answer all those questions or go as far as some \nmight like. But I certainly think it clears up something that would \nraise a question and is a move in the right direction, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I welcome the amendment from the Senator \nfrom New York. We spoke earlier about introducing it at this point \nahead of the general debate on safe harbor. I am quite amenable to that \nbecause I want to get a substantive result. This provision was going to \nbe a part of the debate had this not happened, I think as the Senator \nfrom New York well recognizes, but we are willing to forego the debate \npoints in order to try to clean something out of the bill. There is \nstill plenty wrong with it, and I am going to address that when we have \nthe general debate on safe harbor. But I support this modification that \nis being made in the bill, and I hope the Senate will accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am advised--and I mention this to my colleague and \nfriend--that there is another area of the bill that we will have to \nmodify because it is referred to a second time. But rather than do that \nat this point in time, I suggest that we go forward, and then later on \nI will make that modification.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why not go ahead?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. On page 114, line 7, we delete the word ``expectation'' \nas well. This was not done in the first. I ask that the amendment be \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 121, line 1, delete the word ``expectation,''.\n       On page 114, line 7, delete the word ``expectation,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1476), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think under the order I am to be \nrecognized at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1477\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the safe harbor provisions of the bill)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself and \n     Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 1477.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 112, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 126, line 14, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 105. SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Consideration of Regulatory or Legislative Changes.--In \n     consultation with investors and issuers of securities, the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission shall consider adopting or \n     amending rules and regulations of the Commission, or making \n     legislative recommendations, concerning--\n       (1) criteria that the Commission finds appropriate for the \n     protection of investors by which forward-looking statements \n     concerning the future economic performance of an issuer of \n     securities registered under section 12 of the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934 will be deemed not be in violation of \n     section 10(b) of that Act; and\n       (2) procedures by which courts shall timely dismiss claims \n     against such issuers of securities based on such forward-\n     looking statements if such statements are in accordance with \n     any criteria under paragraph (1).\n       (b) Commission Considerations.--In developing rules or \n     legislative recommendations in accordance with subsection \n     (a), the Commission shall consider--\n       (1) appropriate limits to liability for forward-looking \n     statements;\n       (2) procedures for making a summary determination of the \n     applicability of any Commission rule for forward-looking \n     statements early in a judicial proceeding to limit protracted \n     litigation and expansive discovery;\n       (3) incorporating and reflecting the scienter requirements \n     applicable to implied private actions under section 10(b); \n     and\n       (4) providing clear guidance to issuers of securities and \n     the judiciary.\n       (c) Securities Exchange Act of 1934.--Title I of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 73a et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 13 the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 37. APPLICATION OF SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING \n                   STATEMENTS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--In any implied private action arising \n     under this title that alleges that a forward-looking \n     statement concerning the future economic performance of an \n     issuer registered under section 12 was materially false or \n     misleading, if a party making a motion in accordance with \n     subsection (b) requests a stay of discovery concerning the \n     claims or defenses of that party, the court shall grant such \n     a stay until the court has ruled on the motion.\n       ``(b) Summary Judgment Motions.--Subsection (a) shall apply \n     to any motion for summary judgment made by a defendant \n     asserting that a forward-looking statement was within the \n     coverage of any rule which the Commission may have adopted \n     concerning such predictive statements, if such motion is made \n     not less than 60 days after the plaintiff commences discovery \n     in the action.\n       ``(c) Dilatory Conduct; Duplicative Discovery.--\n     Notwithstanding subsection (a) or (b), the time permitted for \n     a plaintiff to conduct discovery under subsection (b) may be \n     extended, or a stay of the proceedings may be denied, if the \n     court finds that--\n       ``(1) the defendant making a motion described in subsection \n     (b) engaged in dilatory or obstructive conduct in taking or \n     opposing any discovery; or\n       ``(2) a stay of discovery pending a ruling on a motion \n     under subsection (b) would be substantially unfair to the \n     plaintiff or to any other party to the action.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, this is the \nissue of safe harbor. I know many Members have heard about this issue. \nIn my judgment, it is an extremely important issue which we now seek to \ndevelop. We have actually addressed five major issues in this bill: \nJoint and several liability, statute of limitations, aiding and \nabetting, and safe harbor, and the lead plaintiff amendment that was \noffered by my distinguished colleague from California. \n\n[[Page S 9118]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, this is an extremely important amendment. It is a \nvery complex issue and some very able people have worked very hard to \nunderstand it and try to address it. I hope to develop it here over a \nreasonably short period.\n  This amendment that I have sent to the desk, this particular \namendment, does not try to define in the statute the standard for safe \nharbor. That may come later. What this amendment seeks to do is simply \nto put into this bill the provision on the issue of safe harbor that \nwas in the bill introduced by Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici.\n  I want to say to my colleagues who sponsored that bill that this \namendment is the provision you cosponsored. The provision that is in \nthe bill before us dealing with safe harbor is not the provision that \nwas in the bill which you cosponsored.\n  Some may say, ``Well, that's all right, I want the provision that's \nin this bill.'' But others may not say that. Every Member should \nunderstand that the provision that was in the bill which they \ncosponsored--a significant number of Members cosponsored--is the \nprovision that is in the amendment at the desk. That is the safe harbor \nprovision that people signed on to.\n  And what Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici had done is, in effect, \ncreate a regulatory safe harbor. They had placed the burden, as it \nwere, on the Securities and Exchange Commission to come up with a \ndefinition of safe harbor, and it set out certain standards by which \nthe Commission would be governed.\n  This is an extremely important matter. It is one about which the \nChairman of the Commission is very much concerned. And I submit to my \ncolleagues, at some point in this legislative process, Members ought to \nstop, look and listen and ask themselves whether they want to continue \nto be at variance or at odds with very strongly held opinions of the \nregulators, of the Chairman of the SEC, of the States securities \nregulators, particularly in a matter as difficult and as complex as the \nsafe harbor issue.\n  The regulators disagree with a majority of this body on the statute \nof limitations issue, but the statute of limitations issue is a \nrelatively easily understood issue. The question was, are you going to \nhave 1 and 3 years, or 2 and 5 years? That is not the safe harbor \nissue.\n  On May 19, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nwrote to the Banking Committee a four-page letter entirely devoted to \nthe safe harbor issue. Only the safe harbor issue was discussed in that \nfour-page letter.\n  The letter itself is complex, let alone the issue. The letter \nreflects the complexity of the issue.\n  In that letter, the Chairman states his interest in trying to have \nchanges in the securities litigation issue. He concedes that he would \nlike to see improvements in existing safe harbor provisions. He talks \nabout the need to get accurate forward projections, but he also talks \nabout the need to protect investors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am quoting:\n\n       A carefully crafted safe harbor protection for meritless \n     private lawsuits should encourage public companies to make \n     additional forward looking disclosure that would benefit \n     investors. At the same time, it should not compromise the \n     integrity of such information which is vital to both investor \n     protection and the efficiency of the capital markets, the two \n     goals of the Federal securities law.\n\n  Later he says, and I quote him:\n\n       A safe harbor must be balanced. It should encourage more \n     sound disclosure without encouraging either omission of \n     material information or irresponsible and dishonest \n     information.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       A safe harbor must be balanced. It should encourage more \n     sound disclosure without encouraging either omission of \n     material information or irresponsible and dishonest \n     information.\n       A safe harbor must be thoughtful so that it protects \n     considered projections but never fraudulent ones. A safe \n     harbor must also be practical. It should be flexible enough \n     to accommodate legitimate investor protection concerns that \n     may arise on both sides of the issue.\n       This is a complex issue in a complex industry and it raises \n     almost as many questions as it answers. Should the safe \n     harbor apply to information required by Commission rule, \n     including predictive information contained in the financial \n     statements, for example, pension liabilities and over-the-\n     counter derivatives? Should it extend to oral statements? \n     Should there be a requirement that forward looking \n     information that has become incorrect be updated if the \n     company or its insiders are buying or selling securities? \n     Should the safe harbor extend to disclosures made in \n     connection with a capital raising transaction on the same \n     basis as more routine disclosures as well? Are there \n     categories of transactions, such as partnership offerings or \n     going private transactions, that should be subject to \n     additional conditions?\n       There are many more questions that have arisen in the \n     course of the Commission's exploration of how to design a \n     safe harbor. We have issued a concept release, received a \n     large volume of comment letters in response and held 3 days \n     of hearing, both in California and Washington. In addition, I \n     have met personally with most groups that might conceivably \n     have an interest in the subject--corporate leaders, \n     investment groups, plaintiffs lawyers, defense lawyers, State \n     and Federal regulators, law professors and even Federal \n     judges.\n       The one thing I can state unequivocally is that this \n     subject eludes easy answers.\n\n  Let me repeat that last statement. This is Chairman Levitt:\n\n       The one thing I can state unequivocally is that this \n     subject eludes easy answers.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Given these complexities and in light of the enormous \n     amount of care, thought and work that the Commission has \n     already invested in the subject, my recommendation would be \n     that you provide broad rulemaking authority to the Commission \n     to improve the safe harbor.\n\n  He then goes on to address considerations if the committee tries to \nput in a legislative standard, instead of having a regulatory safe \nharbor. I think Chairman Levitt was absolutely right. That is obviously \nwhat Senators Dodd and Domenici thought when they put in their bill. I \ndo not know how many other people who cosponsored that bill agreed \nthat, in effect, giving this assignment to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission was the way to do it. As Chairman Levitt said:\n\n       Given these complexities and in light of the enormous \n     amount of care, thought and work that the Commission has \n     already invested in the subject, my recommendation would be \n     that you provide broad rulemaking authority to the Commission \n     to improve the safe harbor.\n\n  That is not what was done. The provision that was in the original \nbill, which is the amendment that is at the desk, was dropped from the \nbill and instead a legislative standard was substituted.\n  The provision that was in the bill that is on Members' desks, the \noriginal bill, is at page 19 through 22, and those pages, as Members \ncan all see, have been stricken. That is what Members originally signed \non to, and that provision has been, as you can see, lined out in this \nbill, and instead an effort has been made for this body to define the \nstandard in an extremely complex matter. As Chairman Levitt said:\n\n       The one thing I can state unequivocally is that this \n     subject eludes easy answers.\n\n  We have just seen an example of that. My distinguished colleague from \nNew York, just before I offered this amendment, got up to offer an \namendment to amend the standard that is in the bill. In other words, \nhere we are, they are conceding that the standard in the bill goes too \nfar and needs to be corrected, so we just amended it. I indicated I \nwelcome that amendment because I think this standard that is in the \nbill, even with the amendment, is an improper standard. But the fact \nthat the amendment was offered is a demonstration of the point I am \ntrying to make about the complexity of this issue and the wisdom of the \noriginal approach to, in effect, charge the Commission with the \nresponsibility of defining the safe harbor provision,\n a matter which the chairman has indicated he was, in fact, working on. \nNow, as people who were here just a few minutes ago noted, not only was \nit amended, but then my distinguished colleague from New York neglected \nto amend another section of the bill which also needed to be amended. \nSo you get some sense of how we are dealing with a very difficult \nissue. Here we are trying to jury-rig it at the last minute. Now, \nlater, if I have to, I will try to deal with the legislative standard, \nbut I think that fools are rushing in where angels fear to tread, \n\n[[Page S 9119]]\nwith all due respect to my colleagues. This is a matter that ought to \nbe put to the Securities and Exchange Commission, just as Senators Dodd \nand Domenici proposed in their initial legislation.\n\n  On May 19, Chairman Levitt wrote the Banking Committee a four-page \nletter on safe harbor only. This safe harbor is a catastrophe waiting \nto happen. And Members must keep in mind the danger that the safe \nharbor is going to become a haven for pirates. As I have said earlier, \nit will turn into a pirate's cove. That is where they will shield \nthemselves in order to really perpetrate some egregious frauds on the \ninvesting public.\n  Subsequent to the letter of May 19 from the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the majority within the Banking \nCommittee, including the sponsors of the earlier bill, departed from \ntheir approach in terms of charging the Commission with the \nresponsibility of developing a safe harbor. I mean, the Commission are \nthe experts, they can hold the hearings, and I will discuss in a minute \nthe hearings they held in trying to resolve this matter. But a majority \ndecided that, well, no, they were going to do a legislative standard.\n  Efforts began to develop an appropriate legislative standard in \ndiscussions with the SEC and others and with members of the committee \non both sides, including those of us that are now opposing this \nlegislation. But the end result of that discussion, unfortunately, was \nan inability to come to an agreement. The definition, the standard in \nthe bill I think is just fraught with danger. In fact, it was just \namended by the proponents of this legislation here on the floor only a \nmoment or two ago. They took out one element of it right here, \nobviously recognizing themselves the deficiencies in it. That \nillustrates the problem with this body trying to formulate a \nlegislative standard.\n  I welcome that substantive change, but I do think it illustrates, in \na rather demonstrative way, the problem with this body trying to write \nthe legislative standard rather than letting the SEC do it. Now, if we \nhave to write it, I will try to do it, but I think it is a mistake. \nThis is an opportunity for Members, in effect, to go back to the \nprovision that was in the bill.\n  Let me read what Chairman Levitt said about the provision that was in \nthe markup document. In other words, after this week of working, the \ncommittee moved with a document that had this definition, and this is \nwhat the Chairman said:\n\n       As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission--\n\n  This letter came on the morning of the markup.\n\n     I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to \n     receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  And then he discussed the problems that he saw with the provision \nthat is in this legislation. The Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission said, ``I cannot embrace proposals which allow \nwillful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does not the safe harbor provision do just that--make \nsure that willful fraud is still covered, expressly stating that the \nsafe harbor does not apply to knowing fraud?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator that I do not believe it does so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not know what else we can put in.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is why Chairman Levitt wrote the letter. He read \nthe provision in the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He wrote the letter about a lot of other issues besides \nthat. We addressed his concerns about willful fraud. We have knowledge \nand intent, which exempt people from the safe harbor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This letter was written the morning of the markup and \nwas directed to the very provision in the bill, as brought out of the \ncommittee. Senator Levitt wrote an earlier letter, which I quoted from \nearlier. I do not know if the Senator was on the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is not a Senator yet, is he? Arthur Levitt is not a \nSenator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Chairman Levitt.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to correct the Record.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am not sure who to apologize to about that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just to clear up the Record.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will not try to reach a conclusion, but I do lay out \na general apology for anyone who may have been offended by it. There \nmay be differing views of the matter.\n  But Chairman Levitt wrote an earlier letter, which I quoted from at \nsome length. At one point, it looked like maybe, if we were going to do \na statutory definition, we might be able to arrive at an appropriate \none. That did not work. The comment I just quoted is what he had to say \nabout the provision that is in the bill. This came to us on the morning \nof the markup.\n  Now, the Dodd-Domenici bill--and I must say to my two colleagues that \nhad we stuck with your bill, the number of issues in dispute here on \nthe floor would have been fewer. There still would have been some.\n  Your bill also had in it the statute of limitations issue, and it had \nan approach on safe harbor which I think was acceptable, which left us, \nof course, with the joint and several, on which there is, I think, a \nsharp difference in perception and philosophy. I recognize that. And \nthere is the aiding and abetting issue.\n  But the bill was introduced in the last Congress on March 24, 1994. I \nbelieve I am correct. If I am in error about that, I hope the two \ncosponsors will correct me, both of whom are here on the floor.\n  Now, that bill contained in it this charge to the SEC, which is in \nthe amendment that is at the desk, I say to my distinguished \ncolleagues. This amendment is your language, verbatim, from the bill as \nyou introduced it and the bill which a lot of Members cosponsored.\n  The SEC put out their concept release on safe harbor on October 13, \n1994. Let me just read the summary of their concept release and notice \nof hearing:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission is soliciting \n     comment on current practices relating to disclosure of \n     forward-looking information. In particular, the Commission \n     seeks comment on whether the safe harbor provisions for \n     forward-looking statements set forth in rule 175 under the \n     Securities Act of 1933, rule 3b-6 under the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934, rule 103(a) under the Public Utility \n     Holding Company Act of 1935, and rule 0-11 under the Trust \n     Indenture Act of 1939 are effective in encouraging disclosure \n     of voluntary forward-looking information and protecting \n     investments, or, if not, should be revised, and if revised, \n     how?\n       The Commission also seeks comment on various changes to the \n     existing safe harbor provisions that have been suggested by \n     certain commentators. Finally, the Commission is announcing \n     that public hearings will be held beginning February 13, \n     1995, to consider these issues.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Comments should be received on or before January 11, 1995. \n     Public hearings will begin at 10 a.m. on February 13, 1995. \n     Those who wish to testify at the hearings must notify the \n     Commission in writing of their intention to appear on or \n     before December 31, 1994.\n\n  So the Commission is moving to try to develop a safe harbor. I think \nit moved relatively promptly after it saw this signal of, in effect, \ncharging them with this mandate.\n  The Commission received 150 responses on the safe harbor issue. That \nis more witnesses, by far, more witnesses by far, than the Banking \nCommittee has heard from on all securities litigation issues. The \nBanking Committee hearings with respect to the safe harbor were \neclipsed by the SEC.\n  The SEC held public hearings, 2 days in Washington, February 13 and \nFebruary 14. Then a day in California on February 16.\n  At those public hearings they had 62 witnesses in all. Venture \ncapitalists, law professors, corporate executives, plaintiff's lawyers, \ndefense lawyers, institutional investors.\n  Mr. President, these are the hearing records of the SEC with respect \nto the matter of safe harbor for forward-looking statements.\n  Now, I submit to my colleagues that it is--I do not want to say sheer \nfolly, because at some point we may have to try to work out a \nlegislative standard--but it is certainly imprudent conduct, at the \nleast, to be trying to develop a standard here instead of allowing the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to develop the standard, which was \nrecognized by the original sponsors of this legislation.\n  I assume they will argue, ``Well, the Commission had not done it, and \ntherefore we are going to go ahead and do \n\n[[Page S 9120]]\nit.'' The fact is, the Commission is working to do it and trying to \nstruggle through some very difficult and complex issues as the Chairman \nof the Commission has stated.\n  He set out a number of questions which I read earlier, and I defy any \nMember of this body to take those questions and go through them and \ngive me an easy answer to them. Not only do I defy the Members, I defy \ntheir staffs to go through it, to go through those questions and work \nthrough them--the ones that the Chairman outlined in his letter; of \ncourse, there are many others, as he indicated--and give me an easy \nresponse.\n  As the Chairman pointed out, ``A safe harbor must be balanced. It \nshould encourage more sound disclosure without encouraging either \nomission of material information, or irresponsible and dishonest \ninformation.''\n  Actually, Chairman Levitt and others recognize the need to have more \ndisclosure of information. That is a desirable objective. The question \nis, what safeguards do we have to ensure that this disclosure of \ninformation is not going to set people up to be exploited in fraudulent \nschemes?\n  Chairman Levitt went on to say, ``A safe harbor must be thoughtful so \nthat it protects considered projections but never fraudulent ones. A \nsafe harbor must also be practical. It should be flexible enough to \naccommodate legitimate investor protection concerns that may arise on \nboth sides of the issue. This is a complex issue and a complex \nindustry. It raises almost as many questions as one answers.''\n  He then details some of those questions, and then goes on to say, \n``There are many more questions that have arisen in the course of the \nCommission's exploration of how to design a safe harbor. We have issued \na concept release, received a large volume of comment letters and \nresponse, and held 3 days of hearings, both in California and \nWashington. In addition, I have met personally with most groups that \nmight conceivably have an interest in the subject. Corporate leaders, \ninvestor groups, plaintiff's lawyers, defense lawyers, State and \nFederal regulators, law professors, and even Federal judges. The one \nthing I can state unequivocally, is that this subject eludes easy \nanswers.''\n  He then goes on to state his basic conclusion, which is, ``Given \nthese complexities and in light of the enormous amount of care, \nthought, and work that the Commission has already invested in the \nsubject, my recommendation would be that you provide broad rulemaking \nauthority to the Commission to improve the safe harbor.''\n  Mr. President, that is what the amendment at the desk does. I urge \nits adoption. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Chairman of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission I have no higher priority than to protect \n     American investors and ensure an efficient capital formation \n     process. I know personally just how deeply you share these \n     goals. In keeping with our common purpose, both the SEC and \n     the Congress are working to find an appropriate ``safe \n     harbor'' from the liability provisions of the federal \n     securities laws for projections and other forward-looking \n     statements made by public companies. Several pieces of \n     proposed legislation address the issue of the safe harbor and \n     the House-passed version, H.R. 1058, specifically defines \n     such a safe harbor.\n       Your committee is now considering securities litigation \n     reform legislation that will include a safe harbor provision. \n     Rather than simply repeat the Commission's request that \n     Congress await the outcome of our rulemaking deliberations \n     and thereby run the risk of missing an opportunity to provide \n     input for your own deliberations, I thought I would take this \n     opportunity to express my personal views about a legislative \n     approach to a safe harbor.\n       There is a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently \n     exists. The current rules have largely been a failure and I \n     share the disappointment of issuers that the rules have been \n     ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements. Our capital markets are built on the foundation \n     of full and fair disclosure. Analysts are paid and investors \n     are rewarded for correctly assessing a company's prospects. \n     The more investors know and understand management's future \n     plans and views, the sounder the valuation is of the \n     company's securities and the more efficient the capital \n     allocation process. Yet, corporate America is hesitant to \n     disclose projections and other forward-looking information, \n     because of excessive vulnerability to lawsuits if predictions \n     ultimately are not realized.\n       As a businessman for most of my life, I know all too well \n     the punishing costs of meritless lawsuits--costs that are \n     ultimately paid by investors. Particularly galling are the \n     frivolous lawsuits that ignore the fact that a projection is \n     inherently uncertain even when made reasonably and in good \n     faith.\n       This is not to suggest that private litigation under the \n     federal securities laws is generally counterproductive. In \n     fact, private lawsuits are a necessary supplement to the \n     enforcement program of the Commission. We have neither the \n     resources nor the desire to replace private plaintiffs in \n     policing fraud; it makes more sense to let private forces \n     continue to play a key role in deterrence, than to vastly \n     expand the Commission's role. The relief obtained from \n     Commission disgorgement actions is no substitute for private \n     damage actions. Indeed, as government is downsized and \n     budgets are trimmed, the investor's ability to seek redress \n     directly is likely to increase in importance.\n       To achieve our common goal of encouraging enhanced sound \n     disclosure by reducing the threat of meritless litigation, we \n     must strike a reasonable balance. A carefully crafted safe \n     harbor protection from meritless private lawsuits should \n     encourage public companies to make additional forward-looking \n     disclosure that would benefit investors. At the same time, it \n     should not compromise the integrity of such information which \n     is vital to both investor protection and the efficiency of \n     the capital markets--the two goals of the federal securities \n     laws.\n       The safe harbor contained in H.R. 1058 is so broad and \n     inflexible that it may compromise investor protection and \n     market efficiency. It would, for example, protect companies \n     and individuals from private lawsuits even where the \n     information was purposefully fraudulent. This result would \n     have consequences not only for investors, but for the market \n     as well. There would likely be more disclosure, but would it \n     be better disclosure? Moreover, the vast majority of \n     companies whose public statements are published in good faith \n     and with due care could find the investing public skeptical \n     of their information.\n       I am concerned that H.R. 1058 appears to cover other \n     persons such as brokers. In the Prudential Securities case, \n     Prudential brokers intentionally made baseless statements \n     concerning expected yields solely to lure customers into \n     making what were otherwise extremely risky and unsuitable \n     investments. Pursuant to the Commission's settlement with \n     Prudential, the firm has paid compensation to its defrauded \n     customers of over $700 million. Do we really want to protect \n     such conduct from accountability to these defrauded \n     investors? In the past two years or so, the Commission has \n     brought eighteen enforcement cases involving the sale of more \n     than $200 million of interests in wireless cable partnerships \n     and limited liability companies. Most of these cases involved \n     fraudulent projections as to the returns investors could \n     expect from their investments. Promoters of these types of \n     ventures would be immune from private suits under H.R. 1058 \n     as would those who promote blank check offerings, penny \n     stocks, and roll-ups. It should also address conflict of \n     interest problems that may arise in management buyouts and \n     changes in control of a company.\n       A safe harbor must be balanced--it should encourage more \n     sound disclosure without encouraging either omission of \n     material information or irresponsible and dishonest \n     information. A safe harbor must be thoughtful--so that it \n     protects considered\n      projections, but never fraudulent ones. A safe harbor must \n     also be practical--it should be flexible enough to \n     accommodate legitimate investor protection concerns that \n     may arise on both sides of the issue. This is a complex \n     issue in a complex industry, and it raises almost as many \n     questions as one answers: Should the safe harbor apply to \n     information required by Commission rule, including \n     predictive information contained in the financial \n     statements (e.g. pension liabilities and over-the-counter \n     derivatives)? Should it extend to oral statements? Should \n     there be a requirement that forward-looking information \n     that has become incorrect be updated if the company or its \n     insiders are buying or selling securities? Should the safe \n     harbor extend to disclosures made in connection with a \n     capital raising transaction on the same basis as more \n     routine disclosures as well? Are there categories of \n     transactions, such as partnership offerings or going \n     private transactions that should be subject to additional \n     conditions?\n       There are many more questions that have arisen in the \n     course of the Commission's exploration of how to design a \n     safe harbor. We have issued a concept release, received a \n     large volume of comment letters in response, and held three \n     days of hearings, both in California and Washington. In \n     addition, I have met personally with most groups that might \n     conceivably have an interest in the subject: corporate \n     leaders, investor groups, plaintiff's lawyers, defense \n     lawyers, state and Federal regulators, law professors, and \n     even Federal \n\n[[Page S 9121]]\n     judges. The one thing I can state unequivocally is that this subject \n     eludes easy answers.\n       Given these complexities--and in light of the enormous \n     amount of care, thought, and work that the Commission has \n     already invested in the subject--my recommendation would be \n     that you provide broad rulemaking authority to the Commission \n     to improve the safe harbor. If you wish to provide more \n     specificity by legislation, I believe the provision must \n     address the investor protection concerns mentioned above. I \n     would support legislation that sets forth a basic safe harbor \n     containing four components: (1) protection from private \n     lawsuits for reasonable projections by public companies; (2) \n     a scienter standard other than recklessness should be used \n     for a safe harbor and appropriate procedural standards should \n     be enacted to discourage and easily terminate meritless \n     litigation; (3) ``projections'' would include voluntary \n     forward-looking statements with respect to a group of \n     subjects such as sales, revenues, net income (loss), earnings \n     per share, as well as the mandatory information required in \n     the Management's Discussion and Analysis; and (4) the \n     Commission would have the flexibility and authority to \n     include or exclude classes of disclosures, transactions, or \n     persons as experience teaches us lessons and as circumstances \n     warrant.\n       As we work to reform the current safe harbor rules of the \n     Commission, the greatest problem is anticipating the \n     unintended consequences of the changes that will be made in \n     the standards of liability. The answer appears to be an \n     approach that maintains flexibility in responding to problems \n     that may develop. As a regulatory agency that administers the \n     Federal securities laws, we are well situated to respond \n     promptly to any problems that may develop, if we are given \n     the statutory authority to do so. Indeed, one possibility we \n     are considering is a pilot safe harbor that would be reviewed \n     formally at the end of a two year period. What we have today \n     is unsatisfactory, but we think that, with your support, we \n     can expeditiously build a better model for tomorrow.\n       I am well aware of your tenacious commitment to the \n     individual Americans who are the backbone of our markets and \n     I have no doubt that you share our belief that the interests \n     of those investors must be held paramount. I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on safe harbor and other issues \n     related to securities litigation reform.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arthur Levitt.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maryland to pay \nattention closely to this since it concerns him directly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the \nSarbanes amendment No. 1477 at 2:15 today and that the time between the \nbeginning of the debate and 2:15 be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, first of all, could I \ninquire of the Chair, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We began consideration of this amendment at \n11:09.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the Senator has used 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am agreeable to dividing the time \nbetween now and 12:30 equally, and then having half an hour after \nlunch, equally divided, and then going to a vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to confer with the chairman \nof the Banking Committee before agreeing to that. I have no personal \nobjection to it. I would think we ought to bring Senator D'Amato into \nthe discussion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Fine. I was not aware of this request until I just \nheard it. I do think we should have some time after the caucus on the \ndebate--after the conference luncheon.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I propound a unanimous-consent request \nthat the time between now and 12:30 be equally divided on this issue, \nand leave the unanimous-consent request as to the exact time of the \nvote for a later request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from Maryland \ntalk at great length about all of the hearings and the comments and the \nlegal aspects of this.\n  Once again, I would like to talk about it from the standpoint of the \nchief executive officer, struggling to maintain the investor confidence \nin his company, and bring an appropriate return to investors, and talk \nabout how this safe harbor circumstance would actually work.\n  A chief executive officer, having been one, sees dozens, maybe \nhundreds, of memorandum, every week. He engages in any number of \nconversations with individuals in the company in any given week about \nany particular subject. That is the fact against which I want to paint \nthe picture of how this thing works.\n  We have been having this discussion about weakening a standard, safe \nharbor; where should the threshold be? I think the issue comes down, do \nwe want a safe harbor or not? If we want one, it has to be safe, or we \nshould not go through the exercise.\n  Now, the opponents have suggested that the safe harbor in the bill \nis, in fact, a pirate's cove.\n  Let me list, Mr. President, the pirates who are not welcome in this \ncove. That is, the pirates who would be denied the right to sail into \nthis particular harbor, by the bill.\n  A blank check company, a blind investment pool that does not tell \nanybody how they invest, a penny stock company, a rollup transaction, a \ngoing private transaction. Not to imply these people are pirates, but \nthey could not get into the cove. A mutual fund. It is very significant \nthat that is on the list because that is where most of the seniors \ninvest their money. They do not go out and individually pick stocks \nunless they have some experience at that. They buy a mutual fund. A \nmutual fund cannot come into this particular harbor. A limited \npartnership. A tender officer. Anyone filing certain ownership reports \nwith the SEC. Or information in the financial statements is excluded. \nAnd of course any company that has recently committed a violation of \nthe antifraud provisions of the securities laws cannot sail into the \nharbor.\n  Those kinds of restrictions are already out there. So the safe harbor \nis not for the pirates. It is for the people who do not fall into those \ncategories.\n  Now, for those in the harbor, they have some requirements written \ninto the bill. They must clearly state that any projection they are \nmaking is, in fact, a statement about the future, and they must clearly \nstate, here in the words of the bill, ``The risk that actual results \nmay differ materially from such projections, states, or descriptions.''\n  In other words, there is not a risk that we might be off a day or \ntwo. There is not a risk that we might be off a penny or two. There is \na risk that the actual results may differ materially from the \nprojections or estimates. Then, of course, we have the language that \nthe bill does not permit companies to take advantage of the safe harbor \nif they act with ``the purpose and actual intent of misleading \ninvestors.'' This is the language of the bill that we have before us.\n  Those are the requirements in this particular harbor; those that \nprevent people from coming in in the first place and those who govern \nthe people who are there.\n  Let me explain why it is important that we not further lower the \nthreshold that we have established with the words ``purpose'' and \n``actual intent of misleading investors.'' Here is how things work in \nan actual company, as I say speaking from experience as a chief \nexecutive officer. You gather all of your people around you. You look \nat the memos and the other reports that come out, and you inevitably \nfind that there is a difference of opinion about just about everything \ngoing on in your company. Let us talk about a new product.\n  Some of your people say to you, ``Oh. Our product, product X, will be \navailable right on schedule in August. You can depend on it. You can \ntake it to the bank.'' Others will say, ``No. We are a little worried. \nWe may not make it in August. We have this problem. We have that \nproblem. Our supplier may not come through. We may miss the target \ndate.'' You are the chief executive officer. You have to decide. You \nhave a meeting coming up with a group of security analysts, and they \nare going to ask you point blank, ``When will product X be on the \nmarket?'' You want to give them the very best information you can.\n  So you sift through all of this and ultimately you have to make a \ndecision. And you decide based on the track record of the people who \nare advising you that you think product X is a pretty good bet to be on \nline in August just as you anticipated it would. You go before the \nanalyst meeting. And they say \n\n[[Page S 9122]]\nto you, ``When will product X be available?'' You say, ``Well, it is my \nbest judgment that it will be available in August. I have to qualify \nthat by saying that is my estimate. I tell you there are some people in \nthe company who do not think it will be available in August. But the \nbest I can tell, my guess, my prediction, is that we will deliver \nproduct X in August.'' He can maybe put some other caveats in. You \nknow, this is very sophisticated. The analysts do not hear any of that. \nThey are like pollsters. ``Who is ahead? Who is going to win the \nelection?'' ``No. We want to know what your numbers say right now.'' \nAnd they do not listen to the caveats. The CEO can put in all the \ncaveats he wants. But they are going to walk away saying, ``He \npredicted that is going to come out in August.''\n  Now we get to August. What happens? Any one of a number of things \nhappens. Frankly, they do not have to be the kinds of things projected \nin the memo that the division manager who said it might not happen in \nAugust included. There could be a hurricane in Florida where one of \nyour suppliers is and the supplier cannot provide the parts that you \nwere depending on. There was no way you could predict that. There are \nany number of things that could have happened. But you get to August, \nand the company puts out a press release saying product X has been \ndelayed and will not be introduced until sometime later in the fall.\n  Bang--the analysts pound the stock. There is wild speculation. I have \nseen those. We have all seen those. They go through the marketplace--\nall kinds of rumors, the company has serious problems, their management \nis in difficulty, so and so is going to get fired, the stock drops 10 \npercent, and within a week strike suits are filed naming the company, \nits chief executive officer, and a bunch of other officers for \nconspiring to put out false information about product X and misleading \nthe marketplace.\n  Product X comes out in September. It is a great hit. The stock price \nrecovers. Presumably nobody is hurt. But, frankly, all of that is \nirrelevant because the legal machinery is now in motion and they do not \ncare what is happening to the product or the company. Whether they want \nto or not, the top management of that company must now focus on an \nissue that is irrelevant to the management of the business; and, if I \nmay, Mr. President, to the detriment of the investors in that company \nbecause the investors in that company want top management focusing on \nsales. They want top management focusing on efficiency. They want top \nmanagement focusing on cutting costs and opening new markets. But \ninstead they have a situation where in the name of the investors the \nlegal machinery is forcing the top management of that company to focus \non something totally unproductive--coming up with a defense against the \ncharges that they mislead the public.\n  Discovery: That great word in the legal lexicon; discovery starts, \nand it goes to every piece of paper that has to do with product X, and \nevery memorandum that may have crossed the CEO's desk. And they find \nthe memo from the fellow who says, ``I don't think we are going to be \nready in August.'' And, bingo, we have a smoking gun. No reference is \nmade to the other opinions now. In court the reference is all going to \nhammer in on this one fateful memo, and, ``Mr. CEO, did you read this \nmemo?'' If, he says yes, he not only has knowledge that product X was \nnot going to come in, he has actual knowledge, not just imputed \nknowledge, actual knowledge. He admits he read the memo. Nail him to \nthe wall.\n  That is what happens if he does not have the safe harbor that we have \nwritten into this act. Let us assume that this company is not one of \nthose that is kept out of the harbor, the list I read in the beginning. \nIt is one of those that is allowed into the harbor and without the \nharbor that is what happens.\n  Now suppose we have the reckless standard that people have argued \nfor. This would be a very easy standard for a plaintiff's lawyer to \nmeet in the circumstance I have described. Arguably any projection \nabout the future is reckless. ``You do not know, Mr. CEO, that the \nfuture is going to produce this product in August. It was reckless of \nyou to say that you would have it in August. You may have believed it \nbut it was a reckless statement.'' There is no protection for the CEO \nin this circumstance with the term ``reckless.'' No. He needs the safe \nharbor of the bill.\n  And the question is how safe should that harbor be? Well, if we had \nthe simple knowledge standard that the SEC suggests, the question is, \n``Well, did you know that this product would not meet its date in \nAugust? Well, here is a memo in the company. It came over your desk. \nYou read it. If you did not know, you should have known.'' Simple \nknowledge can be twisted in the hands of a careful lawyer, and the CEO \nhas a very difficult time explaining this circumstance.\n  So a knowledge standard, even an actual knowledge standard, is not \ngoing to be a safe harbor. It is not going to protect the CEO. And \nagain the point, Mr. President, it is not going to be for the benefit \nof the investors because the CEO is not going to be able to be doing \nwhat he is hired by the investors to do--run the company. He is going \nto be worrying about this particular problem.\n  This is the kind of thing that drives companies to settle out of \ncourt and to say, ``Well, we really did not do anything wrong but in \norder to get back to the business of making products and out of the \nbusiness of prosecuting lawsuits, we will settle even though we are \npretty sure we did not do anything wrong.''\n  No. What we need to have is what we have in this bill, a safe harbor \nthat says not only did the CEO have knowledge but he acted with the \npurpose and actual intent of misleading investors. Now that no one can \ntolerate. That clearly must not be allowed. But it must be the purpose \nand actual intent of misleading investors before the CEO is driven out \nof the harbor.\n  Why actual intent? Because without it intent can be implied in a \nnumber of circumstances. ``You saw this memo, the very fact that you \ndecided to ignore it in your presentation to the security analyst, Mr. \nCEO, implies that you intended to deceive them.'' No. The standard must \nbe higher than that. You must prove that he had the actual intent, that \nhe had the purpose of deceiving investors before you drag him into that \narea.\n  Is this a high threshold? I think it is an appropriate threshold \nbecause it fits the reality of the circumstances, and it prevents \nplaintiffs from accusing companies and officers of committing fraud \nsimply because documents of differing opinions exist somewhere in the \nfile. You have to go beyond that. You have to prove actual intent.\n  If I may stray into waters that I probably should not, since I have \nnot gone to law school, but I have had some experience in this area, it \nis a little like the standards that we apply in the first amendment.\n  If a newspaper inadvertently prints something that is inaccurate, \nthey cannot be held for libel unless it is proven that they acted with \nmalice, with actual intent, if you will, to harm the reputation of the \nindividual. Thus free speech is allowed to go forward unimpeded, \nhowever damaging it is to the individual involved. Having been the \nindividual involved in some circumstances, I know how hard sometimes \nthat is to accept.\n  But that is the standard we have created in that circumstance, and I \nthink the language in this bill holds that same kind of standard.\n  Now, Mr. President, I come to the final question, which is what I \nthink we should focus on here. Whom are we trying to protect? With all \nof this legislation, whom do we seek to benefit? What is the purpose of \nall of this? Are we trying to protect CEO's? Are we trying to protect \nlawyers? Are we trying to protect security analysts and newspapers that \nreport things? Whom are we trying to protect at base by all of this \nlegislation? The answer, Mr. President, is the investor. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to protect the investor and his or her investment.\n  Look at every issue that we are talking about here through that \nparticular lens. Is it good for the investor or is it bad for the \ninvestor? Is it good for the investor to have the CEO feel constrained \nabout talking about the prospects of his company? Is it good for the \ninvestor to have the CEO being hedged about by lawyers who tell him \nwhen he goes before the security analyst: You cannot talk about this; \nyou cannot talk about that; you cannot make any speculation of any kind \nlest you run \n\n[[Page S 9123]]\nthe risk of exposing yourself to these kinds of suits later on.\n  I submit that it is good for the investor to have the CEO be as open \nand candid as he possibly can be and to say to the security analyst: \nYes, it is my judgment that product X will be on the market in August. \nBecause what if he is right and product X is on the market in August, \nand he did not tell anybody that and they did not have the opportunity \nto buy the stock in the expectation that that would be the case?\n  Is it good for the investors to have him say: I have differences of \nopinion within the company; there are some people who do not think it \nwill be.\n  Yes, it is good for the investors to have him be as candid and open \nas possible. And the only way you can get that kind of candid, open \ndiscussion is if you have a safe harbor in which that honest CEO can \nsail knowing that he will be protected from the waves and whims of the \nshark suits that are out there.\n  Is it good for the investor or is it bad for the investor to have the \nCEO's attention diverted into lawsuits that have nothing whatever to do \nwith the management of the company? I submit it is bad for the investor \nto have the CEO concentrating on things other than the things for which \nhe was hired. And ultimately, is it good for the investor or is it bad \nfor the investor to have the company paying out millions of dollars in \nlegal fees on issues that are tangential to the company's performance?\n  I submit it is bad for the investor, and it becomes doubly bad for \nthe investor when, as we have seen over and over again in the debate on \nthis bill, the highest percentage of those fees and fines being paid \nout by the investor--those are the investor's moneys; those are not the \nCEO's moneys. When you say those are the company's moneys, there is \nonly one source of company money, and that is the investor. That is the \ninvestor's money going out, with the vast bulk of it going out to the \nplaintiff's attorneys and not the investor. They say: Oh, look, we are \nprotecting the investor. Look at the money that is going back to the \ninvestor.\n  No, the money is going back to the lawyer, and in the meantime all of \nthe money and attention and activity on behalf of the management of the \ncompany has been focusing on this suit.\n  That is why they settle, Mr. President. They settle because it is \ngood for the investors and for them to get this thing behind them. But \nit would be better for the investors if honest executives who have no \nintent and no purpose of deceiving have a safe harbor from which they \ncan explain to the public the things that are going on in the company \nand make statements about the future fully hedged about with \nprotections that say these are speculations so that the investor then \nhas information from which to make his or her own intelligent \ndecisions.\n  So, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland. I enjoy serving with him on the Banking \nCommittee. I enjoy the intellect and I enjoy the thoroughness with \nwhich he approaches these decisions, and I hope he recognizes it is not \nan act of disrespect on my part when I say I disagree with him on this \namendment and intend to vote against it and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. today, \nSenator Kassebaum be recognized in morning business for not to exceed 5 \nminutes, and that at the hour of 2:20 p.m. there be 40 minutes of \ndebate on the Sarbanes amendment No. 1477, equally divided in the usual \nform, with the vote occurring on or in relation to the Sarbanes \namendment at 3 p.m. today, with no second-degree amendments in order to \nthe amendment; further, that following the disposition of the Sarbanes \namendment No. 1477, Senator Sarbanes be recognized to offer an \namendment regarding safe harbor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have \nindicated a desire to have an up-or-down vote on the amendment. Does \nthe Senator have any problem with that?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no problem with that, but I cannot \nbind other Senators who may wish to make a motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I would have no objection to that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So with that amendment to the unanimous consent \nrequest, I have no objection.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, on the Sarbanes amendment there would be no motion \nto table.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me just, if I can, make a couple of observations here about this \namendment and the history----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the time remaining is under the control \nof the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I do not think that is correct, in all \nfairness to my colleague. I wish to be fair. I think the agreement was \nwe would divide equally the time between 11:10, as I understood it, \nwhen we went----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \nunanimous-consent be amended to be as the Senator from Maryland \nremembers it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thought that is what it was.\n  It would not be fair to divide the time from 11:45 equally since the \ntime before 11:45 was consumed, not quite but primarily, on one side. \nThat is not really fair to my colleagues, and I recognize that. I think \nif we divided it--was it from 11:15 on?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It was 11:09.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If that time were divided equally, what would the time \nsituation now be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland would have 10 \nminutes, and the Senator from Utah would have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that that be the state of the \ntime from this time until we break for lunch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that would mean from the time we went on this \namendment, all time would have been equally divided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Utah. I yield myself 5 minutes. \nIf the Chair would remind me at the end of 5 minutes so as not to take \ntoo much time on this because a lot has been said already about it.\n  Mr. President, let me make a couple of observations to underscore the \npoint that my colleague from Utah has already addressed. Some of my \ncolleagues have said that the safe harbor provisions of S. 240 do not \ngo as far as some would suggest. First, our provisions of safe harbor \nlimit significantly the circumstances in which the safe harbor applies.\n  I think it is very important to lay out as clearly as I can here, \nwhat is included and what is excluded.\n  The safe harbor provisions of S. 240 apply only--only--to statements \nmade by issuers or outside reviewers retained by issuers. Statements by \nstockbrokers are not protected at all under S. 240's safe harbor. \nCertain issuers are excluded. Not all issuers are included; some are \nexcluded from safe harbor, including anyone who has violated securities \nlaws within the prior 3 years. Penny stock companies, blank check \ncompanies, investment companies, all companies, Mr. President, are \nexcluded from the safe harbor when they engage in certain types of \ntransactions such as IPO's, initial public offerings. The tender \noffers, rollup transactions, all of those are excluded. So this is a \nvery narrow provision here. All information contained in historical \nfinancial statements is excluded as well.\n  Second, Mr. President, the safe harbor applies only to projections or \nestimates that are identified--they must be identified--as forward \nlooking statements and that refer ``clearly and \n\n[[Page S 9124]]\nproximately'' to ``the risk that actual results may differ \nmaterially''--that is the language, ``the risk that actual results may \ndiffer materially''--from the projection or estimate.\n  That goes right to the heart of what the Senator from Utah was \ntalking about. This is a very narrow area we are talking about, and the \npoint is to create a safe harbor. Why do you create a safe harbor? \nBecause we are trying to solicit from these issuers as much information \nas possible so that a potential buyer can have as much awareness as \npossible about where this stock or where this company is likely to go. \nIt is in the interest of the investor that we get as much of that \ninformation as possible.\n  There is no requirement in law that an issuer even put out forward \nlooking statements. In fact, what has happened lately is a lot of them \nhave retreated from that very advantageous idea because of the very \nsituation we find ourselves in today. So it is in our interest to \nsolicit this kind of information, but in doing so, we say, ``Look, we \nwant you to share as much information about where you think this \ncompany is going, where this stock is going so that investors will make \nintelligent decisions.''\n  In doing so, if you do anything--and we say very clearly in the bill \nif you do anything that knowingly with purpose or intent of misleading \ninvestors, on page 121 of this bill, we now take out the word \n``expectation''--knowingly made with the purpose or intent of \nmisleading investors, then you are excluded. Not only excluded, you are \nsubject to the penalties of the law.\n  So anyone who knowingly with intent to mislead in those forward \nlooking statements is subject to the provisions of the law that apply \nin this piece of legislation before us. But the idea is to get that \ninformation out, and it seems to me that is in everyone's interest.\n  You have to strike that balance. There are those who are opposed to \nsafe harbor. I disagree with them; I understand it. I do not think \nanyone who has really looked at the larger issues would agree with it. \nSo we have attempted with this legislation to craft the safe harbor \nprovisions.\n  My colleague from Maryland has correctly pointed out that in the \nearlier bill we introduced some 17 months ago, we asked the SEC to try \nto develop a regulatory scheme to deal with safe harbor. I must say, I \nhave heard now for the last 2 days a lot of these kudos and praise over \nthe bill that we introduced last March. I would very much have liked to \nhave passed a bill in the previous Congress in this area, but I could \nnot get that kind of support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to proceed for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish we had some of that support. The very \npeople today who find the previous bill so attractive, I must say \ncandidly, were not exactly racing to support the legislation when it \npotentially could have been adopted in the last Congress.\n  Putting that aside, let me also point out to my colleagues, having \nmade the offer 17 months ago to have the SEC move, frankly, the SEC has \nnot moved, and I am convinced today they would not move on this.\n  There is ample evidence to indicate that that suspicion of mine is \ncorrect. In a June 22 edition of the Bureau of National Affairs \npublication, which follows legislation dealing with financial \ninstitutions, under securities, the headline is, ``SEC safe harbor \ninitiative may be overtaken by litigation reform.'' Following are \nseveral pertinent paragraphs I think support what I am saying:\n\n       Although one agency official stated in late March that SEC \n     action in its October concept release was imminent, that has \n     not materialized. Rather, the SEC remains at the concept-\n     release stage on the initiative. Its inaction during the 8 \n     months since release was issued has been attributed by some \n     observers to some differences of opinion within the \n     Commission on various issues connected with the initiative.\n\n  Another Commissioner, Richard Roberts, told BNA June 21 that there \nare bona fide reasons that the Commission did not act quickly on the \nconcept release, including questions about the agency's authority in \nthe area of forward looking information.\n  Again, we just were not getting the action in this area.\n  It is a complex area. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely \ncorrect. Anyone who suggests otherwise has not spent any time looking \nat this. But I will argue, despite the fact that our original bill \ntried to get the SEC to come forward in this area--in fact they have \nnot--that there is a good case to be made that leaving these matters \njust up to the regulatory bodies or, as we have seen in other cases \ndealing with aiding and abetting, for instance, to the courts, is not a \nwise way to go ultimately.\n  In many matters here, we ought to be trying to establish through the \nlegislative process what our intent is. So while I welcomed in the past \nthe SEC's efforts in this regard, that was not forthcoming. Now it is \nbeing suggested by those who opposed the bill last year that I ought to \ngo back to my earlier position on this matter, even though the SEC did \nnot move in this area, given the 17 months they had an opportunity to \ndo so.\n  Letters are being bandied about. The letter of May 19 from the \nChairman of the SEC certainly recognizes that there is a need to \nstrengthen the safe harbor provisions. In fact, in paragraph 3 of \nChairman Levitt's letter on May 19, he says:\n\n       There is a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently \n     exists. The current rules have largely been a failure, and I \n     share the disappointment of issuers that the rules have been \n     ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements. Our capital markets are built on the foundation \n     of full and fair disclosure. Analysts are paid and investors \n     are rewarded for correctly assessing a company's prospects. \n     The more investors know and understand management's future \n     plans and views, the sounder the valuation is of the \n     company's securities and the more efficient the capital \n     allocation process. Yet, corporate America is hesitant to \n     disclose projections and other forward-looking information \n     because of excessive vulnerability to lawsuits if predictions \n     ultimately are not realized.\n  It goes on to talk about how he was a businessman all his life, and \nso forth, and lays out some specific areas and talks on page 2 of this \nletter, in the last paragraph:\n\n       A safe harbor must be balanced, should encourage more sound \n     disclosure, without encouraging either omission or material \n     information or irresponsible and dishonest information. Safe \n     harbor must be thoughtful so that it protects considered \n     projections, but never fraudulent ones.\n\n  I invite my colleagues to look at the language on page 121 of our \nbill, where we specifically lay out, No. 1, knowingly--talking about \nprojections--knowingly made with the purpose and actual intent of \nmisleading investors.\n  So we clearly there are saying if you make a knowingly fraudulent \nstatement, a misleading--not even fraudulent but misleading statement--\na knowingly misleading statement, that you are not protected by the \nsafe harbor provisions. Is this perfect? I cannot say that it is. But I \nwill say it conforms to what the Chairman of the SEC says, that the \npresent situation is not working very well. We know when we see what is \nhappening with the forward-looking statement; they are being contracted \nand contracted and contracted. That is the practical effect of the \nenvironment we live in today. That does not serve the investor \ncommunity well, Mr. President.\n  With those reasons, with all due respect and great admiration for my \ncolleague from Maryland, throwing this back into the court of the SEC I \ndo not think is going to advance our cause in dealing with clear reform \nin the area of safe harbor that is needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to both of my \ncolleagues and I would like to, very quickly, address some of the \npoints they made. I think the Senator from Connecticut is being \nextremely unfair to the SEC in terms of saying that they did not pick \nup on this. They have picked up on it. Whether they should have picked \nup sooner is the question. But they did issue a period for comment, and \nthat was in October 1994, and they received comments--over 150. They \nthen held hearings in the first part of this year. The Chairman, I \nthink, of the SEC, as the Senator quoted him in the letter, has \nindicated that he wants to do something about safe harbor. The Senator \nquoted him correctly. \n\n[[Page S 9125]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Chairman \nLevitt, dated May 25, 1995, be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The real question here is not whether we should improve \nsafe harbor. The question is, who is going to try to do it? Where is \nthe best place to do that? This amendment says that the best place to \ndo that is at the SEC, and that this body is not equipped to try to \nwork through this complex issue; and if it tries to do it, the law of \nunintended consequences is going to bring a lot of potentially \ndevastating developments.\n  The proposal to have it done at the SEC is, of course, the proposal \nwhich the Senators from Connecticut and New Mexico had when they first \nintroduced the bill--the bill which Members cosponsored. Members who \ncosponsored this legislation were cosponsoring a provision with respect \nto safe harbor, which is exactly the amendment at the desk. That \nprovision was subsequently changed in the committee. That is not the \nprovision that was in the legislation which Members were signing onto \nas cosponsors.\n  Chairman Levitt has warned us of the danger that the provision in the \nbill will protect fraud. Safe harbor is a grant of immunity, an \nexemption from any liability. Safe harbor, in effect, says that you are \nimmunized altogether. So it is very important to properly define the \nsafe harbor. I have been interested in Members--first of all, the \nchairman amended the statutory provision in the bill on safe harbor \nshortly a while ago here on the floor, recognizing that this effort to \nwrite this statutory standard was deficient, I assume.\n  My colleague from Connecticut is citing provisions in the bill where \ncertain activities cannot get safe harbor. He specifically precludes \nthem from doing that and he went through some of them. All of those are \nthings that developed. We got concerned about penny stocks when they \nwere used as an abuse. Who knows what the next abuse is going to be \ndown the road? If the SEC does this, they are in the business of being \nable to adjust to the abuses as they come. The SEC can, in effect, \nmodify the framework. These listings of exceptions to the safe harbor \nstandard in the rule are a demonstration, in my judgment, of the \ninappropriateness of trying to write the standard here, as opposed to \nletting it be done by the regulatory authorities.\n  The forward-looking statements in this bill are broadly defined. They \ninclude both oral and written statements. Now, we want a lot of the \ninformation, but it is the kind of information investors use in \ndeciding whether to purchase a particular stock.\n  Now, the Chairman of the SEC himself has said they want--in fact, the \nSenator quoted one member of the SEC who said maybe they were not \nmoving as quickly because they had some doubts about their statutory \nauthority to do so. Of course, his original proposal would have \nprovided that statutory authority. So if that is an inhibition, the \namendment eliminates that and any doubts with respect to the SEC's \nability to move ahead. The Commission received 150 comment letters in \nresponse to the release. It has worked closely with a vast \nrepresentation of the industry. In fact, when Chairman Levitt testified \nin April of this year, he said:\n\n       From the Commission's perspective, an appropriate \n     legislative approach is contained in the Domenici-Dodd bill. \n     This provision would allow the Commission to complete its \n     rulemaking proceeding and take appropriate action after its \n     evaluation of the extensive comments and testimony already \n     received. Based on the Commission's experience with this \n     issue to date, we believe there is considerable value in \n     proceeding with rulemaking which can more efficiently be \n     administered, interpreted and, if needed, modified than can \n     legislation.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association, the \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, the National League of Cities, \nand nine other groups, in a letter to the committee, on the 23d of May, \nexpressed the same view, saying:\n\n       We believe the more appropriate response is SEC rulemaking \n     in this area.\n\n  Unfortunately, the committee print substitute to S. 240, unlike the \nbill as introduced, abandoned this approach in favor of trying to \nformulate a statutory safe harbor.\n  This is contrary to all the advice we are receiving from the \nregulators. Everybody gets up here and says this interest group wants \nthis and this interest group wants that. I recognize that. I have been \nthe first to state that you have these interest groups clashing over \nthis thing. But what are the public interest officials telling us--\nthose whose responsibility it is to serve the public interest, not one \nor another of these economic interest groups--what are they telling us? \nOf course, what they are telling us is that the approach in my \namendment is the approach to follow.\n  The standard that is in the legislation, I think, is going to allow \nfraud to occur. In fact, Chairman Levitt, on the morning of the markup, \nwrote about the language that is in the bill before us. He stressed \nthat this language failed to adhere to his belief that a safe harbor \nshould never protect fraudulent statements. Let me quote him:\n\n       I continue to have serious concerns about the safe harbor \n     fraud exclusion as it relates to the stringent standard of \n     proof that must be satisfied before a private plaintiff can \n     prevail. As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful \n     fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  He had seen the language. That is a comment on the very language that \nis in this bill. He said:\n\n       . . . I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud \n     to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  Others have criticized this provision as well. The Government Finance \nOfficers Association, representing more than 13,000 State and local \ngovernment financial officials, county treasurers, city managers, and \nso forth, wrote on the safe harbor provision in the bill:\n\n       We believe this opens a major loophole through which \n     wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims would \n     be denied recovery.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, no one is arguing here that we do not need to \ndo something to improve safe harbor. The issue framed by this amendment \nis, who should do it? I submit, as I indicated earlier, in an issue of \nthis complexity, it is better that it be done by the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association represents \n50 State securities regulators. They said:\n\n       We believe this opens a major loophole through which \n     wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims would \n     be denied recovery.\n\n  These are on the front line of defense against securities fraud. They \nare really the regulators closest to the individual investors. They \ncall the provision in this bill an overly broad safe harbor, making it \nextremely difficult to sue when misleading information causes investors \nto suffer losses.\n  AARP has also written calling for replacement of the safe harbor \nprovision, with a directive to the SEC to issue a rule which structures \na safe harbor that protects both legitimate business and investors.\n  Given the broad definition in this legislation of forward-looking \nstatements, discussed above, it is crucial that the legislation not \nshield such statements when they are false. Encouraging reasonable \ndisclosures is one thing. Allowing fraudulent projections is another. \nActually, that kind of safe harbor would hurt investors trying to make \nintelligent investment decisions and penalize companies trying to \ncommunicate honestly with their shareholders. It runs counter to the \nwhole premise of our Federal securities laws, which has helped to give \nus strong markets. The fraud must be deterred, and the fraud must be \npunished when it occurs.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that safe harbor not protect \nfraudulent statements and, in my judgment, the best way to address this \nissue is to, in effect, use the approach that was initially in the \nlegislation charging the SEC with developing a safe harbor regulation--\na process now engaged in.\n  These are the transcripts of the hearings they held on the issue. \nThey received over 150 comment statements and letters, and they have \nengaged in an extensive discussion with a whole range of people who \nhave acquaintance and knowledge in this area.\n  I very much hope the body will adopt the amendment.\n\n[[Page S 9126]]\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that this morning you and \n     the members of the Banking Committee will be considering S. \n     240 and that you will be offering an amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute. While I have not had the opportunity to \n     analyze fully the May 24th manager's amendment to the \n     Committee print, I appreciate your leadership and efforts to \n     address the concerns of the Commission in drafting your \n     alternative.\n       The safe harbor provision in the amendment, in my opinion, \n     is preferable to the blanket approach of H.R. 1058. It \n     addresses a number of the concerns pertaining to the size of \n     the safe harbor and the exclusions from the safe harbor. The \n     Committee staff appears to be genuinely interested in the \n     Commission's views of its draft legislation and has attempted \n     to be responsive. I was pleased to see the latest draft \n     deleted the requirement that a plaintiff must read and \n     actually rely upon the misrepresentation before a claim is \n     actionable. Your attempt to tailor the breadth of the safe \n     harbor of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the more \n     narrow safe harbor of the Securities Act of 1933 was \n     encouraging. However, I continue to believe that the \n     definition should be further narrowed to parallel the items \n     contained in my letter of May 19th. Moreover, there remain a \n     number of troubling issues.\n       I continue to have serious concerns about the safe harbor \n     fraud exclusion as it relates to the stringent standard of \n     proof that must be satisfied before a private plaintiff can \n     prevail. As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful \n     fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection. The \n     scienter standard in the amendment may be so high as to \n     preclude all but the most obvious frauds. I believe that \n     there should be a direct relationship between the level of \n     scienter required to prove fraud and the types of statements \n     protected by the safe harbor. My letter of May 19th indicated \n     the discreet list of subjects that are suitable for safe \n     harbor protection, assuming a simple ``knowing'' standard. \n     Accordingly, if the Committee is unwilling to lower the \n     proposed scienter level to a simple ``knowing'' standard, the \n     safe harbor should not protect forward-looking statements \n     contained in the management's discussion and analysis \n     section. This would be better left to Commission rulemaking.\n       In addition to my concerns about the safe harbor, there is \n     no complete resolution of two important issues for the \n     Commission. First, there is no extension of the statute of \n     limitations for private fraud actions from three to five \n     years. Second, the draft bill does not fully restore the \n     aiding and abetting liability eliminated in the Supreme \n     Court's Central Bank of Denver opinion. I am encouraged by \n     the Committee's willingness to restore partially the \n     Commission's ability to prosecute those who aid and abet \n     fraud; however, a more complete solution is preferable.\n       I also wish to call you attention to a potential problem \n     with the provision relating to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure. I worry that the standard employed in \n     your draft may have the unintended effect of imposing a \n     ``loser pays'' scheme. The greater the discretion afforded \n     the court, the less likely this unintended consequence may \n     appear.\n       I would like to express my particular gratitude for the \n     courtesy and openness displayed by the Committee and its \n     staff. I hope we will continue to work together to improve \n     the bill so as to reduce costly litigation without \n     compromising essential investor protections.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arthur Levitt.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9109-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1477\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have discussed this with Senator \nD'Amato. Some of the time remaining will be allocated to me by him. So \nlet me start by yielding myself 7 minutes from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, speaking now of the safe harbor \namendment that is before us, and the safe harbor language that is in \nthe bill, I first want to call to the Senate's attention the chilling \neffects on voluntary disclosure that exist today because of our failure \nto have an adequate safe harbor for voluntary statements about future \nconditions.\n  First:\n\n       Seventy-five percent of the American Stock Exchange CEO's \n     surveyed have limited disclosure of forward-looking \n     information.\n\n  That is according to an April 1994 survey.\n  Limited disclosure:\n\n       Seventy-one percent of more than 200 entrepreneurial \n     companies surveyed are reluctant to discuss the companies \n     performance. (National Venture Capital Association, 1994.)\n       Nearly 40 percent of investor relation personnel surveyed \n     at 386 companies have cut back on voluntary disclosure of \n     information to the investment community. (National Investor \n     Relations Institute, March 1994.)\n       Fear of litigation is the number one obstacle to enhance \n     voluntary disclosure by corporate managers. (Harvard Business \n     School study, 1994.)\n       Less than 50 percent of companies with earnings result \n     significantly above or below analysts' expectations released \n     information voluntarily. That information, too, is from one \n     of our great universities, the University of California, \n     (November 1993.)\n\n  Mr. President, it has been asked why, originally in the Dodd-Domenici \nor Domenici-Dodd bills we did not have this statutory safe harbor \nlanguage.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, the truth of the matter is that it \nhas been 4 years since we first started this exercise of trying to get \nthis law. And the final draft, more or less, of what is being alluded \nto as the Dodd-Domenici or Domenici-Dodd bill is 3 years old.\n  For those who are questioning why we do not adopt the original bill's \nlanguage on safe harbor, let me just suggest that such an approach's \ntime has come and gone. If the Senators suggesting the regulatory \napproach would have all come to the party 3 years ago, the bill would \nhave been enacted. But nobody would. So what happened is we had in that \nbill asked that the Securities and Exchange Commission solve this \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, for various reasons the Securities and Exchange \nCommission is not able to solve the safe harbor problem. They have had \nnumerous hours of hearings, Commissioners are split, we are short two \nCommissioners. There are vacancies. Entrenched staff of that \ninstitution are arguing back and forth on philosophy and language. \nMeanwhile, the status quo continues, and here we sit with an unfixed \nsafe harbor even though Congress has asked them to fix it.\n  Last year in appropriations, Mr. President, fellow Senators, I put in \nthe appropriations bill report language that the SEC needed to create a \nnew safe harbor and to report back to us by the end of the fiscal year. \nThe provision called upon them to tell the people of this country what \nthe safe harbor would be since the SEC wanted to develop it. They have \nnot done it. It is almost time for another appropriations bill. And \nthey have not done it.\n  Let me suggest that inaction and gridlock at the SEC do not mean we \nshould not do something. In fact, I do \n\n[[Page S 9127]]\nnot believe that is what the current head of the SEC, Arthur Levitt is \nsaying, that we should not do anything because we should still leave it \nup to them 3 years and untold numbers of hours, and hundreds of pages \nof testimony. So frankly, we ought to do something statutorily about \nthe safe harbor.\n  The fact that it is a problem is absolutely manifold before us here \ntoday. And the fact that those very same lawyers, that small group of \nsharks, that sit around waiting for litigation, are fighting so hard to \nkeep the current, ineffective safe harbor makes it patently clear that \nfiling frivolous lawsuits when a company misses an earnings projection \nis one of their great slot machines. This is one situation where they \njust jump out there and pick up on statements that are predictions of \nthe future, and anything that does not turn out as it was spoken as a \nbasis to file a lawsuit.\n  Forward-looking statements are predictions about the future. \nFrequently, these lawsuits are based on past statements of future \nexpectations.\n  Why do not future predictions always come true?\n  Mr. President, changes in the business cycle occur beyond the control \nof the company or their executive or their accountants. Is that fraud?\n  Changes in the market occur. And ask somebody why the changes have \noccurred and you will get as many answers as there are people you would \nask. Is that fraud?\n  Changing the timing of an order--is that fraud?\n  Because forward-looking statements often involve future products, \ninnovations, technologies of the future, failure to meet one or another \nexpectation, is inevitable. But it should not be inevitable that a \nlawsuit follows.\n But I ask: Is each of those a fraud if you do not meet them? No. It is \nsimply failure of a prediction about the future to come true.\n\n  Talk about the chilling effects of disclosure. I have just explained \nthe reality of harm this ineffective policy is causing in the \nmarketplace. And so now let me proceed to talk about the safe harbor in \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 more minutes.\n  Arthur Levitt, for whom I have great respect, and he knows that, said \nhe wanted a balanced safe harbor. The SEC has been promising this new \nsafe harbor for at least 3 years. Arthur Levitt has said that the \ncurrent safe harbor ``is a failure.''\n  That is not Pete Domenici, who proposed this bill some 4 years ago; \nit is Arthur Levitt saying the current safe harbor, whatever it is, is \na ``failure.'' The securities litigation reform bill that Senator Dodd \nand I introduced, directed them to make plans for, and recommend a fix \nto this broken safe harbor situation. We have gone through that with \nyou already. But I can repeat again, frustrated by this lack of \nprogress, I put language in the appropriations bill's report.\n  Actually, it has been 8 months since the SEC took its first step and \nissued a concept proposal, and still we get nothing.\n  So in answer to those in the Chamber, including my friend from \nMaryland, Senator Sarbanes, who say Senator Dodd, Senator Domenici, if \nyou left the bill the way it was when you originally introduced it, I \nwould be for this provision because you did not have the provision that \nis before the Senate today. Of course not. We have been anxiously \nwaiting for 3 years now for the SEC to fix this. And since they have \nnot, we believe the committee has come up with an excellent solution to \nthis problem.\n  Let me go on then and cite for the Record a little detail about the \ndisagreements among the Commission and various staff at the SEC just to \nshow that there is great imbalance.\n  Wallman wants a meaningful safe harbor. Beese wants a strong safe \nharbor. The Commission is two commissioners short and there will be \nthree empty seats soon. With new commissioners eventually coming on \nboard, it will slow the process even further. It will be years.\n  The Senate bill recognized the problem at the SEC and the urgency of \na meaningful safe harbor. The committee made the change and crafted a \nstatutory safe harbor, even though the Securities Commission could not \ntell us how to do it. And I believe the committee have done it right. \nThey had the benefit of this entire record before the SEC.\n  The main concern that Arthur Levitt has expressed to the Congress is \nthat there should be no safe harbor for predictions about the future \nthat were intentionally false.\n  The Council of Institutional Investors, the mutual fund managers, did \nnot agree with Arthur Levitt and they had suggested that Congress go \nfurther than our bill. They argued that statements which are \naccompanied by warnings should be per se immune from liability. The \nSenate bill does not go that far.\n  CALPERS--the California public employees pension fund--in their \ntestimony to the SEC, stated:\n\n       By definition, projections are inherently uncertain. The \n     more such statements are based on assumptions susceptible to \n     change, the less useful they are in assessing prospective \n     performance. Investors recognize this and appropriately \n     discount the importance of such information when making \n     investments. This being the case, we see no reason why \n     investors should then be allowed to rely upon such statements \n     in an action for fraud after their speculative nature has \n     been fulfilled.\n\n  There is a warning that will accompany each of these statements if it \nis to be protected under the safe harbor created by the bill. It will \nclearly: say these forward looking statements are predictions; they may \nnot come true. It may turn out that the actual results differ \nmaterially from this prediction about the future.\n  The Council of Institutional Investors--that is the professional \npeople who manage these funds, people who have a fiduciary duty and \nhigh level of trust to manage pension funds--told the SEC that any safe \nharbor must be ``100 percent safe.'' This means that all information in \nit must be absolutely protected even if it is irrelevant or \nunintentionally, or intentionally, false or misleading.'' The bill does \nnot go that far.\n  For decades, Congress has deferred to the courts in setting the \ncontours of class action 10b-5 litigation. We are changing that in this \nbill, and we should not pass the buck on to anyone on something as \nimportant as safe harbor.\n  The chilling effect on the willingness of companies to make \ndisclosures is bad for investors, for analysts, for professional fund \nmanagers, for retirement stewards, companies and the market in general. \nThe high technology companies cannot grow without a meaningful safe \nharbor, and we provide just that.\n  We provide a meaningful safe harbor. That meaningful safe harbor \nclearly does not protect against intentional fraud and knowing \nmisrepresentations. We have made it very specific; individuals engaging \nin that type of activity can not get into our safe harbor. Those \nstatements are still actionable. So any statements on the floor that we \nwill let people perpetrate fraud because of this statutory safe harbor, \nwhich includes knowledge, purpose and intention, that is not so. \nNonetheless, you either have to have a safe harbor that works on future \nstatements that are predictive only or you have it wide open again for \nlitigation and we are right back where we started.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the safe harbor provisions of the bill \nhave been criticized by some of my colleagues. I would like to address \nthose criticisms by pointing out that S. 240 puts more responsibilities \non companies seeking to use the safe harbor and puts more conditions on \ntheir use of the safe harbor than the SEC does in its current rules. It \nalso goes further than a number of courts of appeals that have examined \nthe issue of liability for forward-looking statements.\n  I wonder if the bill's manager would engage in a colloquy with me on \nthis point?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be delighted to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. First, S. 240 has a definition of forward-looking \nstatement. It includes projections of revenues, statements about \nmanagement's plans for the future, and statements about future economic \nperformance of a company, among other things. Can you tell me where \nthat definition came from?\n\n[[Page S 9128]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It came directly from rule 175. It is the SEC's own \ndefinition of forward-looking statements.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Now, the Banking Committee excluded a number of \ncompanies and a number of transactions from using the safe harbor. Can \nyou explain why that was done?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Banking Committee made a policy decision to exclude \nfrom the safe harbor certain companies and certain transactions in \nwhich the incentives for making overly optimistic forward-looking \nstatements might be present. It is important to note that the safe \nharbor does not apply to:\n  First, statements about a company that within the past 3 years has \nbeen convicted of certain violations of the Federal securities laws.\n  Second, statements made in an offering by a blank check company. \nThese are companies that offer securities to the public, but which have \nno clear business plan and are therefore highly speculative.\n  Third, statements made by an issuer of penny stock. These are \ncompanies that sell very low priced stock, often through brokers who \nuse high pressure sales tactics. There have been significant problems \nof fraud in the sale of these securities in the past.\n  Fourth, statements made in connection with a rollup transaction. \nThese are transactions in which sponsors of limited partnerships \nattempt to combine many separate partnerships and rake off huge \nmanagement fees. Congress passed legislation to address these abuses in\n 1990. We shouldn't allow these transactions to use the safe harbor.\n\n  Five, statements made in connection with a going private transaction. \nThese are transactions in which a company buys back its shares from its \npublic shareholders. Often, it involves management of the company \nbuying back the shares.\n  Six, statements made in connection with the sale of mutual funds. \nMutual funds simply should not be making projections. The SEC has a \nlong series of rules governing mutual fund disclosure.\n  Seven, statements made in connection with a tender offer also are \nexcluded. These often are hotly contested takeover battles, and we have \ndecided not to give them any safe harbor protection.\n  Eight, statements made in connection with certain partnership \nofferings and direct participation programs. Very often, these are \nsecurities products put together in-house at a broker-dealer, and we \nthink the temptation for making rosy performance projections may be too \ngreat in these cases.\n  Nine, statements made in connection with ownership reports under \n13(d) also are excluded. These are the reports required under law by \nanyone who purchases 5 percent or more of a company's securities. The \nlaw also requires that they state their plans with respect to the \ncompany. The committee decided these statements should not be protected \nunder the safe harbor.\n  Ten, finally, the safe harbor does not apply to forward-looking \nstatements in the financial statements of a company.\n  So, to answer your question, we excluded a long list of companies and \ntransactions from the safe harbor, because we were concerned that, in \nthese companies and in these transactions, there might be a temptation \nfor companies to make rosy projections.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The committee's bill also has a tough requirement \nthat, in order to use the safe harbor, a company has to accompany any \nprojection with a warning is that not correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is true. The bill requires that there be a clear \nwarning that actual results may differ materially from any projection, \nestimate, or description of future events.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Then, I want to compliment the committee for its work \nhere. Clearly this is a difficult area. We want to provide certainty \nfor companies and encourage them to make disclosure. At the same time, \nwe want to make sure that no one takes advantage of the safe harbor to \nmislead investors. You have tried to strike a balance here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be deducted equally.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time do \nwe have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator still has 5 minutes 48 seconds; \nthe other side has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much is remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are about to vote on shortly is an \namendment that puts into this bill the very provision that was in the \nbill introduced by Senators Dodd and Domenici, which referred over to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission the responsibility for \ndeveloping a safe harbor provision.\n  I have to tell you, I think it is either the height of arrogance or \nthe height of folly to be trying to draft these standards here in the \ncommittee and in the Chamber of the Senate. Even the proponents admit \nthis is a very complex issue. The original bill as introduced and as \ncosponsored provided to send this issue to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in order for them to put their expertise and their \nrulemaking authority to work in order to develop an appropriate safe \nharbor provision.\n  Now, the Chairman of the SEC has indicated that he thinks changes \nneed to be made with respect to safe harbor for forward-looking \nstatements. But he has also indicated that the provision in the bill is \nnot acceptable, that it goes much too far. And, in fact, the very \nmorning of the markup he said in a letter to the committee, ``I cannot \nembrace proposals which allow willful fraud to receive the benefit of \nsafe harbor protection.''\n  In other words, it is his view of the standard written in the bill \nthat it would provide safe harbor protection for willful fraud. I \nchallenge anyone in the Chamber to rise and defend that should be the \ncase.\n  What they will try to argue is, ``No, this standard does not really \npermit that.'' But here is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, in effect, saying that this standard does permit that. And \nhe is supported in this judgment by a range of public interest groups \nconcerned with securities regulation. The North American Securities \nAdministrators Association has come in with respect to this matter and \nhave indicated that they believe that the safe harbor definition should \nbe left to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a May 23, 1995, \nletter, the North American Securities Administrators Association, the \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, the National League of Cities, \nand nine other groups expressed the view:\n\n       We believe the more appropriate response is SEC rulemaking \n     in this area.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I stated in the Senator's absence--you \ncan charge this to my time; I do not mean to use his--that the SEC had \nbeen trying to do this for 3 years. And last year, we put it in the \nappropriations bill. I said, because I was the one who wrote it in, \nwhile funding the SEC, we expect them to do it. Is it not true they \nhave been unable to arrive at a consensus and present one that they are \nwilling to say will work and should be adopted? Is that not true?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. I think what is true is that the SEC--the Senator \nput it in his bill that he introduced 15 months ago, in March 1994, was \nwhen he first brought forth in statutory language the proposition that \nit should be referred to the SEC. The SEC, in October 1994, issued a \nconcept release and notice of hearing. In that concept release, they \ninvited comments to be made before the end of the year, and they also \nscheduled hearings to take place in February of this year, of this very \nyear.\n  Now, the SEC received over 150 comments by the end of the year. They \nheld 3 days of hearings, 2 days in Washington and 1 day in California. \nThis, in fact, is the hearing record from those hearings conducted by \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, as the Chairman of the \nCommission pointed out in a letter to the committee about the problem \nof working this out, he said there is a need for a stronger safe harbor \nthan currently exists. He has \n\n[[Page S 9129]]\n\nmade that statement. And I think generally people accept that. The \nquestion is, who is going to write this safe harbor? Does it make sense \nfor the Congress to be writing the safe harbor instead of the experts \nand the regulators who represent--who are supposed to represent the \npublic interest in this matter to devise the safe harbor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I ask a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is assuming we do not have the public \ninterest in mind when we write this?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We do not have the expertise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We do not have the expertise of the SEC. And we do not, \nparticularly in an area that is as difficult and complex as this one. I \nthink that is very clear. In fact, the standard you propose in the bill \nwas amended here on the floor by the chairman of the committee earlier \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In response to criticism. If we have to define it \nlegislatively, of course we will have to try to do that. But I invite \nthe Senator's attention to the provisions of the bill that try to \ndefine out the safe harbor. It is obviously a very intricate and \ncomplex section. The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, upon reading this, then wrote a letter to the committee \nsaying he could not embrace the proposal because it would allow willful \nfraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n  So, in fact, your very bill--it is very interesting the way this bill \nhas been structured. The proposal now before us allows the SEC to \nexpand the safe harbor. In other words, they can provide even more of a \nsafe harbor, but it does not allow the SEC to limit the safe harbor. So \nit is all a one-way voyage. It is a one-way voyage, and really giving \nthe SEC the role that it ought to have in this situation and has been \ndenied to them.\n  I think the Members are assuming an incredible responsibility here. \nAs I pointed out earlier, the North American Securities Administrators, \nthe Government Finance Officers, the National League of Cities, and \nnine other similar groups all express the view that they thought what \nwas a more appropriate response is SEC rulemaking in this area. Now, \nthen, I quoted earlier from the Chairman of the SEC. The Government \nFinance Officers Association, representing more than 13,000 State and \nlocal government financial officials, county treasurers, city managers, \nand so on, wrote of the safe harbor provision in the bill, and I am now \nquoting them:\n\n       We believe this opens a major loophole through which \n     wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims would \n     be denied recovery.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       We believe this opens a major loophole through which \n     wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims would \n     be denied recovery.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association, which \nrepresents the 50 State securities regulators--they are really a front \nline of defense against securities fraud--have called the provision \nthat is in the bill ``an overly broad safe harbor making it extremely \ndifficult to sue when misleading information causes investors to suffer \nlosses.''\n  Mr. President, I submit that the wise course of action here is to \nadopt this amendment. That is the provision that was originally in the \nbill. That is the provision that Members were acquainted with when they \ncosponsored the bill. Let the Securities and Exchange Commission, which \nhas the expertise and the knowledge and the experience, deal with this \nvery complex area and shape a proper safe harbor provision which is not \nsubject to abuse and which is not subject to the objection of the \nChairman of the Commission, who stated with respect to the provision \nthat is in this bill that we are now trying to change:\n\n       I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to \n     receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 7 minutes, 40 seconds. The \nmajority side has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask consent to have 2 minutes, if I may?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Maryland yielding?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, certainly. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me state again, Mr. President, there are those, I \nsuppose, who would always say, in any matter, defer to an agency to \nwrite it. We deal with a lot of complex areas of law. This is one of \nthem. I admit that.\n  But the notion inherent there is that there is in the SEC an ability \nto deal with this issue beyond the capacity of this body. I do not \nthink that is necessarily true. In fact, the Commission itself is so \nhighly divided on the issue we might wait 2 or 3 years before we get an \nanswer. If you read the two letters from Arthur Levitt, one dated May \n19 and one May 25, you would hardly recognize they are coming from the \nsame author. In the May 19 letter, it says, this area has to be cleared \nup. The letter of May 25, I would call a fairly strident letter. The \nauthors might have been different people, although they were signed by \nthe same individual.\n  We have in this legislation very emphatically made it clear that for \nany individual who knowingly and intentionally misleads, knowingly \nintentionally misleads an investor, that there is no protection of safe \nharbor. I do not know how much more clear and explicit you can be.\n  The idea somehow that this is a major gaping hole by which defrauded \ninvestors are somehow going to be taken advantage of is rhetoric. We \nclose up that loophole. We close it up by saying no misleading \nstatements.\n  In fact, we go further than that. We require there be warnings in \nthese forward-looking statements. It narrows it down to who can take \nadvantage of safe harbor, under what circumstances, what kind of \npeople. This is not available to stockbrokers or others. It is the \nissuers, and it is designed specifically to give investors the kind of \ninformation they need.\n  We need to encourage the issuers to step forward with their \nstatements, not cause them to step back. It does not serve the economic \ninterest of this country, or anyone for that matter, to be faced with \nthat kind of a problem. That is why we included safe harbor, that is \nwhy we included the language to cut out the misleading statements. We \nthink this is a good provision, and we urge that we stick with the \nlanguage of the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 7 minutes 40 \nseconds. The Senator from New York has 2 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Connecticut, \nI think he is being extremely unfair to the Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission. I think the two letters that the Chairman \nwrote us are perfectly consistent with one another.\n  I know the Senator is very involved in this legislation and very \nanxious to try to pass it. I differ sharply with him on that issue, but \nI do not think in the course of the debate he ought to, in effect, \ndemean the Chairman of the SEC.\n  The letter he wrote on May 19 spelled out his very considerable \nconcern over the safe harbor provision. I quoted from it at great \nlength earlier in the day. I am not going to repeat that here except, \nfor instance, he says:\n\n       A safe harbor must be thoughtful--so that it protects \n     considered projections, but never fraudulent ones.\n\n  He then raises a lot of questions about what safe harbor can cover, \nand he states right in the letter, this is the earlier letter:\n\n       Given these complexities--and in light of the enormous \n     amount of care, thought, and work that the Commission has \n     already invested in the subject--my recommendation would be \n     that you provide broad rulemaking authority to the Commission \n     to improve the safe harbor.\n\n  That is what the amendment at the desk does. That is what this \namendment does.\n  The Chairman then went on, since the Senator from Connecticut, or at \nleast colleagues of his were pushing hard for statutory definition, to \nspell out the components that he thought ought to be in any statutory \ndefinition of safe harbor.\n  At that time, efforts were being made to shape this. Those efforts \ndid not \n\n[[Page S 9130]]\nprove fruitful and, in the end, on May 25, the morning of the markup, \nthe Chairman wrote a letter to the committee expressing his view about \nthe provision that is in this bill, the very provision we are now \ntrying to change. And he said:\n\n       I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to \n     receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  I think Chairman Levitt is a dedicated public servant. I think he is \ntrying to do what is right. In his letter, he acceded to the view that \nsomething needed to be done to provide a stronger safe harbor \nprotection, but then he raised his concerns in the nature of the \nprotections that ought to be made. He has spent a lifetime on Wall \nStreet. He is an experienced businessman. In fact, he quoted himself as \na businessman about the problem of meritless lawsuits. He recognizes \nthe problem of frivolous lawsuits and, in fact, has been working with \nthe committee to try to address those. He has a sufficient removal \nrepresenting the public interest as he does to be able to identify \nprovisions in this bill which he thinks are defective.\n  I want the Members to realize what they are doing here. They are \ntrying to enact a standard which the regulators--the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the State regulators, the \nGovernment finance officers--are all telling them, ``Don't do this; \ndon't do this.'' This is not as though we were putting into the law a \nstandard which the regulators acceded to or thought was reasonable. \nThey are saying, ``Don't do this, don't put this standard in.''\n  There are two ways to correct that. One is to refer it back to the \nCommission, which is exactly what was in the bill as it was introduced \nand a matter the Commission was working at, and that is what this \namendment does. The other is to try to define the standard here. If we \nhave to do that, I am prepared to address that subject.\n  I do not think that is the wise thing to do. I do not think that, \nfrankly, with all due deference to my colleagues, that there is anyone \nhere who really knows this law intimately and well enough in a highly \ncomplex area to write the standard. I say that with all due deference, \nand I include myself within those about whom I am making that judgment. \nSo it ought not to be done in the legislation.\n  The initial approach by Senators Dodd and Domenici was the correct \napproach, and that is what this amendment does. This amendment is word \nfor word what was in the bill. It would provide the opportunity for the \nCommission, through broad rulemaking authority, to improve the safe \nharbor provision, and I very strongly commend this amendment to my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time is remaining.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I ask how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 2 minutes 22 \nseconds. The Senator from Maryland has 1 minute 48 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me refer to one of the two letters \nmentioned by my colleague. In the letter, sent by the Chairman of the \nSEC, the Chairman says:\n\n       There is a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently \n     exists. The current rules have largely been a failure, and I \n     share the disappointment of the issuers that the rules have \n     been ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements.\n\n  He says clearly in this letter that we have not afforded protection \nfor forward-looking statements.\n  History shows that we have been waiting for 3 years for the SEC to \nwork out the safe harbor issue. Last year, the Appropriations Committee \nstated that the time for the SEC to act on this had come, it said, ``We \nwant some rules. We can wait no longer.''\n  The Chairman of the SEC has been working on this but it is obvious \nthat the Commission has some concerns on the safe harbor and cannot \ncome to a point where it publishes rules. I say the media does not know \nwhat they are writing about. What we are attempting to do with this \nlegislation is to allow companies the flexibility to make forward-\nlooking statements but, holding them liable if they make knowingly and \nintentionally misleading statements. There is no safe harbor for any \nuntested companies and there is not safe harbor in situations where we \nfelt the investor was at too great a risk of being mislead. To this \neffect, the safe harbor provision excludes IPO's, it excludes tender \noffers, and excludes stockbrokers. If you want a good example of \nlegislation that goes too far, look at the House bill.\n  I think some of the journalists writing on this legislation, \nparticularly those from the New York Times, have not taken the time to \nreally understand what this legislation does. I suggest that they take \nsome time to read the bill before they write. There is not a safe \nharbor that allows companies to say anything--anything, even \nintentionally false or misleading statements--as long as there is a \ndisclaimer that the statement is in the safe harbor. This legislation \ndoes not institute a caveat emptor, buyer beware, attitude. I believe \nthat would be going too far, much too far. But to say that the safe \nharbor in S. 240 would do this is wrong; it is wrong.\n  We cannot continue to allow businessmen to be held up by a handful of \nbuccaneering barristers. That is an artful term used by my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, and that is exactly what these lawyers are \ndoing, they do not give two hoots and a holler about the stockholders. \nThey care only about their own personal enrichment. That is why I have \nto oppose this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I, in fact, quoted the very sentence the \nSenator from New York quoted from Arthur Levitt where he says, ``There \nis a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently exists.'' The \nquestion is, how are you going to develop that safe harbor?\n  This amendment says the SEC should do it. That is what the bill \nintroduced by Senators Dodd and Domenici on March 24, 1994, provided \nfor. Then they say, well, the SEC has delayed. The SEC put out their \nconcept release on safe harbor in October 1994. In other words, about 7 \nor 8 months ago. They received 150 responses on the safe harbor issue. \nThat is more testimony than the Banking Committee has had on all \nsecurities litigation issues.\n  The SEC held 3 public hearings on the safe harbor issue in February--\n2 in Washington, 1 in San Francisco--62 witnesses in all: Venture \ncapitalists, law professors, corporate executives, plaintiffs lawyers, \ndefense lawyers, institutional investors.\n  Arthur Levitt says:\n\n       There are many questions that have arisen in the course of \n     the commission's explanation of how to design a safe harbor.\n\n  He then talks about the concept release, the comment letters, the 3 \ndays of hearings, and his meeting personally with a wide range of \ngroups that have an interest in the subject.\n  This matter should be handled by the SEC, just the way it was \nproposed in the original bill, which Members have cosponsored. That is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1477\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1477 offered by the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, today's Boston Herald contains a shocking \nfront-page story--a story that should send shivers down the spines of \nall Americans, especially those who have criticized my call to the \nentertainment industry to exercise good citizenship when it comes to \nproducing films that celebrate mindless violence.\n  That is the headline: ``We're `Natural Born Killers.''' There was a \nmovie called ``Natural Born Killers.'' This is a story, the prosecutor \nsays, where the suspects bragged about the slaying saying, ``We're \nnatural born killers.''\n  ``We're `Natural Born Killers,''' the headline blares, referring to \nthe critically acclaimed Oliver Stone film.\n  This is what happened. The Boston Herald story begins, and I quote:\n\n       As they changed out of their bloody clothes, the men who \n     plunged a knife into an elderly Avon man 27 times bragged \n     they were ``natural born killers,'' a Norfolk County \n     prosecutor said yesterday.\n       ``Haven't you ever seen `natural born killers' before?,'' \n     18-year-old suspect Patrick T. Morse allegedly bragged to a \n     girl after the gruesome slaying.\n\n  According to the Norfolk County prosecutor, ``This is one of the most \nvicious premeditated murders I have ever seen.'' And Massachusetts \nState Police Trooper Brian Howe said ``My understanding was that they \nwere drawing a comparison between the characters in the movie and \nthemselves.''\n  Of course, no movie caused this brutal killing in Massachusetts. We \nare all responsible for our own actions, period. But, at the same time, \nthose in the entertainment industry who deny that cultural messages can \nbore deep into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving \nthemselves. If the Boston Herald story is true, and if these are the \nkinds of role models that Hollywood is content to promote, then perhaps \nsome serious soul-searching is in order in the corporate suits of the \nentertainment industry.\n  Let me just indicate again that is the headline. It is not Bob Dole's \nheadline. It is the headline this morning in the Boston Herald about \nhow these young murderers bragged about attacking an old man and \nstabbing the person 27 times. In fact, it goes into graphic detail \nabout the knife that was so bloody that they had to ask for a new \nknife.\n  Something is wrong in America with the entertainment industry, and \nmaybe it is high time they took a look at themselves and put profit \nbehind common decency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nBoston Herald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     We're ``Natural Born Killers''\n\n       As they changed out of their bloody clothes, the men who \n     plunged a knife into an elderly Avon man 27 times bragged \n     that they were ``Natural Born Killers,'' a Norfolk County \n     prosecutor said yesterday.\n       ``Haven't you ever seen `Natural Born Killers' before?'' \n     suspect Patrick T. Morse allegedly bragged to a girl after \n     the gruesome slaying of 65-year-old Philip Meskinis.\n       Chilling details of the trio's murderous attack and their \n     fascination with the murder spree depicted in the motion \n     picture ``Natural Born Killers'' were revealed yesterday when \n     Morse, 18, and Leonard Stanley, 20, were arraigned on murder \n     charges and held without bail.\n       Police are scouring the Brockton area for a third suspect, \n     Michael F. Freeman, a 20-year-old fugitive and former convict \n     who allegedly wielded the knife that slashed Meskinis' throat \n     early Friday morning and punctured his body with 27 stab \n     wounds.\n       ``I've been doing violent felonies for 20 years,'' Norfolk \n     County prosecutor Gerald Pudolsky said after the arraignment. \n     ``This is one of the most vicious, premeditated murders I've \n     seen.''\n       After an intensive investigation that led to Morse's arrest \n     about 36 hours after the grisly murder, and Stanley's \n     surrender shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, police learned in \n     interviews with Morse and the trio's associates that the men \n     and their female friends ``on occasion'' watched ``Natural \n     Born Killers'' after one person bought the movie, said State \n     Police Trooper Brian L. Howe.\n       ``My understanding was they were drawing a comparison \n     between the characters in the movie and themselves,'' Howe \n     said.\n       In Stoughton District Court yesterday, Morse and Stanley \n     sat expressionless as Pudolsky recited the threesome's \n     alleged vile deeds.\n       ``I think the only thing they're sorry about is they got \n     caught,'' Howe said after the arraignment.\n       The trio allegedly started plotting the slaying at a \n     coffee-ship in Avon after Freeman--whose handicapped mother \n     once dated the disabled victim--told Morse and Stanley that \n     Meskinis had money and guns\n      stashed inside in his School Street home, Pudolsky said.\n       At 5 p.m. Thursday, the trio went to a girlfriend's house \n     in Avon where they discussed ``pulling an armed invasion at \n     Mr. Meskinis' house,'' Pudolsky said.\n       Armed with at least two, maybe three knives, the suspects \n     left the girl's house in Morse's Chevrolet Cavalier at about \n     1:30 a.m.\n       ``Mr. Freeman knew he was going to kill the victim and the \n     other two went along 100 percent,'' Pudolsky said in an \n     interview.\n       As Meskinis lay asleep in his bed, the men invaded his home \n     and Freeman launched the bloody assault, jamming a knife \n     repeatedly into the helpless man's body.\n       ``So much blood was coming from Mr. Meskinis' body that Mr. \n     Freeman actually lost the grip on the knife,'' Pudolsky said.\n       Freeman yelled to Morse for another knife and Morse \n     complied, passing a Buck knife, Pudolsky said. The blows were \n     so forceful that Freeman allegedly broke Meskinis' wrist and \n     clavicle during the relentless hacking.\n       Stanley was ``ready, willing and able'' to assist in the \n     bloody siege--although his attorney and relatives insisted \n     yesterday that he was not in the bedroom during the murder.\n       The suspects stole a shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle, \n     stashing them first in the woods, and later inside the \n     girlfriend's house.\n       Police recovered two knives, two victim's guns and bags of \n     bloodied clothing ditched in a dumpster behind a Brockton \n     convenience store.\n       The trio returned to the woman's home where three other \n     female friends were staying that night, police said. They \n     stripped their bloodied clothing, and worried that they had \n     left behind fingerprints, Morse and Freeman brazenly returned \n     to the murder scene at abut 5 a.m. to remove evidence from \n     ashtrays and door knobs, police said.\n       As Morse and Freeman sat down at 8:30 a.m. for breakfast, \n     Stanley said he was not hungry.\n       But Stanley, using a glass of water, gurgled the liquid in \n     his mouth to imitate ``the death chortle of Mr. Meskinis as \n     his throat was being slashed,'' Pudolsky said.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9131-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9131-S9133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ELECTIONS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, long-delayed parliamentary elections were \nheld in Haiti last weekend. The long-suffering Haitian people deserve \ncredit in what is a momentous step in their efforts to develop \ndemocracy. For many months, it appeared elections might never take \nplace. Since January, President Aristide has been governing by decree \nbecause elections were not held in the constitutionally mandated \nperiod.\n  All reports out of Haiti indicate confusion and chaos in the \nelectoral process. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians were waiting to \nvote 24 hours after polls were supposed to close. Some polling stations \nopened very late, and some never opened at all. An election station was \nburned in northern Haiti. Turnout was low.\n\n[[Page S 9132]]\n\n  According to information my office received from Haiti today, the \nballot counting process is in total disarray. The final results are not \nyet in, but the early returns indicate deep flaws in the process \nleading up to the election, deep flaws on election day, and now a \ncomplete breakdown of the process. All the signs point to an election \nprocess that is fatally flawed.\n  There are credible reports of ballots being destroyed, and of \nnonexistent ballot security. No one knows when ballot counting will be \ncompleted--or if it can ever be done credibly.\n  You may have seen a picture of ballot security in the Washington Post \nthis morning, boxes and boxes of ballots stacked up and ballots \nspilling out of the boxes.\n  Witnesses today cite cases of ballots being shoveled into trash \ncontainers, and left in the street.\n  The International Republican Institute [IRI] documented dozens of \nshortcomings in the months and weeks leading up to the election. The \nIRI delegation, headed by Congressman Porter Goss, issued a statement \nyesterday titled: ``Irregularities Mar the Electoral Process.'' The IRI \nstatement details grave concerns with the Haitian elections.\n  The International Republican Institute deserves credit for its honest \nand serious effort to expose flaws in the Haitian election process. The \ninternational community should not just stand by and applaud a deeply \nflawed election. As Chairman Goss' statement noted yesterday, ``The \nHaitian people deserve better.''\n  In light of the work done by IRI, it was all the more surprising to \nsee the\n Washington Post editorialize today against IRI's work. The Post \nclaimed IRI's criticism was not informed or constructive, but \nmisunderstood the tough effort to rehabilitate Haiti. I agree the \neffort to rehabilitate Haiti will be tough--but it will not be served \nby turning our eyes from the very real problems in Haiti, or from an \nelection that is fraught with problems. This is not a Republican view--\nit is an honest assessment of the facts. The New York Times today \nreported that the Haitian election unraveled further yesterday. The \nmayor of Port au Prince, an old ally of President Aristide, said \nyesterday: ``There has been massive fraud. It does not seriously \nadvance the process.''\n\n  I expect hearings into Haiti's election to begin as soon as the \nSenate returns from recess in July. Instead of criticizing the monitors \nof the election, the Post should look for answers to the tough \nquestions:\n  Why were thousands of candidates rejected by the election council in \ntotal secrecy?\n  Why was an official list of candidates never released?\n  Why weren't election administrators trained until it was too late--\ndespite the availability of millions in international assistance for \nsuch training?\n  What happened to 1 million voter registration cards missing before \nelection day? Why were voter registration records unavailable on \nelection day, and then being destroyed 48 hours later?\n  Why was there a complete lack of ballot security on election day and \nsubsequently?\n  Why were thousands of ballots and tally sheets destroyed and \ndiscarded before any official count was recorded or finalized today in \nPort au Prince and other departments?\n  Are the verifiable cases of ballot substitution part of a national \npattern to influence the outcome of the elections?\n  Why was President Aristide silent on key issues of election integrity \nin the days before Sunday's balloting?\n  Who in the government and police force played a role in the \nundermining of Haitian democracy?\n  What has happened to the millions of dollars in election assistance \ngiven to Haiti--amid rumors that elections workers will not be paid?\n  Is the election chaos in Haiti orchestrated, as charged by credible \ninternational observers on the scene today?\n  These and other issues deserve serious scrutiny--not just \ncheerleading. The Haitian election process is at a standstill. I \nbelieve the election process in Haiti should be judged by the same \nstandard used for other elections in other parts of the world--the \nHaitian people deserve no less. The election observers have left the \ncountry but IRI is still on the ground asking the tough questions. I am \nconfident Congress will fully examine all issues associated with the \nHaitian elections in the coming weeks.\n  I ask consent that a summary of the preelection analysis and the \nInternational Republican Institute statement of June 26, 1995, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Republican Institute,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1995.\n\nIrregularities Mar Electoral Process--Statement by Rep. Porter Goss (R-\n                        FL), Delegation Chairman\n\n       Good morning. This is our second press conference. On \n     Saturday, the International Republican Institute (IRI) \n     released its pre-electoral assessment in which we expressed \n     our concern over a number of issues. They include the \n     implications of the failure of the electoral authorities to \n     create an open, transparent and verifiable process; the \n     disqualification of parties and candidates; the lack of \n     adequate training for electoral workers; and the failure to \n     conduct any civic education to encourage voter participation. \n     Today, all of us here have seen the consequences of these \n     failings.\n       I want to underscore the fact that our delegates are still \n     in the field throughout the nine departments sending in \n     reports. Election day has only recently come to an end and \n     the counting continues. Our serious concern about the total \n     lack of ballot security is being borne out as I speak. We \n     received reports from our delegates early this morning who \n     observed disturbing irregularities at BEC level (regional \n     collection and counting station). I have asked our delegation \n     to determine the extent of these abuses for our evaluation of \n     the count. The problems in this electoral process can only \n     complicate the strengthening of democracy in Haiti.\n       Frankly, the Haitian people deserve better. We saw their \n     remarkable dignity and endurance yesterday while trying \n     earnestly to participate in an arbitrary process. We share a \n     common objective with others in the international community--\n     we all want a better Haiti and a stronger democracy here. IRI \n     is not here to certify this election. Only the Haitian people \n     themselves have the right to determine the legitimacy of this \n     process. Already several major parties have issued statements \n     challenging the integrity of the process. We must take their \n     judgements seriously.\n       Let me share with you our observations about yesterday's \n     events. We received radio and telephone reports from IRI \n     delegates in the field from Les Cayes to Fort Liberte. \n     Together, the IRI delegates have visited during the course of \n     election day about 500 BIVs (local polling stations). Our \n     delegates in Jacmel and Jermie reported an election we had \n     hoped for--sufficiently organized, whose irregularities were \n     overcome by the Haitian people and the electoral workers \n     themselves. For myself, the only normal process I observed \n     was at Cabaret, which is doubly ironic because it used to be \n     Duvalierville, the former dictator's Potemkin Village. Our \n     delegates throughout the departments in the north reported \n     graphically about the closing of the BIVs, the intimidation \n     of politicians and the burning down of the BEC in Limbe. \n     Today in Port-au-Prince our delegates observed the use of \n     xeroxed ballots, and early this morning we witnessed tally \n     sheets being intentionally altered and ballots being \n     substituted with newly marked ballots. This occurred in the \n     Delmas BEC, not 10 minutes from where we are today. This \n     raises the serious possibility of the political manipulation \n     of this election.\n       So let me take a step back and point out a positive aspect \n     of these elections. Throughout the country, all of us were \n     surprised and impressed by the significant presence of \n     political party observers. I would like to give credit to the \n     Haitian private sector who filled a crucial void by providing \n     the necessary support to field these pollwatchers. The Center \n     for Free Enterprise and Democracy (CLED) deserves credit for \n     putting this bold initiative together in 48 hours.\n       Let me summarize our grave concerns:\n       Security: The international military served as a deterrent \n     to widespread violence for these elections. However, the \n     issue of personal security for those participating in this \n     political process remains a serious concern. This issue was \n     permeated every step of the process, affected the quality of \n     the campaign, the environment in which this election occurred \n     and clearly lessened voter participation. It was magnified \n     yesterday by threatened electoral workers and intimidated and \n     harassed candidates. Yesterday, violent incidents closed BIVs \n     in Port-au-Prince, Limbe, Port de Paix, Don Don, Ferrier, \n     Jean Rabel, Carrefour and Cite Soleil. These actions \n     disenfranchised an undeserving Haitian population. Without \n     visible security, BIV authorities were forced to close the \n     polls and in other cases voters went home without casting \n     their votes.\n       Voter Materials: The CEP failed to deliver and distribute \n     voter materials in the necessary time frame. Many BIVs also \n     received incomplete election material packages. This resulted \n     in countless delayed BIV openings. This created enormous \n     voter frustration and even postponed the elections in La \n     Chapelle.\n\n[[Page S 9133]]\n\n       Unpaid Elections Workers: As noted in our pre-electoral \n     assessment, the failure of the CEP to pay thousands of \n     electoral workers was attributed as one of the reasons for \n     absenteeism which delayed and closed many BIVs. \n     Demonstrations were reported in several departments.\n       Administration Capability: As noted in our pre-electoral \n     assessment, electoral workers received minimal or no training \n     on the duties and procedures. This resulted not only in \n     lengthy delays but jeopardized the security and secrecy of \n     the process.\n  Secrecy of the Ballot: There was widespread disregard for the secrecy \nof this process. IRI and other delegates reported that the ballot box \nseals were rarely used. Additionally, the setup of most BIV's did not \nafford voters secrecy in marking their ballots.\n  Security of the Ballot: The most flagrant lack of control occurred \nfrom the point of the count to the BEC level. Upon arrival of the \nballots at the BEC's, observers reported a lack of control of used and \nunused ballots. The most egregious examples of this known to IRI \noccurred in the Delmas BEC where clean ballots were marked and \nsubstituted for ballots that had arrived from the BIV's; tally sheets \nwere altered.\n  Disqualification of Candidates: The thoroughly arbitrary process of \nqualifying candidates led to serious consequences which we anticipated \nin our pre-election report. While some argued that the number of \ncandidates that were disqualified was not statistically significant, it \nproved on election day to destabilize the electoral environment in \ncertain areas. The results of this ranged from a low voter turn out in \nSaint Marc where five candidates for magistrate were left off the \nballot to Jean Rabel, where it was reported that followers of \nindependent candidate Henry Desamour burned ballots and closed BIV's \nbecause his name did not appear on the ballot.\n  Voter Turnout: IRI delegates reported low to modest voter turnout in \nthe BIV's they visited. If this remains the case, we believe that it is \nthe consequence of a compressed election timetable, a lack of civic \neducation, and frustration with the electoral process.\n  It was important for Haiti and the international community to hold \nthis election, but holding an election is simply not enough. The \npurpose of this election was to create layers of government that can \nserve as checks and balances on each other and decentralize power as \nenvisioned by the 1987 Constitution. That is why it was important to \nhave an inclusive process, not one marked by exclusion.\n  It has been IRI's intent throughout this process to be thorough, \nindependent, objective and constructive. In this regard, IRI will \nmaintain a presence in Haiti through the final round of elections and \nwill make recommendations for the formation of the permanent electoral \ncouncil.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Haiti--IRI Pre-Electoral Assessment of the June 25, 1995, Legislative \n                 and Municipal Elections, June 24, 1995\n\n\n                          i. executive summary\n       On June 25, 1995 Haiti will hold elections for 18 Senators, \n     83 Deputies, 135 mayors and 565 community councils. These \n     elections were originally to be held in December but were \n     postponed several times for a variety of reasons.\n       This election occurs at a pivotal time for Haiti as it \n     struggles to rejoin the family of democratic nations and \n     offer renewed hope of stability for its people. This election \n     is also critical for the international community as it seeks \n     a benchmark to demonstrate the transition from an \n     internationally dominated country to a Haiti governed by \n     Haitians. For many in the international community, these \n     issues have made the holding of an election far more \n     important than the quality of the election. IRI has sought to \n     evaluate the pre-electoral process and environment for their \n     comparision to minimal standards of acceptability.\n\n\n                           Electoral Process\n\n       The legal foundation for these elections was a Presidential \n     decree that subverted the legislative process.\n       The formulation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) \n     itself breached an agreement between the President of the \n     Republic and the political parties to allow the parties to \n     nominate all candidates from which CEP members would be \n     chosen by the three branches of government. Only two of the \n     nine CEP members were chosen from the parties' list.\n       The voter registration process, to have been administered \n     by the CEP, was complicated by miscalculations of population \n     size, lack of sufficient materials and registration sites, \n     and one million missing voter registration cards.\n       The CEP review of the over 11,000 candidate dossiers for \n     eligibility was a protracted process that occurred under a \n     cloak of secrecy. When the CEP made its decisions known, by \n     radio, no reasons were given for the thousands of candidates \n     rejected. After vehement protests by the parties, some \n     reasons were supplied and supplemental lists were announced \n     through June 14, thirty-one days after the date the final \n     candidate list was to be announced. This stripped the CEP of \n     its credibility with the political parties. There is still \n     not a final list of approved candidates available.\n       The sliding scale of registration fees imposed by the CEP--\n     whereby political parties with fewer CEP approved candidates \n     pay larger fees--has made it difficult for many parties to \n     compete. As of June 20, five days before the election, \n     protests against this unusual requirement have gone \n     unanswered.\n       The ability of the CEP and those under its direction to \n     administer an election is unclear. As of June 20, five days \n     prior to the election, formal instructions for the procedures \n     of election day and the count has yet to be issued; this has \n     prevented the 45,000 persons needed to administer election \n     day from receiving specific training.\n       As of June 20, those persons designated by the political \n     parties as pollwatchers had not yet received any training \n     from the CEP which could lead to serious confusion on \n     election day.\n       These actions have led to deep misgivings across the \n     Haitian political spectrum about the ability of the CEP to \n     fulfill the mandate and functions normally executed by \n     election commissions. Political parties had no idea to whom \n     to turn with complaints in the process--the CEP, the \n     President of the Republic, the United Nations Electoral \n     Assistance Unit or the United States Government. Three \n     political parties withdrew from the process as a form of \n     protest.\n\n\n                         electoral environment\n\n       A concern for security is an issue that has permeated every \n     step of the process. The assassination of Mireille Durocher \n     Bertin, a well-known lawyer and leading political opponent of \n     Aristide, only confirmed the fears of the parties and \n     candidates. During the crisis, many elected representatives \n     feared returning to their districts, contributing to the \n     decay of political infrastructure. Candidates have curtailed \n     their campaign activities and have given personal security a \n     higher priority.\n       The campaign itself began late and has been barely visible \n     until some activities in the last week prior to elections. \n     Given the process and environment surrounding these \n     elections, it is doubtful many of Haiti's recognized \n     political parties could have competed effectively.\n       The electorate itself is basically uninformed about this \n     election--what it stands for and who is running. There has \n     been no civic education campaign, with the exception of some \n     limited U.S. and U.N. military efforts, to illuminate the \n     purpose of this election.\n       Similarly, there has been no educational campaign on how to \n     vote, which for a largely illiterate population in Haiti \n     could pose serious difficulties on election day.\n       Compared to other ``transition elections'' observed by IRI, \n     such as in Russia in 1993, El Salvador in 1994, South Africa \n     in 1994 and even China's Jilan Province village elections in \n     1994, the pre-electoral process and environment in Haiti has \n     seriously challenged the most minimally accepted standards \n     for the holding of a credible election.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9131-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9133-S9141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Maryland to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1478\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the safe harbor provisions of the bill)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1478.\n\n       On page 114, strike lines 7 and 8, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) made with the actual knowledge that it was false or \n     misleading;\n       On page 121, strike lines 1 and 2, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) made with the actual knowledge that it was false or \n     misleading;\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the previous amendment, the one we just \nconsidered, which was not adopted on a vote of 43 to 56, would have \nsent the matter of defining the parameters of the safe harbor exemption \nto the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I, of course, argued very strenuously in the consideration of the \namendment \n\n[[Page S 9134]]\nthat that is where this ought to be done, that it ought not to be done, \nwell, in the committee and now in this Chamber, because the existing \ndefinition in the bill has already been amended.\n  The Senate did not adopt that provision, and the question now arises, \nif you are going to have a statutory definition, what should it be? \nWhat should it be?\n  This amendment that has been sent to the desk would strike out the \nlanguage that is in the bill. What the bill says is that the exemption \nfrom the liability provided does not apply to a forward-looking \nstatement that is knowingly made with the expectation, purpose, and \nactual intent of misleading investors.\n  Earlier the Senator from New York modified that and struck the word \n``expectation,'' but the problem still remains, the essential problem \nwhich prompted the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto say, and I quote him, ``I cannot embrace proposals which allow \nwillful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.''\n  So we are now into the question, if the standard in the bill is \ninappropriate, as I believe strongly it is, and as has been indicated \nby the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and indeed \nby other securities regulators, State securities regulators, by \nGovernment finance officers and others, all of whom in a sense are \noutside the controversy amongst the economic interests associated with \nthis bill, and represent the public interest, the question now is, is \nthis standard so difficult that all but the most egregious fraudulent \nefforts would be exempted from liability. And I submit that it is, and \nthe amendment I have sent to the desk is an effort to modify that. The \nstandard provided for in that amendment is made with the actual \nknowledge that it was false or misleading.\n  Let me repeat that: Made with the actual knowledge that it was false \nor misleading.\n  There are forward-looking statements that would be exempted from \nliability under the standard in the bill that would not be exempted \nfrom liability under the standard of this amendment.\n  The question then becomes, is the standard in this amendment an \nappropriate one? And I defy anyone to advance a rationale why a \nforward-looking statement made with the actual knowledge that it was \nfalse or misleading should be protected from liability. I have heard \npeople talk, oh, we are not going to allow knowing fraud to be \nprotected.\n  That is exactly what this amendment provides. It says that the \nexemption from liability provided for in this bill does not apply for a \nforward-looking statement that is made with the actual knowledge that \nit was false or misleading. And I want to hear from others, if they \noppose the amendment, why they believe a forward-looking statement made \nwith the actual knowledge that it was false or misleading ought to be \nprotected from liability.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of significance and moment. We have \nheard from the various securities regulators in opposition to the \nprovision in the committee bill. The National Association of Securities \nDealers has written to us in opposition to it, as has the Government \nFinance Officers Association. SEC, of course, I have already quoted \ntheir statement. But let me just point out the Government Finance \nOfficers Association, which represents more than 13,000 State and local \ngovernment financial officials, county treasurers, city managers, and \nso on, and which issues securities and invests billions of dollars of \npublic pension and public taxpayer funds every year, wrote of the safe \nharbor provision in the bill, the standard that we are seeking to \nchange, the one in the bill which says knowingly made with the purpose \nand actual intent of misleading investors, ``We believe this opens a \nmajor loophole through which wrongdoers could escape liability while \nfraud victims would be denied recovery.''\n  Let me repeat that: ``We believe this opens a major loophole through \nwhich wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims would be \ndenied recovery.''\n  The provision in the bill requires you to show the actual intent of \nthe parties making the forward-looking statement. Not only that, you \nhave to show that it was knowingly made with the purpose of misleading \ninvestors. And as originally written also the expectation, although \nthat was stricken earlier in our consideration. So it is now knowingly \nmade with the purpose and actual intent of misleading the investors.\n  That is what you have to demonstrate in order for the forward-looking \nstatement to lose its immunization from liability. And that is a \nstandard that is so extreme that the Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission wrote to us and said, ``I cannot embrace proposals \nwhich allow willful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor \nprotection.'' And that is the provision which the Government Finance \nOfficers Assocation said, ``We believe this opens a major loophole \nthrough which wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud victims \nwould be denied recovery.''\n  The amendment that I have sent to the desk very simply states that \nthe exemption from liability is lost for a forward-looking statement \nthat is made with the actual knowledge that it was false or misleading, \nvery simply put. You make a forward-looking statement, and you make it \nwith the actual knowledge that it was false or the actual knowledge \nthat it was misleading, and you lose your immunity. You lose your \nimmunity.\n  Why should anyone who makes a forward-looking statement with an \nactual knowledge that it was false or misleading have immunity from \nliability for that forward-looking statement?\n  That is the issue that is before us by this amendment. It was my \npreference that this issue be worked out by the Commission. I thought \nthat is where it ought to go in terms of expertise.\n  If Members want to deal with it here on the floor, then we need to \nexamine it on the standard, address the standard that is in the bill, \nwhy I think it opens, as the Government Finance Officers said, a major \nloophole, or which, as the Chairman of the Commission said, would allow \nwillful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection. That \nought not to be the case. Therefore, I propose to substitute the \nlanguage ``made with actual knowledge that it was false or \nmisleading.'' No statement made with the actual knowledge that it was \nfalse or with the actual knowledge that it was misleading ought to have \nsafe harbor protection.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, what we are talking about now is what we \ncall in legal jargon the scienter standard. It is not an easy one. It \ncan be difficult to understand. And indeed it can open up an incredible \nloophole, one that we are attempting to deal with; that is, to permit \npeople to make projections. And they must state--I can have that \ndisclaimer--they must state this is a projection, this is a projection, \nand that it may not be accurate. I will get the exact verbiage. It may \nnot be accurate.\n  Whole classes of issuers are exempted, the penny stocks, the mergers \nand acquisitions. ``Refers clearly that such projections, estimates, or \ndescriptions are forward-looking statements and the risk that the \nactual results may differ materially from such projections, estimates, \nor descriptions'' has to be included.\n  Now, let us read the language, because I have heard this, and I have \nseen it written, too. It is inaccurate to describe this bill as giving \na license to people to knowingly, with intent, defraud. It is just \nwrong.\n  Here is the language in the bill. We modified it today because I \nthought there was one standard that might go above and beyond. The \nexemption from liability provided for in subsection A does not apply. \nIt does not apply. In other words, you get no exemption. Then on page \n114, line 4, it says:\n\n       (c) Exclusions.--The exemption from liability provided for \n     in subsection (a) does not apply to a forward-looking \n     statement that is--\n\n  In other words, you get no exemption.\n\n       (1) knowingly made with the expectation, purpose, and \n     actual intent of misleading investors.\n\n  So if you knowingly make a false statement, knowingly, with the \npurpose and actual intent of misleading \n\n[[Page S 9135]]\ninvestors, you are not protected. And that is as it should be. These \nare projections. Now, I have to ask the question, who knows what \nsomeone knows, what is knowledge to them? And once you have that, once \nyou say, if you knowingly made this, all they have to do--the \nplaintiffs bar this particular group, very small group --is allege that \nyou knowingly made a false statement.\n  The burden now comes upon that person who has this complaint filed \nagainst them to prove that they did not. How do you prove it? How do \nyou prove it? That is why we say, look, it has to be a little tougher. \nYou cannot say, ``You knowingly made this. You knowingly made this, \nknowingly, with intent, with the purpose to mislead investors.'' It \nseems to me that that is pretty reasonable.\n  If a person does that, then you should go after them and hold them. \nWe do. They are not exempt. We get down to the issue of splitting legal \nhairs and opening the doors for this group of bandits. That is what \nthey are, bandits, absolute bandits; this is the group that, you know, \nsuggests that we make it easier to bring these kinds of suits. We do \nnot want to make it easier to bring suits that have no merit, where \npeople allege someone knowingly, falsely made these statements. All you \nhave to do is allege someone made the statement. Bingo, we have not \nsolved the problem. That brings us right back into court and brings us \ninto the situation where a person gets sued for millions, and has to \nsettle for millions of dollars and/or pay millions of dollars in legal \nfees against claims that would otherwise be worthless and should get no \ndollars.\n  I have to tell you something; that we have sat back for far too long \nin dealing with this because it was really a very small and almost \ninsignificant portion of the population that was affected. We did not \nsee on a daily basis lawsuits being brought with no claim. We did not \nsee where we had, for example, of 229 cases filed, 229 cases filed, 38 \npercent used the same repeat plaintiffs; 38 percent used the same \ncadre. In other words, they were professional plaintiffs. And I have to \ntell you why we may have cured that and said--by the way, they were \npaid bonuses. These people, for letting their names be used, got \n$15,000, $20,000, $25,000 for being professional plaintiffs.\n  So when we talk about protecting the little guy, we are not \nprotecting the little guy. What we are trying to do is put a stop to \nand really protect the investors who have their money invested in these \nsmall companies, who have the mutual funds, who have those pension \nfunds, which represent trillions of dollars and truly represent \nmillions of people. Give them an opportunity. Give them a say. And do \nnot have their companies savaged by people who are only looking to take \ncare of their own interests. And those are the buccaneering barristers, \nthose lawyers. The term was coined, at least the first time I heard it, \nby Senator Dodd. He happens to be correct. They are sharks who are \nlooking to eat whatever they can and the devil may care as it relates \nto the harm and the injury that they bring, in many cases, to good \npeople simply by being able to allege that someone knowingly made a \nmisleading statement.\n  We say, no, you have to go a little further. Knowingly, and you have \nto show intent. Because who knows what ``knowingly'' is. Show me. You \nsay: I allege you knew it. I say I did not know. But if one has to \nallege that you knew and you had intent, that is a little more \ndifficult; is it not? I think people are entitled to that presumption. \nI do not think they should be subjected to these scurrilous lawsuits. \nAnd they have taken place. That is why we say ``knowingly, with \nintent,'' and that you deliberately did this to mislead investors.\n  It is one thing to have people subjected to suits where there is \nintent to deliberately mislead, and it is another thing where people \nhave made accidents and now are held to a standard whereby that was an \naccident and they say, ``You knew.'' You say, ``I did not know.'' You \ndid and you actually made, if the fellow actually made the statement, \nhe made the statement. Nobody can say he actually did not. So the word \n``actually,'' that is nothing. They say you have knowledge, claim you \nhave knowledge. Wait, I did not know that it was wrong. I got you in \ncourt because all I had to do is say that, well, you did. You had \nactual knowledge, and if you checked your papers, you would have found \nout that the projections you were making were off. Now I have him in \nunder a claim of actual knowledge.\n  Did he really have actual knowledge? No. But it is very easy to \nallege. And once you allege it, you have him in this revolving door, in \nthe chain. What do his lawyers say to him? ``We can fight it. We may be \nable to win it.'' But you know what? You may stand to lose, if they get \na judgment against you, tens of millions of dollars, and put the \ncompany--a startup company --out of business. Or if you are an \naccountant, yes, we can probably win it. But you can get hit pretty \nhard. Because you know, these people made this and you saw it and they \ndragged you in.\n  I think that when you look at and read what we have put in, not what \nsomebody puts in substitution, tell me how you can read this bill and \nsay, anybody, that we say that you can deliberately lie and mislead \nwith intent, and that we give you safe harbor for that? We do not.\n  I want to do it, and I will sit down and read once more, there is no \nexemption from liability where, line 7, a forward looking statement is:\n\n       (1) knowingly made with the expectation, purpose, and \n     actual intent of misleading investors.\n\n  They are not protected. You can be sued. And if that is the case, you \nshould be sued, no doubt; absolutely. There is nothing that keeps the \nSEC from doing this, from bringing these suits. Our bill does not \nprotect fraudulent statements or conduct. The administration does not \nsay that it does. It does not say that it does.\n  A letter, from Abner Mikva, counsel to the President, asked for \nclarification. I do not think that our bill is unclear on this point. I \ncan clarify it. If it is, this debate should provide important guidance \nthat the bill does not and will not protect fraud. I think this is \nclarification enough. How many times should we state it? We do not do \nit, we will not do it, that is not my intent, and I urge my colleagues \nto oppose the amendment by my distinguished colleague and friend from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York \nread the standard that is in the bill, and that is the problem, that \nstandard. Those who are knowledgeable in the securities field have \nlooked at that standard and reached the conclusion that it is an \nenormous loophole, and it will enable people to engage in willful \nfraud.\n  The amendment which I sent to the desk, which would change that \nlanguage, would not allow a forward-looking statement to claim \nexemption from liability where the statement was made with the actual \nknowledge that it was false or misleading.\n  What every Member has to ask themselves is on what possible basis \nwould you want to give immunity to a forward-looking statement that was \nmade with the actual knowledge that it was false or with the actual \nknowledge that it was misleading? I submit to you, statements of that \nsort ought not to be protected from immunity. The bill, as written, \nwould, in effect, allow statements made of that sort to have protection \nfrom immunity.\n  The standard in the bill is so high and so narrow that virtually any \nforward-looking statement is going to have immunity. The burden of \nshowing purpose and actual intent--before, of course, we also had \nexpectation which the Senators struck from the bill--but to show \npurpose and actual intent is so heavy that a lot of very fast games by \nsome very fast artists are going to be played on the investing public \nand is going to cause a lot of people a great deal of grief and harm \nand damage.\n  So I urge Members to examine this issue very carefully. This is one \nof those issues that will come back to haunt you because people are \ngoing to be swindled, they are not going to be reachable because of the \nimmunity which the bill provides, and everyone is going to look at what \nthey did and say, ``Why should these people be immunized from \nliability,'' and the responsibility for immunizing them is going to \nrest on the people voting on this \n\n[[Page S 9136]]\namendment and voting on this legislation.\n  So I very strongly urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Now, the letter to which my colleague referred is a letter from the \ncounsel to the President, Judge Mikva. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       The White House\n                                        Washington, June 27, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to express the \n     administration's support of your amendment to S. 240. The \n     administration strongly believes the bill's safe harbor \n     provision should not protect a statement made with the actual \n     knowledge that it was false or misleading.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       . . . should not protect a statement made with the actual \n     knowledge that it was false or misleading.\n       The bill's current safe harbor standard would exclude \n     forward-looking statements ``knowingly made with the \n     expectation, purpose, and actual intent of misleading \n     investors.''\n\n  And as I noted, let me depart from the text of the letter for a \nmoment, not very long ago, earlier in our proceedings, the Senator from \nNew York struck the word ``expectation'' from the standard that is in \nthe bill.\n  So he continues then, it now reads:\n\n       ``knowingly made with the purpose, and actual intent of \n     misleading investors.''\n\n  I double checked, and I am told that does not affect the import of \nthis letter, and that knowing of that change, the letter still stands \nas sent to us. I double checked that in order to be very accurate with \nmy colleagues.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission has opposed the use \n     of this standard because it might allow some defendants to \n     avoid liability for certain false statements.\n       In the Statement of Administration Policy forwarded to the \n     Senate on June 23, 1995, the administration urged the Senate \n     to clarify whether the safe harbor's current language would \n     protect statements known to be materially false or misleading \n     when made. The Senate can best ensure that the safe harbor \n     would not protect fraudulent statements by adopting an actual \n     knowledge standard, as your amendment proposes.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       The Senate can best ensure that the safe harbor would not \n     protect fraudulent statements by adopting an actual knowledge \n     standard, as your amendment proposes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Abner J. Mikva,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleague from New York has suggested, well, we are \njust splitting legal hairs here. We are engaged in some difficult legal \nanalysis, that is quite true. And I suggested that when we did the \nprevious amendment that the place where this ought to be done is by the \nSEC. The Senator from New York did not agree with that, and a fairly \nnarrow margin of the Members of this body supported him in that view \nand, therefore, the burden falls upon us to define the standard here.\n  The SEC and the State regulators have told us that the standard, as \nwritten in the bill, will protect fraud artists. In effect, the bill \nswings the pendulum too far and the language of the bill goes too far \nand, therefore, will end up protecting fraud and hurting investors.\n  This amendment is an effort to bring the pendulum back toward the \nmiddle. It still will provide an enhanced safe harbor over what now \nexists, but it will not go to the extreme lengths of the provision in \nthe bill which all the experts tell us, all the people whose \nresponsibility it is to deal with securities fraud, who work in the \nfield full-time all the time, they all tell us that this will end up \nprotecting fraud artists. As I said, the Chairman of the SEC said:\n\n       I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to \n     receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here. The substitute standard which \nI am proposing simply says that you are not going to give protection \nfrom liability to a forward-looking statement --listen very carefully \nto this--to a forward-looking statement that is made with the actual \nknowledge that it was false or misleading. You cannot make the \nstatement with actual knowledge that it is false or actual knowledge \nthat it is misleading and be protected from liability.\n And I invite anyone to explain to me why that kind of statement ought \nto get protection from liability. I would think it is as clear as can \nbe that is the very sort of statement that ought not to get protection \nfrom liability. Therefore, I say to my colleagues, if--as apparently \nhas been decided--we are going to write the standard right here, \nclearly, we must rewrite the standard in the bill. I submit that the \nstandard contained in the amendment is an appropriate standard, if we \nare going to be concerned about a proper balance that will help to \nprovide some insurance that investors will not be subjected to fraud.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's support of your amendment to S. 240. The \n     Administration strongly believes the bill's safe harbor \n     provision should not protect a statement made with the actual \n     knowledge that it was false or misleading.\n       The bill's current safe-harbor standard would exclude \n     forward-looking statements ``knowingly made with the \n     expectation, purpose, and actual intent of misleading \n     investors.'' The Securities and Exchange Commission has \n     opposed the use of this standard because it might allow some \n     defendants to avoid liability for certain false statements.\n       In the Statement of Administration Policy forwarded to the \n     Senate on June 23, 1995, the Administration urged the Senate \n     to clarify whether the safe harbor's current language would \n     protect statements known to be materially false or misleading \n     when made. The Senate can best ensure that the safe-harbor \n     would not protect fraudulent statements by adopting an actual \n     knowledge standard, as your amendment proposes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Abner J. Mikva,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think we have debated this point now \nover and over. First, let me say, that if the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has constructive suggestions to make in this area, we stand \nready, willing, and able to adopt them. We would be happy to have \nhearings. But, we have been waiting for the safe harbor standards for 3 \nyears, and we finally have felt compelled to create the safe harbor \nourselves. Once again, I direct my colleagues to the letters from \nChairman Levitt. He has shared with us the frustration and problems \nthat the business community face. He alludes to these problems and he \nhas recognized that there is a need to begin solving these problems.\n  Now, if you look at the language of my friend and colleagues' \namendment, and then look at the language in S. 240, as it currently \nexists, it is very clear that the current language means that if you \nknowingly make a statement with the purpose and intent of misleading \ninvestors you will be held liable. This current standard means that you \nhave to demonstrate that this statement was made with an intent to \nmislead investors. However, the Sarbanes amendment would reduce that \nstandard to just knowing a misstatement was made. That is too easy to \nallege. That opens the door to meritless suits and that then forces \nfirms to pay huge settlements. That is what we are attempting to stop.\n  We cannot countenance lying nor can we countenance the making of \nfalse statements. But the fact of the matter is, if we use this \nscienter provision, it will open the door to meritless litigation based \nonly on allegation. This will prove to be a nearly impossible \nstandard--how does one prove that he actually did not know and was not \naware of the misstatement? How does one prove that? That is the high \nburden that we place on the defendant with this standard. With this \nstandard, I feel that firms will be forced to settle and that means \npayments of millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from \nMaryland, first of all, for offering a creative amendment here. It \nlooks tempting with the language that is offered and the arguments he \nhas given \n\n[[Page S 9137]]\nas to why not just support the replacement language that he has \noffered, which would strike paragraph one on page 121 and paragraph one \non another page--I apologize for not having the page number--and \nreplace what we now have, ``knowingly made with the purpose and intent \nof misleading investors,'' to ``actual knowledge of false and \nmisleading information,'' I believe is the language of the amendment.\n  Let me begin, Mr. President, by stating what I hope all of our \ncolleagues will accept is the point here. That is, that we are all \nafter the same goal--certainly, those of us who have spent time over \nthe last 3 or 4 years in trying to deal with the broader issue that \nthis legislation attempts to address. I have tried to strike a balance \nthat will deal with an existing problem that we have identified over \nthese last several days in our debate.\n  Let us also assume that we have some six, seven, eight pages here in \nthe bill that deal with the issue of safe harbor. An amendment being \noffered by the Senator from Maryland deals with one clause--an \nimportant clause, but nonetheless one aspect of safe harbor.\n  I said earlier today, Mr. President, that the purpose of safe harbor \nis designed to encourage the disclosure of information, to encourage \nthe disclosure of information. There is no requirement, under law, that \ncompanies disclose information to potential investors. There may be \nthose who want to require that, but the law does not require it.\n  So the very purpose of having a safe harbor is not just to create \nsome island where people can make statements, futuristic statements, \nand avoid litigation or be immune, but because we think it is important \nto elicit from businesses, from industry, from corporations, statements \nabout what they believe the company is likely to be doing.\n  Good news and bad news. It is not just good news. A forward-looking \nstatement can be bad news about what may happen--product lines that are \nnot necessarily going to live up to earlier expectations.\n  I hope that everyone would agree that it is in the interests of our \ncountry economically to encourage businesses to be forthcoming about \ninformation which they possess that will allow for investors to make \nintelligent, reasonable decisions about whether to buy stock, sell \nstock, whatever else they may be engaged in. That is why we create a \nsafe harbor. That is the only reason for it.\n  If you had a law that required businesses to tell everything they \nknow, you would not need safe harbor. No one is suggesting we do that. \nProprietary information, businesses trying to make plans for the \nfuture, should remain private. In the whole area of securities \nlitigation, the notion of safe harbor is a longstanding notion.\n  The problem, today, as identified by the Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission is that the present safe harbor is not working.\n  We have heard at length earlier today, and maybe I ought to put in \nthe letter again, the letter of May 19, in which the Chairman of the \nSEC identifies in paragraph 3 of that letter, ``There is a need for \nstronger safe harbor than currently exists.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord, because the Chairman of the SEC lays out why that problem \nexists.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Chairman of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission I have no higher priority than to protect \n     American investors and ensure an efficient capital formation \n     process. I know personally just how deeply you share these \n     goals. In keeping with our common purpose, but the SEC and \n     the Congress are working to find an appropriate ``safe \n     harbor'' from the liability provisions of the federal \n     securities laws for projections and other forward-looking \n     statements made by public companies. Several pieces of \n     proposed legislation address the issue of the safe harbor and \n     the House-passed version, H.R. 1058, specifically defines \n     such a safe harbor.\n       Your committee is now considering securities litigation \n     reform legislation that will include a safe harbor provision. \n     Rather than simply repeat the Commission's request that \n     Congress await the outcome of our rulemaking deliberations \n     and thereby run the risk of missing an opportunity to provide \n     input for your own deliberations, I thought I would take this \n     opportunity to express my personal views about a legislative \n     approach to a safe harbor.\n       There is a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently \n     exists. The current rules have largely been a failure and I \n     share the disappointment of issuers that the rules have been \n     ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements. Our capital markets are built on the foundation \n     of full and fair disclosure. Analysts are paid and investors \n     are rewarded for correctly assessing a company's prospects. \n     The more investors know and understand management's future \n     plans and views, the sounder the valuation is of the \n     company's securities and the more efficient the capital \n     allocation process. Yet corporate America is hesitant to \n     disclose projections and other forward-looking information, \n     because of excessive vulnerability to lawsuits if predictions \n     ultimately are not realized.\n       As a businessman for most of my life, I know all too well \n     the punishing costs of meritless lawsuits--costs that are \n     ultimately paid by investors. Particularly galling are\n      the frivolous lawsuits that ignore the fact that a \n     projection is inherently uncertain even when made \n     reasonably and in good faith.\n       This is not to suggest that private litigation under the \n     federal securities laws is generally counterproductive. In \n     fact, private lawsuits are a necessary supplement to the \n     enforcement program of the Commission. We have neither the \n     resources nor the desire to replace private plaintiffs in \n     policing fraud; it makes more sense to let private forces \n     continue to play a key role in deterrence, than to vastly \n     expand the Commission's role. The relief obtained from \n     Commission disgorgement actions is no substitute for private \n     damage actions. Indeed, as government is downsized and \n     budgets are trimmed, the investor's ability to seek redress \n     directly is likely to increase in importance.\n       To achieve our common goal of encouraging enhanced sound \n     disclosure by reducing the threat of meritless litigation, we \n     must strike a reasonable balance. A carefully crafted safe \n     harbor protection from meritless private lawsuits should \n     encourage public companies to make additional forward-looking \n     disclosure that would benefit investors. At the same time, it \n     should not compromise the integrity of such information which \n     is vital to both investor protection and the efficiency of \n     the capital markets--the two goals of the federal securities \n     laws.\n       The safe harbor contained in H.R. 1058 is so broad and \n     inflexible that it may compromise investor protection and \n     market efficiency. It would, for example, protect companies \n     and individuals from private lawsuits even where the \n     information was purposefully fraudulent. This result would \n     have consequences not only for investors, but for the market \n     as well. There would likely be more disclosure, but would it \n     be better disclosure? Moreover, the vast majority of \n     companies whose public statements are published in good faith \n     and with due care could find the investing public skeptical \n     of their information.\n       I am concerned that H.R. 1058 appears to cover other \n     persons such as brokers. In the Prudential Securities case, \n     Prudential brokers intentionally made baseless statements \n     concerning expected yields solely to lure customers into \n     making what were otherwise extremely risky and unsuitable \n     investments. Pursuant to the Commission's settlement with \n     Prudential, the firm has paid compensation to its defrauded \n     customers of over $700 million. Do we really want to protect \n     such conduct from accountability to these defrauded \n     investors? In the past two years or so, the Commission has \n     brought eighteen enforcement cases involving the sale of more \n     than $200 million of interests in wireless cable partnerships \n     and limited liability companies. Most of these cases involved \n     fraudulent projections as to the returns investors could \n     expect from their investments. Promoters of these types of \n     ventures would be immune from private suits under H.R. 1058 \n     as would those who promote blank check offerings, penny \n     stocks, and roll-ups. It should also address conflict of \n     interest problems that may arise in management buyouts and \n     changes in control of a company.\n       A safe harbor must be balanced--it should encourage more \n     sound disclosure without encouraging either omission of \n     material information or irresponsible and dishonest \n     information. A safe harbor must be thoughtful--so that it \n     protects considered\n      projections, but never fraudulent ones. A safe harbor must \n     also be practical--it should be flexible enough to \n     accommodate legitimate investor protection concerns that \n     may arise on both sides of the issue. This is a complex \n     issue in a complex industry, and it raises almost as many \n     questions as one answers: Should the safe harbor apply to \n     information required by Commission rule, including \n     predictive information contained in the financial \n     statements (e.g. pension liabilities and over-the-counter \n     derivatives)? Should there be a requirement that forward-\n     looking information that has become incorrect be updated \n     if the company or its insiders are buying or selling \n     securities? Should the safe harbor extend to disclosures \n     made in connection with a capital raising transaction on \n     the same basis as more routine disclosures as well? Are \n     there categories of transactions, such as partnership \n     offerings or going private transactions \n\n[[Page S 9138]]\n     that should be subject to additional conditions?\n       There are many more questions that have arisen in the \n     course of the Commission's exploration of how to design a \n     safe harbor. We have issued a concept release, received a \n     large volume of comment letters in response, and held three \n     days of hearings, both in California and Washington. In \n     addition, I have met personally with most groups that might \n     conceivably have an interest in the subject: corporate \n     leaders, investor groups, plaintiff's lawyers, defense \n     lawyers, state and federal regulators, law professors, and \n     even federal judges. The one thing I can state unequivocally \n     is that this subject eludes easy answers.\n       Given these complexities--and in light of the enormous \n     amount of care, thought, and work that the Commission has \n     already invested in the subject--my recommendation would be \n     that you provide broad rulemaking authority to the Commission \n     to improve the safe harbor. If you wish to provide more \n     specificity by legislation, I believe the provision must \n     address the investor protection concerns mentioned above. I \n     would support legislation that sets forth a basic safe harbor \n     containing four components: (1) protection from private \n     lawsuits for reasonable projections by public companies; (2) \n     a scienter standard other than recklessness should be used \n     for a safe harbor and appropriate procedural standards should \n     be enacted to discourage and easily terminate meritless \n     litigation; (3) ``projections'' would include voluntary \n     forward-looking statements with respect to a group of \n     subjects such as sales, revenues, net income (loss), earnings \n     per share, as well as the mandatory information required in \n     the Management's Discussion and Analysis; and (4) the \n     Commission would have the flexibility and authority to \n     include or exclude classes of disclosures, transactions, or \n     persons as experience teaches us lessons and as circumstances \n     warrant.\n       As we work to reform the current safe harbor rules of the \n     Commission, the greatest problem is anticipating the \n     unintended consequences of the changes that will be made in \n     the standards of liability. The answer appears to be an \n     approach that maintains flexibility in responding to problems \n     that may develop. As a regulatory agency that administers the \n     federal securities laws, we are well situated to respond \n     promptly to any problems that may develop, if we are given \n     the statutory authority to do so. Indeed, one possibility we \n     are considering is a pilot safe harbor that would be reviewed \n     formally at the end of a two year period. What we have today \n     is unsatisfactory, but we think that, with your support, we \n     can expeditiously build a better model for tomorrow.\n       I am well aware of your tenacious commitment to the \n     individual Americans who are the backbone of our markets and \n     I have no doubt that you share our belief that the interests \n     of those investors must be held paramount. I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on safe harbor and other issues \n     related to securities litigation reform.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arthur Levitt.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if you disagree with safe harbor, and wish \nto apply a standard here that is appealing on its face, but actually \nundercuts the very intention of the safe harbor, then it seems to me \nyou run the risk of destroying a very important vehicle that causes \nbusinesses to voluntarily give information out that is critical. \nInformation, as I say, that could be positive or negative information. \nSo that is the reason it exists.\n  Now let me cite examples where I believe that the actual knowledge \nstandard, as tempting as it is, can actually just bring us back to the \npoint we are trying to get away from, and that is the litigation that \nhas swamped up in many ways in terms of the ability of these companies \nto move forward and to, as I said earlier, to give the kind of \ninformation that may be necessary.\n  We all want safe harbor, as I mention. We want a safe harbor that \nwill work. When the chief executive officer of a large industry goes to \nhis general counsel in a very practical way, and says ``Should I tell \npension fund investors,''--remember, that is primarily who we are \ntalking about-- ``that,'' returning to an earlier example, ``a new disk \ndrive at the heart of their investment in this company, may not quite \nwork as well as we planned.''\n  We should have a safe harbor that will allow the general counsel to \nsay ``Yes, you can say this without being sued.'' It is so the company \nnow has this information, not required by law, that it share that \ninformation. But the CEO says, ``I do not think this disk drive will \nwork quite as well as I planned, and I want to know whether or not to \nlet people know,'' knowing full well what may be the implication in \nterms of the investors.\n  Pension funds obviously, I think, are entitled to information even if \nit is not required to be disclosed. We want to make sure that CEO's can \nsay and tell us what is going on without the fear of millions of \ndollars in litigation costs. That is the point of this bill--trying to \nreduce litigation costs.\n  If we do not make this a very clear division, a very clear division, \nas to when safe harbor does not apply, it is not going to be safe \nenough, and that general counsel is then going to say to that CEO, \n``You are not required to say anything--don't say anything. Don't say \nanything.''\n  Who are the winners and losers, when that decision is made? The \ngeneral counsel says ``Don't say anything here, don't you dare say \nanything. You are not required to by law.'' You can never be sued for \nwhat he did not say in this case. So they do not do anything.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. If I could finish this train of thought, I will be glad to \nyield for a question.\n  We are trying here to get this information out. As the Council of \nInstitutional Investors, representing literally millions of small \ninvestors in this country with hundreds of billions of dollars in \nassets, said in testifying before the SEC, the safe harbor must be 100 \npercent safe.\n  Let me go back at that point quickly. There is a fear that Members \nwill think that anything that anybody does in relationship to \nsecurities can fall into this safe harbor category. That is not the \ncase at all.\n  As pointed out by the distinguished junior Senator from Utah today, \nby the Senator from New York, and myself, let me go back, there are 6 \nor 7 pages in the bill dealing with safe harbor. This is one line in \nthat entire section.\n  Safe harbor only applies to statements by issuance and reviewers \nhired. Statements by stockbrokers are not included. Certain issuers are \nexcluded from safe harbor, including anyone found to have violated \nsecurities law, anyone involved in penny stocks, blank check companies, \ninvestment companies, IPO's, tender offers, roll-up transactions--all \nare exempted. Historical information contained in historical financial \nstatements is excluded as well.\n  I forget to mention this earlier, but in this bill we require \ncautionary language be included in forward-looking statements so \ninvestors can pick up the kind of language that ought to give them a \nbetter sense to put them on notice that maybe these predictions are not \ngoing to turn out to either be as bad or as good as the company may \nutter and say. That was never before required.\n  In the discussion of safe harbor, remember, we are dealing with \nnarrow fact situations here.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is it not true that one of the other provisions never \nincluded, safe harbor will now permit the SEC to bring suits for \ndisgorgement, for violation of safe harbor provisions?\n  Mr. DODD. I was just about to get to that point. That is a second \nadded new provision.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That has never been in before?\n  Mr. DODD. Never before in this legislation. It is all new authority \nwe are extending to the SEC.\n  To listen to this debate, we would think we have been stripping away \nand stripping away. What we are doing is providing different vehicles. \nAs we listened and heard testimony, the Council of Institutional \nInvestors represents, I said, millions of people in the country, \ninvolving billions of dollars.\n  They want that information. These pension funds want to know what is \ngoing on in these companies. If these companies do not provide that \nkind of information, these pension funds are not making decisions with \nall of the information they have when they decide whether or not to \ninvest or not to invest.\n  So the safe harbor is a critical issue in soliciting that kind of \ninformation. That is why it is so important. I think their testimony \nbefore the SEC on truly a safe harbor, a 100 percent safe harbor is \nabsolutely critical. Again in the context of what we are talking about, \nthose that are excluded, from the protections of safe harbor.\n  Now, returning to my earlier example, I illustrate the problem with \nthe amendment of my colleague from Maryland. The CEO in the fact \nsituation I described does not think it will work out as well as it is, \nand goes to \n\n[[Page S 9139]]\nthe general counsel and says, ``should I share this information?''\n  It turns out the disk drive prediction that he had made was a panic \ndecision; that, in fact, the disk drive turns out to be fine, turns out \nnot to be as bad as he thought. But many shareholders, based on the \nearlier prediction, sold their stock. Now they sue them for actually \nknowing that the disk drive was really OK.\n  Of course when he gets before a jury he will be able to make his \ncase. But the problem is, Mr. President, before you get to the jury, \nyou are probably going to end up with a settlement involving millions \nof dollars, because there were memos or other information that came \nacross his desk that said, ``Mr. CEO, we think this disk drive will be \nOK.'' During the discovery period, as a practical matter in litigation, \nevery single paper that crossed that CEO's desk is going to be subject \nto discovery.\n  So there on the table is a memo or two or three that says, ``We think \nthis disk drive is not as bad as you think,'' but he felt based on his \nfeelings about this, with the advice of general counsel that he said \n``I don't think it will do that well.''\n  Now you have yourself with actual knowledge--not with intent, not \nwith purpose, to mislead, but with actual knowledge of information--\nthat suggested a different result than what the CEO predicted when he \nput out a statement that he thought the pension funds ought to know \nabout.\n  I do not believe that it is in our interest in the safe harbor \ncontext--not in other issues of aiding and abetting and joint and \nseveral and proportional liability, but in safe harbor context, if it \nis a standard of actual knowledge of something that existed that \ncontradicted your own statement, thereby you said something misleading, \nbecause there was information that reached a different conclusion, and \nyou end up with a lawyer saying ``Look, you know, I don't know how a \njury will find with this.'' The Sarbanes language in this bill says \n``actual knowledge.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actual knowledge that it was false. Why should anyone \nbe able to make a statement that they have actual knowledge that is \nfalse.\n  Mr. DODD. Misleading. That could be the subject of litigation here. \nYou made a statement that you said you thought this disk drive was \ngoing to do poorly. You had information before you that said something \nelse. I sold my stock on the basis of that prediction you put out, that \nit was not going to do well.\n  Now I know you had information from your people in your divisions \nthat said it would do fine. You made a prediction it would do poorly. \nYou had actual knowledge there was different information available to \nyou. You cannot tell me about that. As a result, I am suing you, and I \nthink I can collect.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do you think he should have told? Do you think he \nshould have had a forward-looking statement that said some have said we \nhave a problem; others say we do not have a problem. Would that not be \nan honest statement to the potential investors?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague, another aspect of this bill, \nhere in the safe harbor context, in the safe harbor context, it is our \ncommon desire to solicit information from these businesses that do not \nhave to make it forthcoming. I think, frankly, going to the intent and \npurpose, to disregard intent and purpose of that CEO, and have the mere \nstandard actual knowledge, I think, creates a nightmare. That is my \nview.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it the Senator's view--will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order. If the Senator asked for the Senator to \nyield for a question, fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Chair reminds the Senator----\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just asked the Senator if he would yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reminder that the Senator must address the \nChair to ask a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he will yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it the Senator's view that all forward-looking \nstatements are voluntary? As I understand it, the Senator says you are \ngoing to dissuade forward-looking statements because these are \nvoluntary things; and, if they have a problem with what the standard \nis, they will not volunteer the information.\n  Is that your position?\n  Mr. DODD. That is the difficulty here. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is your explanation of the language on page 113 of \nthe bill which includes within the definition of a forward-looking \nstatement in paragraph 3, lines 18 through 22, a statement of future \neconomic performance contained in the discussion and analysis of \nfinancial condition by the management, or in the results of operations \nincluded pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission.\n  Mr. DODD. I do not understand the purpose of the statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that currently under the rules \nand regulations of the Commission you are required to provide certain \ninformation that is in effect a forward-looking statement.\n  Does the Senator agree to that?\n  Mr. DODD. I understand that. How much information you have to----\n  Mr. SARBANES. But you earlier made the statement in effect that this \nwas all voluntary, and that people, if they were dissuaded, would \nprovide no information. The fact is under current SEC requirement they \nare required to provide some forward-looking information.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. I stand corrected.\n  My point here is that soliciting all the necessary information one \nwould like to have is not required by law. Some statements are. The \npoint I was trying to make was in the case of the one that I ascribed \nto. But the condition of a particular product line, a case could be \nmade that that information would not necessarily be required to be \nforthcoming.\n  So my point is that while the temptation to adopt the actual \nknowledge standard here, in effect we may be undoing the very purpose \nthat I presume is unanimous here. Maybe there are some who disagree \nwith us, but you want a good safe harbor. The purpose of having a safe \nharbor is that it be safe. If it just be a harbor that is sometimes \nsafe or never safe or rarely safe, then the very purpose for its \nexistence is undermined. As a result, you defeat the very purpose of \ncreating it.\n  My point here is that a simple standard of actual knowledge can \nundermine that very desire that I believe is unanimously held in this \nbody to create that safe harbor. So while the standard of actual \nknowledge is a difficult standard to overcome rhetorically in the \nsubject of debate, in the practical application of it, then I think it \nis a standard that undermines the very purpose of safe harbor.\n  I say to my colleague from Maryland and others, they know I have some \ndifficulty even with this standard. I am worried about having a good \none that does create the safe harbor, and that does apply to those \nefforts. My colleague from New York and I and Senator Domenici have \ndiscussed this at some length. And there are many different ways we may \nfinally get some language here that can be appropriate. But \nestablishing just actual knowledge with no intent or no purpose to \nmislead, it seems to me, runs the risk of having the very purpose of \nthe safe harbor destroyed.\n  I cite the factual kind of example involving a good meaning, well \nintended person--let us assume that most of the people we are talking \nabout here are not inherent crooks. We are talking about decent, \ncompetent people who want to do their business appropriately and \nproperly. And sharing information that can then undermine them and end \nup with significant litigation costs is not exactly serving the purpose \nof the intent when we desire to put in a safe harbor in the \nlegislation.\n  The SEC itself, as I said earlier, feels as though the safe harbor \nneeds to be strengthened. Their present standard is ``acted in good \nfaith and reasonable basis for believing what you are saying.'' That, \nof course, created a mountain of problems over the issue of reasonable \nbasis.\n  But as I mentioned a moment ago, we have added language here that \nrequires \n\n[[Page S 9140]]\ncautionary language. The Senator from New York has pointed out that we \nextended to the SEC the authority to go after these matters which may \nbe the best way of recovering, I would say anyway, because they are not \nnecessarily out to just win for themselves but rather win for the \ninvestors where they have the knowingly intentionally and with purpose \nattempted to mislead the investor. That may not be a perfect standard \nbut I think our desire here to have a higher standard makes sense if \nyou understand the value of safe harbor.\n  Again I will state what I said at the outset. For those who do not \nbelieve in safe harbor, adoption of the Sarbanes amendment makes sense \nbecause in my view that undermines the safe harbor.\n  So I would respectfully disagree with my colleague in his amendment, \nas appealing as it is to the rhetorical sense. I think the net effect \nof it at the end of the day is that we are going to abandon the safe \nharbor protection. Information will not be forthcoming that could \notherwise help your institutional investors, particularly in terms of \ndeciding whether or not to buy or sell the stock in a particular \ncompany.\n  I think that is a shortcoming, if we adopt this language as part of \nthis bill. I think it will hurt what we have tried to do here with this \nlegislation in trying to strike the balance.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Chair has an obligation to \nrecognize the Senator who stood up first.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last September the United States----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is out of order. The Senate will be \nin order. Both Senators were standing. The Senator from Arizona has \nbeen standing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have been standing. With all due respect, I have \nbeen here, was here before the Senator from Arizona, and I called for \nrecognition from the Chair. And the Chair, as I saw it, deliberately \nchose to ignore my appeal for recognition. The Chair I guess has that \nright. But that is not the way this body is to operate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my friend from New Jersey is obviously \nupset. Could I ask how long the Senator from New Jersey intended to \nspeak?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Probably 15 minutes. I am not upset at the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I am upset because of common courtesy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand. May I say that I believe it is a very close \ncall. And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 15 minutes \nto the Senator from New Jersey, and that as I do so, I have been in \nthese similar situations with very tough calls from the Chair as to who \nspeaks first. I believe the rule of the Senate is who is on their feet \nand speaks first is who seeks recognition. I believe we were both on \nour feet. I do not believe that the rule of the Senate is who has been \nstanding the longest.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey \nis to be recognized for 15 minutes, and then I would be recognized for \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Arizona is very courteous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I respect and appreciate it.\n  How long does he intend to speak?\n  Mr. McCAIN. About 10 minutes. Please go ahead. The Senator was on the \nfloor. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthe Sarbanes amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as the Senator from Maryland \nexplained, this amendment would modify a provision of S. 240 that I \nfind very troubling. I know that earlier today our colleague from New \nYork tempered somewhat the existing language relating to the safe \nharbor provision, but Mr. President, I do not think he went far enough.\n  One goal of this bill is to minimize the existing disincentives to \nprovide detailed forward-looking statements about the economic \nprospects of their companies.\n  Everyone agrees that is a desirable goal.\n  I certainly do.\n  Indeed, my support is based on personal experience.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, I worked in the private sector. I \ncofounded a company with two others, three of us from poor working-\nclass homes, that today employs over 20,000 people. It is an American \nsuccess story. I say that because I think it is important to \noccasionally call on one's background as we review some of the \nlegislation that is proposed in front of us. After the company went \npublic in 1961, I filed countless statements with the SEC as its CEO. \nAs the CEO, I believed that it was important for investors to have as \nmuch information as possible.\n  Each year, I made it a practice to project earnings for the following \nyear. And if it needed modification during the period due to changes \nand conditions, I quickly went to the public to alert them to any \nrevision. This process had significant rewards because investor \nconfidence in ADP--my company--caused our stock, which is listed on the \nNew York Stock Exchange, to sell at among the highest price-earnings \nratios of all listed securities on any exchange.\n  There used to be a company in the investment business, an old name in \nthe financial world, Kidder-Peabody. And each month they would publish \na list known as The Nifty 50. These were the highest price-earnings \nratio companies that were listed. They did that for over 265 months, \nfor more than 22 years. Every month they would publish lists of the \ncompanies that were among the investors' favorites. The company that \nled that list was my company, ADP. It was on the list 215 out of 265 \nmonths, far more than the next best company which listed among the top \nlist more than 200 times. Obviously, the company did well. It performed \nwell year after year. But it was the investors' belief, the investors' \nconfidence, that they could always count on ADP to tell the truth about \nwhat was happening that caused the stock price to swell as the earnings \ngrew.\n  As I look back at that period, I know that I was in the forefront of \nCEO's who provided investors with forward-looking statements on my \ncompany's financial health. It made sense to me then. It makes sense to \nme now.\n  One of the things that I know this bill would like to accomplish is \nto make sure that the public is as well informed as possible. It is not \nsimply to focus on whether or not litigation is possible or whether \nthere ought to be ceilings on certain claims but, rather, to give the \npublic a chance to know what is going on and at the same time not to \nencourage frivolous or whimsical lawsuits.\n  It is important that investors have as much information as they can. \nEveryone knows, especially in the larger companies, that senior \nexecutives in the company know very well what they are expecting to \nhappen over a year, 2, 3, 4, 5 years in advance. It may not be precise, \nbut they have a target; they have a goal. Everyone knows that in \naddition to the executives within the company, the board of directors \nhas to be notified if there are any changes.\n  What does that represent? It represents an advantage that people on \nthe inside have over those on the outside who are investing their \nmoney. And there is nothing, no reason at all why anyone on the inside \nought to have privileged information with which to sell stock or buy \nstock ahead of the investing public. It is critical that all investors \nhave as much information about the company as they can to make informed \ninvestment decisions.\n  Despite the desire to provide information, many issuers, many \ncompanies do not provide sufficient information. They do not because \nthey are concerned about their potential liability, which this bill \naddresses, should these forecasts turn out to be off the mark. Well, if \nthings change, as I said in my comments, then what ought to happen is \nthe company ought to say: Investors, be prepared. We have to take a hit \non \n\n[[Page S 9141]]\nour earnings because of this product or this market or what have you, \nbut we have confidence in the future and this is what we expect. The \ninvestors will stay with the ship. This is especially true for the \nsmall high-tech companies, which is what my company was. These are \ncompanies whose growth we want to encourage. It is not in the public \ninterest for these companies to go out of business because of a lawsuit \nbased on a financial forecast or information which despite the \ncompany's best efforts later turns out to be inaccurate. And that can \nhappen despite the best intentions of the company.\n  I remember how much the stock of biotech companies dropped when we \nwere discussing health care last year. And should those biotech \ncompanies be held accountable for this drop? Of course not. We want to \nprotect the research and the innovation that develops from such firms. \nBut I believe that this bill goes too far in the effort to do that.\n  The recently amended language in S. 240 provides a safe harbor from \nliability unless the issuer's statement is knowingly made with the \npurpose and actual intent of misleading investors, and on its face that \nlegislative language looks reasonable. But the committee report notes \nthat purpose and actual intent are separate elements that must be \nproven by the investor.\n  To me, this standard, although an improvement over the version \nreported out of the Banking Committee, is still too high a threshold. \nThis amendment provides safe harbor protections for issuers who make \nforecasts, but we narrow this protection so that issuers who make \nstatements with the knowledge that the information was false or \nmisleading would be liable. That is a reasonable standard, and it is a \nstandard supported by the SEC and by the administration. It protects \nthose who should be protected. And it does so without creating a safe \nharbor for those who should be subject to litigation.\n  It may seem to those listening or who may be watching this debate \nthat the Senator from Maryland and I are splitting hairs with single \nword changes. However, when the next financial scandal rocks our \nmarkets and investors are prevented from recovering their losses caused \nby intentionally misleading forecasts because they are unable to \ndemonstrate actual intent, those affected investors will certainly feel \nthe difference. We do not want to hurt those investors who are able to \ndemonstrate that an issuer intentionally made a misleading statement \nbut are unable to show actual intent.\n  I cannot understand this. I say that again as a person who has been \non both sides of the matter--as an investor and as an issuer. I believe \nthat the amendment as proposed provides the right balance. If you make \na forward-looking statement knowing it was false or misleading, you \nshould not be immune from liability. You have to pay the price for the \ndeception.\n  Now, I understand why the Senator from New York would want to expand \nthe current safe harbor. Everyone wants that, including the SEC. But I \nthink this bill has gone too far in the other direction. We should not \nbe encouraging or protecting fraudulent statements, which I believe is \nwhat S. 240 might inadvertently do.\n  Mr. President, we have the most efficient markets in the world, and \nthis is due in large part to the reliability of information available \nto investors. I do not understand why we would want to enact \nlegislation that might jeopardize this.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and now I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey. I say \nto him I understand the sensitivity of recognition. I remained in the \nminority party for some 12 years, and I appreciate the sensitivity \ninvolved with that. I believe that in all fairness the Chair is \nrequired to recognize the person that the Chair hears first, and I as \nalways appreciate his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9133-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9141-S9143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            HAITI'S ELECTION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last September, the United States sent \n20,000 of its sons and daughters to Haiti. Their ostensible mission was \ndefined in the name given to this unopposed invasion of another \ncountry--Operation Uphold Democracy. Today, we are told by some Haitian \nGovernment Ministers, by the head of Haiti's Provisional Electoral \nCouncil, and even by our own Washington Post, that democracy--a form of \ngovernment that we exported to Haiti at the risk of American lives--may \nbe, in the end, too much to expect from this poor, troubled, violent \ncountry.\n  Few would disagree that what happened last Sunday at least raised \nquestions, serious questions, about whether Haiti's elections were free \nand fair. But, as I just noted, among the few, were some Aristide \nministers; Mr. Remy, the hopelessly incompetent chairman of Haiti's \nelection council; and, again, the Washington Post. In truth, the gross \nirregularities that plagued last Sunday's election, and the polling \nthat occurred on Monday purportedly to compensate for a small fraction \nof those irregularities, as well as the mounting evidence of vote \ncounting fraud have made it, in the sensible judgment of Representative \nPorter Goss--``impossible to verify the results of this election.''\n  Mr. Goss led an accredited election observation team from the \nInternational Republican Institute [IRI]. I have the honor of serving \nthe institute as chairman of its board of directors. I am proud of \nIRI's work generally, and its work in Haiti specifically. I will talk \nsome more about the quality of that work a little later in my remarks.\n  I want to first talk briefly about the elections and the gross \nirregularities that indeed make it impossible to verify the results. It \nis important to note that no observer of the election--be it OAS \nobservers, or observers on the White House delegation, or even one very \ncandid Government minister in Haiti, will dispute the evidence of \nirregularities which IRI's observers and these other monitors \nuncovered. IRI observers found that these elections were, in a word, \nchaotic.\n  The headline for today's Washington Post story on the elections was \n``Unanimity in Haiti: Elections Were Chaotic.'' Unfortunately, no one \nseems to have told the Washington Post's editorial writers. Or, \npossibly, those writers do not believe that the chaos which, in truth, \ndefined these elections seriously undermined their integrity. If that \nis the judgement of the Washington Post's editors it is a faulty one, \nand it cannot withstand the weight of the abundant evidence that the \nelection process--from the campaign season through election day to the \nballot counting--was plagued by very grave problems.\n  People can judge for themselves whether these problems have rendered \nthe elections completely unfair and unfree. The IRI delegation's \nresponsibility as impartial observers was to simply call them as they \nsaw them. What they saw was rather discouraging, so discouraging that \neven Aristide's Minister for Culture, Jean-Claude Bajeux, offered an \napology. ``As a member of the Government,'' he said, ``I am not proud \nof this.'' Minister Bajeux went on to observe that ``instead of \nimproving on the 1990 elections, we have done worse.''\n  Not surprisingly, the widespread irregularities have prompted \nopposition parties to reject these elections as fraudulent. That charge \nwas leveled by the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Evans Paul, as well. You \nwill recall, Mr. President, that Mayor Paul's post support for \nPresident Aristide was often referred to by President Aristide's \nsupporters in the United States.\n  Mr. President, let me offer a brief sampling of the irregularities \nwhich the IRI delegation documented. I will first read from the \nexecutive summary of IRI's pre-election report which evaluated the pre-\nelectoral process and environment for their comparison to minimal \nstandards of acceptability.\n  The elections were originally to be held in December, but were \npostponed several times for a variety of reasons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete executive \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 9142]]\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n                           electoral process\n\n       The legal foundation for these elections was a Presidential \n     decree that subverted the legislative process.\n       The formulation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) \n     itself breached an agreement between the President of the \n     Republic and the political parties to allow the parties to \n     nominate all candidates from which CEP members would be \n     chosen by the three branches of government. Only two of the \n     nine CEP members were chosen from the parties' list.\n       The voter registration process, to have been administered \n     by the CEP, was complicated by miscalculations of population \n     size, lack of sufficient materials and registration sites, \n     and one million missing voter registration cards.\n       The CEP review of the over 11,000 candidate dossiers for \n     eligibility was a protracted process that occurred under a \n     cloak of secrecy. When the CEP made its decisions known, by \n     radio, no reasons were given for the thousands of candidates \n     rejected. After vehement protests by the parties, some \n     reasons were supplied and supplemental lists were announced \n     through June 14, thirty-one days after the date the final \n     candidate list was to be announced. This stripped the CEP of \n     its credibility with the political parties. There is still \n     not a final list of approved candidates available.\n       The sliding scale of registration fees imposed by the CEP--\n     whereby political parties with fewer CEP approved candidates \n     pay larger fees--has made it difficult for many parties to \n     compete. As of June 20, five days before the election, \n     protests against this unusual requirement have gone \n     unanswered.\n       The ability of the CEP and those under its direction to \n     administer an election is unclear. As of June 20, five days \n     prior to the election, formal instructions for the procedures \n     of election day and the count had yet to be issued; this has \n     prevented the 45,000 persons needed to administer election \n     day from receiving specific training.\n       As of June 20, those persons designated by the political \n     parties as pollwatchers had not yet received any training \n     from the CEP which could lead to serious confusion on \n     election day.\n       These actions have led to deep misgivings across the \n     Haitian political spectrum about the ability of the CEP to \n     fulfill the mandate and functions normally executed by \n     election commissions. Political parties had no idea to whom \n     to turn with complaints in the process--the CEP, the \n     President of the Republic, the United Nations Electoral \n     Assistance Unit or the United States Government. Three \n     political parties withdrew from the process as a form of \n     protest.\n\n\n                         electoral environment\n\n       A concern for security is an issue that has permeated every \n     step of the process. The assassination of Mireille Durocher \n     Bertin, a well-known lawyer and leading political opponent of \n     Aristide, only conformed the fears of the parties and \n     candidates. During the crisis, many elected representatives \n     feared returning to their districts, contributing to the \n     decay of political infrastructure. Candidates have curtailed \n     their campaign activities and has given personal security a \n     higher priority.\n       The campaign itself began late and has been barely visible \n     until some activities in the last week prior to elections. \n     Given the process and environment surrounding these \n     elections, it is doubtful many of Haiti's recognized \n     political parties could have competed effectively.\n       The electorate itself is basically uninformed about this \n     election--what it stands for and who is running. There has \n     been no civic education campaign, with the exception of some \n     limited U.S. and U.N. military efforts, to illuminate the \n     purpose of this election.\n       Similarly, there has been no educational campaign on how to \n     vote, which for a largely illiterate population in Haiti \n     could pose serious difficulties on election day.\n       Compared to other ``transition elections'' observed by IRI, \n     such as in Russia in 1993, El Salvador in 1994, South Africa \n     in 1994 and even China's Jilan Province village elections in \n     1994, the pre-electoral process and environment in Haiti has \n     seriously challenged the most minimally accepted standards \n     for the holding of a credible election.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Those are the problems that undermined the integrity of \nthe election before election day. We have all read newspaper accounts \nover the last 2 days which chronicled the abuses and irregularities \nthat occurred on Sunday. Mr. Goss accurately reported in a press \nstatement yesterday the following serious problems.\n  While the international military served well as a deterrent to \nwidespread violence, the elections were not free of violence and \nintimidation. Violent incidents closed local polling stations in Port-\nau-Prince, Limbe, Port de Paix, Don Don, Ferrier, Jean Rabel, \nCarrefour, and Cite Soleil.\n  The election council failed to deliver and distribute voter materials \nto a number of polling stations. This resulted in countless delayed \nvoting place openings and postponed the elections in some places. \nUnsurprisingly, these delays and postponements caused widespread voter \nfrustration which helps explain why turnout was low.\n  There was also widespread disregard for the secrecy of the ballot. \nMany voters had little choice but to mark their ballots in the open.\n  The thoroughly arbitrary process of qualifying candidates led to \nserious consequences which we anticipated in our pre-election survey. \nThe disqualification of some candidates proved to destabilize the \nelectoral environment in certain areas, this was most acutely the case \nin Saint Marc and Jean Rabel.\n  The New York Times reports that at least 200,000 voters are still \nwaiting to cast their ballots, but election officials still won't say \nwhen and if they will be allowed to do so.\n  Regarding the vote tally, I will quote not from IRI's report but from \nthe Organization of American States which had a much larger observation \nteam in Haiti. Because of administrative failings in the election it \nremains to be seen how effectively the count will be carried out.\n  As anyone who read a newspaper today discovered, allegations of \nwidespread abuse and irregularities in the counting process are coming \nin by the dozens. Again and again, we are hearing from all observers \nthat unmarked ballots are being marked at the regional counting centers \nto indicate a vote for Lavalas candidates.\n  Mr. President, this is, as I said, only a brief sampling of the \nproblems which IRI observers and all credible observers witnessed. For \ncalling the press' attention to these problems, the IRI mission was \nchastised today in a Washington Post editorial for unconstructive \npolitical science correctness.\n  In response to that charge let me just quote the last two paragraphs \nof Mr. Goss' statement yesterday as chairman of our delegation.\n\n       It was important for Haiti and the international community \n     to hold this election, but holding an election is simply not \n     enough. The purpose of this election was to create layers of \n     government that can serve as checks and balances on each \n     other and decentralize power as envisioned by the 1987 \n     Constitution. That is why it was important to have an \n     inclusive process, not one marked by exclusion.\n       It has been IRI's intent throughout this process to be \n     thorough, independent, objective and constructive. In this \n     regard, IRI will maintain a presence in Haiti through the \n     final round of elections and will make recommendations for \n     the formation of the permanent electoral council.\n\n  This is hardly inflammatory language, Mr. President. In fact, I think \nmost people would consider it as well as all of IRI's reporting to be \nconstructive, informed criticism. Indeed, Brian Atwood, Director of \nU.S.A.I.D. and head of the Clinton administration's observation \ndelegation in Haiti, said about IRI's reporting: ``they have performed \na service.''\n  The Post's editors are being a little disingenuous, I fear, when they \nraise the obviously bogus charge of political correctness. After all, \nthat is not a problem that the Post usually finds distressing.\n  What the Post is really saying, as are those hysterical critics of \nIRI's delegation in the Aristide Government and on the Provisional \nElectoral Council; What they are really saying is that Haiti should not \nbe expected to adhere to minimally acceptable election process \nstandards.\n  IRI has observed elections in 48 countries. Some of those countries \nand some of those elections were the subject of disagreements, \nsometimes, but not always, partisan disagreements in the U.S. Congress. \nElections in Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Russia come to mind. Never, \nnot once, has there been the slightest intimation that IRI delegations \nwere anything other than objective, scrupulously fair, committed, hard \nworking professionals. On the contrary, IRI delegations are routinely \nacclaimed for their thorough professionalism.\n  But because IRI discovered and reported information which, \napparently, the Washington Post editorial writers would have preferred \nto have gone unnoticed, the integrity of these observers--not the \nelection, but the observers--is now called into question by those \neditorialists and others.\n  What the Post editorial writers and others are really saying is that \nwhatever standards we hold El Salvador to; whatever standards we hold \nNicaragua to; whatever standards we hold Croatia to; whatever standards \nwe hold Serbia \n\n[[Page S 9143]]\nto; whatever standards we hold Albania to; whatever standards we hold \nBulgaria to; whatever standards we hold Azerbaijan to; whatever \nstandards we hold Russia to; whatever standards to which we hold all \nthese countries where IRI observed elections without controversy, no \nmatter how minimal those standards are we cannot expect Haiti to meet \nthem.\n  Mr. President, that is what the Washington Post said today, and it is \nan injustice. It is an injustice to IRI; to Mr. Porter Goss and all the \ngood and honorable people on IRI's election observation delegation in \nHaiti.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, it is an injustice to the people of \nHaiti. They are human beings who yearn for freedom like any other \nnation, and who are capable of building and sustaining the institutions \nthat will protect that freedom. To expect any less of Haiti is, as I \nsaid, an injustice. The people who have condescended to Haitians, \nincluding the Post editorialists, by asking the world's indulgence of \ntheir election's failings, should apologize to the Haitian people, and \nto those good Americans who they have maligned in the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9141-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9143-S9145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1478\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of my colleagues \nif any of them have any statements to make with respect to the pending \namendment, and how much time they intend to take. Might I ask my \ncolleague how long he believes he will take?\n  Mr. BROWN. I have a brief statement that I think will be more than \ncompleted in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Colorado makes his statement that I be recognized--it is \nmy intent to make a motion to table. Does the Senator wish to claim \ntime to respond?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I may. I do not know what he is going to say. Why do we \nnot say 10 minutes evenly divided and go to the vote?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is fine. I ask unanimous consent that after the \nstatement of the Senator from Colorado, which will take 10 minutes \nequally divided, at that point in time I will ask for the yeas and nays \nand make a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, distributed on our desk is a statement from \nAbner Mikva, counsel to the President and former Member of this \nCongress, who has what I believe is a very distinguished record, as \nwell as a fine record as a judge for this Nation. I have the utmost \nrespect for Judge Mikva, and so it is with seriousness that I view his \nletter that has been distributed.\n  It addresses the subject which we are discussing, and the implication \nis, of course, that this is an important factor in the President \ndeciding whether he will sign this bill. He speaks out strongly on \nbehalf of Senator Sarbanes' amendment, I think for no other reason than \nthat it is worth taking a serious look at.\n  As I read the two standards, I suspect other Members will find it a \nchallenge, as I do, in pinpointing precisely what the difference is. \nThe bill carves out an exclusion; that is, a safe harbor. What we found \nunder current law is that people in business, in order to avoid \nliability in terms of speculating about their company or commenting on \ntheir company's future, simply have clammed up. Their lawyers tell \nthem, ``Look, if you say anything and it turns out not to be totally \naccurate or if you speculate on the future and it goes the other way, \nyou are going to get sued.'' So to avoid being sued they say, ``We \ndon't want you to say anything.'' Literally, that is what many \ncompanies will say.\n  ``How is the weather at your plant?''\n  ``Can't say.''\n  ``What do you expect your earnings to be?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  What this issue revolves around is the fact that we have denied \neconomic free speech. It is a different issue than misleading people. I \nthink everyone here--at least I hope they would--would feel very \nstrongly that if someone intentionally misleads you for their own gain \nthat we give redress for that. We expect people to be honest and that \nis fair and reasonable. But what we have found is the penalties are so \nprofound and enormous and the ease of bringing a suit is so great that \nwe have tried to address the problem by at least not penalizing people \nwho make reasonable statements about the future of their company. That \nis what this is all about.\n  The first thing the bill does is go through a series of instances \nwhere some people have been known to make misstatements about a company \nin the past, and they specifically exclude them from this safe harbor. \nIn other words, they say, Look, if you are convicted of any felony or \nmisdemeanor, you are not going to come under this provision at least \nfor a few years. If you are offering securities by a blank check \ncompany, you're not going to come under this safe harbor provision. If \nyou are involved in issuance of penny stocks, you are not going to come \nunder this safe harbor provision. If you are dealing with a rollup \ntransaction, you will not come under the safe harbor provision. If you \nare dealing with a going private transaction, you will not come under \nthe safe harbor provision.\n  The bill has said here are some areas, and we understand in the past \npeople have made misleading statements or false statements,\n and we are going to specifically exclude them from the safe harbor. \nMr. President, I think that is responsible. I want to commend the \nchairman of the committee for doing that. I think it is a responsible \napproach. I want to say on this floor that if there are other areas \nthat have had this kind of problem, we ought to pay attention and add \nthem to this section. That is how to deal with this area. If there is a \nproblem, we have to deal with it. What is left, which is considerably \nreduced, is meant to give some freedom of speech and is meant to allow \npeople to make reasonable statements.\n\n  The problem here is that any time you attempt to forecast earnings, \nany time you, again, attempt to forecast what is going on, you are \nprobably not going to have any better record of forecasting than the \nweather bureau has. They are conscientious, honest, and they miss it \nabout half of the time. It does not mean that they are evil. What it \nmeans is that it is difficult to forecast. The question we have to \nanswer is, should we simply, by putting tough penalties into place, \nprevent people from economic forecasting. Maybe we ought to put into \nlaw that it is illegal for anybody to come in about the future of their \ncompany. The reason we do not is that it probably does not help \ninvestors very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will yield when I finish my statement. This is an \nattempt. One says, ``knowingly made with a purpose and actual intent of \nmisleading investors.'' The amendment says, ``made with the actual \nknowledge that it was false or misleading.''\n  Well, ``knowingly made'' and ``actual knowledge'' sound similar and \nhave some similarities. I believe, in reading the legislation, the big \ndifference is this: It is in the words of ``purpose'' and ``actual \nintent.'' I think as Members try and make a decision about how they can \nvote, they ought to ask themselves, if somebody makes a statement and \nit turns out not to be accurate, should we insist, before we penalize \nthem, that they had the purpose and actual intent of misleading \nsomeone? Or was it an innocent statement and they did not intend to \nmislead someone, they did not have that actual intent? I believe the \npurpose of misleading someone and intent of misleading someone is at \nthe heart of this amendment.\n  The amendment is offered by a very conscientious, thoughtful \nlegislator. It is endorsed by a very thoughtful and reasonable judge, \nwho acts as counsel to the President. I think the heart of the issue \ncomes down to whether or not we want to extend economic free speech in \nthese areas. Should you have the purpose and intent of misleading \npeople, or should you be allowed to say what is appropriate without \nthat? \n\n[[Page S 9144]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to pledge one thing. I think the issue raised \nis appropriate and is a good one. I pledge one thing. If there are \nadditional carved-out areas, exemptions from this that we ought to look \nat, I want to look at them and support them if they are reasonable. But \nlet me say, Mr. President, that I think it is important that we be very \ncareful about denying economic free speech. It is an important aspect \nof giving a full picture in describing economic opportunities and \neconomic endeavors.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe that under the present order we \nhave 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have debated this issue for several \ndays and I think the Senator from Colorado stated the concern with this \namendment well. If there are areas where we need additional carve-\nouts--to exempt people from getting this safe harbor, I am willing to \nlook at them. Senator Dodd is willing to look at them. Senator Domenici \nis willing to look at them. If there are reasonable suggestions that \nthe SEC has, we will look at them. We are going to go to conference if \nwe pass this bill, and I pledge that we will keep the offer open to \nlook at those suggestions. We have been looking for them for 3 years. \nIf suggestions come up now, because of this legislation, and they make \nsense, I will certainly consider them. We have worked to modify and \nstrengthen, S. 240, to protect the rights of the legitimate investor \nand understand their concerns. That is what we attempted to do in \ndrafting this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just want to make a couple of comments \nhere at the close of the debate on this amendment. I have to say to my \ncolleagues, I hope everyone understands that they are ignoring the \nrecommendations and judgment of the Chairman of the SEC, the State \nSecurities Regulators, Government Finance Officers Association, and so \nforth. It may well be that people feel so knowledgeable and have such \nexpertise in this area that that does not trouble them. I have to tell \nyou, it troubles me and would trouble me wherever I found myself on \nsome issues. I would want to be very certain about ignoring those \nopinions.\n  Arthur Levitt said:\n\n       A carefully crafted safe harbor protection from meritless \n     private lawsuits should encourage public companies to make \n     additional forward-looking disclosure that would benefit \n     investors.\n\n  That is what the Senator from Connecticut has been asserting. No one \nis challenging that. He earlier said, ``You are not going to have any \nsafe harbor.'' Nobody is saying that.\n  Arthur Levitt goes on to say:\n\n       At the same time, it should not compromise the integrity of \n     such information which is vital to both investor protection \n     and the efficiency of the capital markets--the two goals of \n     the Federal securities law.\n\n  He has said about the language that is in the bill, the language we \nare trying to take out:\n\n       I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to \n     receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\n\n  That is what the issue is. The Government Finance Officers \nAssociation has written to us that the safe harbor provision in the \nbill opens a major loophole through which wrongdoers could escape \nliability while fraud victims would be denied recovery. That is the \nissue.\n  I understand that we need a meaningful safe harbor, but the safe \nharbor should not be structured in such a way that pirates can find \nshelter in it. And, as written, the language in the legislation does \nexactly that. That is why the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Government Finance Officers Association, the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association, which represents the 50 \nStates' security regulators, that is why--the North American Security \nAdministration Association called the provisions in the bill ``An \noverly broad safe harbor making it extremely difficult to sue when \nmisleading information causes investors to suffer losses.''\n  The amendment is very simple. The amendment would take out the \nlanguage in which all of the regulators have seen major problems, in \nterms of investor fraud, and substitute for it that you do not have \nprotection in a safe harbor if you make a forward-looking statement \nmade with the actual knowledge that it was false or misleading. And no \none yet on the floor has explained to me why such statements ought to \nget protection from liability.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think that this is the crux of the \nmatter. And the ranking member is really the conscience of the Senate \non this whole matter. I want to ask a very direct question. I am not an \nattorney, and my learned friend is.\n  If we vote for S. 240 without the Senator's amendment, is it the \nSenator's view that a company or an officer of a company, could make a \nfalse statement--tell a lie, put it that way--make a false statement, \nwhich is tell a lie, that he had actual knowledge was a lie?\n  In other words, I know I am wearing a yellow suit. If I said I am \nwearing a blue suit, I am telling a lie. I have to know that this is \nyellow. Is my friend saying that unless we adopt his amendment we could \nhave a business person make a false statement that he knew was false, \nand he could still benefit from the safe harbor in S. 240 and hide \nbehind that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. He could find shelter within the safe harbor even \nthough he had actual knowledge that the statement was false--even \nthough he had actual knowledge.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have heard many statements in this \ndebate. One particular statement I have heard is about a pirate's cove. \nThe pirate's cove exists today, those pirates are taking investors for \na real ride, and they are drowning them. They are drowning companies \nand they are drowning good people.\n  All the pirates have to do is allege fraud, and companies find \nthemselves facing millions of dollars in damages or in settlements. If \nwe adopt the standard in this amendment, nobody will be willing to make \npredictions. They will not take the risk.\n  Now, look at what S. 240 says. It says, with no exceptions, that the \nsafe harbor does not apply to a forward statement that is knowingly \nmade with the purpose and actual intent of misleading investors.\n  We think that this standard will encourage people to make statements, \nmake predictions, but will hold them liable if they knowingly, with \nintent to defraud make a statement that is false. Anything less than \nthis standard will allow the same band of pirates that we have now to \ncontinue to bring meritless cases.\n  S. 240 stops lawyers from being able to pay their professional \nplaintiffs. They were actually paying people $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 \nto use their name on the suit. One of these characters has signed up 14 \ntimes with the same law firm, the same law firm that is working, \nlobbying, paying millions of dollars to try and defeat comprehensive \nreform.\n  If we want reform and to we want to get rid of these pirates, we need \nto pass S. 240. This amendment will cause a chilling effect on the \nability of people to make projections about the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

While widespread violence had been deterred, \nthere has been a lack of visible security, and closed individual polls \nhave forced Haitians to go home without casting their vote. There have \nbeen long delays in the opening of polls in many areas and a shortage \nof electoral material. Many ballot boxes were not sealed properly \nbefore being turned over to the regional centers. Observers found a few \ncases of ballot stuffing.\n  In short, we have a serious situation.

I was not in Haiti this past weekend as part of an observer \ngroup, but as I think most of my colleagues know, I have been there on \nnumerous occasions. In fact, I lived on the border of that country for \n2\\1/2\\ years and have a more than passing interest in the awareness of \nHaiti.\n  As I have listened this afternoon to several speeches now made about \nthe events in Haiti over the past several days, I find it stunning in \nmany ways. My colleagues, by their remarks, almost imply that the \nsituation in Haiti would have been preferable had there not been an \nelection or had there not been the decision by the administration in \nprevious months to go back to intercede, along with the support of the \ninternational community, to try to restore the democratically elected \ngovernment of that country.\n  This was not a perfect election in Haiti. There were serious \nproblems. But, remember, this is a country that can count free \nelections on one hand--fewer fingers in fact--that they have had over \nthe years. The last free one was 4 or 5 years ago when President \nAristide was elected. And then we watched that election be ripped from \nthe people of that country through a coup.\n  President Clinton, the administration, took the courageous decision \nto restore President Aristide to power in that country. And I recall \nback in those days during that debate the almost apparent \ndisappointment that there was not more of a tragedy. We did not lose a \nsingle soldier in that effort. In fact, the President deserves great \ncommendation, mind you, for the courage he showed in making an \nunpopular move. It was not popular at the time. Today, interestingly, \nthe majority of people in this country think the President did the \nright thing.\n  Now, over the weekend, they had an election. It is a poor country \nwith a tremendous level of illiteracy and staggering economic problems. \nSo it did not look like a perfect election in this country. But it is \nan effort of poor people to get out and freely choose its leadership, \nliterally hundreds and hundreds of candidates for local office and \nnational office in that country. And rather than castigate and denounce \nthe effort for the shortcomings that certainly were obvious and \napparent, why are we not applauding the fact that this country was \ntrying to embrace democracy and do so in a noble way?\n  Granted they had problems with ballot boxes and people abused the \nprocess. Votes were not counted. There were shortcomings, to put it \nmildly, in the process. All of that I accept. But instead of picking \nthis process apart, there ought to be at least some underlying \nstatements that indicate that we support this effort. We hope it is not \njust a one-time effort, but that in coming months and years we will see \ndemocracy take hold in this poor, little country to our south.\n  And so I have been disappointed. It is just a continuum of almost the \ndisappointment people expressed over the last year over the President's \ndecision to go in and restore President Aristide, which was a success. \nIt seems to be a continuation of that. I am disappointed by these \nremarks. This is working. It is not perfect. We have watched what \nhappened in other countries, including what we are watching in the \nformer Soviet Union, the New Independent Republics. Countries that are \nstruggling to find their democratic feet do not do so instantaneously. \nIt takes time.\n  So I commend President Aristide and commend the people of Haiti for \nthe courageous attempt to have a free and fair election. I am terribly \ndisappointed it did not meet our high standards of a perfect election. \nBut rather than spend our time denouncing the imperfections, we ought \nto take a moment out and commend these people. Some people walked \nliterally miles and miles to get to a polling place in order to \nexercise their rights. Most of them are illiterate, cannot read or \nwrite. They have to vote by looking at colors or symbols on a ballot in \norder to choose their party or candidates. And to watch people get out \nwith, I think, the returns somewhere around 60 or 70 percent--in our \nelections in 1974 we had 38 percent that turned out to vote.\n  So with all its imperfections, I think the people of Haiti deserve \nour applause, our commendation for their efforts. And certainly the \nGovernment of Haiti does, as well, for conducting this election. And \nalbeit with its shortcomings, my hope is in coming years we will see \nbetter results and less imperfections in the process. But they do not \ndeserve to be denounced, in my \n\n[[Page S 9146]]\nview, for the significant efforts they have made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I listened with interest to the statement just made by my \nfriend from Connecticut. And all I can say is it is deja vu all over \nagain. I remember the criticism that the Senator from Connecticut \nleveled at the election in El Salvador that was attended by me and \nothers. And, Mr. President, he might have missed the thrust of my \nremarks. And that is, that this election, according to the same group, \nthe IRI, that has observed some 48 elections around the world, did not \nmeet high standards. They did not meet minimum standards, I say to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  I applaud the effort of the people of Haiti for wanting to be \ninvolved in the electoral process. I applaud the efforts that have been \nmade by many people. But the fact is, by objective judgment, this \nelection was chaos--chaos.\n  And, Mr. President, the report of our observers--I will be brief \nbecause I know the Senator from New York gets understandably impatient \nwith this issue impeding the progress of the pending legislation. But \nthis is the report of the objective observers, these same observation \nteams that, as I say, observed 48 other elections throughout the world \nand judged by the same standards, not high standards, Mr. President, \nthe same standards. Here's what they said:\n\n       General: Total breakdown in reception of ballots and tally \n     sheets to counting centers; total abandonment of materials; \n     zero supervision of materials; counting of ballots occurring \n     without supervision.\n       Tally Sheets: Tally sheets being destroyed deliberately; \n     tally sheets have been created/replaced; tally sheets with \n     opposition parties leading have been destroyed in front of \n     observers; tally sheets and other electoral records are being \n     thrown out as garbage--and trash is being removed from site.\n       Ballots: Ballots have been burned, both used and unused; \n     ballots have been substituted with newly marked ballots; \n     unused ballots by the hundreds of thousands are readily \n     accessible at counting sites.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Perhaps the Senator from Connecticut feels it is \na real high standard not to expect unused ballots by the hundreds of \nthousands readily available at counting sites.\n\n       Unused ballots being mixed in with marked ballots; new \n     ballots clearly being marked at counting sites; crumpled \n     ballots, registration materials, and ballot boxes \n     accumulating in trash heaps, inside and outside counting \n     sites.\n       Ballot Boxes: Ballot boxes universally unsealed; ballot \n     boxes being sealed at counting sites with serial numbered \n     seals that may not correspond to actual voting site number; \n     sealed ballot boxes are being thrown away.\n       Registration Cards: Registration records in total disarray; \n     registration records being jettisoned into the trash in large \n     quantities; unused registration cards (remember one million \n     missing) found in large quantities.\n\n  This is not a result of underdevelopment nor simple mismanagement; \nthis is orchestrated chaos.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You mentioned--I do not know who IRI is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The International Republican Institute, which was there \nmonitoring this election, as they have some 48 elections throughout the \nworld. I say to my friend from Iowa, there are certain standard \nprocedures used in judging any election, whether it be Russia, El \nSalvador, Haiti, anywhere else. These minimum standards are what an \nelection is judged by.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could ask another question.\n  It is the International Republican Institute. I did not know that.\n  Second, in this institute, did they monitor the elections that were \nheld in Haiti about, if I am not mistaken, a little over 2 years ago \nwhen the junta, the military, was in charge and there was an election \nthere?\n  I am wondering whether they monitored that election and if they drew \nany comparisons between this election and that election. I only ask \nthat question because----\n  Mr. McCAIN. My answer is, as you know, that that election was so \nfraudulent there was no international observer groups allowed there. \nBut in the words of other people who observed the 1990 election, this \nwas far worse than the 1990 election conducted in Haiti which was \nobserved by international organizations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I ask one more question? Does the Senator know how \nmuch money the United States or other nations may have provided and \nsupport that we may have provided in order to help that electoral \nprocess in Haiti, being a poor country? I just wonder if there are any \nfigures on how much we did in terms of monitoring assistance to help \nthem do the things that the Senator has pointed out were shortcomings \nin that election.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I respond to my friend from Iowa, I do not know the \namount of money. I do know what the commitment on the part of the \nAmerican Government was. But I know the election should have met \ncertain minimum standards. Otherwise, there is no sense in holding an \nelection. And the observers who came in to observe this election and \nothers did not believe those standards were met. I mean, the front page \nof the Washington Post this morning, ``chaos'' and other descriptions \nalong those lines clearly indicate that if we did spend money, and I am \nsure we did, that it was either misplaced or improperly used or \nsomething.\n  The real point here, I say to my friend from Iowa, is I do not know \nhow much money was spent. I know money was spent, but I know that these \nare trained observers who observe election after election after \nelection around the world and judged the election in Russia to be \noverall fair, the election in El Salvador to be fair, the election in \nNicaragua to be fair, the recent election in Chile to be fair. This is \nthe first time they have judged this election not to be, that I know \nof, one which was fair and open. But they certainly did not judge the \nprevious election to be in any way acceptable. They did not even go to \nsee it because everybody knew what that election was all about.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. I always appreciate this dialog with \nmy friend from Connecticut. I think he may have misunderstood the point \nwhen I made my statement. I also admire the tenacity, desire, the will \nof the Haitian people to obtain freedom. They are people who deserve, \nif any one group of people in this hemisphere deserves our assistance \nand help, and they deserve a freely elected government after all they \nhave suffered through.\n  I am just saying to my friend from Connecticut that there are certain \nstandards that must be observed, that must be adhered to in any \nelection; otherwise, the people do not have that precious right, and \nthat is to choose their own leadership.\n  It is not clear to me yet what all the reasons behind this failure \nwere but, in my view, it has been a significant failure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it had been my intention at this point to \noffer an amendment, but I ask unanimous consent for time as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was in Haiti on Saturday and Sunday of \nthis weekend, and I would like to share with my colleagues some of my \nobservations. I intend to submit a more formal statement later, but for \nthis afternoon, I would like to talk about some of the things that I \nsaw.\n  Frankly, to my good friend from Arizona, who was represented in \nHaiti, he and the IRI, by another good friend, Congressman Porter Goss \nof my State of Florida, I was concerned about my first experience in \nHaiti this weekend. I got off the plane Saturday morning at \napproximately 11 o'clock, and at the foot of the plane were several \nU.S. reporters, including a representative of one of the major \nnetworks. The first question that was asked was what did we think about \nthe report that had been issued a few hours earlier on Saturday \nmorning--this is the day before the election--by the IRI criticizing \nthe election that had not yet taken place?\n  Obviously, we were in no position to comment on a report that we had \nnot \n\n[[Page S 9147]]\nseen about an election that had not yet taken place.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield to me to respond to that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to complete my comments and then yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator made a serious charge. I would like him to \nlet me respond.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is not a charge. It is a factual statement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator knows, it is the preelectoral process and, \nto be fair, the Senator from Florida ought to say that. They did not \ncomment on the election itself, they commented on the preelectoral \nprocess. Let us not distort the record here, I say to my friend from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am not distorting the record. They were commenting and \nmade a conclusionary statement as to what they thought the status of \nthe election was 24 hours before the election took place.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Florida, I have the document in \nmy hand: ``Preelectoral Assessment of the June 25, 1995, Election.''\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You do not have the document in your hand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Preelectoral.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Because the document was approximately 300 pages long, \nassessing an election that was 24 hours yet before it was to commence.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the executive summary of the 300-page document, \nand it clearly states ``preelectoral.'' Preelectoral.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It seems to me that it would have--and this is just my \nassessment, this is my editorial judgment--that it would have been more \nappropriate to have made such an assessment after the election had \ntaken place as opposed to the morning prior to the election taking \nplace. And it would have been more appropriate to have deferred to what \nhas been the tradition of American politics, which is that partisan \npolitics end at the Nation's boundaries.\n  The reality is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield again? Is the Senator impugning \nthe integrity of Congressman Goss, who was the leader of that \norganization, saying that he took partisanship past the water's edge? \nIf the Senator has evidence----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am not impugning anyone's integrity. I am suggesting \nthat I believe that where the United States sends organizations to a \nforeign country to serve as objective election observers, that both in \nterms of their objectivity as election observers and in the spirit that \npartisan politics end at the Nation's boundaries, that it would be \nappropriate to defer observations on the election until after the \nelection has taken place.\n  There is a suspicion raised that the purpose of issuing a report on \nan election 24 hours before it commences is to either influence the \nelection in that country or to influence domestic politics within the \nUnited States. I do not think that the process of American political \nparty involvement is advanced by issuing a report of 300 pages on the \nmorning before the election. That is my judgment. I would not recommend \nthat that be done. Others may have different assessments as to the \npropriety of doing so, and I would not state that my values on this are \nbiblical or absolute, but they are my values.\n  Mr. President, after having gotten off the plane and responding to \nthat series of reporters' questions, we then went to a series of \nsessions in which we were briefed as to what we might expect on \nelection day and some of the preparation for this election.\n  Let me say, this election is one that originally was supposed to have \ntaken place in February or March of this year, coincident with the \ncompletion of the term of all of the members of the lower house of the \nHaitian Parliament and approximately half of the members of the Haitian \nSenate. Because of a variety of difficulties in getting the election \norganized, it was postponed several times and finally took place last \nSunday.\n  There will be a runoff election towards the end of July in those \nraces where there was not a majority of the vote secured by any \ncandidate.\n  I think it is important--and I say this not in an attempt to create \nan unduly positive sense of the atmosphere, environment, but the \nreality of conducting an election in Haiti.\n  First, you are dealing with a nation that has a very high proportion \nof its population that is illiterate. Because of that, the ballots that \nwere printed were some of the more complex ballots that I have ever \nseen. They were multicolored, in order to depict the parties by being \nable to fully illustrate the party symbols. If it was a rooster, it was \na red rooster, with all of the coloration of the rooster. They also had \npictures of all of the candidates for the Senate. And in the first \nvoting precinct that I visited in Cite Soleil, one of the large slum \nareas in Port-au-Prince, there were 29 candidates for the Senate from \nthat particular district, two of whom would be elected. There were 29 \npictures of each of those candidates for the Senate. These are \nlogistically difficult steps to take in order to assure that people, \nmany of whom cannot read and write, would be able to cast an informed \nballot.\n  We are also dealing with a country which has had only two elections \nwithin a whole generation. People do not have much experience--those \npeople who are running the election, those people who are participating \nin the election. Basic electoral infrastructure is largely missing. \nHighways are extremely substandard. Telephone and other means of \ncommunication are often nonexistent.\n  So those are some of the practical circumstances under which an \nelection was held. Many of the shortcomings which were cited by the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Georgia were the result of an \nattempt to increase the democracy of the elections. They may have been \nattempts which exceeded the capability of those responsible for \nadministering the election. As an example, a decision was made that no \nprecinct would have more than 400 registered voters. The theory was \nthat they did not want to overburden the people who were at the \nprecinct and had the responsibility for managing by having an excessive \nnumber of voters at each precinct. The number 400 was selected as a \nmanageable number.\n  The problem with that was that they ended up with over 12,000 \nprecincts in order to have everybody in a precinct with no precinct \nmore than 400. Even more than that, because of the attempt to allow as \nmany people a chance to register as possible, registration did not \nclose until a few days before last Sunday's election. So you had many \npeople who registered late, who were assigned to one of these precincts \nwith no more than 400 people, where they did not have the time or the \nlogistical capability to get the ballots printed out to those precincts \nthat were created in order to accommodate the late registrants. \nProbably, in retrospect--and maybe this will be a lesson to be applied \nat the runoff election next month and at the Presidential election at \nthe end of the year--they will close the registration books earlier to \nassure that there is an adequate amount of time to process all of the \nregistered people and get the materials to those precincts.\n  That is an example of the kind of circumstance which started from a \ngood motive, to get as many people registered and participate as \npossible, which ended causing the kinds of problems that have been \ncited.\n  I talked to IRI--International Republican Institute--people who were \nactually out in the field in the precincts and small towns. I talked to \nOAS representatives in Port-au-Prince, and to others who were observing \nthe election. I asked, ``Is there any evidence that these problems were \nintended to benefit a party or a set of candidates?'' The answer was, \nfrom all sources, ``no.'' The problems, the shortfalls, were as a \nresult of incompetence, maybe an overreaching in terms of the desire to \nextend the election to all of the people, and to the kind of basic \ncircumstances that are the atmosphere, the environment for any election \nin a country like Haiti. But there was no evidence that those were \nintended to serve partisan political advantage.\n  As some have said, we are going to have an early opportunity to see \nwhether some of the lessons learned last Sunday will be applied, \nbecause there are going to be a second round of elections in just a \nmatter of 4 weeks. It will be the opportunity for those responsible for \nthe electoral process to \n\n[[Page S 9148]]\nincorporate some of those lessons that have been learned, in seeing \nthat the next round of elections are more orderly.\n  Let me just recite some of the vignettes that stick in my mind of \nthis election. In 1987, there were elections scheduled in Haiti, and as \npeople lined up at 6 o'clock in the morning to vote, the Tontons \nMacoutes came by with machine guns and slaughtered people in the voting \nlines. You would think that kind of circumstance that occurred less \nthan a decade ago would create a sense of anxiety and apprehension for \npeople to go out and vote on a Sunday morning in 1995. That was not the \ncase. People were, in fact, joyful in their attitudes. They were \nenthusiastic about the opportunity to vote. At 6 o'clock in the morning \nin Cite Soleil--the same place people were being shot down 8 years \nago--40 people were standing in line waiting to be able to be the first \nto vote at that particular precinct. It was an exciting exhilarating \nexperience to see people who wanted so much to participate in \ndemocracy.\n  I was particularly impressed with the number of young people. I just \nread an article about the low participation in American elections by \nour youngest voters. In Haiti, the youngest voters seem to be the most \nparticipating. I made a point, through a translator, of asking a number \nof these young people why they were doing this. Why was this 18-year-\nold out on a Sunday morning standing in line to vote? The answer was, \n``This is my country, this is my future. It is important to me and my \ncountry that democracy work.''\n  That is exactly the kind of spirit that will drive this country into \na better future, the kind of spirit that will begin to eradicate those \ncircumstances that have made holding an election in June 1995 so \ndifficult.\n  So, Mr. President, as I said, I will be submitting a fuller report at \na later time, but I wanted to put in context what is happening in this \ncountry. I do not intend to be naive or Pollyannaish about the \ndifficulties, including the difficulties of this election. But I \nbelieve that we, as Americans, can take pride in what we have \naccomplished, taking a country which a year ago was under one of the \nmost brutal dictatorships in modern history in the Western Hemisphere, \nwhere bodies where showing up every morning butchered as a result of \nthe previous night's brutality by agents of a military dictatorship; \nand now we have people standing upright, prideful of their country, \noptimistic of their personal future, desirous of being a part of the \nfuture of their nation and seeing democracy as the means by which that \nfuture would be achieved.\n  I think we should take some pride in that and that we will be able to \nlook back, I hope, at this experience last Sunday as an important step \nin what will be a long path toward the emergence of Haiti as a fully \ncommitted, operative democracy with an economy that provides \nopportunity and a future for its people and a government which respects \nthe rights and dignity of each individual citizen of Haiti.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield. Madam President, I want to \ncommend our colleague from Florida,\n who took the time, once again, as he has on numerous other occasions, \nto personally participate and observe routine, watching the elections \nin Haiti.\n\n  Senator Graham of Florida has a consistent and longstanding interest \nin Haiti, and I think it is worth our while. We anticipate and await a \nmore detailed report.\n  I was particularly interested in hearing your firsthand accounts of \nwhat actually occurred this past weekend, with all of the shortcomings \nthat occurred.\n  I read with some interest the departure statement of the U.S. \nPresidential delegation who observed the Haitian elections and the \nnumber of places that the delegation--some 300 polling sites--observed \ncomplicated balloting procedures involving elections for more than \n2,100 legislative, mayoral and local council offices, 25 political \nparties, and it goes on how complicated this process was.\n  The delegation notes here that:\n\n       Despite repeated misunderstandings over the actions of \n     election officials at all levels, the delegation saw little \n     evidence of any effort to favor a single political party or \n     of an organized attempt to intentionally subvert the \n     electoral machinery. At many points, the Provisional \n     Electoral Council's actions and public statements raised \n     questions about the credibility of the process. The most \n     significant of the problems was the failure to explain the \n     reasons candidates were rejected. Political parties raised \n     these and other concerns relating to the transparency of the \n     elections in their contacts within the delegation.\n\n  It goes on. I think it points out the success of this delegation.\n  Last, Mr. President, in the Miami Herald, Monday, June 26, edition, \n``Haiti: Ballots, Not Bullets.'' I think it is a worthwhile headline to \nnote, Ballots Not Bullets.\n\n       Historic vote is mostly free of violence. Democracy scored \n     a fragile victory Sunday as Haitians trooped to the polls \n     under a blazing sun and a cloud of confusion to vote on all \n     but 10 of the country's 2,205 elected offices.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Haiti: Ballots, not Bullets\n\n                   (By Don Bohning and Susan Benesch)\n\n       Port-au-Prince.--Democracy scored a fragile victory Sunday \n     as Haitians trooped to the polls under a blazing sun and a \n     cloud of confusion to vote on all but 10 of the country's \n     2,205 elected offices.\n       Perhaps most important, the election was virtually free of \n     the violence that marred previous ones.\n       Sunday's was the first and most complicated of three \n     crucial electoral tests in the wake of the U.S.-led military \n     intervention in September that restored President Jean-\n     Bertrand Aristide to office after three years of exile.\n       The next test comes July 23, with a runoff for Senate and \n     Chamber of Deputies candidates who did not win a majority in \n     Sunday's balloting. All 83 seats in the lower house and 18 in \n     the 27-seat Senate were contested.\n       Both Sunday's vote and the July 23 runoff are curtain-\n     raisers for year-end presidential elections.\n       ``We're voting for democracy to advance,'' pronounced a \n     smiling Aristide after voting near his residence on the \n     outskirts of Port-au-Prince.\n       Dressed in blue jeans and a white polo shirt with green \n     trim, the diminutive Aristide, buried in a phalanx of \n     security officials and aides, walked the half-mile from his \n     home to the polling station at the St. John Paul II church \n     and school complex.\n       Aristide emerged 15 minutes later, showing a crowd of \n     journalists and admirers his thumb coated in indelible ink, a \n     sign he had voted.\n       A far greater problem than the few scattered and mostly \n     minor incidents of violence across the country, were the \n     almost universal complaints of snafus at the 10,000 polling \n     stations.\n       Many polling places opened late, some by several hours. In \n     others, ballots and other voting materials were missing. In \n     some cases, so were poll workers. Transportation was a \n     problem, with all but official and public vehicles banned \n     from the streets. The ban also applied to all commercial \n     airline flights.\n       For the most part, Haitians waited patiently outside \n     polling stations as electoral officials scurried to correct \n     the deficiencies.\n       With about 80 percent of Haitians illiterate, many voters \n     struggled to decipher a multitude of party symbols on the \n     ballots. Independent candidates were identified with a \n     Haitian flag. Voters also got help from election officials in \n     marking their ballots and depositing them correctly.\n       Electoral officials estimated that about 90 percent of \n     eligible Haitians--3.5 million--had registered to vote. There \n     were no immediate figures available of how many actually \n     voted, but turnout appeared to be heavy, although not equal \n     to that of the December 1990 election that swept Aristide to \n     office.\n       Results for the local, district and the first round of \n     parliamentary elections are not expected for at least a week, \n     because the ballots have to be counted by hand.\n\n\n                           foreign assessment\n\n       The tentative assessment was that Sunday's vote probably \n     met at least the minimum standards for a credible election. A \n     final verdict is expected today, when up to 1,000 foreign \n     observers offer their assessment. And it's likely that even \n     they might not agree.\n       ``There were the kind of administrative problems we \n     anticipated, but Haitians as a whole voted without \n     intimidation or fraud in the electoral process,'' said a \n     Clinton administration official participating in the 20-\n     member U.S. presidential delegation witnessing the vote.\n       ``I have been in many African countries for elections and \n     they are doing very well here,'' was the midmorning \n     assessment of Sen. Jacques Goillet, member of a French \n     parliamentary observer delegation.\n\n\n                             positive side\n\n       While the credibility of the election may be debated, on \n     the clearly positive side there were no reports of major \n     election day violence.\n       The most serious incidents of election-related violence \n     occurred overnight Friday in \n\n[[Page S 9149]]\n     the northern areas of Limbe, Le Bourgne and Dondon. Sunday's vote was \n     called off in all three places, with the expectation it would \n     be rescheduled in conjunction with the July 23 runoff.\n       In Limbe, somebody threw a firebomb into the electoral \n     offices, destroying thousands of ballots. In neighboring \n     Dondon, election officials decided to shut down to prevent \n     problems. And in Le Bourgne, a mob attacked the electoral \n     offices, stealing seven boxes of election materials. They \n     were later recovered but in unusable condition.\n       There seems to be little doubt the election violence was \n     held to a minimum by 6,000 foreign troops--including 2,400 \n     Americans--remaining here as part of a United Nations force. \n     Along with about 1,000 international police monitors, they \n     were deployed nationwide.\n       Florida Sen. Bob Graham, observing the vote, said he was \n     ``pleased by what I have seen so far.''\n       Almost to a voter, Haitians in line in Cite Soleil, a Port-\n     au-Prince slum, said they were voting for the candidates of \n     the ticket known as The Table, who are favored by Aristide.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to commend my colleague for his efforts and for \nsharing his observations here. This was not perfect by any standards. \nGiven what we have seen over the years here, this does offer at least \nsome significant hope--that the comments you heard from young people \nabout what they wish for, why they were going through the process of \nvoting, is something that we can get behind and nourish and try to \nencourage in the coming years.\n  I thank my colleague for his efforts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, while my friend from Florida is on the \nfloor, International Republican Institute has similar preelection \nreports from Nicaragua, China, El Salvador, Slovenia, just to name a \nfew. The National Democratic Institute has issued preelection reports \nin the course of their monitoring of elections.\n  For the Senator from Florida to somehow believe that this is an \nunusual or inappropriate measure is simply, I think, incorrect, in \nlight of the fact that it is a normal, standard procedure for electoral \nobservation teams to make these reports.\n  I will be glad to provide for the Record all those that the National \nDemocratic Institute also completed.\n  Because this report was very critical in no means, in my view, \ninvalidates it. I would like to point out I know that the Senator from \nFlorida knows that Congressman Goss, of all people, is highly \nqualified. He is a former member of the CIA--I think the only member of \nthe other body that is a member of the CIA.\n  I would say to my friend from Florida, at no time, in 4 years of \nobserving 48 elections, has the International Republican Institute or \nthe National Democratic Institute, been challenged on the basis of \nparty bias. If they did, if there was any of that, they would have no \ncredibility.\n  While we are looking at newspapers, here is a picture at a counting \nstation in downtown Port-au-Prince. ``Monique Georges reacts to the \nstate of ballot boxes deposited by angry election workers who said they \nhad not been paid.''\n  The Washington Post reports:\n\n       Parties and election observers across the political \n     spectrum--from the government of President Jean-Bertrand \n     Aristide--today criticized as chaotic and disorderly \n     elections Sunday that were considered a key step in \n     establishing democracy in this impoverished nation.\n\n  To be fair I should go on:\n\n       But most said the disarray did not invalidate the voting, \n     and even the Republican observer team said the irregularities \n     were not enough to prompt a cutoff of U.S. aid.\n\n  Nor am I seeking a cutoff of U.S. aid.\n\n       ``The process is very badly organized, and we, the \n     government, are not proud of it,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeaux, \n     the Minister of Culture, in a radio interview. ``Instead of \n     improving on the 1990 elections, we have done worse.''\n\n  Now, this is the Minister of Culture in Haiti.\n  Madam President, we are wasting the time of the Senate in a way, \nbecause the facts are going to come out on this election. These are the \nfirst initial observations made by qualified observers, and I think \nmore and more evidence is pouring in that this election did not meet \nthe minimum standards in order to judge an election as fair and \nequitable and that the people are allowed to select their leadership.\n  I just want to emphasize, Madam President, that this election was \nobserved by unbiased observers. I will provide for the Record the names \nof those individuals who made the observations.\n  There being no objection, the ordered printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n                         Observation Delegation\n\n\n                      chairman of the delegation:\n\n       U.S. Representative Porter J.

People can honestly disagree on what they observed. But \nto allege that somehow agreement or disagreement with administration \npolicy concerning Haiti would somehow affect one's view of this \nelection, I think, does great disservice to the people what took their \ntime and their effort.\n  The Senator from Florida certainly knows how unpleasant the \nconditions are down there. They may disagree with the Senator from \nFlorida as to the veracity of the elections, but I cannot, without any \nevidence, accept any allegation that the observation of these elections \nand the conclusions that were reached by these observers were in any \nway colored by their view of United States policy toward Haiti.\n  I am sure that my friend from Florida would not intimate such a \nthing. I want to make the record clear and I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Florida for his many-year-long involvement in the issue of Haiti, \nfor his strong advocacy for freedom and democracy in Haiti, and his \ncontinued knowledgeable and informative manner as far as the region is \nconcerned. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9146-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9150-S9173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, is about to offer an amendment.\n  It would be my intent when the ranking member returns, Senator \nSarbanes, to offer a unanimous-consent agreement, the nature of which \nis we would have 1 hour equally divided on Senator Graham's amendment, \nand we then would proceed to Senator Boxer's amendment.\n  I see Senator Sarbanes is here. I yield the floor to Senator Graham \nso he can start and offer his amendment, and at some point in time he \nmight break to propound the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Could I ask the Senator from New York a question? Your \nunanimous consent--are you going to provide some time in the morning \nprior to the vote for a brief statement for those who may not be able--\n--\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It would be our intent to vote this evening, probably by \nabout 8 o'clock.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am sorry. From earlier comments, I understood it was \nsuggested otherwise.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We had attempted to get an agreement to stack the votes, \nbut there was an objection to stacking more than a certain number. It \nis my intent to dispose of the Senator's amendment prior to disposing \nof the Boxer amendment.\n  May I ask at this point unanimous consent that when the Senate \nconsiders the Graham amendment, there be 1 hour for debate, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, and no second-degree amendments be \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I further ask that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time on the Graham amendment, that \nthe amendment be laid aside and Senator Boxer be recognized to offer an \namendment regarding insider trading, on which there would be 90 minutes \nfor debate to be equally divided in the usual form, and no second-\ndegree amendments to be in order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I will have to object to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object? Objection is heard.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Well, then, we proceed to the Graham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1479\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an early evaluation procedure in securities \n                             class actions)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, before I offer my amendment, I would \nlike to make a few comments relative to this legislation. When I \napproach a piece of legislation, I like to do so by asking some basic \nquestions, the first of which is: What is the problem? What is it that \nwe do not like about the status quo that has caused us to propose some \nalteration of the status quo?\n  In this case, that diagnosis has been very consistent, clear, and \ntrumpeting, and it is that we have too many frivolous lawsuits that \nrelate to securities fraud.\n  I cite as my evidence of that an ad which appeared on page A7 of \ntoday's Washington Post, under the headlines, ``Who Profits? `A Coterie \nof Lawyers'.''\n  This ad was in support of S. 240, and it was placed by ``America \nNeeds More Investors, Not More Lawsuits,'' under the sponsorship of \nAmerican Business Conference and American Electronics Association.\n  What did the proponents of this legislation say was the reason that \nwe have S. 240 before us this evening? Quoting from the ad:\n\n       Specialized securities lawyers win big bucks by filing \n     meritless lawsuits against many of America's most promising \n     companies. The securities lawyers profit handsomely, but \n     Americans with money in stocks, pensions and mutual funds are \n     the losers in the deal.\n       This is what editorial writers across the Nation are saying \n     about securities lawsuit abuse:\n\n  And then the ad quotes a number of newspapers which have taken a \nposition in support of this legislation. It happens that the first of \nthose newspapers is from my State, the Tampa Tribune, June 25, 1995:\n\n       The situation now is that all investors are paying the \n     costs of settling lawsuits that should never have been filed. \n     . . . [T]he time has come to pull the legal leeches off the \n     backs of corporations that have done no wrong.\n\n  That is from the Tampa Tribune.\n  The next is from the Rocky Mountain News:\n\n       . . . the nogoodniks suffer at the same rate as the \n     straight-shooters. Meanwhile, who profits? A coterie of \n     lawyers with stock charts and fill-in-the-blanks fraud \n     complaints.\n\n  That is the January 18, 1995, Rocky Mountain News.\n  The Chicago Tribune of March 29 of this year:\n\n       . . . groundless lawsuits by shareholders alleging fraud . \n     . . are often merely a way of extorting settlements from \n     corporations whose stock prices have dropped.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the totality of the ad from \ntoday's Washington Post be printed in the Record immediately following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, that is the stated problem: Frivolous, \nmeritless lawsuits. But what do we have? Is that the prescription that \nhas come out in S. 240? Is it legislation which is targeted at \neradicating the tumor of meritless lawsuits? Unfortunately not.\n  If I may quote from another newspaper, the Miami Herald of yesterday, \nwhich stated, under the headline, ``License to steal'':\n\n       Practically everyone in Washington, to some degree or \n     other, has blamed ``frivolous or abusive lawsuits'' for \n     sapping America's economic vigor. And judging from anecdotes, \n     the complaint has some merit. But more often than not, the \n     proposed cures turn out to be far more debilitating than the \n     disease. A perfect illustration is a bill moving through \n     Congress that supposedly protects the securities industry \n     from ``frivolous'' suits by investors.\n       The bill may come to a Senate vote today. It would bar, \n     among many other things, charges of fraud against those who \n     make false projections of a company's likely performance. By \n     granting ``safe harbor'' to all statements of a ``forward-\n     looking'' nature, it essentially tells companies and brokers: \n     Go ahead, lie about the future. As long as you're not \n     misrepresenting the past, you can fleece investors in any way \n     that your imagination allows.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the editorial from the June \n26, \n\n[[Page S 9151]]\n1995, Miami Herald also be printed in the Record immediately after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I think has happened, Madam President, is we had a \ngoal to eliminate frivolous lawsuits which could have been hit easily \nwith a .22 rifle. We have now used a howitzer, which has cratered in a \nlarge area of the legitimate rights of American investors when they are \nsubjected to abusive and to fraudulent activities. We have created a \nsituation in which it is going to be much more difficult to maintain \nany kind of suit, serious or frivolous, where fraud is alleged. We have \nshortened the statute of limitations. We have provided protection for \nthose who assisted in the fraudulent behavior of the principals. We \nhave created a circumstance of a conflict of interest by designating \nthe largest investor in the company as the principal plaintiff in these \ntypes of cases. These are just some of the things that have happened, \nall under the pretext that we are going to be dealing with frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I suggest that there are serious consequences of this type of \nlegislation, and what it is likely to lead to for the American free \nenterprise system. It was only 100 years ago that we had a very \npredatory form of free enterprise in the United States. We had large \ncompanies using their power in an abusive way to squelch small \ncompetitors, to gain monopolistic economic control. We had extreme \nswings in our business cycle, in large part attributed to that \npredatory behavior. We had the growth of populism and other forms of \npolitical dissent, as farmers and workers felt as if they were being \nthe targets of this predatory behavior.\n  The free enterprise system in America was in a very precarious \ncondition. Free enterprise has flourished in America when people felt \nthat the rules of free enterprise were fair and that everyone was going \nto be treated equally, that people could invest in firms--not without \nrisk; that is the nature of the marketplace. But at least they were \ngoing to be treated with some discretion and some level of an equal \nplaying field.\n  I am afraid that legislation such as S. 240--which is going to be \nseen as, and I believe will in fact result in, a tilting of the \neconomic playing field toward those who would be inclined to wish to \nabuse it and to use it for their own fraudulent purposes--will \nundermine that essential confidence of the American people in their \neconomic institutions.\n  So, with that, Madam President, I have an amendment that I would like \nto propose. It is an amendment which I will send to the desk which \nactually goes directly at the issue of frivolous lawsuits.\n  Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1479.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Madam President, the time I just used should be counted \nagainst the time which I was afforded to debate this matter.\n  Madam President, the amendment that I send to the desk I do not \npurport to be original.\n  It is in fact a version of what appeared in S. 240 as it was \noriginally filed. It also draws heavily on language that was contained \nin the Bryan-Shelby bill, S. 667. What it attempts to do is to provide \nan early evaluation procedure for litigation filed either under the \n1933 Securities Act, or the 1934 Securities Act. It would provide that \non the motion of the parties, or by the motion of the court before whom \nthe case has been filed, that there can be an independent mediator \ndesignated. That mediator would have the responsibility of reviewing \nall of the facts of the litigation. After that review, the mediator \nwould submit a report. That report would contain a finding that the \nlitigation was either one of three categories. It was either a clearly \nfrivolous action; second, a clearly meritorious action; or, third, was \nneither.\n  If the parties in the face of that determination proceed with \nlitigation, at the conclusion of the litigation, that report is \nsubmitted to the judge. And in the case under the 1934 act, for \ninstance, where the report has found that this was a clearly frivolous \naction, and if the final judgment is entered against the plaintiff--\nthat is, the plaintiff proceeded forward to full litigation in spite of \nthe fact that there had been an early evaluation that this was a \nclearly frivolous action, and the plaintiff had in fact had the final \njudgment entered against the plaintiff--then the plaintiff or the \nplaintiff's counsel shall be liable to defendant for sanctions as \nawarded by the court, which may include an order to pay reasonable \nattorney's fees and other expenses, if the court agrees based on the \nentire record that the action was clearly frivolous when filed and was \nmaintained in bad faith.\n  Madam President, if, on the other hand, this report of the early \nevaluation found that this was a clearly meritorious action, and the \ndefendant carried it through to final judgment, and final judgment was \nentered against the defendant, then the defendant, or the defendant's \ncounsel, shall be liable to the plaintiff for the sanctions awarded by \nthe court which may include reasonable attorney's fees and other \nexpenses; if the court agrees based on the entire record that the \naction was clearly meritorious and was defended in bad faith.\n  Madam President, that is what we are trying to do here. We are trying \nto create some effective sanctions against people bringing frivolous \nlawsuits. We are attempting to set up a procedure that will facilitate \nthe delineation and early determination of the frivolous from the \nnonfrivolous and meritorious cases. It is hoped with that early \ndetermination the parties against whom this report is entered will not \npursue it further, or, in the case of the defendant, that they will \nsettle the case without the necessity of prolonged and expensive \nlitigation.\n  Is not that what we are here for? We have identified the problem as \nbeing frivolous lawsuits. Why do we not solve the problem of frivolous \nlawsuits and not allow that problem to become a Trojan horse into which \nwe load a lot of other issues, of shortening statute of limitations, \ncreating conflicts of interest by designating only the most affluent \ninvestor as the lead plaintiff, giving really quite unwarranted \nprotection to persons who make projections about the future with \nknowledge that those projections are false, giving increased sanction \nand protection to aiders and abettors who have acted in a reckless \nmanner that has resulted in investors of being defrauded? None of those \nthings are relevant to the issue of frivolous lawsuits.\n  So, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to seriously consider this \namendment which is submitted in an attempt to refocus our remedies on \nwhat has been general agreement to be the problem, which is frivolous \nlawsuits that do not advance the cause of justice that have the \neconomic adverse effects that are recited by the proponents of S. 240.\n  So, Madam President, I will reserve the remainder of my time. But I \nurge a \n\n[[Page S 9153]]\nfavorable consideration of this amendment by my colleagues.\n  Thank you.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Who Profits? ``A Coterie of Lawyers''--Rocky Mountain News.\n       Specialized securities lawyers win big bucks by filing \n     meritless lawsuits against many of America's most promising \n     companies.

And judging from anecdotes, \n     the complaint has some merit. But more often than not, the \n     proposed cures turn out to be far more debilitating than the \n     disease. A perfect illustration is a bill moving through \n     Congress that supposedly protects the securities industry \n     from ``frivolous'' suits by investors.\n       The bill may come to a Senate vote today. It would bar, \n     among many other things, charges of fraud against those who \n     make false projections of a company's likely performance. By \n     granting ``safe harbor'' to all statements of a ``forward-\n     looking'' nature, it essentially tells companies and brokers: \n     Go ahead, lie about the future. As long as you're not \n     misrepresenting the past, you can fleece investors in any way \n     that your imagination allows.\n       Technically, investors still could sue in cases of \n     egregious deceit. But they'd have only one year to do so, and \n     they'd have to show evidence, up front, that the fraud was \n     deliberate. Not even the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     can prove willfulness that quickly.\n       The problem is that companies make plenty of rosy \n     projections in good faith. Sometimes, when the promises don't \n     pan out, frustrated (or merely opportunistic) investors try \n     to sue. How common is that? Experts disagree.\n       But the Senate bill offers a curious solution: To prevent \n     some unknown number of unfair securities-fraud lawsuits, \n     let's outlaw huge categories of them. The genuine, fair ones \n     will just have to go unpunished.\n       So sorry you're swindled, old chap. Better luck next time.\n       This is licensed larceny, and it's unconscionable. Yet \n     Florida Sen. Connie Mack, a member of the Banking Committee, \n     has co-sponsored and voted for the bill so far. In the time \n     since the committee review, Mr. Mack may have had a chance to \n     ponder its ill consequences. He'd do well to vote No today \n     and help slay this beast for good.\n       Recent history is replete with colorful illustrations of \n     deliberate, systematic fraud on small investors. Their \n     savings were replenished, if at all, only by the courts or by \n     the threat of litigation. It's a strange moment indeed, with \n     the sores of the savings-and-loan fiasco still raw, for \n     Congress essentially to declare open season for deceiving \n     investors.\n       It prompts an ironic question: How does it help American \n     investment to scare off potential investors with a promise \n     that the law won't aid them if they're bilked? The point of \n     solving the ``frivolous lawsuit'' problem was supposed to be \n     to encourage more investment. By that standard, the Senate's \n     ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act'' amounts to self-\n     strangulation.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Florida \nis correct that the amendment he is now submitting has been the subject \nof intense scrutiny. Indeed, it was considered in the initial draft of \nthis legislation. One of the reasons this proposal was rejected and \ndropped from the initial legislation was because it requires--and will \nwind up costing--too much. Also, this provision would set up an \nentirely new bureaucracy, by setting up an early evaluation procedure \nfor class action lawsuits.\n  Although early evaluation may be a laudable concept, this amendment \nwill force parties into an early evaluation procedure. The procedure \nrequires parties to voluntarily turn over documents or be subject to \nsanctions. At the end of the evaluation, if the parties do not settle \nor dismiss the action, they can be sanctioned if any further action is \nconsidered frivolous. I believe that parties should attempt to mediate \ntheir claims, if possible, but they should not be forced to mediate \nclaims if they really want to seek a day in court.\n  This is the balance that was reached. This Senator has never \nattempted to keep people from having their day in court. This Senator \nstated that belief clearly for the record during debate on this \nprovision and the loser pays provision when they were strongly urged by \nthose in the private sector who sought relief. But I would not, and \ncould not, support the losers-pays concept because, as laudable as that \nmight sound, it would indeed infringe upon the basic rights of men to \nseek relief. It would just be too high a bar for those who have truly \nbeen aggrieved.\n  This amendment requires parties to submit to an early dispute \nresolution. If one of the parties, however, does not want this early \nprocedure, then we have a very real problem. The early evaluation \nprocedure would take place if each side agrees to it, or if either side \nwants it and the court acts upon such motion within 60 days of the \nfiling the class action. I believe that this amendment goes too far in \nits attempt to resolve disputes. It actually sets up a standard where \npeople would lose the ability to fight for their rights, whether they \nare the plaintiff or the defendant. I notice that Senator Dodd is here \nand know that he has spent a great deal of time on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me first of all thank my colleague \nfrom Florida for giving me a call earlier today about what he was going \nto offer with this amendment.\n  Let me first of all, say that the spirit of this amendment, which I \nadmit I like, in a way, has been offered as a part of the original bill \nalternative dispute resolution procedure to try to give litigants in \nsecurities matters an option of going a route rather than going into \ncourt to resolve their problems. We tried that on a number of bills. I \ngo back 7 or 8 years ago in my efforts with then Senator Danforth of \nMissouri. We proposed some tort reform legislation that set up an \nalternative dispute resolution mechanism.\n  So there is a spirit to this amendment and I am attracted to that \nspirit. I say that at the outset. But let me also say that despite my \nattraction with the spirit of what is being offered, I see this as \nbeing a proposal which is going to complicate matters rather than help \nresolve them.\n  Under this amendment, as I understand it, any party that seeks a \ncourt order or an early evaluation--and if the court grants that \norder--an early evaluation might sound, and does sound very attractive, \nto Federal judges who are looking for a way to clear off their dockets, \nthen you have the fishing process which can begin which I think runs \ncounter to what we are trying to \n\n[[Page S 9154]]\nachieve even under an alternative dispute resolution, a modest one as \nwe have in the bill.\n  Even if the complaint, Madam President, is clearly a matter--let us \nfor the sake of argument assume that is the case--which would be \ndismissed and the case ended, when a motion to dismiss is decided, the \nplaintiff would get complete discovery prior to any ruling on the \nmotion to dismiss. Now, that raises the issue of discovery and \ndiscovery costs. Of course, these are some of the principal forces and \nfactors that cause innocent defendants to settle their cases.\n  In testimony before our committee, in hearings on this matter--and I \nam quoting from page 14 of our committee report:\n\n     . . .discovery costs account for roughly 80 percent of the \n     total litigation costs in securities fraud cases.\n\n  In many cases the discovery can work in determining the guilt of a \nparty. So I am not arguing there should not be discovery, but here you \nare getting it completely even before you get to the process, even \nbefore the motion to dismiss.\n  One witness described the broad discovery requests requiring a \ncompany to produce over 1,500 boxes of documents at an expense of $1.4 \nmillion, referring to page 16 of our report.\n  What does all this mean, Madam President? Lawyers who can file \nmeritless cases--and we have seen examples of that, cases that would be \ndismissed by the Court--will be able to circumvent the very important \nprotection against unjustified claims that is provided by the motion to \ndismiss process.\n  Indeed, this amendment would expand attorneys' ability to coerce \nsettlements, in my view to include a new category of cases--those that \nare by definition meritless and that would be dismissed by the court. \nGiven all the evidence that these lawyers extract in settlements in \nunjustified cases, we cannot--in my view, should not--enact a provision \nthat would expand their power to do so in meritless cases, and that \nwould be the net effect were the amendment to be adopted.\n  So again, for one who is attracted very strongly to the alternative \ndispute resolution process, what you are getting here is something very \ndifferent than that which raises the costs which provokes these kinds \nof settlements in meritless cases, and therefore, with all due respect \nto my good friend from Florida, I would urge the rejection of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, we have nothing further to say on this \nside, unless the Senator from Florida wishes to continue. Otherwise, we \nwill put in a quorum call.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call time be \ntaken equally off both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be applied \nequally.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator withhold on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 14\\1/2\\ minutes; \nthe Senator from New York has 22 minutes and 32 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Will the Senator from Florida give me just 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Florida yields such time as the Senator \nfrom Maryland would choose to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I wish to say to the Senator from \nFlorida that I think he has come up with a very imaginative proposal \nhere. His proposal in fact really gets at the question of the frivolous \nsuits. We have been hearing a lot of discussion here over the last \ncouple of days about trying to get at frivolous suits.\n  When you look at the provisions that are being used in order to get \nat frivolous suits, you discover that they really encompass a great \nnumber of other things as well. As my colleague from Nevada, Senator \nBryan, said at one point during the debate, this is a Trojan horse \nriding beneath the pennant of the frivolous suit with all sorts of \nother menacing, dangerous things hidden in the Trojan horse.\n  I am interested that the proponents of this legislation are not \nresponsive to the amendment of the Senator, which, of all the proposals \nI have seen, is the one that focuses on the frivolous suit and on the \nfrivolous suit only, as I understand it.\n  I ask the Senator, is it, in fact, correct that the focus of the \nSenator's amendment is the frivolous suit and it does not go beyond \nthat?\n  We have other things that are being done. People are being denied \naccess to the courthouse. Aiders and abettors are being protected from \nany liability whatsoever. Joint and several liability is being done \naway with, all in the name of trying to get at the frivolous suit. It \nmay have some implications for the frivolous suit, but the unfortunate \nthing is it also has very significant implications for the meritorious \nsuit.\n  As I understand the Senator's amendment, it is not subject to that \ncriticism. This is the frivolous suit only.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The purpose, I say to the Senator, is the difference \nbetween using a laser beam to precisely remove a tumor as opposed to \namputation to remove the entire limb. I fear that what we have done in \nthis legislation, Madam President, is to amputate the ability of most \ninvestors to bring a serious case of securities fraud. Whether it is \nfrivolous, competitive, or highly meritorious, we have eliminated for \nmany individuals the ability to have access to court, to have their \nclaims adjudicated in all types of cases.\n  The purpose of this amendment was to be that laser that would \nidentify those cases which in fact are, to use the amendment's term, \nclearly frivolous actions, and to provide some very stiff sanctions \nagainst persons who are found to have filed a clearly frivolous action \nbut persist. If they lose that clearly frivolous action, which \nassumedly they are likely to do, then they face the prospect of paying \nnot only their attorneys and their costs; they have to pay the \ndefendant's attorneys and costs.\n  Conversely, if a clearly meritorious action is filed and the \ndefendant persists in litigation to defend against that clearly \nmeritorious action and the defendant loses, then the defendant is \nplaced in the position of being subject to the sanction of having to \npay not only his own costs but also the costs of the plaintiff.\n  This is not an attempt to apply a broadly based English standard of \nloser pays. This is an attempt to achieve the very purpose of this \nlegislation, which is to discourage frivolous lawsuits by making the \neconomic consequences of filing a frivolous lawsuit so onerous.\n  I thank my colleague for having asked that clarifying question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, the amendment of the Senator is \nbalanced. There has been a tremendous amount of focus about the \nfrivolous lawsuit filed by plaintiffs, but there also can be a problem \nwith defendants resisting what are otherwise meritorious claims. Is \nthat not correct?\n How does the Senator address that?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, Madam President, there could be a frivolous defense \nas well as there can be a frivolous plaintiff's filing. And this \namendment would provide balance. Exactly the same sanctions would be \napplied under the 1934 Securities Act to a frivolous action as would be \napplied to a clearly meritorious action. That is, if you are the \ndefendant, and the evaluation is this is a clearly meritorious case, \nbut you persist, litigate, and you lose, then you are subject to the \nsanction of having to pay the plaintiff's attorneys fees and court \ncosts. So this is an attempt to create some strong economic incentives \nfor people to settle and for people not to file a frivolous action, nor \nto persist in frivolous defenses.\n\n[[Page S 9155]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have to say to the Senator, having listened to this \nexplanation, I have difficulty understanding why the proponents of this \nlegislation have asserted that the purpose in trying to move the \nlegislation is to avoid expensive litigation or preparation for \nlitigation.\n  Let me ask the Senator one final question. Does your process come in \nahead of an extensive discovery period, or how does it work? At what \npoint does your process come into play?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The expectation would be that this would be at the \ndiscretion of the parties or of the judge that this would be the first \naction initiated after the litigation has been filed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I see. So it would involve potentially a lot of the \ncosts that are associated with preparing for trial, let alone the costs \nconnected with the trial?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is difficult for me to understand the people who are \nopposing this amendment on the assertion they are trying to get at the \ncost of frivolous suits, or as I understand it, opposing the Senator's \namendment. I just have difficulty squaring that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It seems to me, Madam President, that this amendment is \nexactly consistent with what proponents of this legislation say the \nevil is that we are attempting to correct, and it would avoid the \nnecessity of having to overreach in terms of a remedy to apply an \nexcessive amount of medication of severely restricting access to courts \nby people with legitimate claims, which I fear this legislation will \ndo. And even if a legitimate claim matures into a judgment, to then \nprotect those persons against whom the judgment might be rendered by \nthings like the aiders and abettors provision and the joint and several \nliability, particularly as it relates to small investors, et cetera. \nAll of those types of things would be less necessary if we went \nstraight at the problem cited, the frivolous lawsuit, and tried to \neliminate as many of those lawsuits by effective sanctions as I believe \nthis will be at the initial stages.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then you would not be running the risk, the very \nsubstantial risk, as I perceive this legislation, that meritorious \nclaims would be adversely affected by these other sweeping provisions \nthat are in this legislation. Your provision by definition is so \ndirected that the meritorious claim would pass through the screening \nprocess, as I understand it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The early evaluation would make a determination that the \ncase was either clearly frivolous, clearly meritorious, or neither. And \nif you fell into that third category, then that ought to be the kind of \nopen, civil due process that we associate with the American judicial \nsystem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, I thank the Senator very much for his explanation \nand for his very constructive and I think imaginative proposal.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, unless there is someone else who would \nlike to speak on this amendment, I am prepared to make a short \nconcluding statement and then if the opponents are prepared to yield \nback their time, I would be so prepared and we could proceed.\n  Madam President, we have before us consensus on one issue, and that \nis that there is a problem relative to frivolous lawsuits in the \nsecurities area. The quandary is how to eradicate or mitigate that \nproblem without doing excessive damage to other rights of investors, \nwithout eliminating what has been one of the principal deterrents to \nfraudulent behavior within our free enterprise system, what has been \none of the foundations of public confidence that they could invest in \nour capitalistic system and be treated fairly.\n  I believe this amendment goes directly at the problem that we have \nidentified. It states that early on, after a case has been filed, there \nwill be an independent evaluation by a judicially selected mediator as \nto whether this is a frivolous, meritorious, or other action. The case \nwould then be in the hands of the litigants as to whether, in the face \nof that determination, they wish to proceed.\n  But if they proceeded with a frivolous case, and if they lost that \nfrivolous case, then they would be subject to very serious sanctions of \nhaving to pay not only their bills, but also the attorney fees and \ncosts of their opponent. I think that would be a significant factor in \nterms of deterring the prosecution of frivolous suits.\n  Frivolous defenses are sanctioned in exactly the same manner. So if a \ncase is determined to be clearly meritorious, and yet the defendant \nproceeds and loses, that defendant will be subject to these sanctions. \nMadam President, I believe that comes as close to solving the problem \nwe have identified and does so in a way that does not have unintended, \nadverse consequences on other aspects of investors' rights.\n  So I urge those who are proponents of S. 240 to see this as a \nsupportive, friendly, positive contribution to achieve their objective. \nAnd I hope that they and my other colleagues will support this \namendment, which I believe moves toward achieving the very purpose that \nled to the introduction of this legislation in the first instance.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I am prepared to yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from \nFlorida. I too yield back the balance of our time, and ask unanimous \nconsent that this matter be set over for the purpose of giving Senator \nBoxer an opportunity to offer her amendment. She has indicated that she \nwould take 40 minutes on her side and retain the balance of 5 minutes \nfor tomorrow with the express intent that we will vote on her amendment \nfirst tomorrow after she makes her 5-minute statement. I reserve \nourselves 2 minutes for tomorrow, and as much time as we need this \nevening. I do not intend to use more than 15 minutes at the most.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not want to \nobject, when are we going to vote on the Graham amendment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It is my thought and intent that we will vote on Senator \nGraham's amendment after your amendment. And Senator Specter has \nseveral amendments to offer. If we could stack them to accommodate some \nof our colleagues, certainly well before 9 o'clock. It is my intent to \nask for unanimous consent that we proceed in that manner.\n  No matter, at least the Senator will have the opportunity of offering \nher amendment and starting to use some of her time.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I am very willing. I would prefer to \nhave my vote follow Senator Graham's. I think it makes more sense.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Would you like to vote on it this evening?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am suggesting tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We will vote on Senator Graham's amendment this evening.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was not aware of that.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That was my purpose, so you would have an opportunity.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the manager will yield, as I understand the \nprocedure now, the Graham amendment is being set aside so Senator Boxer \ncan offer her amendment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. Possibly Senator Specter, as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Boxer's amendment we will debate for 40 \nminutes. You will respond for, I think, not more than----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Not more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then we will move on to some other amendments?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It is my hope we would take the three Specter \namendments, at least two of those amendments, and dispose of them this \nevening, as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Boxer amendment would go on over to the morning. \nSenator Boxer will have an opportunity to speak in the morning for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We intend to vote tonight on Senator Graham and Senator \nSpecter?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All together, or Senator Graham after Senator Boxer \nfinishes her debate?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Well, I would like to possibly stack them for the \nconvenience of our Members so they do not have to keep coming back and \nforth this evening.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This evening.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. This evening.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So it would be the Graham amendment and Specter, some \nnumber of Specter.\n\n[[Page S 9156]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct, either two or three.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, and if that \nappropriate time is now, I would like to ask for the yeas and nays on \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1480\n\n(Purpose: To make an amendment relating to the consequences of insider \n                                trading)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 30 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1480.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CONSEQUENCES OF INSIDER TRADING.\n\n       (a) Securities Act of 1933.--Section 13A of the Securities \n     Act of 1933, as added by section 105 of this Act, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Consequences of Insider Trading.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (c), the \n     exclusion from liability provided for in subsection (a) does \n     not apply to a false or misleading forward-looking statement \n     if, in connection with the false or misleading forward-\n     looking statement, the issuer or any officer or director of \n     the issuer--\n       ``(A) purchased or sold a material amount of the equity \n     securities of the issuer (or derivatives thereof), as \n     reflected in filings with the Commission; and\n       ``(B) financially benefited from the forward-looking \n     statement.\n       ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     term `material amount' means--\n       ``(A) with respect to an issuer, equity securities of the \n     issuer of any class having a total value of not less than \n     $1,000,000; and\n       ``(B) with respect to an officer or director of an issuer, \n     holdings of that officer or director of any class of the \n     equity securities of the issuer having a total value of not \n     less than $50,000.''.\n       (b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934.--Section 37 of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by section 105 of \n     this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(h) Consequences of Insider Trading.--\n       ``(1) Consequences of insider trading.--Notwithstanding \n     subsection (c), the exclusion from liability provided for in \n     subsection (a) does not apply to a false or misleading \n     forward-looking statement if, in connection with the false or \n     misleading forward-looking statement, the issuer or any \n     officer or director of the issuer--\n       ``(A) purchased or sold a material amount of the equity \n     securities of the issuer (or derivatives thereof), as \n     reflected in filings with the Commission; and\n       ``(B) financially benefited from the forward-looking \n     statement.\n       ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     term `material amount' means--\n       ``(A) with respect to an issuer, $1,000,000 worth of any \n     class of the equity securities of the issuer; and\n       ``(B) with respect to an officer or director of an issuer, \n     $50,000 worth of the holdings of that person of any class of \n     the equity securities of the issuer.''.\n     Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, simply put, my amendment says that insider \ntraders who financially benefit from false or misleading forward-\nlooking statements shall not benefit from the safe harbor in S. 240. It \ncould not be more direct. I am very hopeful colleagues will support me \non this.\n  It is very clear that 48 colleagues are unhappy with the safe harbor \nas it is in S. 240. All we are doing here is saying, ``Well, you didn't \nchange it, so at least let us not allow insiders who financially \nbenefit in connection with a false and misleading statement they issue \nto get the benefit of the safe harbor.''\n  S. 240 has a safe harbor provision which basically gives insiders \nhuge protection for false forward-looking statements, all statements, \nexcept those involving intentional fraud. In other words, there is a \nsafe harbor for reckless fraud, knowing fraud and purposeful fraud. Let \nme repeat that. The S. 240 safe harbor provision, which gives insiders \nimmunity for false forward-looking statements, involves reckless fraud, \nknowing fraud and purposeful fraud.\n  Senator Sarbanes tried to change that standard. He offered two \namendments. Those two amendments failed, although I would say the \nsecond one got 48 votes from both sides of the aisle. Obviously, people \nare troubled by the safe harbor which my friend from Maryland calls a \npirate's cove. I call it a deep ocean--a deep ocean.\n  In the Boxer amendment, the insider trading has to appear on the \nrecords of the SEC, so it is no guesswork. You know that insider made \nhis insider trades because it is registered with the SEC, and it would \nhave to involve significant insiders--the company itself or its \nofficers or directors. So it is very narrowly drawn.\n  Under my amendment, the insider trading would have to involve \nsignificant sums; in the case of a company, a million dollars in \ninsider trading or more; in the case of an officer or director, insider \ntrading would have to involve $50,000 or more.\n  Let us be clear, the Boxer amendment only covers those trading on \ninside information who also issue false forward-looking statements in \nconnection with that insider trading and who financially benefit from \nthat trading.\n  Make no mistake, unsuspecting investors are harmed quite directly by \nfalse or misleading forward-looking statements made in connection with \ninsider trades. Why is that? Because small investors believe the \nstatement. Buy the stock, push up the price, the insider then sells his \nstock at the higher price, pockets the profit, because of a false and \nmisleading statement. The stock collapses. When the true news hits, the \nsmall investors are left holding losses.\n  I am going to show a chart which I showed last week, the Crazy Eddie \nstory. Crazy Eddie was a business. This is real. This is not a figment \nof anyone's imagination. Let us hear what Crazy Eddie said. This is a \nforward-looking statement:\n  ``We are confident that our market penetration can grow \nappreciably.''\n  ``Growing evidence of consumer acceptance of the Crazy Eddie name \naugurs well for continuing growth outside of New York.''\n  Crazy Eddie dumps his stock, the top officer flees the country with \nmillions, the CEO is convicted of fraud, and to any of my colleagues \nwho say there is another provision that covers insider trading, that is \nonly for the stockholders who actually bought Crazy Eddie's stock. It \ndoes not cover the class of other people who suffer because the stock \nplummeted. I think that is an important point, because every time I \nraise an amendment, the opposition stands up and says this is covered \nin another section. Wrong. Not for the class of shareholders, only the \nones who buy Crazy Eddie's stock.\n  If he sells a million dollars worth of stock, those people who bought \nit, yes, they can pursue under another provision of law. The other $2 \nmillion worth of stock bought by the general public have very little \nchance here.\n  Let us go to the next chart.\n  T2 Medical, Inc. Here is another business. Take a look at this one's \nforward-looking statements. My colleagues want to encourage forward-\nlooking statements. So do I, but not false ones. I want to encourage \nhonest ones. Does that mean that some businesses may make a mistake? \nThey may make a mistake, a true mistake. But look at these guys:\n  ``T2 plans to lead the way through the 1990's.''\n  ``We expect continued steady revenue and earnings growth.''\n  Just at the time of those statements, look what happens: The stock \ngoes up; insiders sell 571,000 shares for 31 million bucks; the Wall \nStreet Journal reports insurers reducing their payments by 15 to 50 \npercent; the stock plunges; then the company discloses a grand jury \ninvestigation; total insider sales of $31.6 million.\n  And look at the story here. Now the people at T2 Medical would get \nthe safe harbor for forward-looking statements, the very same safe \nharbor that Senator Sarbanes tried to tighten up. They would get the \nprotection of that safe harbor.\n  It is an invitation to fraud. It is exactly what Chairman Levitt of \nthe SEC \n\n[[Page S 9157]]\nsaid would happen. He does not like the safe harbor. He said if you do \nthis, by God, you crook, you cannot hide under that safe harbor. I hope \nmy colleagues will embrace this amendment.\n  Look at this, it tells the story, I say to my friend. The statement \nis made:\n  ``T2 plans to lead the way through the 1990's.''\n  ``We expect continued steady revenue and earnings growth.''\n  The stock goes up, insiders sell, and the truth comes out. They \ndisclose the grand jury investigation and bye, bye, baby, for all those \npoor snooks who bought it.\n  This individual and these insiders do not deserve the safe harbor in \nS. 240. If Senator Sarbanes had been successful at changing the safe \nharbor, I would feel a lot better and I would not have offered this \namendment.\n I told that to my friend. But we have the pirate's cove. Here are the \npirates--Crazy Eddie and these people. These are just two examples. And \nfor those who said Charles Keating never made forward-looking \nstatements, I have a chart on that, too. So Crazy Eddie's top officer \nfled the country. The CEO was convicted of fraud. Investors were left \nwith huge losses. That is the type of misbehavior this bill would \nencourage and reward. Why? It is not that anybody who writes this bill \nwants to help guys like this. But as a result of the safe harbor, these \nguys get the benefits. We say that they should not.\n\n  Now, I do not think we want to encourage this. These are not isolated \nexamples. There is a great deal of insider trading. Am I picking out \ntwo examples because I am exaggerating here? No; let me show you where \nwe are with insider trading. This is a story from Business Week, \nDecember 1994. ``Insider Trading: It's Back, But With a New Cast of \nCharacters.'' They looked at 100 of the largest businesses, by the way, \nand found that one out of every three merger deals was proceeded by \nstock price runups.\n  Here is one from the Los Angeles Times. I want to say to my friends \nthat this is a story from Saturday, June 24, 1995. I opened the paper \nwhen I was in L.A., and there it was. ``Insider Trading Probes Make a \nComeback. Wall Street. SEC official notes more investigations than at \nany time since the takeover boom of the 1980's.''\n  What are we doing? We are giving these people a safe harbor. I do not \nthink this is in the best interest of the country. How about reading \nthis a little bit:\n\n       A wave of mergers and acquisitions in the United States is \n     reviving an unwanted headache for regulators: Insider \n     trading.\n       ``We have more insider trading investigations now than at \n     any time since the takeover boom of the 1980's,'' said Thomas \n     Newkirk, associate director of enforcement for the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission.\n\n  No wonder the SEC has trouble with the safe harbor in this bill. \nThese are the guys who have to go after these crooks. They do not want \nto make it harder to catch them.\n  I will put all of these in the Record at the appropriate time.\n  Now, here is a quote from Gene Marcial, a Business Week ``Inside Wall \nStreet'' columnist. This is his book.\n\n       Don't kid yourself: Very little has changed on Wall Street. \n     Half a dozen years after the scandals of the 1980's, when any \n     number of street veterans were charged with violations of \n     securities laws and several high profile insiders were \n     marched off to jail, insider trading and market \n     manipulation--in most cases illegal--are still the most \n     zealously desired play in the financial world.\n\n  He concludes and basically says, ``Sorry, but that's the way the game \nis played.''\n  Now, look, if the game is played that way, we should try to stop it. \nWe should not make it easier.\n  Let us go to the next chart. Here is another one. New York Times, \nJune 1995.\n\n       Regulatory Alarms Ring on Wall Street. With the frenzy of \n     merger deals and takeover battles these days, it seems like \n     old times on Wall Street in more ways than one. Securities \n     regulators say they are opening investigations into insider \n     trading at a rate not seen since the mid-1980's, the era in \n     which Ivan Boesky, who went to jail for trading on inside \n     information, became a household name.\n\n  They go on to say that it is a growth industry. We are going to give \ninsider traders a safe harbor. They do not deserve it. I am worried \nabout the good business people. I represent a lot of them and I am \nproud of them. They would not cheat anyone. They deserve to be \nsupported, and they do not deserve frivolous lawsuits. This is about \nthe bad guys.\n  So let us, in good faith, say we did not change the safe harbor, but \nlet us make sure that the worst of the worst, these inside players who \nissue a false or misleading statement and then sell their stock and \nbenefit, do not get the benefit of the safe harbor.\n  I say, if we do not do this, the incentives for insider trading and \ncashing in will be greater because, clearly, there is a nice, safe \nharbor for these people to hide in. I hope anyone who supports this \nbill would not want to encourage insider trading.\n  Again, my amendment focuses narrowly on only one type of notorious \nfraud, insider trading in conjunction with false or misleading forward-\nlooking statements, and they have to increase the insider trader's \nprofit. That is the only way they do not get the safe harbor. It has to \nbe a false or misleading statement made in conjunction with their sale, \nand they have to make a profit. So we are not opening up a loophole for \nanybody good. We are closing a loophole for the bad. And that is very \nclear.\n  My friend from Connecticut--and he is my friend and we go back and \nforth on this bill--has said many times that confidence of the \ninvestors is the most important thing. I have news. You just wait. If \nwe do not fix this bill and this safe harbor provision goes forward, \nand we do not at least take this Boxer amendment, when we have the \nfirst crisis in the marketplace, when a group of investors like those \nburned by Keating or any of the others, when they come to Washington \nand stand on the steps of the Capitol and say, ``What have you done? \nYou are giving these people a safe harbor. Where is my safe harbor? Why \ncan I not collect from these crooks?'' You know, that is when \nconfidence in the investing public will plummet.\n  I tell you, with what I know about this bill--and my colleague said \nsome claims would work. I worked on Wall Street at Hemphill, Noyes, & \nCo., Zuckerman & Smith, and J.R. Williston & Beane. I was proud of \nthose days. I was one of the few women who had the license, passed the \nexam, was a registered representative. I had a very small--but \nimportant to me--practice. You can call it a practice. I had clients. \nThey trusted me, and I will tell you, if I was in that business today, \nhonestly knowing what I know about this bill and the fact that we did \nnot pass the amendment offered by my friend from Maryland, I would \nreally tell people to be very wary and to be very careful. I really \nwould.\n  The small investor, the IRA owner, the 401(k) owner, is increasingly \ncoming to believe there are two games in town, two securities markets, \none for the insiders and one for the little investors. The small \ninvestor is increasingly coming to fear that little investors are being \nplayed for suckers. Gary Lynch, who oversaw the Securities and Exchange \nCommission's investigation of Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine, and Michael \nMilken is quoted as saying, ``What is happening now is exactly what \neveryone predicted in the 1980's, that as memories dulled, insider \ntrading would pick up again. The temptation would be too great.''\n  That is what this bill does--temptation in the form of a safe harbor, \nwhich my friend from Maryland calls the pirate's cove and I call an \nocean. Insiders could well have a field day if this bill passes in its \ncurrent form.\n  I talked about the loss of faith that people would feel, and I say \nthat very seriously. We may not see securities markets as we know them \ntoday. They may not be the envy of the world, the engine of economic \nopportunity for ordinary Americans, because they will be rigged against \nthe honest investor, who will stay out of the securities marketplace.\n  Now the bill supporters want to stop strike suits. So do I. They want \nto stop frivolous lawsuits. So do I. I have to say, I do not think \nanyone that backs S. 240 wants to help insiders who would issue a false \nand misleading statement, and pocket the stock. I know they do not.\n  I hope they look at this legislation with an open mind. I think it is \nvery narrowly focused. It is crafted for the sole purpose of making \nsure the bill \n\n[[Page S 9158]]\ndoes not shield and encourage insider trading. I think it is quite \nclear.\n  Let me say I do have a Charles Keating chart, and I want to just say \nsome of the things that Charles Keating said in terms of his forward \nlooking statements: ``Future prospects are outstanding.'' That's what \nhe said. He tried to get people to buy the junk bonds. He said, ``We \noffer significant profit potential over the next 5 years.'' That is \nforward looking. ``Completion and sale of projects will generate huge \ngains.'' Thousands bought and lost money.\n  Senator Bryan showed a chart. He showed what the impact would be if \nwe adopt S. 240 the way it came to the floor. It would hurt those \npeople.\n  I just want to say, and I will retain the balance of my time, we are \nvery clear in what we are trying to do with S. 240. We are trying to \nmake it a better bill.\n  Believe me, it would be easier for the ranking member and those \nmembers on the committee who had trouble with this bill to fold up our \ntents, because in this committee we could hardly get but a couple of \nvotes.\n  We believed enough in these amendments that we are offering that we \ndecided to take to the floor and try to explain them to our colleagues. \nAs others have said, it is difficult to do that. It is a technical area \nof the law.\n  The bottom line is we do not want to give the Crazy Eddies--those who \nwould make a false statement--a safe harbor, and then turn around when \nthey make their money, the facts come out, the investors are left \nholding the bag. Why should those people get a safe harbor, I say to my \nfriends.\n  I hope you will endorse the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na New York Times article and a Los Angeles Times article.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 9, 1995]\n\n                 Regulatory Alarms Ring on Wall Street\n\n                           (By Susan Antilla)\n\n       With the frenzy of merger deals and takeover battles these \n     days, it seems like old times on Wall Street in more ways \n     than one. Securities regulators say they are opening \n     investigations into insider trading at a rate not seen since \n     the mid 1980's, the era in which Ivan Boesky, who went to \n     jail for trading on inside information, became a household \n     name.\n       Regulatory alarm bells went off again earlier this week \n     after I.B.M. disclosed its hostile $60-a-share offer for the \n     Lotus Development Corporation. That bid pushed up the value \n     of Lotus shares by 89 percent on Monday, the day it was \n     announced, and caused regulators to begin looking into \n     suspicious trading last week.\n       Other cases brought to light recently involved Lockheed's \n     merger last year with Martin Marietta, another military \n     contractor, and AT's acquisition of the NCR Corporation.\n       ``It's a growth industry,'' said William McLucas, director \n     of the division of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission.``In terms of raw numbers, we have as many cases \n     as we've had since the 1980's, when we were in the heyday of \n     mergers and acquisition activity.''\n       Through the end of May, the National Association of \n     Securities Dealers, which overseas the Nasdaq electronic \n     trading market, had already referred 47 cases to the S.E.C. \n     for investigation into possible insider trading, said James \n     Cangiano, N.A.S.D.'s senior vice president for surveillance. \n     If the pace of suspect trading continues at that rate, it \n     would mean the N.A.S.D. would surpass the record 110 insider \n     trading referrals it made to the S.E.C. in 1987, he added.\n       The same holds true for the New York Stock Exchange, where \n     investigators have opened three times as many insider trading \n     cases so far this year as they had by this date in 1994.\n       The Lotus case seems typical. In the days before the I.B.M. \n     announcement, trading in both Lotus stock on Nasdaq and Lotus \n     options, which are traded on the American Stock Exchange, was \n     unusually heavy. ``I think you can presume we are looking at \n     it,'' Mr. Cangiano said. And\n      while the S.E.C. does not comment on pending investigations, \n     Wall Street professionals say that the agency has \n     undoubtedly already opened a case to investigate Lotus \n     trading.\n       These days, those trading on insider information apparently \n     do not come as frequently from the ranks of Wall Street's \n     professionals as they did in the 1980's, regulators say. \n     Those who take advantage of privileged information now tend \n     to be corporate officers, directors, and their families, \n     friends and lovers, according to executives at the nation's \n     stock exchanges, and lawyers who represent defendants.\n       But the game--and the potential profits--are the same: get \n     information about a proposed deal that might raise the shares \n     of a publicly traded company before it is announced, and buy \n     the stock ahead of the news. Better yet, buy the options, \n     which cost less and tend to attract less regulatory scrutiny.\n       Then, after the public learns what the insiders knew ahead \n     of time, it's time to get out with a quick profit.\n       The lure of profits from insider information regarding \n     deals is just too much to resist for some players, the \n     S.E.C.'s Mr. McLucas said. The potential rewards compared \n     with the risks look better ``when people look at the premiums \n     available in takeovers,'' he said. ``We're a few years \n     removed from the Boesky insider trading cases, and people \n     have short memories.'' Of the 1,400 unresolved cases in the \n     S.E.C.'s current inventory, Mr. McLucas said, 20 percent \n     involve insider trading.\n       The initial rounds of suspect trading of the last year or \n     so differed from those of the 1980's in that they generally \n     did not focus on big names in the securities business. \n     ``While Wall Street learned some lessons of the 1980's, it's \n     not completely clear that Main Street learned all of the \n     lessons,'' said Harvey Pitt, the former S.E.C. lawyer who \n     defended Mr. Boesky.\n       If Wall Street appears to be more honest, though, it is \n     largely a function of increased surveillance by brokerage \n     firms and by regulators, say defense lawyers and securities \n     cops. ``We have not returned to the environment of the 1980's \n     where so many defendants were investment bankers, brokerage \n     firm employees and young lawyers,'' Mr. McLucas said. Still, \n     he added, ``We're seeing people in those areas start to crop \n     up, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more of them.''\n       Earlier this week, Frederick A. Moran, a money manager in \n     Greenwich, Conn., said that he was the focus of an S.E.C. \n     investigation. Regulators contend that he bought shares of \n     Tele-Communications Inc., the big cable operator, in advance \n     of the announcement that it planned to merge with Bell \n     Atlantic. The S.E.C. is looking at Mr. Moran's purchases \n     because his son is a securities analyst who was privy to \n     information about the pending deal. Mr. Moran has said he \n     will fight the charges.\n       Despite the higher numbers, regulators undoubtedly miss \n     cases both big and small. But, in this newest round of \n     insider trading investigations, it appears that the chances \n     of being caught are higher than before. At the New York Stock \n     Exchange, 100 employees work in market surveillance today, up \n     from 76 in 1975. And white-collar criminals who are members \n     of the Big Board face stiffer fines if they get caught. In \n     1988, the New York exchange removed the previous limit of \n     $25,000 for each charge against a member, eliminating any cap \n     on potential fines. At the same time, Congress enacted the \n     Insider Trading Sanctions Act, which allows for triple \n     damages to be paid when a trader is convicted on insider \n     charges.\n       Moreover, the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board \n     Options Exchange, which routinely share information with each \n     other and with the S.E.C. about suspect action in the \n     markets, have beefed up their detection mechanisms \n     substantially.\n       ``When I first came her in 1981, the analysts drew \n     genealogical trees of corporate officers and investment \n     bankers and hung them on the wall'' to analyze who had \n     privileged information about a pending deal, said Agnes \n     Gautier, a vice president in the Big Board's market \n     surveillance department. Today, by contrast, computer \n     software programs spit out the dates, times and names behind \n     the trades that look suspicious, she said, making what used \n     to be an onerous task a fairly simple exercise.\n       Thus, the S.E.C. was able to quickly investigate and settle \n     a case against a lawyer for Lockheed only eight months after \n     the news that the military contractor and Martin Marietta \n     would merge. The lawyer made $42,000 in illegal profits by \n     buying Lockheed options, Mr. McLucas recalled.\n       Considering all this renewed attention to insider trading, \n     shouldn't more people be wary of breaking the rules? ``We'd \n     like to think so,'' Ms. Gautier said. ``But, I guess, as the \n     defense lawyers say, `Greed will overcome.' ''\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1995]\n\n                Insider-Trading Probes Makes a Comeback\n\n\n wall street: sec official notes more investigations than at any time \n                 since the takeover boom of the 1980's\n\n       New York.--A wave of mergers and acquisitions in the United \n     States is reviving an unwanted headache for regulators: \n     insider trading.\n       ``We have more insider-trading investigations now than at \n     any time since the takeover boom in the 1980s,'' said Thomas \n     Newkirk, associate director of enforcement for the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission.\n       Several of this year's largest merger announcements have \n     been preceded by unusual trading Thursday, shares of Scott \n     Paper Co. jumped $2.50 to $46.875. Friday morning, the Wall \n     Street Journal reported that Kimberly-Clark Corp. was \n     negotiating to buy the company.\n       During the merger bonanza of the 1980s, insider trading was \n     equated with greed on Wall Street as prosecutors won \n     convictions against Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken and others. \n     The alleged culprits of the 1990s tend to be more ordinary \n     working folk.\n       In February, the SEC charged 17 people with civil \n     violations of insider-trading laws \n\n[[Page S 9159]]\n     related to trading in shares of AT Corp. acquisition targets, \n     including NCR Corp. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. \n     Two were former AT employees. Charles Brumfield, former \n     vice president in the human resources department, pleaded \n     guilty in connection with the case.\n       Earlier this month, the SEC sued a Salomon Bros. Inc. \n     analyst, Frederick Moran, and his father, a\n      money manager in Greenwich Conn., for alleged insider \n     trading in the failed merger of Tele-Communications Inc., \n     the nation's largest cable systems operator, and Bell \n     Atlantic Corp.\n       ``We brought 45 cases in the last fiscal year and the \n     caseload is running about the same this year,'' the SEC's \n     Newkirk said.\n       Opportuunities are increasing for people to use advance \n     knowledge of a merger to make illegal profits. About $178 \n     billion in mergers have been announced since the beginning of \n     the year, putting 1995 on course to exceed last year's $368 \n     billion, according to Securities Data Co.\n       Regulators say they are looking at such transactions for \n     any sign of trading picking up before the agreements were \n     announced. That was the case for shares of Telular Corp., \n     which said June 22 that it might seek a buyer for the \n     company, and for Lotus Development Corp., which agreed to be \n     bought by International Business Machines Corps.\n       On June 20, just before a New York state agency proposed a \n     buy-out of Long Island Lighting Co. for $17.50 a share, the \n     utility's stock jumped $1.50 to a seven-month high of $17.\n       One person who isn't surprised by the recent rise in \n     insider-trading cases in Gary Lynch, who as chief of \n     enforcement at the SEC during the 1980s was one of the main \n     people responsible for bringing about the convictions of \n     Boesky and Milken.\n       ``What's happening now is exactly what everyone predicted \n     back in the '80s: that with the number of high-profile cases \n     brought, the incidence of insider trading would decline for a \n     while, but as memories dulled, insider trading would pick up \n     again,'' said Lynch. ``The temptation is too great for people \n     to resist.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield such time as he desires to my friend from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes and 41 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will be very brief so the Senator can reserve the \nbalance of her time.\n  I want to say the distinguished Senator from California has made a \nvery strong, effective statement on behalf of her amendment.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that there are people who--corporate \ninsiders--who would sometimes make fraudulent forward-looking \nstatements, to run up the stock price so they can unload their stock \nprice before it goes down? Is that not exactly what has been happening?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly. And we showed the same in two examples. Here is \none of the charts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could we see the other chart? That is Crazy Eddie's. \nThe other chart, as I understand it, the Senator shows on the left \nwhere we begin, making the statements. That runs their stock price up. \nThen they start unloading their stock, having done that.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What happens further along there? They get news, then \nrevealed, that the insurance for this medical company is falling off, \nis that it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. The clients say they are reducing their \npayments to the T2 Medical Inc. by 15 to 50 percent, and the company \nhere discloses a grand jury investigation which they knew.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What happens further along?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It goes on down list.\n  They have unloaded at this point, $31 million or 571,000 shares of \nthe stock at the high price, and now as this bad news comes out, we see \nthe stock plummet, and essentially, the company here reports the SEC is \ninvestigating them.\n  That is as far as this chart goes. They are under investigation. \nThese were bad apples. People got snookered in as this stock went up, \nleft holding the bag as it goes down. Insiders knew all of this.\n  And we are saying they should not have the ability to get the safe \nharbor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to commend the Senator for offering this \namendment, for her very clear explanation of it.\n  I want to underscore one other point the Senator had which I think is \nextremely important. Members have taken the floor in the sense of a \nconstructive way, trying to propose and get adopted amendments which we \nthink should straighten out some of the problems with this legislation.\n  In fact, I am prepared to say if all of the amendments had been \nadopted I would have been prepared to be supportive of this \nlegislation.\n  But what is happening here is that the bill contains provisions that \nare far in excess of dealing with frivolous suits. The provisions in \nthis bill are going to cut off meritorious suits, and they will make \nhonest, legitimate investors suffer as a consequence, as the Senator \nhas so carefully outlined. I simply want to thank the Senator for her \nvery strong statement.\n  Mr. President, we have had difficulty with respect to these \namendments, although we have come increasingly close on some of these \namendments. I think that is reflecting a growing sense within this body \nthat there is something amiss with this legislation.\n  All is not right with this legislation. I think that is increasingly \nbecoming clear. There has been an effort to portray it by the \nproponents in terms of the competing economic interests. So they engage \nin long denunciations in that regard.\n  The fact is, every, as it were, independent observer or outside \ngroup, has sounded warning bells about this legislation. Members need \nto understand that. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association, the Government Finance \nOfficers Association.\n  The distinguished Senator from California put into the Record a long \nlist of organizations that had difficulty with this legislation. We \nwere sounding the warnings about this legislation. The consumer groups \nall have joined in doing that.\n  I hope, as Members approach the end of the amendment process and \nconsider the bill itself, they will come to realize that the burden of \nthe consequences are going to fall on the supporters. If this \nlegislation passes, those voting to support it will bear the heavy \nburden in terms of what the consequences are going to be.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that honest people will end up being \ndefrauded and not have a remedy as a consequence of this legislation. \nThe regulators have warned Members of that fact. Groups that have no \nvested economic interest in this legislation have warned Members of \nthat fact. I just want to sound that warning to my colleagues.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom California for being so gracious and so accommodating in \nattempting to go forward in a manner--and I know she was not feeling up \nto par. Although she has made a brilliant case, and has presented her \ncase with the eloquence of someone who believes in what they are \nsaying, and she does believe very strongly, I am forced to oppose this \namendment.\n  Let me say, this is not easy to oppose.\n   Let me explain why I oppose this amendment, because this is a very \ncomplex issue. The fact of the matter is that insider trading is not \ngiven safe harbor protection and is absolutely covered and will \ncontinue to be covered by section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 of the \nsecurities laws. It prohibits the kind of fraudulent conduct that we \nconsider to be insider trading. Fraudulent conduct and insider trading? \nThe conduct that Senator Boxer seeks to prohibit is already prohibited \nin the securities law.\n\n  Let me tell you what the consequences this amendment would be. They \nwould be devastating. For example, somebody who routinely takes stock \noptions--officers, directors in the company--would lose safe harbor \nprotection. This amendment would bring us back to the situation that \nlawyers could simply allege fraud to bring a lawsuit. This amendment \nopens the door for the same kinds of operations that this legislation \nseeks to stop. That is why I must oppose this bill, notwithstanding the \nfact this amendment seems to indicate that it prohibits insider \ntrading. This amendment does not do that.\n  What this amendment does is strip away, the opportunity for someone \nto make a forward looking statement that might at some point in time \nprove to be inaccurate. Why should a firm have the door to litigation \nopened just because an executive engaged in any trades or exercised an \noptions and made $50,000? \n\n[[Page S 9160]]\n\n  Tell me, if someone engages in legal insider trading should they be \ntarred and feathered? Should they be sued? However, should you have a \nright of action against illegal insider trading as prohibited by rule \n10b-5? Absolutely. And that right of action does exist.\n  So I have to oppose the amendment. But again I commend my colleague \nfor coming forward and certainly for the manner in which she has made \nthis presentation tonight, in an attempt to accommodate so many of our \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to wait until my colleague from \nCalifornia is back at her desk, because I have some questions that the \namendment raises, that I would legitimately like to get some answers \nto. I am trying to understand the implications of the amendment.\n  On page 2 of the amendment, as I read this, now--part of the \ndifficulty is under the previous amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, who controls the \ntime?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Senator Dodd is speaking on the time of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the difficulties is trying to read \nand understand. The previous amendment, offered by the Senator from \nFlorida, was a 12-page amendment. Trying to read through it and \nunderstand the implications in the space of a short amount of time is \ndifficult.\n  Let me come to page 2 of this amendment. Starting on the bottom of \npage 1.\n\n       Notwithstanding subsection (c), the exclusion from \n     liability provided for in subsection (a) does not apply to a \n     false or misleading forward-looking statement if, in \n     connection with the false or misleading forward-looking \n     statement, the issuer or any officer or director of the \n     issuer--\n       (A) purchased or sold . . .\n\n  And so forth.\n  My concern is this, and correct me if I am wrong. It seems to me you \nwould be confronted with a factual situation where you have a director \nwho had nothing to do with the problems associated with the Crazy Eddie \ncase or whatever else. I heard my colleague, and I agreed with her, \ngive eloquent statements on the importance of stock options. It was on \nan issue not too many months ago involving the value of stock options. \nShe talked about what a valuable tool this can be.\n  The mere action on the part of a director to either purchase or sell \na stock that may or may not--let us assume did not have anything to do \nwith what an officer of the company was doing regarding statements. Am \nI correct in assuming that director, then, if in fact you are able to \nprove the first point, assuming they met the other qualifications of \n$50,000, would be penalized under your amendment, were it to be \nenacted?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, we indicate in the amendment who \ninsiders are. It is pretty boilerplate. Yes, it covers insiders, people \nwho would have inside information. But only, and I underscore only, if \nin conjunction with the false or misleading statement they sold stock \nand made a profit, they would be covered.\n  Mr. DODD. What about the directors themselves? Not an officer, the \ndirector. Directors--one of the compensations for directors is we offer \nthem stock options.\n  The members of the board of directors did not have anything to do \nwith this; the officers of the companies did. Let us assume that is the \nsituation, assuming everything else is the case and that director, who \nhad no involvement whatsoever with the insider false statements, as I \nread this, that innocent director who then sold or bought stock \ninnocently, outside of whatever else the officers may be doing, would \nthen be subject to the penalties of this?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right. I say to my friend, we are using a pretty \nboilerplate definition of what an insider is. The insider is the \ncompany itself or any officer or director. But only if they sold their \nsecurities in connection with a false and misleading statement, we do \nnot give them the safe harbor. We did not go out of our way to reach \nthem. We are just saying you have to be an officer or director----\n  Mr. DODD. Even though the director had nothing to do with the false \nand misleading statements? We all know how important stock options are, \nand so forth. I want to know the implications.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All it says is they cannot benefit from the safe harbor \nand the lawsuit can go forward. If, in the course of the lawsuit, it \nturns out that this director is senile and did not know anything about \nit, or whatever the defense is, that is different. But we are saying as \nreasonable people that insiders--and we define that as the company, any \nofficer or director.\n  I have to tell my colleague, if my friend from Connecticut does not \nview that as a fair definition of an insider, I want to know what is--\nsomeone who sits on the board of directors, someone who knows all the \ngood news and bad news.\n  All we are saying is the case will have to go forward. But in fact, \nif there is insider trading in connection with a false or misleading \nstatement, they do not get the safe harbor and the case goes forward. \nDoes it mean they are convicted? Of course not.\n  Mr. DODD. I am not trying to be argumentative here.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am trying to answer my friend's questions. I am not \nbeing argumentative. I am being strong in my response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, I will advise the \nSenators they may speak in third person through the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to propound a unanimous-\nconsent request so we might give, to those of our colleagues who are \noff the Hill, an opportunity to get back and request that we vote up or \ndown on the Graham amendment.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the Graham amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises they have.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we be permitted \nto vote on the Graham amendment at 8 o'clock. In this way we will give \nopportunity to all our Members to get back and they would get a little \nextra notice. That would not interfere with any of the time my \ncolleagues have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague. Do I not still have the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the time situation on the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Boxer has 13 minutes and 14 seconds; \nthe other side has 5 minutes and 41 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The time would expire at 8 o'clock under the agreement \nand then vote at 8 on the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Then maybe we might be able to dispose of the other \namendment by consent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. After the Graham amendment, the Bingaman amendment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Possibly before, or after. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from California who \nwants to make a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to my friend. Mr. President, I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I can, let me just come back. The point I \nam trying to make here, and I say this with all due respect, no one \nwants to protect insider trading--obviously insider trading is an \nabhorrent exercise and practice.\n  My concern here is that the mere exercise of an option by, for the \nsake of discussion, an innocent director--there can be innocent \ndirectors here; not the assumption that they automatically then take \naway the safe harbor for the \n\n[[Page S 9161]]\nentire company because there has been a sale or a purchase of an amount \ntriggered by the amounts indicated in the amendment itself. I \nappreciate where my colleague from California wants to get. But my \nconcern here is that she is reaching a legal conclusion about someone \nwhere the assertion has been made and the mere existence of that then \ntakes away the safe harbor protections. I think that goes farther even \nfor those who have strong reservations about safe harbor. I think that \njust strips away unnecessarily. That is just drawing a legal conclusion \ntriggering a whole response to a safe harbor provision on the mere \nassumption that someone has engaged in an illegal activity.\n  As I read the amendment, that is how I see it being triggered. When \nyou talk about any officer or any director who purchased or sold a \nmaterial amount of equities and who financially benefited from the \nforward-looking statement in it, that is, to me, trying to put too much \nin this with a lot of assumptions made that I do not think are \nnecessarily borne out by the actions. To assume there is inherently \nsomething illegal, that it is an assumption of an illegal act for \nsomeone to exercise an option, and that action becomes a presumption of \nguilt in this context, then stripping away safe harbor, I think, goes \ntoo far. That is how I read it and understand it.\n  I am going to yield the floor in a minute and give my colleague from \nCalifornia an opportunity to respond to how I read this. But that is my \nconcern here. I think it is taking an abhorrent activity of insider \ntrading and then using that vehicle as a way to try to jam it into the \nissue of the safe harbor.\n  My colleague from California and others have real problems with safe \nharbor. I understand that. But it seems to me that again we are taking \na set of actions where there is not necessarily anything wrong with \nthem, making a presumption about that, and then taking that activity \nand immediately stripping away the veil that protects the statements \nmade in the forward-looking statements that are made in the context of \npredictions by companies, their direction, and thus triggered the safe \nharbor provisions. I for the life of me do not understand why we want \nto necessarily do that when I do not think those actions necessarily \nshould trigger that kind of response.\n  So for those reasons, I object to the amendment. Again, I appreciate, \nI think, the direction they want to go in, but it seems to me to be \noverreaching in terms of how you deal with safe harbor. With that, I \ngive my colleague a chance to respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my friend, to say that I am overreaching \nin this amendment could not be farther off the mark, I have made this \nso narrow in scope. I have said, if Senator Sarbanes' safe harbor \nprovisions had passed, I would not have gone with this. But what I am \nsaying is, why should we give such a good, nice, warm, and cozy safe \nharbor to crooks? It does not mean automatically that anyone is guilty \nof anything, I say to my friend. All we are saying is this is about \ngetting a case brought forward and move forward. All we are saying is \nif an insider--I defy my friends, seriously, I do not understand how I \ncould have been more fair in defining who an insider is other than to \nsay the company, an officer or director. I did not say the secretary or \nanybody else. I am just hitting the top people. If they sell securities \nin connection with a false or misleading forward-looking statement--\nwhen my friend read my amendment, he left out the words ``false or \nmisleading,''--then all we are saying is they do not get the benefit of \nthe safe harbor. The case moves forward quicker. If they are innocent, \nthis will take care of it.\n  My goodness. Let us not make small investors leap through hurdles \nwhen you have a situation such as this where clearly the insiders--by \nthe way, there were a lot of insiders here: $31 million worth of stock. \nI do not think that the small investor who got caught in this downward \nplummet should have to leap through all sorts of hoops to get into \ncourt in this case.\n  I hope my friends who support S. 240 will support this. I think we \ndrew it narrowly. I think we are fair. I just hope that we can get a \ngood vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California, \nthe Senator from Connecticut says we are for it. If I could say, I am \nfor legitimate safe harbor, I am not for excessive or overreaching safe \nharbor. That is what the whole debate has been about today.\n  I thought that the safe harbor issue should have been sent to the SEC \nthe way the Senator from Connecticut proposed in his bill and that the \nSEC could then develop the safe harbor, taking into account all of \nthese complications.\n  This body decided not to do that. So we then tried to have a \ndifferent standard governing safe harbor. Again, the regulators are \ntelling us that the standard in this bill is going to permit abuse. \nUnder the standard in this bill, there will be abuses. The Senator from \nCalifornia is offering yet an even more limited amendment addressed to \nthe insider traders. She has demonstrated in very graphic form the kind \nof practices that took place in two instances which she is trying to \npreclude and she has offered a remedy. For the life of me, I do not \nunderstand why this amendment is being resisted.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for the purpose of a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is on the time of the Senator from California.\n  Mr. DODD. If you told me the officer or director who made the \nmisleading statements, that would be one thing. You could have an \noutside director of a company that could live literally thousands of \nmiles away who exercises an option, and it has nothing to do with the \nmisleading statement. That is my point here. If the Senator said the \ndirector or officer makes the misleading statements, then I understand, \nI think, where the Senator is going. But I do not understand why you \ntake an outsider----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me ask my friend on my own time. It is true, the \ndirector could have been in Paris. He could have a call from someone. \n``Hey, Joe, tomorrow, the Wall Street Journal is giving us a bad \nreport.''\n  Mr. DODD. That is different though.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me finish my point. We would not know that. The \nplaintiffs do not know that. If this man or woman is totally innocent, \nwe are not taking away his or her right. We are just saying there is a \nsmoking gun if a director unloads, by the way, a large amount, a \nmaterial amount, makes a good profit, and, quess what, in conjunction \nwith a forward-looking statement or a bad report coming out in the \npaper. It is worth it, we think, to allow that case to go forward. If \nthe director is totally innocent, fine. All we are saying is they \nshould not have the safe harbor of this particular bill as the good \npeople should. And if, in fact, it turns out that they were far away, \nthey are on their honeymoon, they did not take any calls, did not know \nanything about the fact that there was going to be a false statement, \nthey are going to walk away. God, I hope we have faith.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator has triggered a whole legal activity on the \nmere financial transaction. The Senator has then triggered a whole \nlevel of activity on safe harbor merely because she is assuming \nsomething that she has not been able to prove yet. But the mere fact \nthat some director exercises an option, that then the whole safe harbor \nprocess collapses, the Senator has connected a lot of dots here on the \nbasis of some assumptions. That, to me, is exactly what we are trying \nto avoid.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If this is what the Senator is trying to avoid, then this \nis, in my view, a terrible bill. In other words, if you are trying to \navoid giving an insider a hard time if he dumps his stock and runs \nover----\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator has drawn a legal conclusion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not a bit. What we are saying is you will meet a certain \nthreshold if these facts happen to come forward, a false and misleading \nstatement in conjunction with insider sale. Look, I am not too naive \nabout these insider trades because I have seen it happen. Business Week \ndid a whole issue on insider trades. Let us bring that up. The Wall \nStreet Journal has run stories on this. Everybody is saying it is \ncoming back in vogue. That is not Barbara Boxer. Those are people who \nare experts in the field. ``Insider \n\n[[Page S 9162]]\ntrades.'' ``It's back, but with a new cast of characters.'' All we are \nsaying with this amendment, and I think this is important, all we are \nsaying is it is an insider, and we have narrowly defined that.\n  I challenge anyone to write a better definition of an insider other \nthan the company itself, the board of directors or the officers. If \nthey pocket huge amounts of money in connection with a false and \nmisleading statement, they should not benefit from the safe harbor. \nNow, the case goes forward. If they are away and they can prove it, \nfine. But we are changing the law radically here. We are going far \nbeyond anything the Senator from Connecticut proposed doing in his \noriginal bill. We have a safe harbor that has caused 48 Senators in \nthis Chamber to say we want to change it. We have a safe harbor in S. \n240 that has the SEC saying they are very worried that there will be \nincreases in fraud.\n  Now, I think as a Senator from the largest State in the Union, where \na lot of this happens--we look to the Keating people, and a lot of it \nwas California--I have an obligation to make this bill better.\n  I would far prefer to have the safe harbor that my friend from \nMaryland proposed. Instead, we have this other safe harbor that my \nfriend from Connecticut embraces. And we are saying you are opening it \nup for everybody. How about closing it for some obvious abuses.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, I am not arguing about the spirit of what the \nSenator is trying to do. And no one is here trying to defend insider \ntrading. But at this juncture, when we have tried to get directors to \nbuy stock--it is one of the things we have tried to do over the years \nin our committee, purchase stock and get involved--I would have to say \ntoday, if this amendment were adopted, the last thing you would want to \ndo is become even a purchaser. Forget a seller; the amendment says even \npurchasing stock here. You are removed from the process. All of a \nsudden you are trying to buy. My advice to anyone in that category, if \nthis amendment were to be adopted, would be to stay away from this. I \nwould stay entirely away from this. It would have absolutely the \ncountereffect as we try to get people to acquire this stock. You are \nsubjecting yourself to some very dangerous situations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me take my time because my friend is distorting what \nthis amendment does. He is distorting what this amendment does. No \nhonest director, no honest person has to fear about this amendment. \nOnly the crooks. Only the crooks. And all we are saying is this is a \nproblem. ``Insider-Trading Probes Make a Comeback,'' Saturday's edition \nof the L.A. Times.\n  I say to my friends in the Senate from both sides of the aisle, I \nthink if you vote for this Boxer amendment, you will thank those of us \nwho brought it forward because the handwriting is on the wall. They are \nsaying it is back in vogue, insider trading is back in vogue. If it \noccurs in connection with a false or misleading statement, not a true \nstatement but a false or misleading statement, we say why should we \ngive the benefit of that safe harbor to those people? Let the case be \nbrought forward. Let the officer or director make the point. But my \ngoodness, to argue against this amendment, I just am rather stunned. I \nwas hopeful that we could have an agreement on both sides. I thought we \ncould from the beginning. I was hit with all kinds of arguments the \nfirst time I brought this up: well, it is covered in another section. \nIf you bought the shares the insider sold, yes, you are covered in \nanother section.\n  What about the general public? They are not covered. And yet those \ndirectors, those officers, who pocketed that money are protected by the \nsafe harbor.\n  I have reiterated this on a number of occasions, and I do not feel \nthe need to continue at this point; my energy level is running down. \nBut I have to come back tomorrow and present this in 5 minutes. So I \nlook forward to that conclusion tomorrow, and I hope a favorable vote. \nI know that my colleagues have been hanging on my every word and \neverything I read here. I know that they are sitting in their offices, \nand they are absolutely intrigued by this debate. I hope if they did \nwatch all of it they will come down and vote yes on the Boxer amendment \ntomorrow after we reiterate this argument and get it down to 5 minutes \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from California \nshe has 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will save that time, Mr. President, in case something \nis stated here to which I feel I must retort. Otherwise, I will be \nhappy to yield back.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, do we have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining on the Senator's side of \nthe aisle is 13 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Well, Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of our time. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the spirit of comity and good will \nacross the party aisle, I will yield back my 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1479\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour is 8 o'clock. The question now is on \nagreeing to the amendment No. 1479 offered by the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Graham]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BOND (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say that if we get this unanimous \nconsent agreement, all those Members who have asked to have amendments \nconsidered will have them considered. All \n\n[[Page S 9163]]\nof the votes on those amendments will take place tomorrow, or tonight \nby voice. So what I am saying is there will be no further rollcall \nvotes. And all of the debate, with the exception of, I believe, 7 \nminutes for one Member, and the intervening times, will take place this \nevening. I am going to propound that request.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only remaining first degree amendments in \norder, other than the committee-reported substitute, that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order and that all amendments must be offered \nand debated this evening: The Biden amendment; the Bingaman amendment; \nthe D'Amato-Sarbanes managers amendment; the Boxer amendment, re: \ninsider trading; the Specter amendment, re: fraudulent intent; the \nSpecter amendment, re: rule 11B; the Specter amendment, re: stay of \ndiscovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I further ask that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness today, it stand in recess until 8:40 a.m., and at 8:45 a.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the first Specter \namendment, and that following the conclusion of that vote, there be 4 \nminutes for debate, to be equally divided on the second Specter \namendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the second \nSpecter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I further ask that following the vote on the second \nSpecter amendment, there be 4 minutes for debate, to be equally \ndivided, on the third Specter amendment, to be followed by a vote on or \nin relation to the Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I further ask that following the vote on the third \nSpecter amendment, there be 7 minutes for debate, to be divided under \nthe previous order, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nBoxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I further ask that following the disposition of the \nBoxer amendment, the committee substitute, as amended, be agreed to and \nS. 240 be advanced to third reading, and the Banking Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 1058, the House companion \nbill, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 240, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof, and H.R. 1058 be considered read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I further ask unanimous consent that at that point there \nbe 30 minutes for closing remarks, to be equally divided in the usual \nform, to be followed by a vote on H.R. 1058.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that all \nof the votes after the first vote in the voting sequence be limited to \n10 minutes each, except for final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, there will be no further rollcall votes \nthis evening, and the first vote tomorrow is at 8:45 a.m. The first \namendment to be in order will be the Biden amendment, which will be \nkept under 5 minutes. Thereafter, the Bingaman amendment will follow, \nwhich will also be limited to 5 minutes, to be followed by Senator \nSpecter's three amendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The first vote in the morning will be at 8:45. I remind \nmy colleagues, that is a vote at 8:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote will be 8:45.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so the Senator from Delaware can offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1481\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1481.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n\n     SEC.   . AMENDMENT TO RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT \n                   ORGANIZATIONS ACT.\n       Section 1964(c) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting before the period ``, except that no person may \n     rely upon conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in \n     the purchase of sale of securities to establish a violation \n     of section 1962'', provided however that this exception shall \n     not apply if any participant in the fraud is criminally \n     convicted in connection therewith, in which case the statute \n     of limitations shall start to run on the date that the \n     conviction becomes final.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been here a while. When I first got \nhere 23 years ago, I learned a lesson from Russell Long.\n  I went up to him on a Finance Committee day and asked to have an \namendment accepted, and he said yes. I proceeded to speak on it half an \nhour and say why it was a good amendment. And he said, ``I changed my \nmind. Rollcall vote.'' I lost. He came later and he said, ``When I \naccept an amendment, accept the amendment and sit down.''\n  I will take 30 seconds to explain my amendment because it is about to \nbe accepted. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for allowing me to \nmove ahead. He is always gracious to me and I appreciate it.\n  There is a carve-out in this legislation, carving out securities \nfraud from the application of the civil RICO statutes. I think that is \na bad idea. But I will not debate that issue tonight.\n  I have an amendment that is before the body that says such a carve-\nout exists, except that it shall not apply if any participant in fraud \nis criminally convicted; then RICO can apply, and the statute does not \nbegin to toll until the day of the conviction becomes final.\n  Keeping with the admonition of Russell Long, I have no further \ncomment on the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have no objection. We accept that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1481) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1482\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the application of sanctions under rule 11 of the \n   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in private securities litigation)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 1482.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 105, line 25, insert ``, or the responsive pleading \n     or motion'' after ``complaint''.\n       On page 107, line 20, insert ``, or the responsive pleading \n     or motion'' after ``complaint''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Mr. Bryan. It is a very simple amendment.\n  The present bill, as it is pending before the Senate, calls for a \nmandatory review by the court in any private action arising under the \nlegislation. It says that the court shall establish a record with \nspecific findings regarding compliance by each party, and each attorney \nrepresenting any party with the requirements of rule 11 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, prohibiting frivolous pleading or frivolous \nactivity by counsel.\n  The difficulty is that later in the bill where it specifies \npresumption, that we call for on page 105 and 107 of the bill, \n\n[[Page S 9164]]\nwe only specify that the appropriate sanction apply to pleadings filed \nby the plaintiffs.\n  Our amendment would change that and make it more balanced, in that it \nwould specify that the sanctions could apply either to pleadings filed \nby the plaintiff or to responsive pleadings or motions filed by \ndefense.\n  I think this is acceptable to the managers of the bill. I think it is \nonly reasonable that if we are going to have this provision in the \nbill--which is a provision, quite frankly, I do not agree with--I think \nthat singling out these securities cases as the only cases in our court \nsystem where we require a mandatory review by the court, and the \nfinding and imposition of specific findings, is a mistake. If we are \ngoing to have it, we should make it balanced between plaintiff and \ndefendant.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada wishes to speak. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from New \nMexico. I think his amendment is well-constructed. We have used the \nword often in the course of the debate--balanced. This is balanced. \nWhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n  Those lawyers, whether they be plaintiff's lawyers or defendant's \nlawyers who are involved in frivolous conduct, now feel the full effect \nof sanctioned rule 11 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  Much has been said about the frivolous nature of this lawsuit \ncorrection act. I must say this is one of the few amendments that \nactually deals with this issue. I am pleased to support my colleague \nand friend from New Mexico, and I am pleased that the managers have \nagreed to accept the amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1482) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer three \namendments which I think will provide some balance to the legislation \nthat is now pending before the Senate.\n  I believe that there is a need for some modification of our \nsecurities acts, but I think it has to be very, very carefully crafted.\n  As I take a look at what is occurring in the courts, compared to what \nhappens in our legislative process, I think that the very deliberative \nrule in the courts, case by case, with very, very careful analysis, has \nto take precedence over the procedures which we use in the Congress \nwhere hearings are attended, sometimes by only one or two Senators, and \nthen provisions are added in markup very late in the process. \nLegislation does not receive the kind of very thoughtful encrustation \nthat comes through common law development and interpretation of the \nsecurities acts.\n  I have represented both sides in securities litigation before coming \nto the U.S. Senate in the private practice of law. I would remind my \ncolleagues that before we proceed to make such enormous changes by this \nlegislation, we need to recall the importance of protecting investors, \nespecially small investors, small unsophisticated investors, in some \ncases, who put a substantial part of their savings, perhaps all of \ntheir life savings, into securities, and how much is involved in the \naccretion of capital through corporations, through common stock, \ncompared to what is the thrust of this legislation, really looking to \ncurb some lawsuits which should not be brought, some frivolous lawsuits \nwhich ought not to have been filed, and perhaps some of the excesses in \nthe plaintiffs' bar, as there may be excesses in any group.\n  What we are looking at is the value of shares traded in 1993 on the \nstock exchanges, the most recent year available for analysis. Mr. \nPresident, the $6.63 trillion traded on the stock exchanges in 1993 is \nmore than half of the gross national product of the United States in \n1963. The value of initial public offerings in 1993, was $57.444 \nbillion.\n  If we take a look at the comparison as to how much is spent on \nattorney's fees, according to a 1990 article in the Class Action \nReports, a review of some 334 securities class action cases decided \nbetween 1980 and 1990, a group of cases in which there was a recovery \nof $4.281 billion, only some 15.2 percent of that recovery went to fees \nand costs, a total of some $630 million.\n  In those cases, according to the court records, the attorneys for the \nplaintiffs spent 1,691,642 hours.\n  Statistics have already been presented on the floor of the Senate \nwhich show a decrease in securities litigation. I submit that it is \nvery important to be able to continue to protect investors--especially \nsmall investors--from stock fraud.\n  We know that in the crash of the Depression, 1929 and thereafter, \ntremendous savings were lost at that time. These losses gave rise to \nthe legislation in 1933 and 1934 to protect investors and the \nsecurities markets.\n  Without speaking at length on the subject, I would point to a few \ncases where there were very substantial losses to the public and in \nwhich private actions were brought to enforce the securities laws. For \nexample, the ongoing Prudential Securities litigation, with over $1 \nbillion in losses, perhaps as much as double that;\n the Michael Milken cases, where there were recoveries in the range of \n$1.3 billion, involving Drexel, Burnham & Lambert, recovered by the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the securities laws; we all \nknow the famous Charles Keating case, involving his former company, \nLincoln Savings & Loan, involving some $262 million recovered and some \n$288 million lost; the $2 billion lost in the Washington Public Power \nSupply System case--mentioning only a few.\n\n  The concern that I have on the legislation as it is currently pending \nis that there is an imbalance which will discourage this very important \nlitigation to protect the shareholders. I have supported the managers \nof the bill on a number of the amendments which have been filed, but I \nam going to submit a series of three amendments which, I submit, will \nmake the bill more balanced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1483\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for sanctions for abusive litigation)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. At this time, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1483.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 105, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 108, line 17, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 103. SANCTIONS FOR ABUSIVE LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Securities Act of 1933.--Section 20 of the Securities \n     Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77t) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) Sanctions for Abusive Litigation.--In any private \n     action arising under this title, if an abusive litigation \n     practice relating to the action is brought to the attention \n     of the court, by motion or otherwise, the court shall \n     promptly--\n       ``(1) determine whether or not to impose sanctions under \n     rule 11 or rule 26(g)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure, section 1927 of title 28, United States Code, or \n     other authority of the court; and\n       ``(2) include in the record findings of fact and \n     conclusions of law to support such determination.''.\n       (b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934.--Section 21 of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(l) Sanctions for Abusive Litigation.--In any private \n     action arising under this title, if an abusive litigation \n     practice relating to the action is brought to the attention \n     of the court, by motion or otherwise, the court shall \n     promptly--\n       ``(1) determine whether or not to impose sanctions under \n     rule 11 or rule 26(g)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure, section 1927 of title 28, United States Code, or \n     other authority of the court; and\n       ``(2) include in the record findings of fact and \n     conclusions of law to support such determination.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to leave \ndiscretion with the trial judge in place of the very onerous provisions \nof the pending \n\n[[Page S 9165]]\nbill which require a mandatory review by the court after each \nsecurities case is concluded and then a requirement that the court \nimpose sanctions on a party if the court finds that the party violated \nany requirement of rule 11(b) with the presumption being that \nattorney's fees will be awarded to the losing party.\n  I submit that this is a very harsh rule which will have a profoundly \nchilling effect on litigation brought under the securities acts, and \nwill in addition spawn an enormous amount of additional work for the \nFederal courts by causing what is called satellite litigation.\n  That means that in any case where the litigation is concluded under \nthe securities acts, the judge will be compelled, under the mandatory \nreview provision, to review all the pleadings filed in the case to \ndetermine whether rule 11 was violated, whether or not either party \nchooses to have that review made, and then will be compelled to impose \nthe sanction with the presumption being payment of attorney's fees, \nwhich is really the British system, not the United States' system, \nwhere we have had open courts. This provision risks causing a \ntremendous imbalance between plaintiffs and defendants in these cases \nbecause the defendants are characteristically major corporations with \nmuch greater resources to defend, contrasted with the plaintiffs who do \nnot have those resources, or their lawyers who bring the suits on their \nbehalf.\n  I have surveyed the Federal bench, the judges in the U.S. district \ncourts and in the courts of appeals, to see how the judges respond to \nchanges in rule 11 to take away the discretion of the trial judges and \nhave what is, in effect, micromanagement of the judiciary by the \nCongress of the United States. I have done this to try to get a sense \nas to what is going on in the courts. It has been some time since I \npracticed there.\n  I submit that the views of a few Senators, the authors of this bill \nand the Senators who are voting on this legislation, are a great deal \nmore limited than the insights of the Federal judges who preside in the \nadministration of these cases day in and day out. The procedures which \nare being followed in this legislation are not those customarily \nfollowed where the rules of civil procedure are formulated by the \nFederal courts under the Rules Enabling Act--the Supreme Court which \nhas the authority to do so, and the delegation of that authority to \ncommittees where the judges work with it all the time, and \nrepresentatives of the bar, as opposed to the Members of Congress, who \nhave very, very limited experience in this field and, in this \nparticular case, had this provision added very late in the process, \nlate in May, a few days before there was final markup of the bill in \nthe Banking Committee, which does not normally deal with issues of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  Earlier in the consideration of this bill I made an effort to have \nthese issues on procedure referred to the Judiciary Committee, on which \nI serve, which has the most experience of any committee in the \nCongress--certainly more than the Banking Committee, which has \njurisdiction over this bill--because hearings were not held and \nconsideration was not given to this rule 11 provision.\n  Among the responses which I received, some 164 responses from Federal \njudges, there was a general sense that the trial judges ought to have \nthe discretion and were in the best position to make a determination as \nto whether sanctions ought to be imposed without having a mandate from \nthe Congress, the micromanagement from the Congress, saying you must \nmake this determination. Even though the winning party did not ask for \nit, even though there are not procedures for one party to say to the \nother, ``You are undertaking something which our side considers \nfrivolous and, if you do not cease and desist, we will bring an action \nto impose sanctions,'' to have a chance to correct it.\n  A very lucid statement of the problem was made by a very \ndistinguished judge for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nJudge Edward R. Becker, who had this to say.\n\n       The mandatory sanctions are a mistake and will only \n     generate satellite litigation.\n\n  By satellite litigation, Judge Becker is referring to the situation \nwhere another lawsuit, another issue has to be litigated as to whether \na rule 11 sanction should be instituted. Again, not at the request of \nthe losing party. Judge Becker continues to this effect:\n\n       The flexibility afforded by the current regime enables \n     judges to use the threat of sanctions to manage cases \n     effectively. Well-managed cases almost never result in \n     sanctions. Moreover, the provisions for mandatory review, \n     presumably without prompting by the parties, will impose a \n     substantial burden on the courts and prove completely useless \n     in the vast majority of cases. Requiring courts to impose \n     sanctions without a motion of a party also places the judge \n     in an inquisitorial role, which is foreign to our legal \n     culture, which is based on the judge as a neutral arbiter \n     model.\n\n  A very cogent reply was made by Judge James A. Parker, of the United \nStates District Court for the District of New Mexico, who had this to \nsay:\n\n       As a member of the judiciary, I implore members of the \n     legislative branch of government to follow the Rules Enabling \n     Act procedures for amending rules of evidence and procedure \n     that the courts must apply. Congress demonstrated great \n     wisdom in passing the Rules Enabling Act which defines the \n     appropriate roles of the legislative and judicial branches of \n     government in adopting new rules or amending existing rules. \n     Those who hold the strong and sincere belief that changes \n     should be made to the current formulation of Rule 11 should \n     present their views and proposals in accordance with the \n     procedures set forth in the Rules Enabling Act.\n\n  Judge Parker further writes that ``Rule 11 * * * gives federal judges \nadequate authority to impose appropriate sanctions for conduct that \nviolates Rule 11.''\n  Mr. President, a number of the judicial comments which I am about to \nread apply to my second amendment as well. That second amendment \nrelates to a provision in the bill which requires that the court not \nallow discovery after a motion to dismiss is filed. On that particular \nline, the rule is that discovery may proceed unless the judge \neliminates discovery. Under the pending legislation, there would be no \ndiscovery as a matter of mandate unless under very extraordinary \ncircumstances, but the mandatory rule applies. And the comments of \nJudge Parker would apply to the second amendment as well, the second \namendment which I propose to bring.\n  Mr. President, the statement by Judge Bill Wilson of the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas, in a letter dated April 27, is to the same \neffect, as follows:\n\n       Federal Rule . . . 11, as it now reads, gives a judge all \n     he or she needs to handle improper conduct. And I think we \n     should all keep in mind that we can't promulgate rules good \n     enough to make a good judge out of a bad one.\n\n  On that point, Mr. President, I think it is fair and appropriate to \nnote that we have a very able Federal judiciary which can administer \njustice if left to do so with appropriate discretion.\n  Judge Prentice H. Marshall of the Northern District of Illinois said \nthis in a May 5 letter:\n\n       Rule 11 . . . gives the judge greater flexibility in the \n     imposition of sanctions; it affords the offending party the \n     opportunity to correct his or her misdeed.\n\n  A letter from Martin F. Loughlin of the District of New Hampshire, \ndated May 2 reads:\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 is working well. It \n     gives the judge adequate discretion to deal with frivolous \n     litigation and untoward conduct by attorneys.\n\n  A letter from Federal Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum from the \nSouthern District of New York, dated May 10, 1995, says in part:\n\n       I have found the general supervisory power of the court as \n     well as 28 U.S.C., Section 1927, and Rule 11 adequate sources \n     of judicial authority to discourage frivolous litigation.\n\n  A letter from Federal Judge J. Frederick Motz from the District of \nMaryland, dated May 9, 1995, referring to the mandatory rules said that \nthey are:\n\n       . . . counterproductive in that it increased judges' \n     workloads and contributed to litigation cost and delay by \n     requiring judges to impose sanctions whenever a Rule 11 \n     violation was found. Satellite litigation in which one lawyer \n     or party sought fees from another became commonplace.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       I oppose any amendment to the Rule that would make \n     imposition of sanctions mandatory.\n\n  A similar view was expressed by Judge Ilana Diamond Rovner of the \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a letter dated April 1995:\n\n\n[[Page S 9166]]\n\n       The current Rule 11 gives the District Court ample \n     discretion to address frivolous litigation.\n\n  A letter from Senior Judge Floyd R. Gibson from the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit, dated April 20, 1995:\n\n       I believe more discretion should be given to the district \n     judge in the how and when to apply the sanctions under Rule \n     11(c) on sanctions.\n\n  Similarly, Judge Avern Cohn from the Eastern District of Michigan, \ndated May 5, 1995, says, in part:\n\n       I firmly believe that Congress involves itself too deeply \n     in the procedural aspects of the litigation process.\n\n  A letter from Martin Feldman from the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nsays, in part:\n\n       I believe that giving district courts more discretion in \n     applying the Rule was good thinking.\n\n  And Judge Jimm Larry Hendren of the Western District of Arkansas, \nwrites, in part:\n\n       I am not sure the Congress needs to pass any legislation. I \n     think the courts, themselves, can handle this matter with the \n     rules already in place and their inherent powers.\n\n  And a letter from Judge Leonard I. Garth, a distinguished member of \nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, says:\n\n       In my opinion, abandoning mandatory sanctions and \n     permitting district court judges to exercise their judicial \n     discretion was a welcome measure.\n\n  A good many of these comments apply to the change in rule 11, which \nhad been mandatory from 1983 to 1993. It would apply equally well to \nthe kind of a rule which is in effect here.\n  The letter from Senior Judge William Schwarzer from San Francisco \nsays that the sanctions ought to be discretionary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters, which \nrepresent only a small sample of the responses I received supporting \ndiscretionary imposition of sanctions, appear in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement, with the exception of the letter from Judge \nBecker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now refer again to the letter from \nJudge Becker citing the draft of a rule from Circuit Judge Patrick \nHigginbotham, who is chairman of the Judicial Conference Advisory \nCommittee on Civil Rules, which sets out the amendment which I have \nsubmitted, and it is to this effect: that the sanction for abusive \nlitigation would arise in any private action when the abusive \nlitigation practice is brought to the district court's attention by \nmotion or otherwise. The court shall promptly decide with written \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law whether to impose sanctions \nunder rule 11, and upon the adjudication, the district court shall \ninclude the conclusions and shall impose the sanctions which the court \nin the court's discretion finds appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I submit to my colleagues that leaving the discretion \nto the judge really is the right way to handle these matters. These \njudges sit on these cases, know the cases, and have ample authority as \na discretionary matter to impose the sanction. As one judge said, all \nthese rules cannot make a bad judge do the right thing. But I think we \ncan rely upon the discretion of the judges without tying their hands.\n  Mr. President, I would be glad to yield the floor at this time to \nargument by the managers if they would care to do so. We can then \nproceed to conclude the argument on this amendment.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                     United States District Court,\n\n\n                                       District of New Mexico,\n\n                             Albuquerque, New Mexico, May 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Spector,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Wsshington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Spector: Thank you for your letter of April \n     24, 1995 and the opportunity to express comments on issues \n     involving Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       For purposes of clarity, I have restated each question \n     posed in your April 24, 1995 letter followed by my response.\n       (1) Is there a significant problem with frivolous \n     litigation in the Federal Courts such as to justify ``loser \n     pays'' and strengthening of FRCP 11?\n       Response: Rule 11, as amended effective December 1, 1993, \n     gives federal judges adequate authority to impose appropriate \n     sanctions for conduct that violates Rule 11. Rule 11(c) \n     states that if Rule 11 has been violated ``the Court may, \n     subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate \n     sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have \n     violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the \n     violation.'' Rule 11(c)(2) describes the sanctions that may \n     be imposed for a violation. These include directives of a \n     non-monetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into Court, or \n     an Order directing that an unsuccessful movant who has \n     violated Rule 11 pay ``some or all the reasonable attorneys' \n     fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the \n     violation.'' At this point there appears to be no need to \n     change Rule 11, or to pass legislation, to introduce a more \n     stringent ``loser pays'' sanction.\n       (2) How well did FRCP 11 work after the 1983 Amendment, \n     which strengthened the rule, and since the 1993 Amendment, \n     which weakened the rule?\n       Response: In this judicial district, considerable satellite \n     litigation developed under Rule 11 after the 1983 amendment. \n     This required judges to devote significant time to resolving \n     squabbles among counsel unrelated to the merits of the case. \n     The 1993 amendment of Rule 11 has dramatically reduced the \n     number of motions alleging Rule 11 violations. This I \n     attribute directly to the ``safe harbor'' provision found in \n     Rule 11(c)(1)(A). The ``safe harbor'' provision has forced \n     lawyers to communicate and to resolve their disputes in most \n     instances without the need for Court intervention. My \n     personal opinion is that this feature of the 1993 amendment \n     of Rule 11 strengthened instead of weakened Rule 11. It has \n     made the lawyers talk to each other about claims or defenses \n     perceived by their opponents to be frivolous and this has \n     resulted in most disputes being resolved without extensive \n     briefing and devotion of valuable court time. Removal of the \n     ``safe harbor'' provision from Rule 11 would be extremely \n     detrimental to the orderly functioning of the courts.\n       (3) What suggestions, if any, do you have in relation to \n     this issue?\n       Response: As a member of the judiciary I implore members of \n     the legislative branch of government to follow the Rules \n     Enabling Act procedures for amending rules of evidence and \n     procedure that the courts must apply. Congress demonstrated \n     great wisdom in passing the Rules Enabling Act which defines \n     the appropriate roles of the legislative and judicial \n     branches of government in adopting new rules or amending \n     existing rules.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you very much for your letter \n     of April 6, 1995.\n       In the year and a half that I have been on the bench I have \n     had no problem with frivolous litigation. I have sanctioned \n     two lawyers for engaging in what I thought to be \n     inappropriate discovery procedures, but have had no \n     experience with FRCP 11 as a trial judge.\n       I am strongly opposed to the ``loser pays'' proposal. I am \n     told by my scholarly friends that this is a British rule. \n     With all due respect for our kinfolks across the Atlantic, \n     many of our ancestors got on a ship and came to the United \n     States because they were not particularly fond of the justice \n     system in Britain. In all seriousness, I do have a lot of \n     respect for some aspects of the system in England, but, in my \n     opinion, ours is much superior.\n       The ``loser pays'' will obviously slam the courthouse door \n     shut in the face of deserving citizens who are not well \n     heeled financially.\n       It appears to me that the 1993 Amendment to FRCP 11 was \n     much needed. The rule, before these changes, tended to be too \n     rigid, at least on the surface. It encouraged satellite \n     litigation. FRCP 11, as it now reads, gives a judge all she \n     or he needs to handle improper conduct. And I think we should \n     all keep in mind that we can't promulgate rules good enough \n     to make a good judge out of a bad one.\n       Finally, I would like to comment on the ``crisis'' claims \n     that are being made about the case load in federal district \n     courts. I quote from Judge G. Thomas Eisele: Differing \n     Visions--Differing Values: A Comment on Judge Parker's \n     Reformation Model for Federal District Courts, 46 SMU L. Rev. \n     1935 (1993):\n       . . . In 1985 the total case filings in all U.S. District \n     Courts came to 299,164; in 1986, 282,074; in 1987, 268,023; \n     in 1988, 269,174; in 1989, 263,896; in 1990, 251,113; in \n     1991, 241,420; and in 1992, 261,698. So in a period of seven \n     years the total filings have fallen\n      from 299,164 to 261,698. The number of civil filings per \n     judgeship fell from 476 in 1985 to 379 in 1990--a period \n     when the number of judgeships remained constant at 575. In \n     1991 the number of judgeships increased to 649 and the \n     number of civil cases per judgeship fell to 320. For 1992 \n     the figure is 350.\n       ``We are frequently told that our criminal dockets are \n     interfering with our civil dockets, and this has certainly \n     been true in a few \n\n[[Page S 9167]]\n     of our federal districts. But the number of felony filings per \n     judgeship only increased from forty-four in 1985 to fifty-\n     eight in 1990. In 1992, that number fell to fifty-three. The \n     total filings per judgeship, criminal and civil, have been \n     lower than they were in 1991 (372) in only two years since \n     1975. And the weighted filings per judgeship have likewise \n     fallen in the past five years from 461 in 1986 to 405 in \n     1992.\n       ``So there is not much support for the oft-repeated \n     assertions that `federal court system has entered a period of \n     crisis;' that our courts are `on the verge of buckling under \n     the strain;' that `our courts are swamped and unmanageable'. \n     . . . The actual figures and trends simply do not support \n     such doomsday hyperbole.\n       ``On the issue of delay we find, as always, that a few \n     district courts are having considerable trouble moving their \n     dockets, but overall we find the same median time from filing \n     to disposition in civil cases (nine months) for each year \n     from 1985 until 1992. And the period between issue and trial \n     in 1992 (fourteen months) is the same as it was in 1985. A \n     Rand Corporation study confirms that the rhetoric about \n     unconscionable and escalating delays in processing and trying \n     cases in the federal district court system is nothing more \n     than myth. . . .''\n       In other words, the sky is not falling down.\n       Again, thank you very much for permitting me to comment on \n     these questions.\n           Cordially,\n     Wm. R. Wilson, Jr.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                Northern District of Illinois,\n\n                                   Chicago, Illinois, May 5, 1995.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I respond to yours of April 19 \n     inquiring about the need to strengthen Rule 11 of the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       1. In my 22 years on the federal trial bench I state \n     unequivocally that there is not a significant problem with \n     frivolous litigation in the federal courts warranting a \n     ``loser pays'' sanction. I have encountered two or three \n     repetitious/abusive plaintiffs. But their first complaints \n     were not frivolous. They just had difficulty taking ``No'' \n     for an answer.\n       Of course, in all litigation which is tried, somebody wins \n     and somebody loses. But the losers are not frivolous \n     complainers.\n       2. The 1993 amendment to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure did not ``weaken'' it. Quite the contrary: it \n     made the Rule bilateral, i.e., it applies to unfounded \n     denials as well as unfounded contentions; it gives the judge \n     greater flexibility in the imposition of sanctions; it \n     affords the offending party the opportunity to correct his or \n     her misdeed. The rule should not revert to 1983.\n       3. I suggest that Rule 11 be left just the way it is. It is \n     working well. The collateral litigation provoked by the 1983 \n     version has diminished.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Prentice H. Marshall.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     United States District Court,\n\n\n                                    District of New Hampshire,\n\n                                         Concord, NH, May 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is to acknowledge receipt of \n     your letter dated April 24, 1995 with respect to the recently \n     passed United States House of Representatives legislation \n     providing for a form of ``loser pays.''\n       In response to question #1, I do not believe there is a \n     significant problem with frivolous litigation in the Federal \n     Courts to justify ``loser pays.''\n       With respect to question #2 FRCP 11 is working well. It \n     gives the judge adequate discretion to deal with frivolous \n     litigation and untoward conduct by attorneys.\n       Candidly, I hope that the Senate does not pass the ``loser \n     pays'' legislation. I have one comment related to \n     strengthening of FRCP 11. Although there may be and there is \n     some justification for losers pay, I do not believe it is \n     necessary. There are many cases where an indigent, well-\n     intentioned litigant may be penalized by strict adherence to \n     a rule that losers pay. I have been a New Hampshire Superior \n     Court judge for sixteen years and a Federal Judge for an \n     equal amount of time. While not strictly restricted to the \n     Federal Courts, we are being inundated with paper, usually by \n     the party who is well-off financially. This unfortunately \n     sometimes puts pressure on the non-affluent litigant to \n     settle or withdraw his or her claim.\n           Sincerely,\n     Martin F. Loughlin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                Southern District of New York,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your letter dated April \n     24 inquiring about frivolous litigation in the federal \n     courts. I have been a federal trial judge for nine and one-\n     half years in one of the busiest districts in the country. \n     During that period, Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 has been both \n     strengthened and weakened. I have not observed a significant \n     problem that requires a legislative remedy.\n       The only noticeable effect of the weakening of FED.R.Civ.P. \n     11 has been a welcome diminution in the number of Rule 11 \n     motions. With respect to ``loser pays,'' it is my strongly-\n     held view that the founders of this Republic wisely chose to \n     eliminate certain aspects of the English legal system as \n     contrary to the egalitarian ideals of American democracy. Two \n     of the most important of these reforms were the abolition of \n     the distinction between barristers and solicitors and the \n     elimination of the British practice of requiring the losing \n     party in civil litigation to pay the lawyers fees of the \n     winning party. Indeed, the system of having each party bear \n     its own legal fees has come to be known as the American Rule. \n     It is based on the belief that people of limited means would \n     be deterred from suing on meritorious claims by the fear that \n     if they were not successful, the costs would ruin them.\n       I have found the general supervisory power of the court as \n     well as 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1927 and Rule 11 adequate sources of \n     judicial authority to discourage frivolous litigation, and do \n     not believe that the American Rule should be abolished.\n           Sincerely,\n     Miriam Goldman Cederbaum.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     United States District Court,\n\n\n                                         District of Maryland,\n\n                                 Baltimore, Maryland, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your letter of April \n     19, 1995, in which you solicit my views on a ``loser pays'' \n     rule and the possible strengthening of FRCP 11.\n       There is, of course, a fair amount of frivolous litigation \n     in the federal courts. However, the bulk of that litigation \n     is conducted by impecunious litigants as to whom a ``loser \n     pay'' rule would have no effect. Accordingly, I do not \n     support the adoption of such a rule. I particularly oppose \n     the rule in diversity cases since it would provide in such \n     cases a significant incentive for attorneys to forum shop.\n       Similarly, I oppose any amendments to strengthen FRCP 11. I \n     believe that as a general matter, Rule 11 is a valuable tool \n     for judges to use, and I have occasionally imposed Rule 11 \n     sanctions myself to punish or deter inappropriate behavior. \n     However, I further believe that Rule 11, as it existed prior \n     to the 1993 amendments, had a deleterious effect upon the \n     professional relationships of members of the bar. \n     Furthermore, I think that in its pre-1993 form the Rule was \n     counterproductive in that it increased judges' workloads and \n     contributed to litigation cost and delay by requiring judges \n     to impose sanctions whenever a Rule 11 violation was found. \n     Satellite litigation in which one lawyer or party sought fees \n     from another became commonplace.\n       For these reasons I oppose any amendment to the Rule that \n     would make imposition of sanctions mandatory; to a somewhat \n     lesser extent, I also oppose elimination of the Rule's ``safe \n     harbor'' provision provided in the 1993 amendments.\n       I hope that these comments are helpful to you. If I can be \n     of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                J. Frederick Motz,\n     United States District Judge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                      for the Seventh Circuit,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 19, 1995.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     my views on the ``loser pays'' and Rule 11 issues. I very \n     much appreciate being given an opportunity to comment. My \n     thoughts on the specific questions you pose are as follows:\n       (1) In my judgment, there is no significant problem with \n     frivolous litigation in the federal courts such as would \n     justify ``loser pays'' legislation or strengthening FRCP 11. \n     The current Rule 11 gives the district court ample discretion \n     to address frivolous litigation. If a given case is \n     sufficiently frivolous, a court is not hampered from invoking \n     Rule 11 to shift the entire cost of the case to the loser. \n     Rule 11 also grants the district court discretion to impose \n     more modest penalties or to refrain from a penalty, depending \n     on what is appropriate in a given case.\n       (2) After the 1983 amendment, FRCP 11 created a cottage \n     industry of satellite litigation which consumed an enormous \n     amount of court time and did not succeed in improving the \n     overall quality of litigation. The fact that penalties were \n     mandatory if a violation was found simply raised the stakes \n     of Rule 11 litigation and encouraged the filing of requests \n     for sanctions, even if the breach was slight and the damage \n     minimal. In many cases, it turned a dispute between the \n     litigants into a dispute between the lawyers, and hampered or \n     prevented altogether the pre-trial settlement of cases. The \n     1993 amendment has improved matters greatly by making \n     sanctions discretionary. This permits much greater \n     flexibility and has removed the incentive to file Rule 11 \n     motions when the case for sanctions is weak.\n       (3) I strongly recommend that Congress leave Rule 11 as is \n     and not adopt the ``loser pays'' rule. A ``loser pays'' \n     provision will not add anything substantive to the district \n     court's arsenal of tools to deal with frivolous litigation. \n     It is likely merely to discourage litigants with limited \n     resources to pursue their cases, particularly when the \n     litigant seeks a change in the law. The ability to pursue \n     such cases seems to me one of the fundamental protections of \n     individual rights in \n\n[[Page S 9168]]\n     this country, and I believe if we want to reduce litigation, rather \n     than disincentives for pursuing novel theories we ought to \n     introduce incentives for settlement. ``Loser pays'' would act \n     as a disincentive to settlement by introducing the question \n     of fees and costs into settlement discussions. It would also \n     generate an enormous amount of fees litigation. The net \n     effect would thus be deleterious to individual liberties \n     without significantly reducing the amount of litigation, and \n     would in my judgment merely exacerbate the core problem--the \n     amount of time that judges are increasingly required to \n     devote to non-substantive matters.\n       Thank you again for inviting me to comment. I hope that my \n     thoughts will be of aid to you in your deliberations, and I \n     send, as always, warmest good wishes and my thanks for your \n     many kindnesses through the years.\n           With best regards,\n     Ilana Diamond Rovner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                               Eighth Circuit,\n\n                                  Kansas City, MO, April 20, 1995.\n     Re FRCP 11.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: In reply to your letter of April 6, \n     positing inquiry on three issues related to FRCP 11, I would \n     like to respond as follows:\n       1. There is a significant problem with frivolous litigation \n     in the Federal Courts. I think a trial run with ``loser \n     pays'' proposal would be in order provided the district judge \n     would have the discretion to apply or not to apply such \n     sanction in any given case.\n       2. I think FRCP 11 worked better after the 1983 Amendment; \n     and, has some difficulty since the 1993 Amendment.\n       3. I believe more discretion should be given to the \n     district judge in the how and when to apply the sanctions \n     authorized under FRCP 11(c) on sanction. Also, some revisions \n     of subsection (d) might be in order relating to discovery as \n     there has been many abuses reported of extensive, unnecessary \n     and costly discovery procedures which makes the whole legal \n     system too expensive for many citizens to handle or even \n     participate in the legal process.\n       I have been sitting with the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco \n     since the receipt of your letter, hence my slight delay in \n     reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Floyd R. Gibson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                 Eastern District of Michigan,\n\n                                         Detroit, MI, May 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for asking my views on \n     pending ``loser pays'' legislation.\n       I firmly believe the Congress involves itself too deeply in \n     the procedural aspects of the litigation process. Federal \n     judges are capable of dealing with abusive lawyering. \n     Legislation is not needed. I handle my docket just fine. I \n     control abusive lawyering within the existing rules. Giving \n     me more authority to deal with abusive lawyering is likely to \n     make me more abusive.\n       Specifically,\n       1. There is no problem with frivolous litigation in the \n     federal courts. FRCP 11 does not need to be strengthened and \n     ``loser pays'' is not justified. We have gotten along very \n     well for 220 years without much fee shifting and there is no \n     need for it now.\n       2. FRCP 11 worked less well after the 1983 Amendment than \n     it has since the 1993 Amendment. After the 1983 Amendment \n     there were frequent occasions of overuse. That overuse no \n     longer appears. Rarely is there a need for Rule 11 sanctions \n     of any significant amount.\n       3. I suggest that Congress stay out of this area. What is \n     pushing the Congress now is the better heeled part of \n     society. More defendants win in court than plaintiffs. \n     ``Loser pays'' and a stricter FRCP 11 would discourage \n     otherwise potentially meritorious cases from coming to \n     federal courts.\n       Lastly, published statistics show a 14% drop in the number \n     of civil filings in federal courts between 1985 and 1994. Why \n     all the excitement?\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Avern Cohn.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                Eastern District of Louisiana,\n\n                                     New Orleans, LA, May 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is in response to your letter of \n     April 19th, which I assume went to all members of the \n     judiciary (unless our mutual good friend, Ed Becker, \n     suggested that you write to me).\n       Let me say at the outset that after having been a lawyer \n     who practiced principally in federal courts for some 26 years \n     and a United States District Judge for nearly 12 years, I \n     support some form of ``loser pay'' legislation.\n       There is indeed a problem with frivolous litigation in the \n     Federal Courts which, in my view, justifies some form of \n     ``loser pay'' rule. ``Loser pay'' legislation would serve as \n     a deterrent to many lawsuits that ought not be filed, \n     including suits by lawyers and pro se litigants. Moreover, \n     ``loser pay'' legislation would also deter frivolous defenses \n     in the early stages of the litigation. That, to me, is the \n     main difference between ``loser pay'' and Rule 11.\n       I believe Rule 11 has worked after the 1983 Amendment, but \n     its weakness is that Rule 11 addresses matters that might \n     have occurred at the outset of litigation but that usually \n     occur as an abuse of the adversary process in a later stage \n     of the litigation. On the other hand, ``loser pay'' would \n     serve as a deterrent from the very beginning of the \n     litigation. I haven't had much involvement with Rule 11 since \n     the 1993 Amendment, but I believe that giving district courts \n     more discretion in applying the Rule was a good thing and I \n     would not consider the 1993 Amendment to have been a \n     weakening of the Rule.\n       As to specific suggestions, ``loser pay'' comes in many \n     forms as you no doubt are aware. I don't have a specific \n     model in mind, only a concept. I like the English rule but \n     they have a much more sophisticated Legal Aid system. The \n     question of whether or not pro se litigants should be dealt \n     with the same way as lawyers and other litigants is a close \n     call. I guess what I am saying is that there are several \n     models of ``loser pay'' and your Committee would no doubt \n     want to consider many of them and, perhaps, even a refinement \n     of them that would accommodate the Federal system. But some \n     form of ``loser pay'' is most appropriate now and I would be \n     pleased to work with any group who was interested in drafting \n     such legislation.\n       Thank you very much for writing me. You may also be \n     interested to know that one of my present law clerks is Marc \n     DuBois, whose father I understand is also a close friend of \n     yours.\n           Sincerely,\n     Martin L.C. Feldman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                 Western District of Arkansas,\n\n                                   Fort Smith, AR, April 20, 1995.\n     Re: Your Letter of April 6, 1995.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: With respect to your request for \n     comment, I would make the following observations:\n       (1) Is there a significant problem with frivolous \n     litigation in the Federal Courts such as to justify ``loser \n     pays'' and strengthening of FRCP 11?\n       Response: I cannot speak for all federal courts but, with \n     respect to those with which I am involved, the answer is \n     ``no.''\n       (2) How well did FRCP 11 work after the 1983 Amendment, \n     which strengthened the rule, and since the 1993 Amendment, \n     which weakened the rule?\n       Response: I did not commence my duties as a federal \n     district judge until April 15, 1992. Accordingly, I don't \n     feel qualified to make an appropriate comment on this issue.\n       (3) What suggestions, if any, do you have in relation to \n     this issue?\n       Response: I am not sure the Congress needs to pass any \n     legislation. I think courts, themselves, can handle this \n     matter with the rules already in place and their inherent \n     powers.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jimm Larry Hendren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                        for the Third Circuit,\n\n                                       Newark, NJ, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Your letter of April 6th asks for my \n     comments respecting congressional proposals to strengthen \n     Rule 11 and to enact ``loser pays'' legislation. I am pleased \n     to respond to your inquiries as best I can.\n       The 1983 amendment to Rule 11 generated a rash of Rule 11 \n     motions, which themselves often generated responding Rule 11 \n     motions. These motions were frequently groundless. According \n     to a 1989 Federal Judicial Center (FJC) survey, approximately \n     31 percent of judges believed that many or most Rule 11 \n     motions for sanctions are themselves frivolous. Federal \n     Judicial Center, Rule 11: Final Report of the Advisory \n     Committee on Civil Rules Sec. 2A at 7 (1990). Indeed, the \n     post-1983 Rule 11 jurisprudence gave rise, in my opinion, to \n     tangential ``satellite'' proceedings which, in many \n     instances, not only delayed but appeared to dwarf the \n     controversy on the merits.\n       I make special reference here to the practice of counsel \n     who file a Rule 11 motion in an attempt to recover fees, \n     which is met with a Rule 11 motion by adversary counsel, \n     claiming that the initial Rule 11 motion was itself \n     frivolous. According to the Judicial Center, the majority of \n     judges (and I count myself among them) believe that the \n     possibility of ``dueling'' Rule 11 motions can make \n     litigation even more contentious if the threat of cost \n     shifting materializes. Id. Sec. 2A at 10. Further, judicial \n     time spent defining what is ``frivolous'' and resolving \n     arguments over the appropriate fee award, allowable costs, \n     and the like deprives judges of time which they could \n     otherwise devote to the merits of other matters.\n       Additionally, about 65 percent of judges believe that \n     frivolous litigation represents a small or very small \n     problem, accounting for only 1-10 cases per judge in a year. \n     Id. Sec. 2A at page 2-3. In combination, these statistics \n     suggest to me that the 1983 version of Rule 11 itself may \n     have contributed to needless proceedings in the courts.\n\n[[Page S 9169]]\n\n       The 1993 Amendment, of course, altered Rule 11 so that \n     district court judges may exercise their discretion over \n     whether to impose sanctions. Further, it explicitly provides \n     for the option of penalties (fines) paid to the court in lieu \n     of attorney's fees, and incorporates a 21 day ``safe harbor'' \n     provision. Each provision reduces the likelihood that \n     attorneys will fine Rule 11 motions to shift costs while \n     still permitting judges to target violators with appropriate \n     sanctions aimed at deterring future frivolous proceedings.\n       In my opinion, abandoning mandatory sanctions and \n     permitting district court judges to exercises their judicial \n     discretion was a welcome measure. Some frivolous litigation \n     will always exist, and judges should have the power and \n     discretion to address such behavior. After experience on the \n     district court and more than twenty years examining district \n     court records on appeal, I am confident that district court \n     judges through the exercise of their discretion can control \n     the evil that Rule 11 was originally promulgated to cure. \n     This is the same power and discretion which we in the Courts \n     of Appeal exercise over litigants through Federal Rule of \n     Appellate Procedure 38.\n       I am also of the opinion that there has not been sufficient \n     time since the 1993 Amendment has gone into effect to assess \n     the institutional and judicial problems that may have arisen. \n     I think that before further amendment to Rule 11 is sought, \n     or further legislation in this area is contemplated, there \n     should be a period for judicial maturation, study and \n     evaluation.\n       In this regard, let me state a final concern that I have \n     with the proposed congressional changes to the Federal Rules. \n     The procedure for Rule amendments provided in the Rules \n     Enabling Act--consideration by committees, the Judicial \n     Conference, and the Supreme Court followed by submission to \n     Congress--represents a prudent and conservative allocation of \n     rulemaking authority between the judiciary and Congress. I am \n     concerned that the initiation of rule changes by Congress \n     without study and input from the judiciary, and without a \n     developmental\n      process involving the bench and bar, risks overlooking \n     relevant considerations. Moreover, the ever-present \n     separation of powers problems which lurk in the background \n     of congressional attempts to fashion procedural rules for \n     the Federal Courts suggests that Rules such as Rule 11 \n     should be processed through traditional judicial channels \n     before congressional action is taken.\n       As for my thoughts on the ``loser pays'' aspect of the \n     Attorneys Accountability Act, I will be brief. It is clear to \n     me that the primary results of such legislation can only be \n     to (1) reduce the number of cases that go to trial, and (2) \n     spur plaintiffs to take lower settlements than they would \n     otherwise have accepted. However, this is just my opinion and \n     it is not based on empirical data.\n       I note, for instance, that the Proposed Long Range Plan for \n     the Federal Courts, in its March 1995 publication, recognizes \n     that ``appropriate data are needed to assess the potential \n     impact of fee and cost shifting on users of the Federal \n     Courts.'' Id. at 61. The Plan rejects the ``English'' rule \n     but recommends continuing a study of the problem of fee \n     shifting to decrease frivolous or abusive litigational \n     conduct. I share those views.\n       I am generally of the opinion that the American Rule is \n     consonant with our tradition of liberal access to the courts. \n     I have always taken great pride in the fact that in our \n     country, plaintiffs with legitimate claims may have their \n     ``day in court'' without fear of sanctions should their suits \n     prove unsuccessful. I am also concerned that public interest \n     groups and civil rights claimants may be discouraged from \n     filing meritorious complaints due to fears that they will be \n     assessed ``shifted'' fees in excess of their ability to pay.\n       You have asked what suggestions I have with respect to \n     these issues. I would retain the 1993 Amendment to Rule 11 in \n     its present form and revisit the effect of the Amendment at \n     some future time, perhaps in another five years. Because \n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and Federal Rule of \n     Appellate Procedure 38 give the courts power to sanction \n     frivolous actions when necessary, my inclination is not to \n     remove that discretion, but to encourage it.\n       I am similarly conservative as to ``loser pays.'' I note \n     that even in Great Britain there has been recent criticism, \n     both in the press and among scholars, of the English Rule. My \n     experience tells me that ``each side pays'' has resulted in a \n     just balance of interests. I am also a firm believer in the \n     old adage. ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' I therefore \n     recommend against abandoning our present system until such \n     time as studies of the two system reveal the desirability of \n     change.\n       I am certain that you and your office have considered all \n     of the matters that I have written about before receiving \n     this note, but I did want to respond and explain to you why I \n     entertain the views that I have advanced with respect to Rule \n     11 and ``loser pays'' legislation. Certainly, I would be \n     pleased to respond to any inquires you may have.\n       Thank you writing to me in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leonard I. Garth.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   San Francisco, CA, May 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This letter responds to yours of \n     April 19 posing the following questions relating to \n     legislation that would amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure.\n       (1) Is there a significant problem with frivolous \n     litigation in the Federal Courts such as to justify ``loser \n     pays'' and strengthening of FRCP 11?\n       The short answer is that there is no significant problem \n     with frivolous litigation in the federal courts. To the \n     extent there is frivolous litigation, it consists mostly of \n     cases brought by prisoners. Existing law adequately enables \n     judges to dismiss those cases summarily with a minimum of \n     work. And neither Rule 11 nor fee shifting would have any \n     impact on prisoners filing cases.\n       More generally, it is a misconception to look at Rule 11 or \n     fee shifting as a way to deter frivolous litigation. On the \n     whole, Rule 11 has had a beneficial impact in making lawyers \n     more careful about the pleadings they file, i.e. encouraging \n     them to take a closer look to see whether a particular \n     pleading is justified. Most frequently its application has \n     been to motions and other procedural activities rather than \n     to complaints or answers. But if it has been a deterrent at \n     all, its impact has been mostly on persons who are risk \n     averse-persons who may not want to take a chance that a \n     borderline case will be found to be in violation of Rule 11 \n     leading to possible sanctions. In this way, it functions not \n     so much as a filter based on frivolity but as a gauge of risk \n     averseness. I believe that it has functioned in this way in \n     very few cases but the civil rights bar believes that it has \n     deterred filing of some civil rights cases.\n       On the question of whether there is a justification for \n     what you call a ``loser pays'' rule, in my view fee shifting \n     has little to do with control of frivolous litigation. There \n     are of course various ways in which to approach fee shifting. \n     The so-called English rule is not practical for the\n      United States for several reasons: (1) it impacts everyone, \n     plaintiff and defendant alike, on the basis of risk \n     averseness, not frivolity, i.e. perfectly non-frivolous \n     cases are lost every day and it makes no sense to punish \n     defendants or plaintiffs for losing a case; (2) a loser-\n     pays rule, unless carefully drafted, would undermine \n     contingent fee practice and over 100 federal fee-shifting \n     statutes, and (3) to the extent it works in England, it is \n     made possible by legal aid which pays attorneys fees for \n     lower income litigants and exempts them from the rule.\n       A more constructive approach is to amend FRCP 68 to provide \n     for fee-shifting offers of judgment but in a way that will \n     make the rule serve as an incentive, not as a sanction. If \n     you are interested in this, I refer you to the enclosed \n     copies of an article I published on the subject and of a \n     letter I wrote recently to Senator Hatch.\n       (2) How well did FRCP 11 work after the 1983 Amendment, \n     which strengthened the rule, and since the 1993 Amendment, \n     which weakened the rule?\n       The Federal Judicial Center undertook a study of the \n     operation of the 1983 amendment. It showed, among other \n     things, that Rule 11 activity occurred only rarely (in 2 \n     percent of the cases) and that sanctions were imposed in only \n     about a quarter of the affected cases, that eighty percent of \n     the judges thought that its overall effect was positive but \n     also that it had a potential for causing satellite litigation \n     and exacerbating relations among lawyers, and that the rule \n     probably had a disparate impact on plaintiffs, particularly \n     in civil rights cases. This is discussed in some detail in \n     the enclosed article.\n       While I believe that on the whole the 1983 rule worked \n     well, there is wide agreement among bench and bar that the \n     1993 amendment is an improvement and ought to be given a \n     chance to operate before further changes are considered. The \n     rule, as amended, will preserve the incentive for lawyers to \n     use care in filing pleadings while minimizing costly and \n     unproductive satellite litigation over sanctions by making \n     sanctions discretionary (which in practical effect they are \n     anyway), by providing a safe harbor, and by lessening the \n     emphasis on the rule as a fee shifting device. The amendment \n     will moderate what on occasion had become excessive reliance \n     on the rule. The amendment now pending in Congress will \n     inevitably result in more expense and delay by stimulating \n     Rule 11 litigation without giving any assurance that the \n     people who are prone to file frivolous cases will be deterred \n     from doing so. I believe that the amendment will be \n     counterproductive and self-defeating and therefore recommend \n     that Congress leave the rule alone and observe its operation \n     for a few years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William W. Schwarzer.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I have said earlier in this debate, I \nam unburdened with the blessing of having been to law school, and as a \nconsequence feel myself inadequate to respond to the learned legal \narguments of one of the Senate's best lawyers. As a consequence, Mr. \nPresident, I will leave that argument to be made by the chairman of the \ncommittee at some future point. I have no response at this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside so that I may proceed to offer my second \namendment. \n\n[[Page S 9170]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1484\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a stay of discovery in certain circumstances, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1484.\n       Beginning on page 108, strike line 24 and all that follows \n     through page 109, line 4, and insert the following:\n       ``(k) Stay of Discovery.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In any private action arising under this \n     title, the court may stay discovery upon motion of any party \n     only if the court determines that the stay of discovery--\n       ``(A) would avoid waste, delay, duplication, or unnecessary \n     expense; and\n       ``(B) would not prejudice any plaintiff.\n       ``(2) Additional limitations on discovery.--In any private \n     action arising under this title--\n       ``(A) prior to the filing of a responsive pleading to the \n     complaint, discovery shall be limited to materials directly \n     relevant to facts expressly pleaded in the complaint; and\n       ``(B) except as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B), or \n     otherwise expressly provided in this title, discovery shall \n     be conducted pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure.''.\n       On page 111, strike lines 1 through 7, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Stay of discovery.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In any private action arising under this \n     title, the court may stay discovery upon motion of any party \n     only if the court determines that the stay of discovery--\n       ``(i) would avoid waste, delay, duplication, or unnecessary \n     expense; and\n       ``(ii) would not prejudice any plaintiff.\n       ``(B) Additional limitations on discovery.--In any private \n     action arising under this title--\n       ``(i) notwithstanding any stay of discovery issued in \n     accordance with subparagraph (A), the court may permit such \n     discovery as may be necessary to permit a plaintiff to \n     prepare an amended complaint in order to meet the pleading \n     requirements of this section;\n       ``(ii) prior to the filing of a responsive pleading to the \n     complaint, discovery shall be limited to materials directly \n     relevant to facts expressly pleaded in the complaint; and\n       ``(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii), or \n     otherwise expressly provided in this title, discovery shall \n     be conducted pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is the amendment which I referred to \nearlier dealing with a provision of the bill in its current form which \nprohibits any discovery after a motion to dismiss has been filed, \nexcept under very limited circumstances.\n  The general rule of Federal procedure is that discovery may proceed \nafter a complaint has been filed and a motion to dismiss has been filed \nunless on application by the defendant the judge stays the discovery.\n  The current bill provides as follows:\n\n       In any private action arising under this title during the \n     pendency of any motion to dismiss, all discovery proceedings \n     shall be stayed unless the Court finds, upon the motion of \n     any party, that a particularized discovery is necessary to \n     preserve evidence or prevent undue prejudice to that party.\n\n  It is more than a little surprising, Mr. President, to find \nsecurities litigation separated out from all of the other litigation in \nthe Federal courts. And for those who may be watching this matter on C-\nSPAN, while this may be viewed as somewhat esoteric, somewhat \nhypertechnical, it will not be hypertechnical if you are a stockholder \nand the stock goes down and you find you have been misled and defrauded \nby people who have made misrepresentations.\n  What this means in common parlance, common English, is that a lawsuit \nis started. It is a class action started, and this private right of \naction has been developed in order to protect shareholders, especially \nsmall shareholders who band together in a class, and after the \ncomplaint is filed the plaintiffs' attorney seeks to find out the \ndetails as to what happened with the defendant; the plaintiff does not \nknow all the details of the facts at the time of filing suit. The \ncorporation or the officers may have made some very fine promises which \nsounded very good when the promises were made but no one can tell about \nthe details of the facts unless you go into the records of that party \nbecause those facts are not generally known.\n  In lawsuits, discovery is permitted where one party seeks to take the \ndeposition, that is, to ask the other party questions, or propounds \ninterrogatories, that is, submits written questions, or makes a motion \nfor the discovery of documents to take a look at records.\n  In discussing this issue with the proponents of the legislation, I \nwas given a response--it is a little disappointing not to find somebody \nto argue against here. It is not easy to make an argument when there is \nnobody to disagree. Perhaps my distinguished colleague from Iowa wishes \nto disagree with me. My distinguished colleague from Utah chooses not \nto.\n  The response I got was that it changes the mindset of the litigation, \nand I would say that the trial judge who is sitting on the spot has \nample discretion, if it is inappropriate discovery, to say the \ndiscovery is not going to go on, instead of having a mandatory change \nsingling out this legislation from all other legislation.\n  Well, may I defer to my distinguished colleague from Utah, who I \nknow, having warning in advance, now has had ample opportunity to \nmuster the legal arguments, or am I to infer that the managers of the \nbill have fled the scene because there is nothing to be said in \nresponse to the overwhelming arguments I have presented?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would not concede that there is nothing to be said in \nresponse to the overwhelming arguments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Good. Will the Senator yield for a question or two?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will concede that this Senator is not prepared to \nmount that response. I suggest, Mr. President, that the Senator proceed \nin his scholarly and learned way.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a little difficult to proceed, Mr. President, \nwithout opposition. But permit me at this time, Mr. President--and may \nI note ascension to power of my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of a reply, I would ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed with the third amendment which I propose to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1485\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the standard plaintiffs must meet in specifying \n    the defendant's state of mind in private securities litigation)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now send a third amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1485:\n       On page 110, strike lines 12 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Required State of Mind.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In any private action arising under this \n     title in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only \n     on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or \n     omission alleged to violate this title, specifically allege \n     facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant \n     acted with the required state of mind.\n       ``(2) Strong inference of fraudulent intent.--For purposes \n     of paragraph (1), a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind may be established either--\n       ``(A) by alleging facts to show that the defendant had both \n     motive and opportunity to commit fraud; or\n       ``(B) by alleging facts that constitute strong \n     circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or \n     recklessness by the defendant.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. I sense that the clerk \nwas surprised I had not asked unanimous consent and permitted the clerk \nto read the amendment. But I did so just for a change of scene on C-\nSPAN2. Since there is nobody here to argue with me, at least let there \nbe some break in the action. The formulation of the amendment by my \ndistinguished chief counsel, Richard Hertling, was as clear and \nsuccinct as I could have articulated it.\n  Mr. President, this again involves a question which might be viewed \nas being esoteric and legalistic unless you are someone who has lost \nmoney in the stock market and seek to make a recovery, unless you are \none of the people who has participated in the stock transactions in \nexcess of $3.5 trillion or have been among those who have bought stock \nin the market, more than \n\n[[Page S 9171]]\n$54 billion worth in 1993, the most recent year available for \nstatistical summary. And what this amendment seeks to do, Mr. \nPresident, is to amplify the language of the bill which imposes a very \ndifficult pleading burden on the plaintiff. Let me take just a moment \nor two to say what goes on in a lawsuit.\n  When somebody loses money because they bought stock where there has \nbeen a misrepresentation, and that person goes to a lawyer, they may \nhave a relatively small amount of stock, say $1,000 worth, or $10,000 \nworth, or even $100,000 worth. That is not a sufficient sum to be able \nto carry forward litigation which is very, very costly on all sides, so \nclass actions are authorized under the rules of civil procedure where \nmany plaintiffs can join together and there is a sufficient sum so that \nthe lawsuit can be brought forward.\n  Then the lawyer--and I have been on both sides, filing complaints and \nfiling motions to dismiss--has to prepare a complaint, and the \ncomplaint involves allegations. An allegation is a statement of what \nthe party represents happened. And then there is an answer filed by the \ndefendant or the defendant may file what is called a motion to dismiss, \nif the defendant makes the representation that even assuming everything \nin the complaint is true, there is not a sufficient statement to \nconstitute a claim for relief under the Federal rules, to warrant a \nrecovery.\n  When these rules of civil procedure were formulated back in the \n1930's, and I had the good fortune in law school to have the \ndistinguished author of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Charles \nE. Clark, the former dean of Yale Law School who was then a judge on \nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and came to the law school \nto instruct us law students--there was done what was called notice \npleading so that there did not have to be any elaborate statement as to \nwhat the case was about. It could be very simple. There was a case \ncalled Jabari versus Durning, if my recollection is correct,\n where a person just scribbled some notes on a piece of paper, went to \nthe clerk's office and filed it.\n\n  And the effort was made at that time to have a notice pleading, \ncontrasted with a common law pleading under Chitty where the averments \nhad to be very, very specific. If he did not say it exactly right, you \nwere thrown out of court. It was very complicated. And I can recall the \nearly days practicing, going to the prothonotary in the Philadelphia \nCourt of Common Pleas, which draws a smile from my learned colleague \nwho is also a lawyer. There was no way that I could draw the complaint \nwith sufficient specificity to satisfy the clerks, who would take some \ndelight in rejecting legal papers filed by young lawyers. So at any \nrate, this bill seeks to have a very tough standard for pleading. And I \nthink that it is a good point.\n  And what the draftsmen have done is gone to the Court of Appeals for \nthe second circuit, and they have drafted a type of pleading \nrequirement which was articulated by the chief judge of the court of \nappeals by the name of John Newman, who was a classmate of mine in law \nschool and studied at the same one as the distinguished jurist, Charles \nClark, the chief judge. And now Judge Newman is chief judge in his \nplace. And this required state of mind provides that:\n\n       In any private action arising under this title, the \n     plaintiff's complaint shall, with respect to each act or \n     omission alleged to violate this title, specifically allege \n     facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant \n     acted with the required state of mind.\n\n  Now, that is the toughest standard around. And that is fine. We ought \nto move away from notice pleading and really make the plaintiff state \nwith specificity the state of mind. But when the Court of Appeals for \nthe second circuit handed down this very tough rule, they went just a \nlittle farther and said what would give rise to an inference so that \nthere would not be guessing on the part of the plaintiffs. And this is \nwhat Judge John Newman, who established this standard in the case of \nBeck versus Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said:\n\n       These factual allegations must give rise to a ``strong \n     inference'' that the defendants possessed the requisite \n     fraudulent intent.\n       A common method for establishing a strong inference of \n     scienter is to allege facts showing a motive for committing \n     fraud and a clear opportunity for doing so. Where motive is \n     not apparent, it is still possible to plead scienter by \n     identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior by \n     the defendant, though the strength of the circumstantial \n     allegations must be correspondingly greater.\n\n  Now, what my amendment seeks to do, Mr. President, is to put into the \nstatute the same things that Judge Newman was citing when he posed this \nvery tough standard pleading. Judge Newman and the court said that the \nstrong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of \nmind may be established either:\n\n       (a) alleging facts to show the defendant had both motive \n     and opportunity to commit fraud, or (b) by alleging facts \n     that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious \n     misbehavior or recklessness by the defendant.\n\n  Now, in the committee report, which accompanies this bill, the \ncommittee says this:\n\n       The Committee does not adopt a new and untested pleading \n     standard that would generate additional litigation. Instead, \n     the committee chose a uniform standard modeled upon the \n     pleading standard of the second circuit. Regarded as the most \n     stringent pleading standard, the second circuit requires that \n     the plaintiff plead facts that give rise to a ``strong \n     inference'' of the defendant's fraudulent intent. The \n     committee does not intend to codify the second circuit's \n     caselaw interpreting this pleading standard, although courts \n     may find this body of law instructive.\n\n  Now, I am a little bit at a loss--and I know that the distinguished \nSenator from Utah will have a response at this time, or Senator \nGrassley will, or the Chair will--as to why the--I am just joking about \nthat because there is nobody here to argue with me about this. And it \nmay create some change in my agreeing to the unanimous consent for 2 \nminutes tomorrow to discuss this with the managers of the bill.\n  But the committee does say here that they are not adopting a new and \nuntested pleading standard. They are correct. This is tested by the \nsecond circuit. But the second circuit in the whole series of cases has \nfound that the way to make this determination is through these \ninferences which I have added in this amendment. And the committee does \nsay accurately that this is the most stringent pleading standard \naround. And then the committee says that it does not intend to ``codify \nthe second circuit's caselaw interpreting this pleading standard, \nalthough the courts may find this body of law instructive.''\n  Well, if we do not have it the way the second circuit says you plead \nit, but only saying this is instructive, then this bill allows courts \nto interpret this tougher pleading standard anyway they choose, and \ncourts may impose some standards which go far beyond what the second \ncircuit and Judge Newman had in mind in imposing this tough pleading \nstandard. And it is one thing for the committee to say that they are \nnot adopting a new and untested pleading standard, but it is only \nhalfway if it does not put into the statute but leaves open the \nquestion of how you meet this standard.\n  I do wish I had the managers here to question them about precisely \nwhat they have in mind. And I am going to have to figure out some way, \nMr. President, to raise this issue. Maybe I will offer this amendment \nin another form later so we can have some discussion and debate on it, \nbecause there is not really any explanation or any way to respond to or \nto understand what the committee has done here, because what they have \ndone in essence is say the second circuit has a tough pleading \nstandard; let us take it. But when the second circuit amplifies and \nsays how you meet that standard, the committee says no, no, we are not \ngoing to adopt that.\n  What I am trying the do in this amendment is simply complete the \npicture and have in the statute this standard so that people know what \nthey are to do on the pleading. Now, I know my colleague from Utah will \nhave a comprehensive reply on this substantive issue.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Comprehensive is in the eye of the beholder, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Can you give me in a beholder's eye what you are about to say is \ncomprehensive?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would say--\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that question may be even understandable on C-\nSPAN2.\n\n[[Page S 9172]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The issue did come up. We did discuss it in the \ncommittee at some length. And even though I am not a lawyer, I think I \ndid follow the conversation on this one. My understanding --which I \nthink is what the Senator has said, but I will repeat it so that we \nhave a common basis here--my understanding is that there was concern \nabout different standards and different circumstances. And the \ncommittee decided they wanted to codify the standard from the second \ncircuit. Now, the committee intentionally did not provide language to \ngive guidance on exactly what evidence would be sufficient to prove \nfacts giving rise to a strong inference of fraud. They felt that \nadopting the standard would be sufficient.\n  Obviously, the Senator from Pennsylvania disagrees with that \ndecision. But the decision was intentional. This is not an inadvertent \nthing that the committee did. And they felt that with the second \ncircuit standard being written into the bill, it was best to stop at \nthat point and allow the courts then the latitude that would come \nbeyond that point.\n  Beyond assuring the Senator that this was a deliberate decision \nwithin the committee by the drafters of the bill, both staff and \nmembers, I probably cannot give him any further enlightened knowledge \non this particular subject.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nthat response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. But I must say, I do not understand the logic of what \nthe committee has done when they utilize the second circuit standard \nwhich they say is the most stringent standard, and the second circuit \nis given a road map as to how you meet it.\n  The legislation might not say this is the only way to meet it, but \nthis is one of the ways to meet it so that when somebody is drafting a \npleading, a party has knowledge and notice as to how to go about it. \nWhen the committee takes credit here for not adopting a new and \nuntested pleading standard, I give them credit, because it is something \nwhich has already been tested. It is not new, but is incomplete if it \ndoes not have the second part of what the second circuit said as to how \nyou meet the standard. It simply to me does not follow.\n  I shall not pursue it because I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is not the draftsman.\n  Mr. President, that concludes the argument, and I do not think there \nis any point at this late hour in keeping the staff here if we are not \ngoing to have any reply. So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. If my \ncolleagues are here and intend to make some reply, if they are on the \npremises, I will wait a reasonable period of time, but only that, in \nview of the lateness of the hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss briefly my \nthoughts about the securities litigation reform bill, S. 240 sponsored \nby Senators Dodd and Domenici that is being considered on the Senate \nfloor.\n  No one disagrees with the goals of S. 240, which are to help pull the \nplug on frivolous and unmeritorious securities fraud lawsuits and to \nsecure greater protections for those innocent victims in fraud \nlitigation. But regrettably this bill, as it is currently drafted, will \nmake it more difficult for innocent fraud victims to bring legitimate \nfraud cases. It also limits their ability to recover all of their \nlosses from fraud perpetrators in those cases that they win. For these \nreasons, I intend to vote no.\n  Some of the provisions in the bill are long overdue. The bill would \nlimit unreasonable attorney's fees in securities fraud cases. It also \nprohibits bonus payments and referral fees which may create an \nincentive to file frivolous cases. Moreover, it requires lawyers to \nprovide all plaintiffs with more information about the nature of a \nproposed settlement in class action cases--including a statement about \nthe reasons for settlement, about an investor's average share of the \naward and the amount of the attorney's fees and costs. I support all of \nthese provisions.\n  But other provisions in the bill could effectively shield from \nliability those perpetrators who knowingly mislead or defraud \ninvestors. And if there is one thing that the investors of this country \nhave a right to expect, it is that those who commit fraud or those who \nsubstantially assist in fraud get punished and that they are forced to \nreturn their ill-gotten gains to honest victims of their misdeeds.\n  In the 1980's, a flood of S executives openly flouted the law and \nthe trust of their investors and depositors. Some of them lived like \nmaharajahs while building monuments of worthless paper. This charade \nperpetrated by these swindlers contributed to a bailout of the industry \nthat is costing the taxpayers of America as much as $500 billion to \nclean up. Innocent investors were bilked out of tens of billions of \ndollars and their ability to recover their losses has been limited.\n  Congress enacted tough legislation to ensure that this debacle will \nnot happen again. I recall legislation that I offered, which passed \nCongress, prohibiting S's from investing in risky junk bonds and \nrequiring them to divest the ones they already own. Some S's were \nactually selling worthless junk bonds to investors out of their \nlobbies. It never should have happened. But still many unwary investors \nlost a bundle on junk bonds offered by these deceptive fast-buck \nartists before Congress acted to stop this activity.\n  We ought to pass tough, reformed-minded securities legislation that \nstops the abusive legal cases that are filed to simply line the \nfinancial pockets of unscrupulous lawyers and professional plaintiffs. \nThe companies that are the targets of such lawsuits are rightfully \nconcerned about frivolous lawsuits. Meritless cases unnecessarily \ndivert the much-needed resources and attention of firm personnel to \ndefending these cases rather than allowing the companies to focus on \nproduct improvement and on their global competitors.\n  But I think that S. 240 as drafted goes too far toward immunizing \nthose who are guilty of securities violations from liability. The \nprovisions that shield these wrongdoers in securities fraud cases from \nliability are unfair to the innocent victims of fraud. And it sends the \nwrong message to our securities market that fraudulent behavior will be \ntolerated, if not sanctioned.\n  We must not insulate the white collar crowd who would exploit unwary \ninvestors for their own personal gains. Those responsible for the S \nscandal and those responsible for fraud in the future should pay. \nThat's why I will vote against S. 240, unless it is substantially \nimproved before the Senate votes on final passage.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Private Securities Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995, of which I am a cosponsor, is not about aiding \nperpetrators of fraud in the financial markets or hurting small \ninvestors. This legislation is about curtailing the abuses in this \ncountry's securities litigation system and empowering defrauded \ninvestors with greater control over the class action process. This \nlegislation would restore fairness and integrity to our securities \nlitigation system.\n  This legislation assists small investors by requiring lawyers to \nprovide greater disclosure of settlement terms, including reasons why \nplaintiffs should accept a settlement. This is a common sense approach \nwhich is often lacking under the current system. This legislation also \nincorporates public auditor disclosure language. S. 240 requires that \nindependent public accountants report to their client's management any \nillegal act found during the course of an audit. If the management of \nthe company or the board of directors fail to notify the Securities and \nExchange Committee of the illegal act, the auditor is required to \ninform the SEC or face civil penalties. This is needed reform which \nassists all investors who rely on accountants to act in an independent \nmanner on their behalf.\n  I would like to close my statement on the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 by highlighting some statistics from an \narticle in today's issue of the Wall Street Journal. The article notes \nthat the net legal costs of accounting firms has increased from 8 \npercent of their total revenue in 1990 to 12 percent of revenue in \n1993. That is a 50 percent increase in net legal costs in just 3 years. \nIn one of the cases cited in the article, it notes that an accounting \nfirm spent $7 million defending itself in a case where the jury \n\n[[Page S 9173]]\nruled in the accounting firms favor. That is $7 million spent just to \nprove that the firm was innocent. As these statistics show, common \nsense should be reintroduced to our securities litigation system, and \nthis legislation does just that. Common sense benefits all parties in \nthe securities litigation system, especially investors, which is \nfundamental to this legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act. I like this bill for three reasons: \nIt stops the bounty hunters, it puts people who have lost money in \ncharge, and it penalizes people who commit fraud.\n  Mr. President, we are finally moving on this issue. We've moved \nbeyond discussing whether or not there is a problem--to discussing \nexactly what reforms are needed.\n  Here is what I think. First, let us stop the bounty hunters. This \nbill says that lawyers can't shop around for clients. I mean--a lawyer \nwill not be able to pay a commission to someone else to find them a \nclient.\n  I have heard of instances where lawyers seek out clients just so they \ncan have cases to litigate.\n  Second, I think the people who lose the most money should have the \nmost to say. By that I mean--with this bill the court will be able to \npick one person--who has lost a lot of money in a class action suit--to \nbe the leader. This way the system works for investors instead of \nagainst them.\n  Third, Mr. President, I am all for ending fraud and protecting \nbusinesses that are just trying to create jobs. This bill will not \napply to people who knowingly cheat investors.\n  I have talked to several investors and I have heard from the people \nof Maryland on this issue. Accountants tell me that some attorneys pay \nstockbrokers, and others, in return for information about possible \nlawsuits and possible clients. That is unacceptable. Courts are for \nprotecting the rights of people and promoting fairness, not for \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Companies are hit with higher insurance costs, time in court and are \ngenerally distracted from the mission of creating jobs. Lawsuits mean \nthat companies are reluctant to provide the kind of public information \nthat can benefit investors.\n  In Maryland, high-technology companies are hit the most by this \nproblem. That means these unnecessary lawsuits are costing Maryland \ncitizens--lost jobs and lost opportunities.\n  Mr. President, this is not about protecting some ``savings and loan \ncon artist'' as the ads say. This bill is about saving jobs and keeping \nthe courthouse doors open to those who really need to get inside.\n  I support this bill because I believe it will create jobs. We needs \ninvestors. We need new companies. We need new jobs. But we will not \nhave any new jobs if companies cannot invest or ask people to invest in \ntheir future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. I am pleased this \nday has come, and I am pleased that this reform has overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  It is time we look at liability issues and liability reform not on a \npartisan basis but on an American basis. It is in the best interest of \nbusiness and it is in the best interest of the consumers. We can do \nboth, because this bill does both.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit \nthe import, export, sale, purchase, and possession of bear viscera or \nproducts that contain or claim to contain bear viscera, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        THE BEAR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce the Bear Protection Act. \nThis measure is aimed at controlling poaching of bears such as the \nAmerican black bear which is found in Kentucky. It addresses several \nenforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are caused by a patchwork \nof State laws. The current inconsistencies enable a wildly profitable \nunderground black market for bear parts to flourish in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. \nHunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears \nkilled during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or \nbarter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear \nviscera.\n  This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in \nbear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in \nthe illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold \nand traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San \nFrancisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as \nprimary ports for export shipments of these goods.\n  Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian \nmedicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the \nincreasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears \nhas been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led \npoachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, \nfor one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be \ndecimated by poachers.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black \nbears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the \nAppalachian mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all \nthe way to the Mississippi river. Although we cannot restore the \nnumbers we once had, we can insure that the remaining bears are not \nsold for profit to the highest bidder.\n  Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is \nestimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every \nyear. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting.\n  Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is \ngreed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in \ngold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on \nthe black market.\n  Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to \naddress the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an \neffective manner. The Department of the Interior has neither the \nmanpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally in the \nUnited States. Without extensive testing, law \n\n[[Page S 9175]]\nenforcement officials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts \nhave from threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates \nthe poaching of endangered or threatened bears.\n  The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade \nin bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have \nbeen instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the \nSecretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to \nestablish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts \naimed at curtailing the international bear trade.\n  Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with \nthe poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still \nensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITION OF BEAR VISCERA.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``bear viscera'' means the body \n     fluids or internal organs (including the gallbladder) of a \n     species of bear.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior shall prohibit--\n       (1) the import into the United States, or export from the \n     United States, of bear viscera or products that contain or \n     claim to contain bear viscera; and\n       (2) the sale, barter, offer of sale or barter, purchase, or \n     possession with intent to sell or barter, in interstate or \n     foreign commerce, of bear viscera or products that contain or \n     claim to contain bear viscera.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT BY SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, shall prepare and submit to \n     Congress a report that describes--\n       (1) how to improve the effectiveness of the wildlife \n     monitoring and inspection program of the Department of the \n     Interior (including the computerized information system or \n     any other system of the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service or the United States Customs Service that records \n     data) with respect to the importation or exportation of bear \n     viscera and other bear and other wildlife body parts to and \n     from the United States; and\n       (2) any plans of the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service to monitor the illegal movement of,\n      or commercial activity in, bear viscera or other bear body \n     parts.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING TRADE PRACTICES.\n\n       The United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall--\n       (1) discuss issues involving trade in bear viscera with the \n     appropriate representatives of such countries trading with \n     the United States as are determined jointly by the Secretary \n     of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to be the \n     leading importers, exporters, or consumers of bear viscera; \n     and\n       (2) attempt to establish coordinated efforts with the \n     countries to protect bears.\n\n     SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act precludes the regulation under State \n     law of the sale, barter, offer of sale or barter, purchase, \n     or possession with intent to sell or barter, of bear viscera \n     or products that contain or claim to contain bear viscera, if \n     the regulation--\n       (1) does not authorize any sale, barter, offer of sale or \n     barter, purchase, or possession with intent to sell or \n     barter, of bear viscera or products that contain or claim to \n     contain bear viscera, that is prohibited under this Act; and\n       (2) is consistent with the international obligations of the \n     United States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 969. A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of the \nchild, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n            THE NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kassebaum, the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and \nMr. Rockefeller, to introduce legislation which seeks to ensure that \nnewborn babies and their mothers receive adequate health care in the \ncritical first few days following birth.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the first few days after birth are a \ncritical and challenging time for both the infant and the mother. At \nthis crucial stage in life, infants and their mothers truly need the \nsupport of health care providers. Yet, more and more families are \nfinding their access to health providers at this time is being limited \nseverely.\n  I say this because it is becoming common practice for health insurers \nto require that new mothers and their infants be discharged from the \nhospital 24 hours after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and 72 hours \nafter a cesarean section. In some parts of the country, the hospital \nstay for a normal delivery is being reduced to 12 hours, and there is \neven talk of cutting it back to 6 hours. And in many cases, the mother \nand infant receive no professional follow-up care at home. The American \nMedical Association has dubbled these practices ``drive-through \ndeliveries.''\n  Drive-through deliveries are not simply a matter of sending home \nmothers who are often exhausted and still in pain, and who may not have \nadequate social supports at home. They can also pose severe health \nrisks for both the infant and the mother. National medical \norganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican Medical Association, and the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, have all stated that the trend toward shorter \nhospital stays is placing the health of many newborns and mothers at \nrisk.\n  There are several reasons why they state this: First, numerous health \nproblems faced by newborns, such as dehydration and jaundice, do not \nappear until after the first 24 hours of life. Since many of these \nillnesses can only be detected by health professionals, early hospital \ndischarge can cause these conditions to go undetected, leading to brain \ndamage, strokes, or even death.\n  Second, the mother can also develop many serious health problems, \nincluding pelvic infections, breast infections, and hemorrhaging.\n  Third, a 24-hour stay does not provide sufficient opportunity for the \nmother to be taught basic infant-care skills such as breastfeeding. \nThis, combined with the fact that many mothers are simply too exhausted \nto care for their child 24 hours after delivery, often leads to \nnewborns receiving inadequate care and nourishment during their crucial \nfirst few days of life.\n  Let me assure you that these concerns are not just theoretical. A \nrange of anecdotal and scientific evidence indicates that these \nproblems are real, and growing. A researcher at Dartmouth's medical \nschool recently concluded that newborns discharged less than 2 days \nafter birth are more likely to be readmitted for jaundice, \nmalnutrition, and other problems. Physicians across the country have \nnoted a resurgence in the number of jaundiced babies they are treating. \nAnd newspapers across the country in recent weeks have relayed \ndevastating stories about how local mothers and infants have been \naffected by these policies.\n  Our bill seeks to counteract these negative effects of premature \ndischarges by ensuring that newborns and mothers receive adequate care \nduring those critical first days. It does this by requiring health \ninsurers to allow new mothers and their infants to remain in the \nhospital for a minimum of 48 hours after a normal birth and 96 hours \nafter a caesarean section. Shorter hospital stays are permitted \nprovided that neither the mother nor the attending physician object, \nand that follow-up home health care is provided for the mother and \ninfant.\n  To those who would argue that a 48-hour stay is longer than is \nmedically necessary, I would like to point out that this is a \nsignificantly shorter time than medical experts recommend for \nuncomplicated deliveries. In their guidelines for caring for newborns \nand mothers, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n[ACOG] and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend stays of 48 \nhours for uncomplicated vaginal birth, and 96 hours following a \ncaesarean birth--in addition to the day of delivery. ACOG has also \npointed out that there is inadequate evidence to prove that early \ndischarge is safe, and therefore that the recent trend toward shorter \nstays ``could be the equivalent of a large, uncontrolled, uninformed \nexperiment'' on newborns and their mothers.\n\n[[Page S 9176]]\n\n  A 48-hour minimum stay is also consistent with steps being considered \nby some States. For example, our bill is very similar to one which \nrecently was passed unanimously by the New Jersey Legislature, and \nwhich should soon be signed into law. Maryland has also recently passed \na law dealing with early discharges, and similar measures are being \nconsidered in New York and California.\n  Mr. President, insurers may argue that they will pay for stays beyond \n24 hours if there is a valid medical reason. However, many physicians \nhave told me--off the record--that it is very difficult to convince \ninsurers to grant an extension, no matter how valid the reason. They \nalso state that the final decision is often made by someone with no \nexperience in obstetrics. Finally, they state that many doctors are \nunder financial pressures to avoid having patients stay beyond the 24-\nhour limit, so they are faced with a real quandary when a patient needs \nan extension. A recent report by Maryland's Department of Health and \nMental Hygiene raises further concerns about what is considered a valid \nmedical reason. This report found that among babies who were born \nprematurely, who were not fully developed, or who were diagnosed with a \nsignificant problem, about 22 percent were discharged from the hospital \nwithin 24 hours of birth. This study was based on data from 1992. I can \nonly assume that the situation has gotten worse in the 3 years since.\n  Mr. President, there is no greater advocate for controlling health \ncare costs than this Senator. And I am impressed by some health \ninsurers' success in slowing health inflation by reducing unnecessary \ncare. At the same time, I also recognize that there is a very fine line \nbetween eliminating unnecessary care and reducing access to care which \ntruly is needed. And when we end up on the wrong side of that line--as \nI think is happening in the case of newborns and their mothers--I \nbelieve it is both appropriate and necessary for us to take steps to \nprotect the health of the American public. Concerns about controlling \ncosts are justified, but they must not be allowed to outweigh concerns \nabout doing what is best for patients. And let us not forget, Mr. \nPresident, that discharging mothers and newborns early creates its own \ncosts, the cost to insurers of treating patients for conditions which \ncould have been prevented or lessened if caught earlier, and the costs \nto the individual and society when a child suffers brain damage or \nother permanent disabilities because they did not receive adequate \nearly care.\n  Mr. President, America's newborns deserve a better welcome to the \nworld than they are getting under the present system. Their mothers \nalso deserve better.

Mr. President, I join today with my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Bradley, in introducing the Newborns' and \nMothers' Health Protection Act of 1995.\n  This legislation seeks to ensure that adequate care is provided to \nmothers and newborns in the critical first few days following birth. \nModeled after legislation recently considered in Maryland and passed \nunanimously by the New Jersey Legislature, it requires health insurers \nto allow new mothers and their infants to remain in the hospital for a \nminimum of 48 hours after a normal birth, and 96 hours after a cesarean \ndelivery. If the mother and the doctor agree, shorter hospital stays \nare permitted, provided that there is a follow-up visit.\n  ``Guidelines for Perinatal Care'' issued by the American Academy of \nPediatrics [AAP] and the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists [ACOG] state that in uncomplicated deliveries the \npostpartum hospital stay should range from 48 hours for vaginal births \nto 96 hours for cesarean sections, exclusive of the day of delivery.\n  However, as hospitalization costs continue to climb, it has become \nincreasingly common for health insurers to require that new mothers and \ntheir babies be discharged from the hospital 24 hours after birth. In \nsome parts of the country, hospital stays for a routine delivery can be \nas short as 12 hours.\n  The American Medical Association [AMA], ACOG, and the Academy of \nPediatrics all have stated that the trend toward shorter hospital stays \nis placing the health of newborns and their mothers at risk.\n  Early hospital discharges have caused conditions such as jaundice--\nthat do not appear until after the first 24 hours of life and which may \nlead to brain damage--to go undetected.\n  A 24-hour stay is often too short for new mothers to be taught basic \ninfant care skills, such as breastfeeding. And many mothers are not \nphysically capable of providing for a newborn's needs 24 hours after \ngiving birth. This can lead to inadequate nourishment during a child's \ncrucial first few days of life.\n  Mr. President, I must say that I have agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation \n\n[[Page S 9177]]\nwith some reservation. I generally view any effort to influence private \ncontracting arrangements with great skepticism. However, I view this \nsituation as limited and unique. What is at stake here is not merely an \nimpediment to the traditional doctor-patient relationship, but instead \nthe health and safety of millions of America's children.\n  My primary concern is that the most recent trend toward shorter \nhospital stays appears to be motivated primarily by financial \nconsiderations--instead of sound medicine.\n  In calling for a moratorium on shorter hospital stays last week, ACOG \nstated that:\n\n       The routine imposition of a short and arbitrary time limit \n     on hospital stays that does not take maternal and infant need \n     into account could be equivalent to a large, uncontrolled, \n     uninformed experiment that may potentially affect the health \n     of American women and their babies.\n\n  Like ACOG, I fear that insurers may be acting prematurely, without \nsufficient information about the long-term health implications of \nshorter hospital stays. As more conclusive data becomes available, I \nwould be open to revisiting this issue. Until then, I believe we should \nproceed with caution.\n  I strongly believe that decisions regarding early discharge must be \nindividualized and should place primary emphasis on the health of a \nmother and her child. I believe that the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will help restore that perspective to this important \ndecision.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Ashcroft):\n  S. 971. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \ngovernmental discrimination in the training and licensing of health \nprofessionals on the basic of the refusal to undergo or provide \ntraining in the performance of induced abortions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the medical training nondiscrimination act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I introduce the Medical Training \nNondiscrimination Act of 1995. This bill would prevent any State or \nFederal Government from discriminating against a health care provider \nbecause that provider does not perform induced abortions or train its \nob-gyn residents to perform induced abortions.\n  It is, quite frankly, disturbing to me that this legislation is even \nnecessary. I would venture that few of my colleagues could believe that \nour society is anywhere near to condoning a requirement that any person \nor any hospital be required to perform abortions or offer training in \nabortions.\n  Indeed, as it stands now, our proud tradition of tolerance toward \nthose who abhor abortion and any participation in that act, has \ngenerally protected hospitals from having to provide or train \nabortions. In fact, only 12 percent of hospitals now require training \nin induced abortion. A third more do not offer any such training and \nthe rest offer it only as an option. Of course, those programs still \nare required to train residents to manage medical and surgical \ncomplications of pregnancy. And that includes training procedures than \nmight in the case save the life of the mother, as well as training D \nand C procedures involving preborn children that died as a result of a \nspontaneous abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth.\n  But all this will change now that the Accreditation Council for \nGraduate Medical Education [ACGME] has voted to require all hospitals \nto train or arrange for training in induced abortion. The press has \nindicated that training in late-term, second-trimester abortions would \nbe required. The ACGME has proposed to make exceptions only in the case \nof an institution that can formulate a cohesive, institutional \nobjection based on religious or moral principles.\n  What is particularly shocking is that the Federal Government no only \ncondones this compulsion but actually punishes those who do not submit. \nHere's how: Failure to do the abortion training could result in loss of \naccreditation by the ACGME. Loss of accreditation would result in loss \nof Federal funding. For example, Medicare will not reimburse the Part A \ncosts of intern and resident services if the teaching program is not \naccredited. Further, ob-gyn residents in a program not accredited by \nthe ACGME are ineligible for deferral of repayment on Federal Health \nEducation Assistance Loans [HEAL]. The HEAL loan program is \nreauthorized in S. 555, now before the Senate.\n  Why the change in the standards? Internal correspondence with the \nACGME panel suggests that the policy change was motivated by concern \nover the declining number of doctors willing to perform abortions and \nthe need to destigmatize abortion providers. This concern over the \nstigmatization of abortion providers was dramatically characterized \nduring the debate on the Foster nomination when one ``pro-choice'' \nSenator demanded an apology from another pro-life Senator who had \n``defamed'' Dr. Foster by calling him an abortionist. Would an apology \nhave been demanded if Dr. Foster had been called a heart surgeon or a \npodiatrist? No, there remains substantial negative stigma associated \nwith being an abortion provider--stigma that might be eliminated if all \nobstetricians and gynecologists had to perform abortions as part of \ntheir residency training.\n  The Medical Training Nondiscrimination Act of 1995 would protect the \ncivil rights of health care providers by preventing the Government from \ndiscriminating against any health care provider on the basis that it \nwill not perform, train, or undergo training to perform an induced \nabortion. Discriminatory actions include denial of any benefit, \nassistance, or license, and the conditioning of such benefit, \nassistance, or license on the provider's compliance with accredition \nstandards that require the performance, training, or arranging for \ntraining of induced abortions. The amendment applies only to State \naction and does not proscribe a private accrediting body from requiring \nabortion training.\n  Providers who choose to offer abortion training, and individuals who \nseek abortion training, may continue to do so. The amendment does not \nprevent any program from offering abortion training.\n  Providers will continue to train the management of complications of \ninduced abortion as well as train to handle situation involving \nmiscarriage and stillbirth or a threat to the life of the mother. The \namendment requires no change in the practice of good obstetrics and \ngynecology.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support. On the House side \nCongressman Hoekstra, LaFalce, Volkmer, Coburn, and Weldon have \nintroduced identical language in the House following hearings.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and protect the rights of health \nproviders against Federal and State government action that forces them \nto become involved in training or providing induced abortions against \ntheir will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of all certified nurse practioners and \nclinical nurse specialists services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Medicaid nursing incentive act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicaid \nNursing Incentive Act of 1995, a bill to provide direct Medicaid \nreimbursement to nurse practitioners.\n  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of \ncost-effective primary care to our Nation's most needy citizens.\n  Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year \ndo without the health care services they need, because physicians \nsimply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural \nand urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south \ncentral Los Angeles and Lemmon, SD.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent \nyears an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to \ncare for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner city and \nrural communities where they live. Fortunately, there is an exception \nto this trend: Nurse practitioners frequently accept patients whom \nothers will not treat and serve in areas where others refuse to work.\n  Studies have shown that nurse practitioners provide care that both \npatients and cost cutters can praise. Their advanced clinical training \nenables them to assume responsibility for up to 80 percent of the \nprimary care services usually performed by physicians, many times at a \nlower cost and with a high level of patient satisfaction.\n  Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse \npractitioners. For more than a decade, CHAMPUS has provided direct \npayment to nurse practioners. In 1990, Congress mandated direct payment \nfor nurse practitioner services under the Federal employee health \nbenefit plan. Recent legislation has required direct Medicare \nreimbursement for nurse practitioners practicing in rural areas and \ndirect Medicaid reimbursement for family nurse practitioners.\n  Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the \nMedicaid program and its beneficiaries; there is a broader lesson here \nthat applies to our search for ways to make cost-effective, high-\nquality health care services available and accessible to all of our \ncitizens.\n  One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of \nprimary\n and preventive care, delivered to individuals in convenient, familiar \nplaces where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 million of \nour Nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--in home \nhealth agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and schools.\n\n  In places like my home State of South Dakota, nurses are often the \nonly health care professionals available in the small towns and rural \ncounties across the State.\n  These nurses and other nonphysican health professionals play an \nimportant role in the delivery of care. And, this role will increase as \nwe move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment of illness \nto one that emphasizes primary care and health promotion.\n  But, first we must revaluate outdated attitudes and break down \nbarriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their \ntraining and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health \nProfessions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being \nfully utilized to deliver primary care services and recommended \neliminating fiscal discrimination by paying them directly for the \nservices they provide. This step will help nurse practitioners provide \nthe access to primary care that so many communities currently lack.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the measure I am \nintroducing today, recognizing the important role that nurse \npractitioners and other nonphysician health professionals can play in \nour health care delivery system and the increasing contribution they \ncan make in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle \nas a cosponsor of the Medicaid Nursing Incentive Act of 1995. This \nlegislation would provide direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists for services they provide \nwithin their scope of practice, regardless of whether these services \nare performed under the supervision of a physician.\n  With the current shortage of primary health care services in our \nNation, millions of Americans are without essential health services. \nMedicaid recipients are particularly vulnerable.\n  By allowing direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists, I believe that this legislation will not \nonly improve access to much needed health care services, but will \nstrengthen our health care delivery system. A number of recent studies \nhave documented the important roles that nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists play in providing cost-effective, quality \nhealth care services. For example, a December 1986 study by the Office \nof Technology Assessment detailed the significant contributions nurse \npractitioners have made in reducing health care costs, improving the \nquality of care, and increasing the accessibility of services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It will enhance \naccess to \n\n[[Page S 9179]]\ncost-effective, quality care for individuals with limited access to \nhealth care services.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 973. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of residential ground rents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the residential ground rents act of 1995\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great \nimportance to Hawaii's leasehold homeowners. In fiscal year 1992, at my \nrequest, the Congress appropriated $400,000 to study the feasibility of \nreforming the Internal Revenue Code to address ground lease rent \npayments and to determine what role, if any, the Federal Government \nshould play in encouraging lease to fee conversions. The nationwide \nstudy was conducted by the Hawaii Real Estate and Research Center.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on the \nrecommendations of this study. The bill would: First, provide a \nmortgage interest deduction for residential leasehold properties by \nallowing the nonredeemable ground lease rents to be claimed as an \ninterest deduction; and, second, include a tax credit for up to $5,000 \nfor certain transaction costs on the transfer of certain residential \nleasehold land for a 5-year period, ending on December 31, 1999. \nTransaction costs include closing costs, attorneys' fees, surveys, and \nappraisals, and telephone, office, and travel expenses.\n  In most private home ownership situations in this country, a \nhomeowner owns both the building and land. Under a leasehold \narrangement a homeowner owns the building--single-family home, \ncondominium, or cooperative apartment--on leased land. The research \nconducted under the leasehold study shows that residential leaseholds \nare not uncommon in other parts of the United States and elsewhere in \nthe world. Residential leaseholds exist in places such as Baltimore, \nMD, Irvine, CA, native American lands in Palm Springs, CA, Fairhope, \nAL, Pearl River Basin, MS, and New York, NY.\n  The study further indicates that there are few States that regulate \nresidential leaseholds. Of those that do, the most common requirement \napplies only to condominium or time share units and is one requiring \nadequate disclosure of the lease terms. For the most part, States are \nunaware of any leasehold problems in their jurisdictions. However, \nresidential leaseholds have proven to be problematic for the State of \nHawaii.\n  The formation of Hawaii's land tenure system can be traced back to \n1778 when British Capt. James Cook made his first contact with the \nHawaiian civilization. Leasing was the preferred system to maintain \ncontrol and retain a portfolio asset value. Residential leaseholds were \nfirst developed on the Island of Oahu after World War II. Population \nincreases created a demand for housing and other types of real estate \ndevelopment. Federal income tax policy encouraged the retention of land \nto avoid payment of large capital gains taxes.\n  Hawaii's land tenure system is now anomalous to the rest of the \nUnited States because of the concentration of land in the hands of \ngovernment, large charitable trusts, large agriculturally-based \ncompanies and owners of small parcels or urban properties.\n  High land prices and high renegotiated rents continue to create \ninstability in Hawaii's residential leasehold system. In 1967, the \nHawaii State legislature enacted a land reform act which did not become \neffective until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1984 decision, Hawaii \nHousing Authority versus Midkiff. The act and the Supreme Court \ndecision basically divided the market into a ``single-family home \nmarket in which leaseholds were subject to mandatory conversion, and a \nleasehold condominium market which did not come within the scope of the \nlaw.''\n  Mandatory conversions on the single-family home market occurred from \n1979 to 1982, and 1986 to 1990. As of 1992, there are approximately \n4,600 single-family homes remaining in residential leaseholds. However, \nresolution over condominium leasehold reform remains uncertain. In \n1990, the Honolulu City Council enacted legislation that would cap \nlease rent increases. The law was challenged in Federal district court \nas to its validity and eventually ruled as unconstitutional because the \nformula it used to arrive at permitted lease rent was irrational.\n  In 1991, due to the State legislature's unwillingness to address the \nleasehold problems, the Honolulu City Council again enacted a mandatory \nleasehold conversion law for leasehold condominiums (Ordinance 01-95). \nThe law is currently being challenged in the Federal courts as to its \nconstitutionality. Another bill which linked lease rent increases with \nthe Consumer Price Index and the level of disposable income available \nto condominium owners was also considered. This bill, similar to the \none enacted in 1990, was found to be unconstitutional.\n  The uncertainty in the residential leasehold market continues to \ncreate emotional distress for the leasehold residents of Hawaii. \nVoluntary conversion has helped to ease the situation and substantially \nreduce the stock of leasehold residential units in Hawaii. Yet, \nvoluntary conversion is not enough to resolve the residential leasehold \nproblems.\n  My legislation will help reduce the economic hardship due to the \nuncertainty in Hawaii's residential leasehold system.

A bill to prohibit certain acts involving the use of \ncomputers in the furtherance of crimes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE ANTI-ELECTRONIC RACKETEERING ACT\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the \nAnti-electronic Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important \nchanges to RICO and criminalizes deliberately using computer technology \nto engage in criminal activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, \nmeasured and strong response to a growing problem. According to the \ncomputer emergency and response team at Carnegie-Mellon University, \nduring 1994, about 40,000 computer users were attacked. Virus hacker, \nthe FBI's national computer crime squad has investigated over 200 cases \nsince 1991. So, computer crime is clearly on the rise.\n  Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever \nman develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. \nAnd that is why I have introduced this bill. I believe we need to \nseriously reconsider the Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward \nmodernizing existing statutes and creating new ones. In other words, \nMr. President, Elliot Ness needs to meet the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology \nAssessment. That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has \nentered cyberspace in a big way. International drug cartels use \ncomputers to launder drug money and terrorists like the Oklahoma City \nbombers use computers to conspire to commit crimes.\n  Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year. \nAnd often times, there is little that can be done about this because \nthe computer used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under \nmy bill, overseas computer users who employ their computers to commit \nfraud in the United States would be fully subject to the Federal \ncriminal laws. Also under my bill, Mr. President, the wire fraud \nstatute which has been successfully used by prosecutors for many users, \nwill be amended to make fraudulent schemes which use computers a crime.\n  It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also\n   have to reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that \nprosecutors must overcome. For instance, in the typical case, \nprosecutors must identify a location in order to get a wiretapping \norder. But in cyberspace, it is often impossible to determine the \nlocation. And so my bill corrects that so that if prosecutors cannot, \nwith the exercise of effort, give the court a location, then those \nprosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. And for law enforcers--\nboth State and Federal--who have seized a computer which contains both \ncontraband or evidence and purely private material, I have created a \ngood-faith standard so that law enforcers are not shackled by undue \nrestrictions but will also be punished for bad faith.\n\n  Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and \nglobal computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, \nthere is the potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill and that is why I urge industry to \nsupport this bill.\n  On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of \ntechnology. After all, we are still just people and right is still \nright and wrong is still wrong. Some things change and some things do \nnot. All that my bill does is say you can't use computers to steal, to \nthreaten others or conceal criminal conduct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit \nthe import, export, sale, purchase, and possession of bear viscera or \nproducts that contain or claim to contain bear viscera, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        THE BEAR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce the Bear Protection Act. \nThis measure is aimed at controlling poaching of bears such as the \nAmerican black bear which is found in Kentucky. It addresses several \nenforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are caused by a patchwork \nof State laws. The current inconsistencies enable a wildly profitable \nunderground black market for bear parts to flourish in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. \nHunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears \nkilled during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or \nbarter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear \nviscera.\n  This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in \nbear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in \nthe illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold \nand traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San \nFrancisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as \nprimary ports for export shipments of these goods.\n  Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian \nmedicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the \nincreasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears \nhas been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led \npoachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, \nfor one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be \ndecimated by poachers.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black \nbears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the \nAppalachian mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all \nthe way to the Mississippi river. Although we cannot restore the \nnumbers we once had, we can insure that the remaining bears are not \nsold for profit to the highest bidder.\n  Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is \nestimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every \nyear. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting.\n  Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is \ngreed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in \ngold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on \nthe black market.\n  Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to \naddress the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an \neffective manner. The Department of the Interior has neither the \nmanpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally in the \nUnited States. Without extensive testing, law \n\n[[Page S 9175]]\nenforcement officials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts \nhave from threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates \nthe poaching of endangered or threatened bears.\n  The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade \nin bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have \nbeen instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the \nSecretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to \nestablish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts \naimed at curtailing the international bear trade.\n  Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with \nthe poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still \nensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF BEAR VISCERA.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``bear viscera'' means the body \n     fluids or internal organs (including the gallbladder) of a \n     species of bear.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of the \nchild, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n            THE NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kassebaum, the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and \nMr. Rockefeller, to introduce legislation which seeks to ensure that \nnewborn babies and their mothers receive adequate health care in the \ncritical first few days following birth.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the first few days after birth are a \ncritical and challenging time for both the infant and the mother. At \nthis crucial stage in life, infants and their mothers truly need the \nsupport of health care providers. Yet, more and more families are \nfinding their access to health providers at this time is being limited \nseverely.\n  I say this because it is becoming common practice for health insurers \nto require that new mothers and their infants be discharged from the \nhospital 24 hours after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and 72 hours \nafter a cesarean section. In some parts of the country, the hospital \nstay for a normal delivery is being reduced to 12 hours, and there is \neven talk of cutting it back to 6 hours. And in many cases, the mother \nand infant receive no professional follow-up care at home. The American \nMedical Association has dubbled these practices ``drive-through \ndeliveries.''\n  Drive-through deliveries are not simply a matter of sending home \nmothers who are often exhausted and still in pain, and who may not have \nadequate social supports at home. They can also pose severe health \nrisks for both the infant and the mother. National medical \norganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican Medical Association, and the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, have all stated that the trend toward shorter \nhospital stays is placing the health of many newborns and mothers at \nrisk.\n  There are several reasons why they state this: First, numerous health \nproblems faced by newborns, such as dehydration and jaundice, do not \nappear until after the first 24 hours of life. Since many of these \nillnesses can only be detected by health professionals, early hospital \ndischarge can cause these conditions to go undetected, leading to brain \ndamage, strokes, or even death.\n  Second, the mother can also develop many serious health problems, \nincluding pelvic infections, breast infections, and hemorrhaging.\n  Third, a 24-hour stay does not provide sufficient opportunity for the \nmother to be taught basic infant-care skills such as breastfeeding. \nThis, combined with the fact that many mothers are simply too exhausted \nto care for their child 24 hours after delivery, often leads to \nnewborns receiving inadequate care and nourishment during their crucial \nfirst few days of life.\n  Let me assure you that these concerns are not just theoretical. A \nrange of anecdotal and scientific evidence indicates that these \nproblems are real, and growing. A researcher at Dartmouth's medical \nschool recently concluded that newborns discharged less than 2 days \nafter birth are more likely to be readmitted for jaundice, \nmalnutrition, and other problems. Physicians across the country have \nnoted a resurgence in the number of jaundiced babies they are treating. \nAnd newspapers across the country in recent weeks have relayed \ndevastating stories about how local mothers and infants have been \naffected by these policies.\n  Our bill seeks to counteract these negative effects of premature \ndischarges by ensuring that newborns and mothers receive adequate care \nduring those critical first days. It does this by requiring health \ninsurers to allow new mothers and their infants to remain in the \nhospital for a minimum of 48 hours after a normal birth and 96 hours \nafter a caesarean section. Shorter hospital stays are permitted \nprovided that neither the mother nor the attending physician object, \nand that follow-up home health care is provided for the mother and \ninfant.\n  To those who would argue that a 48-hour stay is longer than is \nmedically necessary, I would like to point out that this is a \nsignificantly shorter time than medical experts recommend for \nuncomplicated deliveries. In their guidelines for caring for newborns \nand mothers, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n[ACOG] and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend stays of 48 \nhours for uncomplicated vaginal birth, and 96 hours following a \ncaesarean birth--in addition to the day of delivery. ACOG has also \npointed out that there is inadequate evidence to prove that early \ndischarge is safe, and therefore that the recent trend toward shorter \nstays ``could be the equivalent of a large, uncontrolled, uninformed \nexperiment'' on newborns and their mothers.\n\n[[Page S 9176]]\n\n  A 48-hour minimum stay is also consistent with steps being considered \nby some States. For example, our bill is very similar to one which \nrecently was passed unanimously by the New Jersey Legislature, and \nwhich should soon be signed into law. Maryland has also recently passed \na law dealing with early discharges, and similar measures are being \nconsidered in New York and California.\n  Mr. President, insurers may argue that they will pay for stays beyond \n24 hours if there is a valid medical reason. However, many physicians \nhave told me--off the record--that it is very difficult to convince \ninsurers to grant an extension, no matter how valid the reason. They \nalso state that the final decision is often made by someone with no \nexperience in obstetrics. Finally, they state that many doctors are \nunder financial pressures to avoid having patients stay beyond the 24-\nhour limit, so they are faced with a real quandary when a patient needs \nan extension. A recent report by Maryland's Department of Health and \nMental Hygiene raises further concerns about what is considered a valid \nmedical reason. This report found that among babies who were born \nprematurely, who were not fully developed, or who were diagnosed with a \nsignificant problem, about 22 percent were discharged from the hospital \nwithin 24 hours of birth. This study was based on data from 1992. I can \nonly assume that the situation has gotten worse in the 3 years since.\n  Mr. President, there is no greater advocate for controlling health \ncare costs than this Senator. And I am impressed by some health \ninsurers' success in slowing health inflation by reducing unnecessary \ncare. At the same time, I also recognize that there is a very fine line \nbetween eliminating unnecessary care and reducing access to care which \ntruly is needed. And when we end up on the wrong side of that line--as \nI think is happening in the case of newborns and their mothers--I \nbelieve it is both appropriate and necessary for us to take steps to \nprotect the health of the American public. Concerns about controlling \ncosts are justified, but they must not be allowed to outweigh concerns \nabout doing what is best for patients. And let us not forget, Mr. \nPresident, that discharging mothers and newborns early creates its own \ncosts, the cost to insurers of treating patients for conditions which \ncould have been prevented or lessened if caught earlier, and the costs \nto the individual and society when a child suffers brain damage or \nother permanent disabilities because they did not receive adequate \nearly care.\n  Mr. President, America's newborns deserve a better welcome to the \nworld than they are getting under the present system. Their mothers \nalso deserve better. It is very important that health care costs be \ncontrolled, but the ultimate decision about health care must be based \non medical factors, not financial ones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of section 2 shall apply to all health plans \n     offered, sold, issued, or renewed after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I join today with my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Bradley, in introducing the Newborns' and \nMothers' Health Protection Act of 1995.\n  This legislation seeks to ensure that adequate care is provided to \nmothers and newborns in the critical first few days following birth. \nModeled after legislation recently considered in Maryland and passed \nunanimously by the New Jersey Legislature, it requires health insurers \nto allow new mothers and their infants to remain in the hospital for a \nminimum of 48 hours after a normal birth, and 96 hours after a cesarean \ndelivery. If the mother and the doctor agree, shorter hospital stays \nare permitted, provided that there is a follow-up visit.\n  ``Guidelines for Perinatal Care'' issued by the American Academy of \nPediatrics [AAP] and the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists [ACOG] state that in uncomplicated deliveries the \npostpartum hospital stay should range from 48 hours for vaginal births \nto 96 hours for cesarean sections, exclusive of the day of delivery.\n  However, as hospitalization costs continue to climb, it has become \nincreasingly common for health insurers to require that new mothers and \ntheir babies be discharged from the hospital 24 hours after birth. In \nsome parts of the country, hospital stays for a routine delivery can be \nas short as 12 hours.\n  The American Medical Association [AMA], ACOG, and the Academy of \nPediatrics all have stated that the trend toward shorter hospital stays \nis placing the health of newborns and their mothers at risk.\n  Early hospital discharges have caused conditions such as jaundice--\nthat do not appear until after the first 24 hours of life and which may \nlead to brain damage--to go undetected.\n  A 24-hour stay is often too short for new mothers to be taught basic \ninfant care skills, such as breastfeeding. And many mothers are not \nphysically capable of providing for a newborn's needs 24 hours after \ngiving birth. This can lead to inadequate nourishment during a child's \ncrucial first few days of life.\n  Mr. President, I must say that I have agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation \n\n[[Page S 9177]]\nwith some reservation. I generally view any effort to influence private \ncontracting arrangements with great skepticism. However, I view this \nsituation as limited and unique. What is at stake here is not merely an \nimpediment to the traditional doctor-patient relationship, but instead \nthe health and safety of millions of America's children.\n  My primary concern is that the most recent trend toward shorter \nhospital stays appears to be motivated primarily by financial \nconsiderations--instead of sound medicine.\n  In calling for a moratorium on shorter hospital stays last week, ACOG \nstated that:\n\n       The routine imposition of a short and arbitrary time limit \n     on hospital stays that does not take maternal and infant need \n     into account could be equivalent to a large, uncontrolled, \n     uninformed experiment that may potentially affect the health \n     of American women and their babies.\n\n  Like ACOG, I fear that insurers may be acting prematurely, without \nsufficient information about the long-term health implications of \nshorter hospital stays. As more conclusive data becomes available, I \nwould be open to revisiting this issue. Until then, I believe we should \nproceed with caution.\n  I strongly believe that decisions regarding early discharge must be \nindividualized and should place primary emphasis on the health of a \nmother and her child. I believe that the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will help restore that perspective to this important \ndecision.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Ashcroft):\n  S. 971. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \ngovernmental discrimination in the training and licensing of health \nprofessionals on the basic of the refusal to undergo or provide \ntraining in the performance of induced abortions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the medical training nondiscrimination act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I introduce the Medical Training \nNondiscrimination Act of 1995. This bill would prevent any State or \nFederal Government from discriminating against a health care provider \nbecause that provider does not perform induced abortions or train its \nob-gyn residents to perform induced abortions.\n  It is, quite frankly, disturbing to me that this legislation is even \nnecessary. I would venture that few of my colleagues could believe that \nour society is anywhere near to condoning a requirement that any person \nor any hospital be required to perform abortions or offer training in \nabortions.\n  Indeed, as it stands now, our proud tradition of tolerance toward \nthose who abhor abortion and any participation in that act, has \ngenerally protected hospitals from having to provide or train \nabortions. In fact, only 12 percent of hospitals now require training \nin induced abortion. A third more do not offer any such training and \nthe rest offer it only as an option. Of course, those programs still \nare required to train residents to manage medical and surgical \ncomplications of pregnancy. And that includes training procedures than \nmight in the case save the life of the mother, as well as training D \nand C procedures involving preborn children that died as a result of a \nspontaneous abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth.\n  But all this will change now that the Accreditation Council for \nGraduate Medical Education [ACGME] has voted to require all hospitals \nto train or arrange for training in induced abortion. The press has \nindicated that training in late-term, second-trimester abortions would \nbe required. The ACGME has proposed to make exceptions only in the case \nof an institution that can formulate a cohesive, institutional \nobjection based on religious or moral principles.\n  What is particularly shocking is that the Federal Government no only \ncondones this compulsion but actually punishes those who do not submit. \nHere's how: Failure to do the abortion training could result in loss of \naccreditation by the ACGME. Loss of accreditation would result in loss \nof Federal funding. For example, Medicare will not reimburse the Part A \ncosts of intern and resident services if the teaching program is not \naccredited. Further, ob-gyn residents in a program not accredited by \nthe ACGME are ineligible for deferral of repayment on Federal Health \nEducation Assistance Loans [HEAL]. The HEAL loan program is \nreauthorized in S. 555, now before the Senate.\n  Why the change in the standards? Internal correspondence with the \nACGME panel suggests that the policy change was motivated by concern \nover the declining number of doctors willing to perform abortions and \nthe need to destigmatize abortion providers. This concern over the \nstigmatization of abortion providers was dramatically characterized \nduring the debate on the Foster nomination when one ``pro-choice'' \nSenator demanded an apology from another pro-life Senator who had \n``defamed'' Dr. Foster by calling him an abortionist. Would an apology \nhave been demanded if Dr. Foster had been called a heart surgeon or a \npodiatrist? No, there remains substantial negative stigma associated \nwith being an abortion provider--stigma that might be eliminated if all \nobstetricians and gynecologists had to perform abortions as part of \ntheir residency training.\n  The Medical Training Nondiscrimination Act of 1995 would protect the \ncivil rights of health care providers by preventing the Government from \ndiscriminating against any health care provider on the basis that it \nwill not perform, train, or undergo training to perform an induced \nabortion. Discriminatory actions include denial of any benefit, \nassistance, or license, and the conditioning of such benefit, \nassistance, or license on the provider's compliance with accredition \nstandards that require the performance, training, or arranging for \ntraining of induced abortions. The amendment applies only to State \naction and does not proscribe a private accrediting body from requiring \nabortion training.\n  Providers who choose to offer abortion training, and individuals who \nseek abortion training, may continue to do so. The amendment does not \nprevent any program from offering abortion training.\n  Providers will continue to train the management of complications of \ninduced abortion as well as train to handle situation involving \nmiscarriage and stillbirth or a threat to the life of the mother. The \namendment requires no change in the practice of good obstetrics and \ngynecology.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support. On the House side \nCongressman Hoekstra, LaFalce, Volkmer, Coburn, and Weldon have \nintroduced identical language in the House following hearings.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and protect the rights of health \nproviders against Federal and State government action that forces them \nto become involved in training or providing induced abortions against \ntheir will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of all certified nurse practioners and \nclinical nurse specialists services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Medicaid nursing incentive act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicaid \nNursing Incentive Act of 1995, a bill to provide direct Medicaid \nreimbursement to nurse practitioners.\n  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of \ncost-effective primary care to our Nation's most needy citizens.\n  Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year \ndo without the health care services they need, because physicians \nsimply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural \nand urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south \ncentral Los Angeles and Lemmon, SD.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent \nyears an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to \ncare for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner city and \nrural communities where they live. Fortunately, there is an exception \nto this trend: Nurse practitioners frequently accept patients whom \nothers will not treat and serve in areas where others refuse to work.\n  Studies have shown that nurse practitioners provide care that both \npatients and cost cutters can praise. Their advanced clinical training \nenables them to assume responsibility for up to 80 percent of the \nprimary care services usually performed by physicians, many times at a \nlower cost and with a high level of patient satisfaction.\n  Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse \npractitioners. For more than a decade, CHAMPUS has provided direct \npayment to nurse practioners. In 1990, Congress mandated direct payment \nfor nurse practitioner services under the Federal employee health \nbenefit plan. Recent legislation has required direct Medicare \nreimbursement for nurse practitioners practicing in rural areas and \ndirect Medicaid reimbursement for family nurse practitioners.\n  Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the \nMedicaid program and its beneficiaries; there is a broader lesson here \nthat applies to our search for ways to make cost-effective, high-\nquality health care services available and accessible to all of our \ncitizens.\n  One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of \nprimary\n and preventive care, delivered to individuals in convenient, familiar \nplaces where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 million of \nour Nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--in home \nhealth agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and schools.\n\n  In places like my home State of South Dakota, nurses are often the \nonly health care professionals available in the small towns and rural \ncounties across the State.\n  These nurses and other nonphysican health professionals play an \nimportant role in the delivery of care. And, this role will increase as \nwe move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment of illness \nto one that emphasizes primary care and health promotion.\n  But, first we must revaluate outdated attitudes and break down \nbarriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their \ntraining and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health \nProfessions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being \nfully utilized to deliver primary care services and recommended \neliminating fiscal discrimination by paying them directly for the \nservices they provide. This step will help nurse practitioners provide \nthe access to primary care that so many communities currently lack.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the measure I am \nintroducing today, recognizing the important role that nurse \npractitioners and other nonphysician health professionals can play in \nour health care delivery system and the increasing contribution they \ncan make in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MEDICAID COVERAGE OF ALL CERTIFIED NURSE \n                   PRACTITIONER AND CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1905(a)(21) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(21)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(21) services furnished by a certified nurse practitioner \n     (as defined by the Secretary) or clinical nurse specialist \n     (as defined in subsection (t)) which the certified nurse \n     practitioner or clinical nurse specialist is legally \n     authorized to perform under State law (or the State \n     regulatory mechanism provided by State law), whether or not \n     the certified nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist \n     is under the supervision of, or associated with, a physician \n     or other health care provider;''\n       (b) Clinical Nurse Specialist Defined.--Section 1905 of \n     such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(t) The term `clinical nurse specialist' means an \n     individual who--\n       ``(1) is a registered nurse and is licensed to practice \n     nursing in the State in which the clinical nurse specialist \n     services are performed; and\n       ``(2) holds a master's degree in a defined area of clinical \n     nursing from an accredited educational institution.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall become effective with respect to payments for calendar \n     quarters beginning on or after January 1, 1996.\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle \nas a cosponsor of the Medicaid Nursing Incentive Act of 1995. This \nlegislation would provide direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists for services they provide \nwithin their scope of practice, regardless of whether these services \nare performed under the supervision of a physician.\n  With the current shortage of primary health care services in our \nNation, millions of Americans are without essential health services. \nMedicaid recipients are particularly vulnerable.\n  By allowing direct Medicaid reimbursement to nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists, I believe that this legislation will not \nonly improve access to much needed health care services, but will \nstrengthen our health care delivery system. A number of recent studies \nhave documented the important roles that nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists play in providing cost-effective, quality \nhealth care services. For example, a December 1986 study by the Office \nof Technology Assessment detailed the significant contributions nurse \npractitioners have made in reducing health care costs, improving the \nquality of care, and increasing the accessibility of services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It will enhance \naccess to \n\n[[Page S 9179]]\ncost-effective, quality care for individuals with limited access to \nhealth care services.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 973. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of residential ground rents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the residential ground rents act of 1995\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great \nimportance to Hawaii's leasehold homeowners. In fiscal year 1992, at my \nrequest, the Congress appropriated $400,000 to study the feasibility of \nreforming the Internal Revenue Code to address ground lease rent \npayments and to determine what role, if any, the Federal Government \nshould play in encouraging lease to fee conversions. The nationwide \nstudy was conducted by the Hawaii Real Estate and Research Center.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on the \nrecommendations of this study. The bill would: First, provide a \nmortgage interest deduction for residential leasehold properties by \nallowing the nonredeemable ground lease rents to be claimed as an \ninterest deduction; and, second, include a tax credit for up to $5,000 \nfor certain transaction costs on the transfer of certain residential \nleasehold land for a 5-year period, ending on December 31, 1999. \nTransaction costs include closing costs, attorneys' fees, surveys, and \nappraisals, and telephone, office, and travel expenses.\n  In most private home ownership situations in this country, a \nhomeowner owns both the building and land. Under a leasehold \narrangement a homeowner owns the building--single-family home, \ncondominium, or cooperative apartment--on leased land. The research \nconducted under the leasehold study shows that residential leaseholds \nare not uncommon in other parts of the United States and elsewhere in \nthe world. Residential leaseholds exist in places such as Baltimore, \nMD, Irvine, CA, native American lands in Palm Springs, CA, Fairhope, \nAL, Pearl River Basin, MS, and New York, NY.\n  The study further indicates that there are few States that regulate \nresidential leaseholds. Of those that do, the most common requirement \napplies only to condominium or time share units and is one requiring \nadequate disclosure of the lease terms. For the most part, States are \nunaware of any leasehold problems in their jurisdictions. However, \nresidential leaseholds have proven to be problematic for the State of \nHawaii.\n  The formation of Hawaii's land tenure system can be traced back to \n1778 when British Capt. James Cook made his first contact with the \nHawaiian civilization. Leasing was the preferred system to maintain \ncontrol and retain a portfolio asset value. Residential leaseholds were \nfirst developed on the Island of Oahu after World War II. Population \nincreases created a demand for housing and other types of real estate \ndevelopment. Federal income tax policy encouraged the retention of land \nto avoid payment of large capital gains taxes.\n  Hawaii's land tenure system is now anomalous to the rest of the \nUnited States because of the concentration of land in the hands of \ngovernment, large charitable trusts, large agriculturally-based \ncompanies and owners of small parcels or urban properties.\n  High land prices and high renegotiated rents continue to create \ninstability in Hawaii's residential leasehold system. In 1967, the \nHawaii State legislature enacted a land reform act which did not become \neffective until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1984 decision, Hawaii \nHousing Authority versus Midkiff. The act and the Supreme Court \ndecision basically divided the market into a ``single-family home \nmarket in which leaseholds were subject to mandatory conversion, and a \nleasehold condominium market which did not come within the scope of the \nlaw.''\n  Mandatory conversions on the single-family home market occurred from \n1979 to 1982, and 1986 to 1990. As of 1992, there are approximately \n4,600 single-family homes remaining in residential leaseholds. However, \nresolution over condominium leasehold reform remains uncertain. In \n1990, the Honolulu City Council enacted legislation that would cap \nlease rent increases. The law was challenged in Federal district court \nas to its validity and eventually ruled as unconstitutional because the \nformula it used to arrive at permitted lease rent was irrational.\n  In 1991, due to the State legislature's unwillingness to address the \nleasehold problems, the Honolulu City Council again enacted a mandatory \nleasehold conversion law for leasehold condominiums (Ordinance 01-95). \nThe law is currently being challenged in the Federal courts as to its \nconstitutionality. Another bill which linked lease rent increases with \nthe Consumer Price Index and the level of disposable income available \nto condominium owners was also considered. This bill, similar to the \none enacted in 1990, was found to be unconstitutional.\n  The uncertainty in the residential leasehold market continues to \ncreate emotional distress for the leasehold residents of Hawaii. \nVoluntary conversion has helped to ease the situation and substantially \nreduce the stock of leasehold residential units in Hawaii. Yet, \nvoluntary conversion is not enough to resolve the residential leasehold \nproblems.\n  My legislation will help reduce the economic hardship due to the \nuncertainty in Hawaii's residential leasehold system. The leasehold \nstudy contains an analysis of the tax revenue effects of this \nlegislation by allowing individual tax deductions for residential \nground rent. The analysis suggests that there is potential revenues to \nthe Federal Government if this legislation is enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit certain acts involving the use of \ncomputers in the furtherance of crimes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE ANTI-ELECTRONIC RACKETEERING ACT\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the \nAnti-electronic Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important \nchanges to RICO and criminalizes deliberately using computer technology \nto engage in criminal activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, \nmeasured and strong response to a growing problem. According to the \ncomputer emergency and response team at Carnegie-Mellon University, \nduring 1994, about 40,000 computer users were attacked. Virus hacker, \nthe FBI's national computer crime squad has investigated over 200 cases \nsince 1991. So, computer crime is clearly on the rise.\n  Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever \nman develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. \nAnd that is why I have introduced this bill. I believe we need to \nseriously reconsider the Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward \nmodernizing existing statutes and creating new ones. In other words, \nMr. President, Elliot Ness needs to meet the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology \nAssessment. That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has \nentered cyberspace in a big way. International drug cartels use \ncomputers to launder drug money and terrorists like the Oklahoma City \nbombers use computers to conspire to commit crimes.\n  Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year. \nAnd often times, there is little that can be done about this because \nthe computer used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under \nmy bill, overseas computer users who employ their computers to commit \nfraud in the United States would be fully subject to the Federal \ncriminal laws. Also under my bill, Mr. President, the wire fraud \nstatute which has been successfully used by prosecutors for many users, \nwill be amended to make fraudulent schemes which use computers a crime.\n  It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also\n   have to reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that \nprosecutors must overcome. For instance, in the typical case, \nprosecutors must identify a location in order to get a wiretapping \norder. But in cyberspace, it is often impossible to determine the \nlocation. And so my bill corrects that so that if prosecutors cannot, \nwith the exercise of effort, give the court a location, then those \nprosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. And for law enforcers--\nboth State and Federal--who have seized a computer which contains both \ncontraband or evidence and purely private material, I have created a \ngood-faith standard so that law enforcers are not shackled by undue \nrestrictions but will also be punished for bad faith.\n\n  Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and \nglobal computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, \nthere is the potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill and that is why I urge industry to \nsupport this bill.\n  On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of \ntechnology. After all, we are still just people and right is still \nright and wrong is still wrong. Some things change and some things do \nnot. All that my bill does is say you can't use computers to steal, to \nthreaten others or conceal criminal conduct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

CHARTER--50 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, June 26, 1995, marked the \n50-year anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter. To commemorate \nthe event, President Clinton traveled to San Francisco to participate \nin ceremonies at the very site where representatives of some 50 nations \nfirst gathered to hammer out that historic document.\n  Mr. President, I believed that President Clinton spoke for all of us \nyesterday when he said:\n\n       Today we honor the men and women who gave shape to the \n     United Nations. We celebrate 50 years of achievement. We \n     commit ourselves to real reforms. We reject the siren song of \n     the new isolationists. We set a clear agenda worthy of the \n     visions of our founders. The measure of our generation will \n     be whether we give up because we cannot achieve a perfect \n     world or strive on to build a better world.\n\n  In recalling that historic day, President Clinton reminded listeners \nas well that, ``The 50 nations who came here * * * to lift the world \nfrom the ashes of war * * * included giants of diplomacy and untested \nleaders of infant nations. They were separated by tradition, race and \nlanguage, sharing only a vision of a better safer future.'' It was that \nshared vision, in the final analysis, that made it possible to set \naside differences, grievances and suspicions. It was that shared vision \nthat empowered conference participants to craft a charter that \nPresident Truman described as, ``a declaration of great faith by the \nnations of the Earth--faith that war is not inevitable, faith that \npeace can be maintained.'' I believe that all freedom loving peoples of \nthe world continue to share that same faith and vision today.\n  Much has transpired since that day, in 1945, when the 50 founding \nnations of the United Nations pledged their faith and cooperation in \nthis new world organization. Today, the U.N. family has grown nearly \nfourfold to 184 member states. Many of the old threats to peace have \nreceded only to be replaced by new and more intractable ones. And, \ndespite the many criticisms leveled against the United Nations, member \nstates have largely heeded the words expressed by President Truman, in \nspeaking about the charter that had just been signed, ``You have \ncreated a great instrument for peace and security and human progress in \nthe world. The world must now use it''.\n  Much has been accomplished by the United Nations during its first 50 \nyears. Even its severest critics have to acknowledge that during the \ncold war, the United Nations served to mitigate the ideological \nconflict between East and West that threatened the world with nuclear \nchaos. It also smoothed the path for new nation states seeking to break \nwith old, outdated colonial empires.\n  The United Nation's various affiliate agencies have served to make \nthe world a better place to live. The world health organization, to \nmention but one, has been a major player in the world-wide campaign to \neradicate smallpox, measles, polio, and other dreaded but preventable \ndiseases. The accomplishments of the United Nations have been \nrecognized and honored by the world community. On four separate \noccasions, U.N. activities and agencies have been recipients of Nobel \npeace prizes--the blue helmet peacekeepers, the U.N. Children's Fund, \nthe U.N. Office of High Commissioner for Refugees.\n  Clearly the world is a different place than it was 50 years age. The \nacts of aggression and threats to peace once posed by the East/West \nconflict have been replaced by a growing number of equally bedeviling \nethnic rivalries, civil wars and humanitarian calamities throughout the \nglobe. The demands on the United Nations for policing these conflicts, \nfor marshaling humanitarian aid, for dispensing economic and social \nservices in response to these events, have grown geometrically--and so \ntoo have the financial costs associated with them.\n  Some of the criticism leveled against the United Nations have been \nunfair. In the final analysis, the United Nations is only as strong and \ndecisive as its membership. In the final analysis it can only continue \nto undertake activities that its membership is\n willing and able to support, both financially and politically.\n\n  However, the United Nations and U.N. management must share some of \nthe responsibility for the criticisms that have arisen. Some of the \nmore problematic endeavors clearly fall in the peacekeeping arena--\nBosnia, Somalia, and others. Organizationally and managerially there \nhave been problems, as well, throughout the U.N. system. Historically, \ninternal financial controls and safeguards have been inadequate and \nineffective in ensuring that members' contributions have been \n\n[[Page S 9187]]\njudiciously spent, with U.N. procurement fairly allocated among \ncontributors.\n  There is clearly consensus within the U.N. membership that reforms \nshould and must be undertaken. The United Nations has already made \nprogress in implementing some of these reforms. Still more will have to \noccur in order to strengthen its capacity to address the challenges of \nthe coming decade. Despite its shortcomings and problems, however, I \ncontinue to believe, Mr. President, that President Truman's fundamental \nconclusion about the United Nations some 50 years ago remains true \ntoday: ``The charter of the United Nations which you have signed is a \nsolid structure upon which we can build a better world.'' We must \nendeavor to do just that--build a better and safer world for our \nchildren and grandchildren. A vibrant and effective United Nations can \nhelp us to accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of President Clinton's \nremarks yesterday in San Francisco be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                        Remarks by the President\n\n       Thank you very much. Secretary Christopher, Mr. Secretary \n     General, Ambassador Albright, Bishop Tutu. My good friend, \n     Maya Angelou, thank you for your magnificent poem. \n     (Applause.) Delegates to the Charter Conference, \n     distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps, the President \n     of Poland, members of Congress, honored guests, Mayor Jordan, \n     Mr. Shorenstein, people of San Francisco, and friends of the \n     United Nations:\n       The 800 delegates from 50 nations who came here 50 years \n     ago to lift the world from the ashes of war and bring life to \n     the dreams of peacemakers included both giants of diplomacy \n     and untested leaders of infant nations. They were separated \n     by tradition, race and language, sharing only a vision of a \n     better, safer future. On this day 50 years ago, the dreams \n     President Roosevelt did not live to see of a democratic \n     organization of the world was launched.\n       The Charter the delegate signed reflected the harsh lessons \n     of their experience; the experience of the '30s, in which the \n     world watched and reacted too slowly to fascist aggression, \n     bringing millions sacrificed on the battlefields and millions \n     more murdered in the death chambers.\n       Those who had gone through this and the second world war \n     knew that celebrating victory was not enough; that merely \n     punishing the enemy was self-defeating; that instead the \n     world needed an effective and permanent system to promote \n     peace and freedom for everyone. Some of those who worked at \n     that historic conference are still here today, including our \n     own Senator Claiborne Pell, who to this very day, every day, \n     carries a copy of the U.N. Charter in his pocket. (Applause.)\n       I would last like to ask all of the delegates to the \n     original conference who are here today to rise and be \n     recognized. Would you please stand? (Applause.)\n       San Francisco gave the world renewed confidence and hope \n     for the future. On that day President Truman said, ``This is \n     proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, \n     can face them, and than can find common ground on which to \n     stand.'' Five decades later, we see how very much the world \n     has changed. The Cold War has given way to freedom and \n     cooperation. On this very day, a Russian spacecraft and an \n     American spacecraft are preparing to link in orbit some 240 \n     miles above the Earth. From Jericho to Belfast, ancient \n     enemies are searching together for peace. On every continent \n     nations are struggling to embrace democracy, freedom and \n     prosperity. New technologies move people and ideas around the \n     world, creating vast new reservoirs of opportunity.\n       Yet we know that these new forces of integration also carry \n     within them the seeds of disintegration and destruction. New \n     technologies and greater openness make all our\n      borders more vulnerable to terrorists, to dangerous weapons, \n     to drug traffickers. Newly-independent nations offer rip \n     targets for international terminals and nuclear smugglers. \n     Fluid capital markets make it easier for nations to build \n     up their economies, but also make it much easier for one \n     nation's troubles first to be exaggerated, then to spread \n     to other nations.\n       Today, to be sure, we face no Hitler, no Stalin, but we do \n     have enemies--enemies who share their contempt for human life \n     and human dignity and the rule of law; enemies who put lethal \n     technology to lethal use, who seek personal gains in age-old \n     conflicts and new divisions.\n       Our generation's enemies are the terrorists and their \n     outlaw nation sponsors--people who kill children or turn them \n     into orphans; people who target innocent people in order to \n     prevent peace; people who attack peacemakers, as our friend \n     President Mubarak was attacked just a few hours ago; people \n     who in the name of nationalism slaughter those of different \n     faiths or tribes, and drive their survivors from their own \n     homelands.\n       Their reach is increased by technology. Their communication \n     is abetted by global media. Their actions reveal the age-old \n     lack of conscience, scruples and morality which have \n     characterized the forces of destruction throughout history.\n       Today, the threat to our security is not in an enemy silo, \n     but in the briefcase or the car bomb of a terrorist. Our \n     enemies are also international criminals and drug traffickers \n     who threaten the stability of new democracies and the future \n     of our children. Our enemies are the force of natural \n     destruction--encroaching deserts that threaten the Earth's \n     balance, famines that test the human spirit, deadly new \n     diseases that endanger whole societies.\n       So, my friends, in this increasingly interdependent world, \n     we have more common opportunities and more common enemies \n     than ever before. It is, therefore, in our interest to face \n     them together as partners, sharing the burdens and costs, and \n     increasing our chances of success.\n       Just months before his death, President Roosevelt said, \n     ``We have learned that we cannot live alone at peace, that \n     our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other \n     nations far away.'' Today, more than ever, those words ring \n     true. Yet some here in our own country, where the United \n     Nations was founded, dismissed Roosevelt's wisdom. Some of \n     them acknowledge that the United States must play a strong \n     role overseas, but refuse to supply the nonmilitary resources \n     our nation needs to carry on its responsibilities. Others \n     believe that outside our border America should only act \n     alone.\n       Well, of course, the United States must be prepared to act \n     alone when necessary, but we dare not ignore the benefits \n     that coalitions bring to this nation. We dare not reject \n     decades of bipartisan wisdom. We dare not reject decades of \n     bipartisan support for international cooperation. Those who \n     would do so, these new isolationists, dismiss 50 years of \n     hard evidence.\n       In those years we've seen the United Nations compile a \n     remarkable record of progress that advances our nation's \n     interest and, indeed, the interest of people everywhere. From \n     President Truman in Korea to President Bush in the Persian \n     Gulf, America has built United Nations' military coalitions \n     to contain aggressors. U.N. forces also often pick up where \n     United States' troops have taken the lead.\n       As the Secretary of State said, we saw it just yesterday, \n     when Haiti held parliamentary and local elections with the \n     help of U.N. personnel. We saw the U.N. work in partnership \n     with the United States and the people of Haiti, as they labor \n     to create a democracy. And they have now been given a second \n     chance to renew that promise.\n       On every continent the United Nations has played a vital \n     role in making people more free and more secure. For decades, \n     the U.N. fought to isolate South Africa, as that regime \n     perpetuated apartheid. Last year, under the watchful eyes of \n     U.N. observers, millions of South Africans who had been \n     disenfranchised for life cast their first votes for freedom.\n       In Namibia, Mozambique, and soon we hope in Angola, the \n     United Nations is helping people to bury decades of civil \n     strife and turn their energies into building new democratic \n     nations. In Cambodia, where a brutal regime left more than \n     one million dead in the Killing Fields, the U.N. helped \n     hundreds of thousands of refugees return to their native \n     land, and stood watch over democratic elections that brought \n     90 percent of the people to the polls. In El Salvador, the \n     U.N. brokered an end to 12 years of bloody civil war, and \n     stayed on to help reform the army and bring justice to the \n     citizens and open the doors of democracy.\n       From the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean, U.N. economic and \n     political sanctions have proved to be a valuable means short \n     of military action to isolate regimes and to make aggressors \n     and terrorists pay at least a price for their actions: In \n     Iraq, to help stop that nation from developing weapons of \n     mass destruction, or threatening its neighbors again. In the \n     Balkans, to isolate aggressors; in North Africa, to pressure \n     Libya to turn over for trial those indicted in the bombing of \n     Pan Am flight 103.\n       The record of the United Nations includes a proud battle \n     for child survival, and against human suffering and disease \n     of all kinds. Every year UNICEF oral vaccines save the lives \n     of three million children. Last year alone the World Food \n     Program, using the contributions of many governments \n     including our own, fed 57 million hungry people. The World \n     Health Organization has eliminated smallpox from the face of \n     the Earth, and is making great strides in its campaign to \n     eliminate polio by the year 2000. It has helped to contain \n     fatal diseases like the Ebola virus that could have \n     threatened an entire continent.\n       To millions around the world, the United Nations is not \n     what we see on our news programs at night. Instead it's the \n     meal that keeps a child from going to bed hungry, the \n     knowledge that helps a farmer coax strong crops from hard \n     land, the shelter that keeps a family together when they're \n     displaced by war or natural disasters.\n       In the last 50 years, these remarkable stories have been \n     too obscured, and the capacity of the United Nations to act \n     too limited by the Cold War. As colonial rule broke down, \n     differences between developing and industrialized nations and \n     regional rivalries added new tensions to the United Nations \n     so that too often there was too much invective and too little \n     debate in the general assembly.\n       But now the end of the Cold War, the strong trend toward \n     democratic ideals among all nations, the emergence of so many \n     problems that can best be met by collective \n\n[[Page S 9188]]\n     action, all these things enable the United Nations at this 50-year \n     point finally to fulfill the promise of its founders.\n       But if we want the U.N. to do so, we must face the fact \n     that for all its successes and all its possibilities, it does \n     not work as well as it should. The United Nations must be \n     reformed. In this age of relentless change, successful \n     governments and corporations are constantly reducing their \n     bureaucracies, setting clearer priorities, focusing on \n     targeted results.\n       In the United States we have eliminated hundreds of \n     programs, thousands of regulations. We're reducing our \n     government to its smallest size since President Kennedy \n     served here, while increasing our efforts in areas most \n     critical to our future. The U.N. must take similar steps.\n       Over the years it has grown too bloated, too often \n     encouraging duplication, and spending resources on meetings \n     rather than results. As its board of directors, all of us--\n     we, the member states--must create a U.N. that is more \n     flexible, that operates more rapidly, that wastes less and \n     produces more, and most importantly, that inspires confidence \n     among our governments and our people.\n       In the last few years we have seen some good reforms--a new \n     oversight office to hold down costs, a new system to review \n     personnel, a start toward modernization and privatization. \n     But we must do more.\n       The United Nations supports the proposal of the President \n     of the General Assembly, Mr. Essyi, who spoke so eloquently \n     here earlier this morning, to prepare a blueprint for \n     renewing the U.N. and to approve it before the 50th General \n     Assembly finishes its work next fall.\n       We must consider major structural changes. The United \n     Nations simply does not need a separate agency with its own \n     acronym, stationery and bureaucracy for every problem. The \n     new U.N. must peel off what doesn't work and get behind what \n     will.\n       We must also realize, in particular, the limits to \n     peacekeeping and not ask the Blue Helmets to undertake \n     missions they cannot be expected to handle. Peacekeeping can \n     only succeed when the parties to a conflict understand they \n     cannot profit from war. We have too often asked our \n     peacekeepers to work miracles while denying them the military \n     and political support required, and the modern command-and-\n     control systems they need to do their job as safely and \n     effectively as possible. Today's U.N. must be ready to handle \n     tomorrow's challenges. Those of us who most respect the U.N. \n     must lead the charge of reform.\n       Not all the critics of today's United Nations are \n     isolationists. Many are supporters who gladly would pay for \n     the U.N.'s essential work if they were convinced their money \n     was being well-spent. But I pledge to all of you, as we work \n     together to improve the United Nations, I will continue to \n     work to see that the United States takes the lead in paying \n     its fair share of our common load. (Applause.)\n       Meanwhile, we must all remember that the United Nations is \n     a reflection of the world it represents. Therefore, it will \n     remain far from perfect. It will not be able to solve all \n     problems. But even those it cannot solve, it may well be able \n     to limit in terms of the scope and reach of the problem, and \n     it may well be able to limit the loss of human life until the \n     time for solution comes.\n       So just as withdrawing from the world is impossible, \n     turning our backs on the U.N. is no solution. It would be \n     shortsighted and self-destructive. It would strengthen the \n     forces of global disintegration. It would threaten the \n     security, the interest and the values of the American people. \n     So I say especially to the opponents of the United Nations \n     here in the United States, turning our back on the U.N. and \n     going it alone will lead to far more economic, political and \n     military burdens on our people in the future and would ignore \n     the lessons of our own history. (Applause.)\n       Instead, on this 50th anniversary of the charter signing, \n     let us renew our vow to live together as good neighbors. And \n     let us agree on a new United Nations agenda to increase \n     confidence and ensure support for the United Nations, and to \n     advance peace and prosperity for the next 50 years.\n       First and foremost, the U.N. must strengthen its efforts to \n     isolate states and people who traffic in terror, and support \n     those who continue to take risks for peace in the face of \n     violence. The bombing in Oklahoma City, the deadly gas attack \n     in Tokyo, the struggles to establish peace in the Middle East \n     and in Northern Ireland--all of these things remind us that \n     we must stand against terror and support those who move away \n     from it. Recent discoveries of laboratories working to \n     produce biological weapons for terrorists demonstrate the \n     dangerous link between terrorism and the weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       In 1937, President Roosevelt called for a quarantine \n     against aggressions, to keep the infection of fascism from \n     seeping into the bloodstream of humanity. Today, we should \n     quarantine the terrorists, the terrorist groups, and the \n     nations that support terrorism. (Applause.)\n       Where nations and groups honestly seek to reform, to \n     change, to move away from the killing of innocents, we should \n     support them. But when they are unrepentant in the delivery \n     of death, we should stand tall against them (Applause.) My \n     friends, there is no easy way around the hard question: If \n     nations and groups are not willing to move away from the \n     delivery of death, we should put aside short-term profits for \n     the people in our countries to stop, stop their conduct. \n     (Applause.)\n       Second, the U.N. must continue our efforts to stem the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There are some \n     things nations can do on their own. The U.S. and Russia today \n     are destroying our nuclear arsenals rapidly. (Applause.) But \n     the U.N. must also play a role. We were honored to help \n     secure an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty under U.N. auspices. (Applause.)\n       We rely on U.N. agencies to monitor nations bent on \n     acquiring nuclear capabilities. We must work together on the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. We must strengthen our common \n     efforts to fight biological weapons. We must do everything we \n     can to limit the spread of fissile materials. We must work on \n     conventional weapons like the land mines that are the curse \n     of children the world over. (Applause.) And we must complete \n     a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. (Applause.)\n       Third, we must support through the United Nations the fight \n     against manmade and natural forces of disintegration, from \n     crime syndicates and drug cartels, to new diseases and \n     disappearing forests. These enemies are elusive; they cross \n     borders at will. Nations can and must oppose them alone. But \n     we know, and the Cairo Conference reaffirmed, that the most \n     effective opposition requires strong international \n     cooperation and mutual support.\n       Fourth, we must reaffirm our commitment to strengthen U.N. \n     peacekeeping as an important tool for deterring, containing \n     and ending violent conflict. The U.N. can never be an \n     absolute guarantor of peace, but it can reduce human \n     suffering and advance the odds of peace.\n       Fifth--you may clap for that--(applause.) Fifth, we must \n     continue what is too often the least noticed of the U.N.'s \n     missions; its unmatched efforts on the front lines of the \n     battle for child survival and against disease and human \n     suffering.\n       And finally, let us vote to make the United Nations an \n     increasing strong voice for the protection of fundamental \n     human dignity and human rights. After all, they were at the \n     core of the founding of this great organization. (Applause.)\n       Today we honor the men and women who gave shape to the \n     United Nations. We celebrate 50 years of achievement. We \n     commit ourselves to real reforms. We reject the siren song of \n     the new isolationists. We set a clear agenda worthy of the \n     vision of our founders. The measure of our generation will be \n     whether we give up because we cannot achieve a perfect world \n     or strive on to build a better world.\n       Fifty years ago today, President Truman reminded the \n     delegates that history had not ended with Hitler's defeat. He \n     said, it is easier to remove tyrants and destroy \n     concentration camps than it is to kill the ideas which give \n     them birth. Victory on the battlefield was essential, but it \n     is not good enough for a lasting, good peace. (Applause.)\n       Today we know that history has not ended with the Cold War. \n     We know, and we have learned from painful evidence, that as \n     long as there are people on the face of the Earth, \n     imperfection and evil will be a part of human nature; there \n     will be killing, cruelty, self-destructive abuse of our \n     natural environment, denial of the problems that face us all. \n     But we also know that here today, in this historic chamber, \n     the challenge of building a good and lasting peace is in our \n     hands and success is within our reach.\n       Let us not forget that each child saved, each refugee \n     housed, each disease prevented, each barrier to justice \n     brought down, each sword turned into a ploughshare, brings us \n     closer to the vision of our founders--closer to peace, closer \n     to freedom, closer to dignity. (Applause.)\n       So my fellow citizens of the world, let us not lose heart. \n     Let us gain renewed strength and energy and vigor from the \n     progress which has been made and the opportunities which are \n     plainly before us. Let us say no to isolation, yes to reform; \n     yes to a brave, ambitious new agenda; most of all, yes to the \n     dream of the United Nations.\n       Thank you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9186-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9188-S9189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO GEN. GORDON R. SULLIVAN, USA, ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as the U.S. Army undergoes a change \nin its top military leadership, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding service of the Army's 32d Chief of Staff, Gen. Gordon R. \nSullivan. Throughout his tenure as the Army Chief of Staff, General \nSullivan has worked closely with the Congress and we have found his \nprofessional military advice invaluable. He is retiring from the Army \nafter more than 35 years of service to our Nation.\n  General Sullivan has had the unenviable task of leading the Army \nthrough its largest downsizing in 50 years, while simultaneously \npreparing the Army for the new challenges of the next century. As a \ntestament to the success of his efforts, General Sullivan is leaving an \nArmy that is trained, disciplined, and proud. His focus on taking care \nof soldiers and their families, on education, and on promoting both \n\n[[Page S 9189]]\nrealistic field exercises and increasing the use of simulation has made \nthe Army ready for what the 21st century may bring. General Sullivan \nhas put forth a vision of the Army for the 21st century that will be \nboth the guidepost for years to come. He can take great pride in both \nthe Army's past accomplishments and future preparedness. General \nSullivan has essentially led the Army into the 21st century.\n  Throughout his career, General Sullivan has distinguished himself in \nnumerous command and staff positions with U.S. forces stationed both \noverseas and in the Continental United States. In Asia, he served a \ntour of duty in Korea and two tours of duty in Vietnam. In Europe, his \nassignments included 3d Armored Division's Chief of Staff and the VII \nCorps operations officer. From July 1985 to March 1987 General Sullivan \nserved on the NATO staff as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Support of \nCentral Army Group in Germany.\n  General Sullivan's stateside assignments included serving as the \nassistant commandant of the Armor School at Fort Knox, KY, and deputy \ncommandant of the Command and General Staff College at Fort \nLeavenworth, KS. In addition, he served as the commanding general of \nthe 1st Infantry Division, ``The Big Red One,'' at Fort Riley, KS. \nSince June 1991, General Sullivan has served in his present assignment \nas the U.S. Army Chief of Staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking General \nSullivan for his honorable service to the people and Army of the United \nStates. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9188-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE NEW JERSEY DEVILS\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure \nto congratulate New Jersey's very own Devils. As you may know, the New \nJersey Devils have defeated the Detroit Red Wings to become the Stanley \nCup Champions of the National Hockey League. This past Saturday night \nat the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, NJ, the Devils concluded \ntheir courageous quest for the Stanley Cup with a 5 to 2 victory to \nsweep the four-game series.\n  The New Jersey Devils may not have superstar players like Detroit. \nHowever, it is clear that through their classic gritty team play and a \nfoundation of discipline, unity, and hard work, they overcame all \nadversity to achieve their ultimate goal. After last year's heart-\nbreaking exit from the playoffs at the hands of the New York Rangers, \nthis year's team forged through the playoffs with a vengeance to \ncomplete their mission.\n  New Jersey's key players came through in the playoffs to inspire \ntheir team with clutch performances. Although it was forward Claude \nLemieux who took the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player \nthroughout the Stanley Cup playoffs, there were a host of other heroes \nwithout whom the Devils would never have made it as far as they did. \nCaptain and defenseman Scott Stevens, who shut down the opposition's \nsuperstars, goaltender Martin Brodeur, the second-year phenom who has \nemerged as one of the best goaltenders in the NHL, and native New \nJerseyan Jim Dowd from Brick, who scored a clutch goal to win game two, \nare just a few examples.\n  The Devils played ultimate team hockey in winning the Stanley Cup. \nTheir now infamous neutral-zone trap defensive system put the Red Wings \nin a stranglehold tighter than any octopi their fans could throw onto \nthe ice.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to once again offer \ncongratulations to our Devils. Success in the professional sports \narena, like many other endeavors, requires a great deal of dedication, \nhard work, and courage. And that is our New Jersey Devils. I am very \nproud to have them represent our State.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9189-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9189-S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE DEATH OF FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday's newspapers reported \nthat former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger died on Sunday here in \nWashington. He was 87 years old.\n  Twenty-six years ago, President Nixon nominated Warren Burger to be \nChief Justice with the hope of reversing the activism of the Warren \nCourt. Yet history was not entirely cooperative: Chief Justice Burger \npresided over a 17-year period in which many of the era's most profound \ncontroversies had to be decided by the High Court. A number of those \nissues, including school busing to achieve desegregation: Swann versus \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 1971; the separation of \nchurch and state as applicable to government aid to parochial schools, \nLemon versus Kurtzman, 1971; and Executive privilege, United States \nversus Nixon, 1974, were decided in opinions written by Chief Justice \nBurger himself.\n  The Chief was somehow able to take all of this and more in stride. He \nrelished his additional statutory duties as chancellor of the Board of \nRegents of the Smithsonian Institution, and as chairman of the board of \ntrustees of the National Gallery of Art. Although my service as a \nregent of the Smithsonian Institution began just after Chief Justice \nBurger's tenure as chancellor ended in 1986, I did have the \nexhilarating honor, in September of 1985, to be presented the Joseph \nHenry Award by then-Chancellor Burger on one memorable evening at the \nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\n  Following his retirement from the Court in 1986, Chief Justice Burger \ndevoted himself on a full-time basis to his work as Chairman of the \nCommission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, to which \nPresident Reagan had appointed him the previous year. \nCharacteristically, the Chief threw himself into that effort with the \ngreat energy and enthusiasm he applied to all of his pursuits. I recall \ncorresponding with him about the Commission's progress and his many \nideas for increasing public appreciation for the Constitution in its \nbicentennial year. Among its good works, the Commission produced the \nexcellent pocket-sized Constitutions that are available in Senate \noffices. I have taken to carrying a copy with me, and I know the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has as well.\n  In his Foreword to the pocket Constitution, Chief Justice Burger \nwrote that our constitutional system:\n\n       [D]oes not always provide tidy results; it depends on a \n     clash of views in debate and on bargain and compromise. For \n     200 years this Constitution's ordered liberty has unleashed \n     the energies and talents of people to create a good life.\n\n  Warren Burger created just such a good life through his own \nindomitable energies and talents. He came from humble roots in St. \nPaul, MN, attended college and law school at night, and ultimately rose \nto become Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Chief Justice Burger was a distinguished jurist and a patriot in the \nfinest sense of the word. He was also a wonderful husband and father \nand, although it is not much in fashion to say so today, he was a \ngentleman. He was my friend for more than a quarter century, and he \nwill be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the obituary by Linda Greenhouse from the \nNew York Times of June 26th be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n                [From the New York Times, June 26, 1995]\n\n     Warren E. Burger Is Dead at 87; Was Chief Justice for 17 Years\n\n                         (By Linda Greenhouse)\n\n       Washington, June 25--Warren E. Burger, who retired in 1986 \n     after 17 years as the 15th Chief Justice of the United \n     States, died here today at age 87. The cause was congestive \n     heart failure, a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said.\n       An energetic court administrator, Chief Justice Burger was \n     in some respects a transitional figure despite his long \n     tenure. He presided over a Court that, while it grew steadily \n     more conservative with subsequent appointments, nonetheless \n     remained strongly influenced by the legacy of his liberal \n     predecessor, Chief Justice Earl Warren. The constitutional \n     right to abortion and the validity of busing as a remedy for \n     school segregation were both established during Chief Justice \n     Burger's tenure, and with his support.\n       The country knew Chief Justice Burger as a symbol before it \n     knew much about him as a man or a judge.\n       He was President Richard M. Nixon's first Supreme Court \n     nominee, and Mr. Nixon had campaigned on a pledge to find \n     ``strict constructionists'' and ``practitioners of judicial \n     restraint'' who would turn back the activist tide that the \n     Court had built under Chief Justice Warren, its leader since \n     1953.\n       The nomination on May 21, 1969, immediately made Mr. \n     Burger, a white-haired, 61-year-old Federal appeals court \n     judge, lightening rod for those who welcomed as well as \n\n[[Page S 9190]]\n     those who feared the end of an era of judicial activism.\n       It was a central contradiction of Mr. Burger's tenure as \n     Chief Justice that long after he became one of the most \n     visible and, in many ways, innovative Chief Justices in \n     history he remained, for many people, the symbol of \n     retrenchment that Mr. Nixon had presented to the public on \n     nominating him.\n       In fact, the Supreme Court in the Burger years was in its \n     way as activist as the Court that preceded it, creating new \n     constitutional doctrine in areas like the right to privacy, \n     due process and sexual equality that the Warren Court had \n     only hinted at.\n       ``All in all,'' one Supreme Court scholar, A. E. Dick \n     Howard, wrote in the Wilson Quarterly in 1981, ``the Court is \n     today more of a center for the resolution of social issues \n     than it has ever been before.''\n       While there were some substantial changes of emphasis, the \n     Burger Court--a label liberals tended to apply like an \n     epithet--overruled no major decisions from the Warren era.\n       It was a further incongruity that despite Chief Justice \n     Burger's high visibility and the evident relish with which he \n     used his office to expound his views on everything from legal \n     education to prison management, scholars and Supreme Court \n     commentators continued to question the degree to which he \n     actually led the institution over which he so energetically \n     presided.\n       His important opinions for the Court included the decision \n     that validated busing as a tool for school desegregation, the \n     one that struck down the ``legislative veto'' used by \n     Congress for 50 years to block executive branch actions, and \n     the one that spurred President Nixon's resignation in 1974 by \n     forcing him to turn over White House tape recordings for use \n     in the Watergate investigations. Yet Chief Justice Burger was \n     just as often in dissent on major decisions. In that, he \n     differed from Chief Justice Warren, who voted with the \n     majority in nearly all important cases.\n       Those seeking to identify the sources of intellectual \n     leadership on the Court usually pointed to William H. \n     Rehnquist, another Nixon appointee to whom Chief Justice \n     Burger assigned many important opinions, and to William J. \n     Brennan Jr., the Court's most senior and, with Thurgood \n     Marshall, most liberal member.\n       As the senior Associate Justice, Justice Brennan had the \n     right to assign the opinion in any case in which he was in \n     the majority and the Chief Justice was in dissent, and he \n     often exercised that prerogative by assigning major opinions \n     to himself, particularly in the area of individual rights.\n       As the years passed, Chief Justice Burger seemed to assign \n     himself the opinions in relatively straightforward and \n     uncontroversial cases, avoiding those in which the Court was \n     deeply split and in which it would have required considerable \n     effort to marshal or hold a fragile majority. As a result, \n     his personal imprint on the Court's jurisprudence was not \n     always readily identifiable.\n                     an innovator in administration\n\n       But his imprint was distinct in the area to which he gave \n     his most sustained attention, judicial administration.\n       Mr. Burger liked to say that he took his title seriously. \n     He was Chief Justice of the United States, not just of the \n     Supreme Court, and he took as his mandate the stewardship of \n     the entire judicial system, state as well as Federal.\n       An array of institutions were created under his aegis, \n     including the National Center for State Courts, the Institute \n     for Court Management and the National Institute of \n     Corrections. The common purpose of those organizations was to \n     improve the education and training of participants in nearly \n     all phases of the judicial process, whether judges, court \n     clerks or prison guards.\n       The Chief Justice turned the small Federal Judicial Center, \n     for which he served by statute as chairman of the board, into \n     a major center for research and publishing about the courts.\n       He believed that judges could be helped to be more \n     efficient if professional management techniques were imported \n     to the courts, from clerks' offices to judges' chambers. The \n     Institute for Court Management set up a six-month program for \n     training court managers and administrators.\n       The Supreme Court itself became one of the first fully \n     computerized courts in the country; in 1981, the Justices all \n     received computer terminals on which to compose their \n     opinions.\n       The Chief Justice campaigned tirelessly for better pay for \n     judges, better education for lawyers and help for the Court's \n     evergrowing caseload. From his earliest years in office, he \n     warned that the Federal courts and the Supreme Court in \n     particular were becoming dangerously overworked.\n       In 1983, he asked Congress to create an appellate panel \n     that could relieve some of the Supreme Court's caseload by \n     resolving conflicting opinions among the Federal appeals \n     courts.\n\n\n                 Many Admirers, But Detractors as Well\n\n       Judges and others interested in these long-ignored \n     administrative issues responded with gratitude. One of the \n     Chief Justice's warmest admirers on the Federal bench was \n     Frank M. Johnson Jr., a Federal appeals court judge from \n     Alabama who won praise from civil rights advocates for his \n     orders on prison issues and other rulings.\n       ``Warren Burger has redefined the nature of his office,'' \n     Judge Johnson wrote in the early 1980's. ``He has \n     concentrated his energy not simply on exploring the \n     subtleties of constitutional doctrine but on reforming the \n     mechanics of American justice. More than any of his 14 \n     predecessors, he has invested the prestige of the Chief \n     Justiceship in efforts to make the American judicial system \n     function more efficiently. He has used his position not as an \n     excuse to withdraw from public affairs but as an opportunity \n     to furnish public leadership.''\n       But the priority that Chief Justice Burger assigned to \n     administration also had its detractors, who complained that \n     he trivialized his office by emphasizing the mechanics of \n     justice at the expense of its substance.\n       Occasionally, too, his enthusiastic lobbying was seen as \n     overbearing by those at whom it was directed. In 1978, for \n     example, he became deeply involved in the effort in Congress \n     to overhaul the bankruptcy system.\n       One Democratic Senator, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, whose \n     subcommittee had jurisdiction over the bill, complained \n     publicly that a ``very, very irate and rude'' Chief Justice \n     had telephoned him to object to a legislative development and \n     ``not only lobbied but pressured and attempted to be \n     intimidating.''\n       The Chief Justice could also be rather intimidating from \n     the bench, particularly when a relatively inexperienced \n     lawyer was arguing a position with which Mr. Burger \n     disagreed. While Chief Justice Warren's favorite question \n     from the bench was, ``Yes, but was it fair?'' Chief Justice \n     Burger often asked: ``Yes, but why is this case in the \n     courts? Isn't this a matter for the Legislature to address?''\n\n\n                 working to limit the judiciary's scope\n\n       Chief Justice Burger believed in a limited role for the \n     courts and reserved some of his sharpest criticism for those \n     who looked to them to resolve social and political problems \n     that, in his view, were not the province of judges. ``If we \n     get the notion that courts can cure all injustices, we're \n     barking up the wrong tree,'' he liked to say.\n       A speech he gave while he was still a judge on the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia provided a useful \n     summary of the view he held throughout his career: ``That \n     courts encounter some problems for which they can supply no \n     solution is not invariably an occasion for regret or concern. \n     This is an essential limitation in a system of divided \n     power.''\n       Some of the more important decisions while he was Chief \n     Justice were those that limited litigants' access to Federal \n     court by using the doctrines of standing, mootness and \n     deference to state courts.\n       He seemed to regard suits for small monetary stakes as a \n     waste of judges' time, and many of his speeches complained \n     about the disproportionate cost to the system of trying the \n     lawsuits brought by prisoners or consumers over modest losses \n     of money or property.\n       His questioning of one lawyer, who argued in 1982 on behalf \n     of 168,000 consumers, each with a claim for $7.98 against the \n     Gillette Company, was the talk of the Court for weeks, ``What \n     is the economic justification for this kind of lawsuit in the \n     Federal courts under any circumstances?'' the Chief Justice \n     demanded.\n       ``We are in state court, judge, in this case,'' the lawyer, \n     Robert S. Atkins, replied.\n       ``In state or Federal court?'' the Chief Justice persisted.\n       ``The problem,'' Mr. Atkins said, ``is that if you cheat \n     people a little bit but do it a lot, you can go free----''\n       The Chief Justice interrupted to interrogate him about the \n     proportion of the recovery that would go for legal fees.\n\n\n                  inviting attention, some of the time\n\n       Chief Justice Burger's effort to police the moral character \n     of lawyers who sought to become eligible to argue before the \n     Court rankled some of the other Justices and in 1982 provided \n     a rare public glimpse of internal disagreements over the \n     Chief Justice's administrative approach.\n       He singled out several applicants by name and accused them \n     of seeking membership in the Supreme Court bar to ``launder'' \n     tarnished credentials. But he failed to persuade a majority \n     of the Court to block the admissions and provoked one \n     Justice, John Paul Stevens, to write that the Court should \n     grant applicants with questionable credentials a ``fair \n     hearing'' before publicly labeling them as unworthy.\n       There were contradictory strains in Chief Justice Burger's \n     attitude toward the public, including the press. At times he \n     seemed to welcome and even invite public attention. He took \n     pride in having made the Supreme Court a more attractive \n     place for tourists to visit, transforming the cold marble \n     ground floor into an area for historical exhibits.\n       Yet he alone of all the Justice refused, when announcing \n     one of his opinion from the bench, to provide tourists and \n     lawyers in the audience with a brief oral description of the \n     case and the decision.\n       The other Justices either read aloud from a memorandum \n     explaining the case or gave a more casual oral account. When \n     the Chief Justice's turn came, he would simply announce that \n     in a case with a particular name, the judgement of the lower \n     court was affirmed, or reversed. When asked why he refused to \n     join the others in explaining his opinions, he once said, \n     ``It's a waste of time.''\n       He was adamant about preserving the secrecy of the Court's \n     internal operations, \n\n[[Page S 9191]]\n     even to the extent of refusing to make public the names of his four law \n     clerks. A law firm recruiter or other member of the public \n     who called the Court's public information office seeking a \n     list of the current law clerks would receive the names of all \n     the clerks except the Chief Justice's.\n       He mailed copies of his speeches to hundreds of journalists \n     around the country and would telephone particular columnists \n     to make sure his message was clear.\n\n\n                defining the limits of speech and press\n\n       Occasionally, usually in connection with his annual ``State \n     of the Judiciary'' address to the American Bar Association, a \n     tradition that he inaugurated, he would invite journalists \n     for informal ``deep background'' briefings, sessions that \n     were often relaxed and informative.\n       But he seemed to hold much of the press corps in low \n     repute. Asked by a lawyer at a Smithsonian Institution \n     symposium what he thought of the reporters who covered the \n     Court, he replied, as he often did: ``I admire those who do a \n     good job, and I have sympathy for the rest, who are in the \n     majority.''\n       His special scorn was reserved for television, which he \n     regarded as an intrusive annoyance. He once knocked a \n     television camera out of the hand of a network cameraman who \n     followed him into an elevator. He vowed that he would never \n     allow oral arguments at the Supreme Court to be televised.\n       Yet he wrote the opinion for the Court in the 1981 case \n     Chandler v. Florida, holding that a state could permit a \n     criminal trial to be televised, even over the defendant's \n     objection, without depriving the defendant of the \n     constitutional right to a fair trial.\n       Chief Justice Burger wrote several of the Court's most \n     important opinions interpreting the free speech and free \n     press guarantees of the First Amendment.\n       His opinion in a 1976 case, Nebraska Press v. Stuart, \n     effectively prohibited judges from ordering the press not to \n     publish information in its possession about the crime, a \n     confession or the like. The opinion said that judges could \n     take less drastic steps to protect criminal defendants from \n     negative pretrial publicity, like sequestering the jury or \n     changing the site of the trial.\n       A 1973 opinion by the Chief Justice ended roughly 15 years \n     of turmoil over the legal definition of obscenity by changing \n     the focus to local communities, rather than the entire \n     country.\n       That opinion, in Miller v. California, said obscene \n     materials were ``works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the \n     prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a \n     patently offensive way and which, taken as a whole, do not \n     have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific \n     value.'' The Chief Justice added that it was up to local \n     juries applying ``contemporary community standards'' to \n     decide whether a particular work fit that definition.\n       ``It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to \n     read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of \n     Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found \n     tolerable in Las Vegas or New York City,'' he wrote. ``People \n     in different states vary in their tastes and attitudes, and \n     this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism of \n     imposed uniformity.''\n\n\n                    religion, rights and veto power\n\n       Chief Justice Burger was also one of the Court's most \n     prolific writers on another aspect of the First Amendment, \n     the clause prohibiting an establishment of an official \n     national religion. In a 1971 opinion, Lemon v. Kurtzman, he \n     set forth the test for deciding whether a given law or \n     government program that conferred some benefit on religion \n     nonetheless passed muster under the First Amendment.\n       ``First,'' he wrote, ``the statute must have a secular \n     legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect \n     must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; \n     finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government \n     entanglement with religion.'' This ``three-part test,'' as it \n     came to be known through later refinements and elaborations, \n     defined the Court's approach to the establishment clause in a \n     variety of contexts.\n       The 1983 decision that struck down the legislative veto, \n     Immigration Service v. Chadna, altered the balance of power \n     between the executive and legislative branches.\n       It invalidated a procedure, which Congress had incorporated \n     into some 200 laws, permitting one or both Houses to block \n     executive branch action. The procedure, Chief Justice Burger \n     wrote, was not within Congress' constitutional authority \n     because it did not follow the rules the Constitution set out \n     for ``legislation'': passage by both Houses and presentment \n     to the President for his signature.\n       The Chadna opinion in many ways summarized the Chief \n     Justice's view of American Government. He wrote, ``With all \n     the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness and potential for \n     abuse, we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom \n     than by making the exercise of power subject to the carefully \n     crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution.''\n       Chief Justice Burger wrote relatively few of the Court's \n     criminal law decisions, and some of the more important \n     decisions on the rights of criminal suspects found him in \n     bitter dissent.\n       For example, in the 1977 case Brewer v. Williams the Court \n     ruled, in a 5-to-4 opinion by Justice Potter Stewart, that \n     the police had violated a murder suspect's constitutional \n     right to counsel. The police officers, knowing that the \n     suspect was deeply religious, delivered what came to be \n     called the Christian burial speech, musing aloud on the wish \n     of the victim's parents to give their daughter a Christian \n     burial. The suspect, who had previously said he would talk \n     only after seeing a lawyer, then led the officers to the \n     victim's body.\n       The majority's decision overturning the murder conviction \n     was ``bizarre,'' the Chief Justice wrote in a dissent that \n     was a stinging attack on the so-called exclusionary rule \n     barring the use at trial of illegally seized evidence.\n       ``The result reached by the Court in this case ought to be \n     intolerable in any society which purports to call itself an \n     organized society,'' he said. ``Failure to have counsel in a \n     pretrial setting should not lead to the `knee-jerk' \n     suppression of relevant and reliable evidence.''\n\n\n                     a conservative on crime issues\n\n       Although Chief Justice Burger's views on criminal law did \n     not always garner a majority on the Supreme Court, those \n     views had probably been more responsible for his being \n     nominated to the High Court than any other factor.\n       He dissented from the Court's 1972 decision that \n     invalidated all death penalty laws then in force. After the \n     Court permitted executions to resume four years later, the \n     Chief Justice grew increasingly impatient with the legal \n     obstacles that lawyers and judges continued to place in the \n     way of executions.\n       When the Court refused to block the execution of a murderer \n     whose appeals had lasted 10 years, Chief Justice Burger wrote \n     a concurring opinion excoriating lawyers for condemned \n     inmates. He said the lawyers sought to turn the \n     administration of justice into a ``sporting contest.''\n       In 13 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, he was known as a conservative, \n     law-and-order judge. He enhanced that reputation with \n     speeches and articles. A speech in 1967 at Ripon College in \n     Wisconsin came to Richard Nixon's attention after it was \n     reprinted in U.S. News & World Report.\n       The White House distributed copies of the speech at the \n     time of Judge Burger's nomination, and the Supreme Court \n     press office handed it out for years when asked for \n     information about his views. In the speech, he compared the \n     American system of justice with the systems of Norway, \n     Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n       ``I assume that no one will take issue with me when I say \n     that these North European countries are as enlightened as the \n     United States in the value they place on the individual and \n     on human dignity,'' he said.\n       Yet, he continued, those countries ``do not consider it \n     necessary to use a device like our Fifth Amendment, under \n     which an accused person may not be required to testify.''\n       ``They go swiftly, efficiently and directly to the question \n     of whether the accused is guilty,'' he added.\n       ``No nation on earth,'' he said, ``goes to such lengths or \n     takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do, once an \n     accused person is called before the bar of justice and until \n     his case is completed.''\n\n\n                      a modest start in minnesota\n\n       Chief Justice Burger's speechmaking style changed little in \n     subsequent years. He often returned to the theme and imagery \n     of the Ripon speech and often used the Scandinavian \n     countries, which he visited frequently, as benchmarks against \n     which to compare the American system.\n       Warren Earl Burger was born Sept. 17, 1907, in St. Paul. \n     His parents, of Swiss-German descent, were Charles Joseph \n     Burger and the former Katharine Schnittger. His paternal \n     grandfather, Joseph Burger, emigrated from Switzerland and \n     joined the Union Army at the start of the Civil War, when he \n     was 14. He was severely wounded in combat and received both a \n     battlefield commission and the Medal of Honor.\n       Warren Burger was one of seven children. The family lived \n     on a 20-acre truck farm on the outskirts of St. Paul. In \n     addition to farming, his father sold weighing scales; the \n     family's financial circumstances were modest.\n       At John A. Johnson High School, from which Warren Burger \n     graduated in 1925, he edited the school newspaper, was \n     president of the student council and earned letters in \n     hockey, football, track and swimming. He earned extra money \n     by selling articles on high school sports and other news to \n     the St. Paul newspapers.\n       The rest of his formal education took place in night school \n     while he worked days selling insurance for the Mutual Life \n     Insurance Company of New York. He attended the night school \n     division of the University of Minnesota for two years, then \n     began night law classes at the St. Paul College of Law, now \n     known as the William Mitchell College of Law. He received his \n     degree with high honors in 1931.\n       He joined the faculty of the law school and taught for 12 \n     years while practicing law with the firm of Boyesen, Otis & \n     Faricy. He remained with the firm, one of the oldest in the \n     state, for 22 years; after he became a partner, the firm was \n     known as Faricy, Burger, Moore & Costello. He handled \n     probate, trial and appellate cases, arguing more than a dozen \n     before the United States Supreme Court and many more in the \n     Minnesota Supreme Court.\n       He married Elvera Stromberg in 1933. They had a son, Wade \n     Allen, and a daughter, Margaret Elizabeth.\n\n[[Page S 9192]]\n\n       As a young lawyer, Mr. Burger became active in community \n     affairs. He was president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce \n     and the first president of the St. Paul Council on Human \n     Relations. That group, which he helped to organize, sponsored \n     training programs for the police to improve relations with \n     minority groups. For many years, he was a member of the \n     Governor's Interracial Commission.\n       He also became involved in state politics, working on \n     Harold E. Stassen's successful campaign for governor. He went \n     to the 1948 Republican National Convention to help Governor \n     Stassen's unsuccessful bid for the Presidential nomination.\n\n\n                     making the move to washington\n\n       In 1952, he was at the Republican convention again, still a \n     Stassen supporter. But he helped Dwight D. Eisenhower's \n     forces win a crucial credentials fight against Senator Robert \n     A. Taft of Ohio. On the final day, with General Eisenhower \n     lacking nine votes for the nomination, Mr. Burger helped \n     swing the Minnesota delegation and gave Eisenhower the votes \n     that put him over the top. Cheers broke out on the convention \n     floor as an organ played the University of Minnesota fight \n     song.\n       His reward was a job in Washington, as Assistant Attorney \n     General in charge of the Civil Division of the Justice \n     Department. He supervised all the Federal Government's civil \n     and international litigation. He told a young Justice \n     Department lawyer years later that he would have been content \n     to continue running the Civil Division for the rest of his \n     career.\n       One of his assignments was somewhat unusual for the Civil \n     Division chief. He agreed to argue a case in the Supreme \n     Court, usually the task of the Solicitor General's Office. \n     The case involved a Yale University professor of medicine, \n     John F. Peters, who had been discharged on loyalty grounds \n     from his job as a part-time Federal health consultant.\n       The Solicitor General, Somin E. Soboloff, disagreed with \n     the Government's position that the action by the Civil \n     Service Commission's Loyalty Review Board was valid and \n     refused to sign the brief or argue the case. Mr. Burger \n     argued on behalf of the board and lost. Among the lawyers who \n     filed briefs on the professor's behalf were two who would \n     precede Mr. Burger on the Supreme Court, Abe Fortas and \n     Arthur J. Goldberg.\n       After two years, Mr. Burger resigned from the Justice \n     Department and was preparing to return to private practice in \n     St. Paul when Judge Harold Stephens of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit died. \n     President Eisenhower nominated him for the vacancy, and he \n     joined the court in 1956.\n       His elevation to the Supreme Court 13 years later was made \n     possible by President Lyndon B. Johnson's failure to persuade \n     the Senate to accept Abe Fortas as Chief Justice.\n\n\n                     a beneficiary of '68 election\n\n       On June 13, 1968, Earl Warren had announced his intention \n     to resign after 15 years as Chief Justice. President Johnson \n     nominated Mr. Fortas, then an Associate Justice, as Chief \n     Justice. But the nomination became a victim of the 1968 \n     Presidential election campaign and was withdrawn on Oct. 2, \n     the fourth day of a Senate filibuster that followed \n     acrimonious confirmation hearings.\n       Chief Justice Warren agreed to delay his retirement, and it \n     was clear that whoever won the Presidential election would \n     choose the next Chief Justice. Justice Fortas remained on the \n     Court until May 1969, when he resigned after the disclosure \n     that he had accepted a $20,000 fee from a foundation \n     controlled by Louis E. Wolfson, a friend and former client \n     who was under Federal investigation for violating securities \n     laws.\n       On May 21, a week after the Fortas resignation, President \n     Nixon nominated Warren Burger to be Chief Justice. The \n     nomination went smoothly in the Senate, and he was sworn in \n     as Chief Justice on June 23, 1969.\n       The Chief Justice and his wife lived in a renovated pre-\n     Civil War farmhouse on several acres in McLean, Va. According \n     to the annual financial disclosure statements required of all \n     Federal judges, he had assets of more than $1 million. His \n     largest investment was the common stock of the Minnesota \n     Mining and Manufacturing Company.\n       He was a gardener and a serious wine enthusiast who took \n     pride in his wine cellar and occasionally sponsored wine-\n     tasting dinners at the Supreme Court.\n       By statute, the Chief Justice is Chancellor of the \n     Smithsonian Institution and chairman of the board of trustees \n     of the National Gallery of Art, duties that, as an art and \n     history buff, he enjoyed. He visited antiques stores to look \n     for good pieces for the Court and took an active role in the \n     Supreme Court Historical Society.\n       He and his wife led an active social life in Washington and \n     spent part of nearly every summer in Europe, usually in \n     connection with a conference or other official appearance.\n       Chief Justice Burger cut an imposing figure, and it was \n     often said that he looked like Hollywood's image of a Chief \n     Justice. He was nearly 6 feet tall, stocky but not heavy, \n     with regular features, a square jaw and silvery hair.\n       Proper appearance was important to him. He once sent a note \n     to the Solicitor General's Office complaining that a Deputy \n     Solicitor General had worn a vest the wrong shade of gray \n     with the formal morning attire required of Government lawyers \n     who argue before the Court.\n       In 1976, he appeared at a Bicentennial commemoration in a \n     billowing robe with scarlet trim, a reproduction of the robe \n     worn by the first Chief Justice, John Jay. He later put the \n     robe on display in the Court's exhibit area.\n       A book by Chief Justice Burger, ``It Is So Ordered'' \n     (William Morrow), was published earlier this year. It is an \n     account of 14 cases that, in his judgment, helped shaped the \n     Constitution.\n       Mr. Burger's wife died in May 1994. He is survived by his \n     son, of Arlington, Va.; his daughter, of Washington, and two \n     grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were incomplete \n     today.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9189-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE STUDENTS OF MAINE SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, earlier this month, Vaclav Havel, \nPresident of the Czech Republic, spoke at a luncheon in his honor at \nthe John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. President Havel spoke eloquently \nabout President Kennedy's New Frontier and the hopes it inspired in his \nown country and among peoples throughout the world. He quoted the \nfamous words of President Kennedy's Inaugural Address, ``Ask not what \nyour country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.'' He \nspoke as well of our failure to live up to those ideals, and of the \nimportance of continuing to strive for them. ``What we can never \nrelinquish is hope,'' he said.\n  Present in the audience at the Kennedy Library to hear these \ninspiring words were many members of the Masaryk club in Boston, a \nnonprofit cultural and social organization for Americans of Czech or \nSlovak ethnic background. President Havel's own personal courage in \nleading his country to freedom and democracy after the fall of the \nBerlin Wall made his visit to Boston an especially moving occasion for \nthem.\n  I believe President Havel's eloquent address will be of interest to \nall my colleagues in the Senate. I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord, along with Senator Kennedy's introduction of President Havel.\n                  Remarks of Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n       I want to thank Paul Kirk for that generous introduction. \n     Everyone in the Kennedy family and everyone associated with \n     President Kennedy's Library is proud of Paul and his \n     outstanding leadership as Chairman of the Library Foundation.\n       I also want to thank John Cullinane for his effective role \n     in our Distinguished Foreign Visitors Program. John has been \n     a dear friend to our family for many years, and we are \n     grateful for all he's done for Jack's Library.\n       Today is a special day for the Library, and we are \n     delighted that our guest of honor could be here.\n       The ties that bind the United States and the Czech people \n     go back many years. We're proud to have with us today members \n     of Boston's Masaryk Club, named for the great founder of \n     modern Czechoslovakia.\n       In 1918, at the end of World War I and the collapse of the \n     Austro-Hungarian Empire, the new independent nation of \n     Czechoslovakia was born. Thomas Masaryk drafted \n\n[[Page S 9193]]\n     its Declaration of Independence, and he used America's Declaration of \n     Independence as his model. He adopted the red, white and blue \n     colors of our flag for the Czech flag and he declared the \n     birth of the new nation. At the time, he was in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, seeking support for his native land, a true \n     patriot for his people.\n       Masaryk's Declaration of Independence had a fascinating \n     subsequent history. Masaryk died in 1937, and left the \n     document to his private secretary, who gave it to the Library \n     of Congress for safe keeping, until it could one day be \n     returned to a free Czechoslovakia\n       When I first met President Havel in 1990, the Berlin Wall \n     had been down for several months, and I mentioned to him that \n     it might\n      be time to return the document to Czechoslovakia. But \n     Czechoslovakia's democracy was still very new, and it's \n     future was uncertain. So President Havel thought is best \n     for the document to remain at the Library of Congress a \n     little longer. In 1991, with democracy firmly established, \n     it was a great honor and privilege for all of us in \n     Congress to return that historic document to President \n     Havel and the people of Czechoslovakia.\n       As all of us know, our guest of honor has had an \n     extraordinary and very inspiring career. As a student in the \n     1950's in Prague, he was attracted to the theater. After \n     completing his compulsory military service, he started work \n     for an avant-garde theater company as a stagehand and \n     electrician. With his talent for writing and his strong sense \n     of the stage, he quickly rose to the position of manuscript \n     reader, and then resident playwright.\n       His rise coincided with the increasing political thaw in \n     his country in the 1960's, and he became well-known for his \n     vivid plays about the dehumanizing and repressive bureaucracy \n     of communist regimes.\n       President Havel's relationship with the Kennedy family goes \n     back to 1968, when he visited the United States in connection \n     with the first American production of one of his most famous \n     plays. Due to restrictions on visitors from Iron Curtain \n     countries at the time, his visa limited him to New York City. \n     His friends in the literary and theater community contacted \n     Senator Robert Kennedy, and, with Bobby's help, President \n     Havel was given permission to visit Washington.\n       But the thaw in Czechoslovakia was only temporary, and the \n     Soviet invasion of 1968 ended the famous Prague Spring. \n     President Havel's works were banned and his passport was \n     confiscated.\n       Repression and harassment followed. In 1975, after his \n     production of ``The Beggar's Opera,'' even the members of his \n     theater audiences became targets of police harassment.\n       But President Havel never wavered. He did not remain silent \n     or flee the country during the repressive Communist rule. He \n     was forced to take menial jobs, but he continued writing, \n     speaking out for human rights, and standing up against the \n     Communist dictatorship.\n       In 1977, he became a leader of Charter 77, a manifesto \n     signed by hundreds of artists and intellectuals protesting \n     the government's refusal to abide by the Helsinki Agreement \n     on Civil and Political Rights. For his continuing courage, he \n     was jailed several different times, and spent five years in \n     prison.\n       In his visit to this country in 1990, President Havel told \n     me that during those dark years in prison, the most important \n     and\n      most sustaining book he had read was ``Profiles in Courage'' \n     by President Kennedy.\n       After the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Havel became \n     the leader of the Civic Forum, an organization of groups \n     opposed to the Communist Government. In November 1989, \n     massive crowds gathered in Wenceslas Square to challenge that \n     government and there was real dangers of violence. President \n     Havel showed great leadership in bringing about a peaceful \n     transition. It was called the Velvet Resolution, and in \n     December he became the first president of the new, free \n     Czechoslovakia.\n       In 1993, when Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two \n     independent nations, he became the first President of the new \n     Czech Republic.\n       During President Havel's earlier visit, we happened to be \n     together at a large dinner party in his honor. As it was \n     ending, I mentioned that one of the most beautiful and moving \n     places to visit in Washington was the Lincoln Memorial at \n     night. He was intrigued, and so we drove over there together. \n     I read out loud the beautiful words inscribed on the walls--\n     the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and his Second \n     Inaugural Address--and his interpreter translated them for \n     President Havel.\n       It was a deeply moving few moments. He wrote down several \n     of the great phrases, and he turned to me and said, ``I am \n     not able to understand the language, but I can understand the \n     poetry.''\n       Finally, I want to quote briefly from some of President \n     Havel's own words, describing his life. Here is what he said: \n     ``You do not become a `dissent' just because you decide one \n     day to take up this most unusual career. You are thrown into \n     it by your personal sense of responsibility, combined with a \n     complex set of external circumstances. You are cast out of \n     the existing structures and placed in a position of conflict \n     with them. It begins as an attempt to do your work well, and \n     ends with being branded an enemy of society.''\n       But that label could not stick. No friend of freedom can be \n     an enemy of society. President Havel's heroic opposition to \n     repression won him many admirers throughout the world, \n     including the great Irish playwright, Samuel Beckett. In \n     1982, in a unique political action, Beckett dedicated a play \n     to Havel, about the suffering of a martyr in an oppressive \n     country.\n       I know that President Havel regards that as one of the \n     finest tributes he has ever received, and he eminently \n     deserved it. Through many years of hardship and repression, \n     he kept the idea of freedom alive, and he successfully led \n     his people to it.\n       As Robert Kennedy said, ``Each time a man stands up for an \n     ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out \n     against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and \n     crossing each other from a million different centers of \n     energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can \n     sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and \n     resistance.''\n       Those words eloquently describe the extraordinary life of \n     our guest of honor and the ripples of hope he has set forth \n     across the world. He is a symbol of the aspirations of \n     peoples everywhere for liberty and an end to oppression.\n       I am honored to introduce him now, a man for all seasons, \n     an inspiring leader for our times, President Havel of the \n     Czech Republic.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        Remarks of Vaclav Havel\n\n       Dear Mr. Senator, dear guests, the name of the President \n     for whom this library is named, your name, Mr. Senator, and \n     the name of your family, evokes as powerful an echo as few \n     other names do. For several generations, this name has been \n     inseparably linked with the history of Boston, the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the United States of America \n     and, indeed, of the whole world.\n       For me and many others, this name is primarily linked with \n     a period which had profoundly influenced a whole generation \n     in various parts of the world, a period whose aftereffects we \n     are still feeling today. I am speaking, of course, about the \n     sixties. I will never forget my sense of elation at the \n     election of President Kennedy. I will never forget my sense \n     of shock at the news of his assassination. It was then that I \n     realized that there are dark forces operating in the human \n     nature and in the world at large. And I will never forget the \n     few weeks I spent in the United States at the end of the \n     sixties, my own taste of the unrepeatable atmosphere of the \n     times in this country.\n       The historical dimensions of a decade do not always \n     coincide with its chronological dimensions. The sixties began \n     right on time in 1960, on a wave of hope with the election of \n     your brother John Fitzgerald Kennedy as the 35th President of \n     the United States. The same sixties, however, ended \n     prematurely in the chaos and disillusion of 1968, with the \n     student riots in Paris, the assassination of your brother \n     Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles, the demonstrations against the \n     war in Vietnam in Washington, and with the invasion of \n     Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact. What remained of the \n     sixties chronologically after that, did not really belong \n     there. Even the last joyful moment of the decade, the landing \n     of Man on the Moon ``before the decade was out,'' seemed to \n     be a mere legacy of the late President who had turned the \n     eyes of the nation toward the New Frontier but was murdered \n     before he could witness the breakthrough.\n       Few decades in the history of mankind have been the focus \n     of so much energy, joy and hope as well as of so much pain, \n     bitterness and disappointment. It is then no wonder that few \n     decades have left behind a legacy so controversial. It is \n     hard to imagine a more suitable place for a small reflection \n     on this legacy and what it might mean today than the Kennedy \n     library.\n       From the very beginning of the sixties we hear the great \n     call of the dead President for a new step forward, for \n     courage and personal responsibility: ``Ask not what your \n     country can do for you--ask what you can do for your \n     country.'' In the course of the sixties the civil rights \n     movement triumphed and eliminated much of the heavy burden of \n     the past. The turmoil of the sixties destroyed the barriers \n     between the sexes and opened a new realm of freedom--sexual \n     freedom. The creative impulse of the sixties produced an \n     unprecedented number of original works in literature, music \n     and arts. The technological progress, accelerated by the \n     effort to conquer the space, set off an information \n     revolution whose fruit we are in full extent reaping only \n     today. In the communist part of the world the end of the \n     decade witnessed an outburst of popular will against the \n     absurdity of the totalitarian dictatorship in Czechoslovakia.\n       If it all stayed at that, we would now be remembering the \n     sixties as a golden age of mankind. However, the hope that \n     had ushered it in remained largely unfulfilled. The removal \n     of barriers did not automatically bring about universal \n     prosperity or universal harmony. A large part of the creative \n     impulse of the times dissipated in disillusion or succumbed \n     to commercial interests. The newfound individual freedom \n     spent itself in hedonism, arbitrariness and in drugs. \n     Technological progress also helped to build a new generation \n     of ever more destructive weapons which were prevented from \n     being used only by the certainty of mutually assured \n     destruction. And the Czechoslovak rebellion against \n     totalitarianism collapsed, in part because of the ambivalence \n     of its efforts, under the avalanche of half a million troops \n     of occupation while the rest of the world could only stand by \n     and watch.\n\n[[Page S 9194]]\n\n       It would be too simple to attribute the failure of our \n     hopes at the time only to unfavorable circumstances, to \n     assassins or to the military might of the totalitarian \n     regime. It would be equally simple to say that our hopes had \n     been false from the very beginning, that they were nothing \n     more than a result of the euphoria of youth or inexperience.\n       Our hopes did not come true because, as many times before \n     in history, we failed to heed that call for personal \n     responsibility and for a service to common interests. The \n     opportunity to work together for the common good gradually \n     degenerated into a service to group interests, sectarian \n     interests and ultimately purely individual interests. The \n     loving sixties were followed by the selfish eighties.\n       I do not think we should tear our garments here as if this \n     were some exceptional and unforgivable failure. The service \n     to one's own interests, the tendency to use one's own \n     potential for one's own good is an inseparable part of human \n     nature and the motivation which ultimately drives the world \n     forward. At the same time it is equally an inseparable part \n     of human nature to love and be loved, to be capable of \n     solidarity, altruism, even of self-sacrifice. Some scientists \n     like E. O.

Mr. President, in the next few days, the Senate \nwill begin to debate regulatory reform legislation to make regulations \nmore sensible, less burdensome, and more efficient.\n  This debate is long overdue. Because while passing laws is important, \nreal people are affected not by congressional debates but by \nimplementation of the law by agencies.\n  And all too often, agencies implement laws with too much paperwork, \ntoo much harassment and too little common sense. It is time to set \nthings straight, and I congratulate the leadership for bringing this \nissue to the floor.\n  At the same time, however, we must remember that preventing \npollution, ensuring food safety and keeping our rivers clean are \ncritically important to a good life for Americans.\n  Unfortunately, some special interest groups do not see it that way. \nAll over Washington, they are trying to get loopholes and special \nrelief that will let them get away with polluting the air and water. \nAnd they are calling their loopholes regulatory reform. They should not \nget away with it.\n  So let us watch what is coming aboard pretty carefully. Let us reform \nGovernment rules and regulations to make them work better. But let us \nnot use regulatory reform to weaken protection of public health and \nsafety and to lower the quality of life.\n\n\n                          the need for reform\n\n  Government has to treat people like adults. It has to understand that \nmost people are good people. They don't need to fill out a lot of forms \nto do the right thing.\n  As the debate unfolds, we will hear theories about so-called super \nmandates. About judicial review. About esoteric provisions of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. About how many permissible statutory \nconstructions can dance on the head of a pin.\n  But when most Montanans think about Government regulations, they are \nmore straightforward. Montanans want common sense. Montanans believe \nmost Federal rules and regulations cost too much. They accomplish too \nlittle. They make responsible business owners fill out too many forms. \nAnd they just plain make people angry.\n                        osha logging regulations\n\n  I will give you an example. Earlier this year, OSHA, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration, proposed a rule that would make \nloggers wear steel-toed boots.\n  Seems to make sense--unless you are actually out in the Montana woods \nin winter, on a steep slope and frozen ground. In that case, steel-toed \nboots can make the job more dangerous, not less. They make your feet go \nnumb, so it is harder to hold your grip. And if you are holding a live \nchainsaw at the time, you are in a lot of trouble.\n  So the people this regulation was meant to help knew it made no sense \nat all. And to add injury to insult, it threatened their jobs. OSHA \ntold them to buy the boots in 2 weeks or take a furlough.\n  Another example was the EPA's decision 2 years ago to ban some kinds \nof bear sprays--pepper sprays that help people avoid injury from bear \nattacks--because they might irritate the nasal tissues of an attacking \ngrizzly. Yet another was the Forest Service's decision to bar loud \nspeech and inappropriate noises in national forests.\n  Most regulations are not as ridiculous or offensive as these. But \neven so, the sheer volume of regulation is a big problem. Small \nbusiness owners often give up all of Friday afternoon to fill out OSHA \nforms and IRS withholding documents just to comply with existing \nregulations, let alone keep up with all the new ones.\n  Today, we are only half-way through 1995. And the Federal Register, \nin which the government publishes its rules and regulations, is about \nto hit the 33,000-page mark. That is about 200 pages of rules, \nregulations, comments, revisions, and rerevisions every day.\n\n\n                         Key elements of reform\n\n  So I congratulate the leadership for moving ahead with regulatory \nreform. The effort is only beginning, but at the end I believe a good \nbill will include five key elements.\n  First, we should open up the regulatory process. It should be easier \nfor people to comment on proposed rules. They should get more notice \nwhen a rule will affect their job or business. You simply cannot expect \na hard-working gas station owner or restaurant manager to subscribe to \nthe Federal Register and track all the changes and revisions in the \nOSHA code.\n  And while they are at it, agencies should explain their rules in \nplain English. For example, look at a sentence from an EPA rule in the \nDecember 29, 1994, Federal Register. It means to say treated hazardous \nwastes are exempt from disposal regulations under two conditions. But \nwhat it actually says is this:\n\n       Currently, hazardous wastes that are used in a manner \n     constituting disposal (applied to or placed on land), \n     including waste-derived products that are produced in whole \n     or in part from hazardous wastes and used in a manner \n     constituting disposal, are not subject to hazardous waste \n     disposal regulations provided the products produced meet two \n     conditions.\n\n  Imagine handing that in to a high school English teacher.\n  Second, we should use new statistical tools like risk assessment and \ncost-benefit analysis when appropriate. They can help agencies set \npriorities, so we spend our money wisely and solve the biggest problems \nfirst. And they can help make sure agencies think creatively and \nconsider all the options before charging ahead. But we must also \nunderstand their limitations--because I do not believe we can place a \ndollar value on things like the survival of the bald eagle or brain \ndamage in children from lead in drinking water.\n  Third, Congress should conduct more oversight. Passing a law is only \na small part of the job. It is implementation of the law that affects \nreal people at home and in business. But too often, Congress passes a \nlaw and then walks away, leaving implementation entirely to bureaucrats \nwho do not always have practical experience. The OSHA logging \nregulation is a good example. Congress should review major new \nregulations closely, so the mistakes are corrected before they start to \nthreaten jobs and businesses.\n  Fourth, we should strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This law \nrequires agencies to pay special attention to the effects of their \nregulations on small business. A good goal--but one agencies sometimes \nignore.\n  Today, small businesses have no right to challenge an agency, in \ncourt, when it fails to comply with the Act. By establishing a \nstreamlined process for judicial review, we can help small businesses \nprotect themselves.\n  And fifth, we must continue strong and effective protection of public \nhealth, public safety and our natural heritage. Clean air, clean water \nand clean neighborhoods are basic American values. They are essential \nto a high quality of life in our country. Regulatory reform should get \nthem for us more efficiently. It must not run away from these goals, \nand allow more contamination of rivers and streams, \n\n[[Page S 9195]]\nmore urban smog, or greater threats to the public health and safety.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  With these five steps, Mr. President, we will make federal rules and \nregulations more effective. And we will do something even more \nimportant. Americans will be more confident that their tax dollars are \nbeing spent wisely, and that we are guaranteeing public health and \nsafety with the absolute minimum of bureaucracy and paperwork.\n  So I look forward to the debate on this bill, and to working with my \ncolleagues to meet these goals.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9194-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE NEW JERSEY DEVILS FOR WINNING 1995 NHL STANLEY CUP\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 142, a \nresolution to congratulate the New Jersey Devils for winning the 1995 \nNHL Stanley Cup, a resolution submitted earlier today by Senators \nLautenberg and Bradley; that the resolution and preamble be agreed to, \nen bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements appear in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 142) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 142\n\n       Whereas on October 5, 1982, the New Jersey Devils played \n     their first National Hockey League game in New Jersey, \n     embarking on a quest for the Stanley Cup which was satisfied \n     13 years later;\n       Whereas the Devils epitomize New Jersey pride with their \n     heart, stamina, and drive and thus have become a part of New \n     Jersey culture;\n       Whereas the New Jersey Devils won 10 games on the road \n     during the Stanley Cup playoffs, thus demolishing the \n     previous record;\n       Whereas the Devils have implemented an ingenious system \n     known as the ``trap'' that was designed by head coach Jacques \n     Lemaire which constantly stifled and frustrated their \n     opponents;\n       Whereas Conn Smythe trophy winner Claude Lemieux led the \n     league with 13 playoff goals, three of which were game-\n     winners, and goalie Martin Brodeur led the league with a 1.67 \n     goals-against average during the playoffs;\n       Whereas the New Jersey hockey fans are the best fans in the \n     nation and deserve commendation for helping build the team \n     into championship caliber and for supporting the Devils \n     during their drive for the Stanley Cup;\n       Whereas the New Jersey Devils during the playoffs beat \n     Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and in the finals swept the \n     heavily favored Detroit Red Wings in four games giving the \n     state of New Jersey its first-ever championship for a major \n     league team officially bearing the state's name: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the New Jersey \n     Devils for their outstanding discipline, determination, \n     emotion, and ingenuity, in winning the 1995 NHL Stanley Cup.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I stand here proud of the New Jersey \nDevils' accomplishment in winning hockey's most treasured prize, the \nStanley Cup. I congratulate the players and their coaches for an \ninspiring series with four straight victories over the Detroit Red \nWings.\n  This capped an impressive string of playoff victories over Boston, \nPittsburgh, and Philadelphia--victories that resulted in the Devils \nbringing the Stanley Cup to my home State for the first time in \nhistory. It is the first time in history that a national professional \nchampionship was won by a team with ``New Jersey'' in its name.\n  Mr. President, it took a great deal of determination, courage, drive, \nand discipline--and no small amount of prayer on the part of fervent \nfans--for the Devils to bring this cup home.\n  And they did this despite the fact that no one thought they could win \nit. Not when the playoffs started. Not when they reached the finals. No \none gave them a chance against the Red Wings.\n  But, under the guidance of Head Coach Jacques Lemaire and with the \ngreat help of Claude Lemieux, the Cup's Most Valuable Player, and \nMartin Brodeur, the Devils demonstrated everything great about New \nJerseyans--we have the heart, the drive, and the stamina to do it when \nwe have to.\n  I will take a moment to mention other outstanding Devils players--Ken \nDaneyko, Bruce Driver, and John MacLean who have each been with the \nDevils since 1983 and have helped start the team's long journey to the \ntop. Also we must commend Jim Dowd, a New Jersey native hailing from \nthe town of Brick, who scored the winning goal in game two.\n  Mr. President, anyone who has been in New Jersey knows that the \nDevils--like our shoreline--are an integral part of our culture. And I, \nalong with 8 million other New Jerseyans look forward to seeing them \ndefend their cup title in the Byrne Arena next year and the year after \nas well.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate them on their remarkable \naccomplishment, and to thank them for the hard fight they fought to \nbring the Stanley Cup to the great State of New Jersey.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9195-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 28, 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, in the past few months, I have taken the \nfloor on several occasions to highlight how the U.N. Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea would protect the national interests of the United \nStates with regard to our fisheries and our economic activities. Today, \nI wish to address how U.S. ratification of the convention will enhance \nour most important interest: national security.\n  The convention establishes as a matter of international law freedom \nof navigation rights that are critical to our military forces. This was \nhighlighted by the President in his Message to Congress, transmitting \nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea:\n\n       The United States has basic and enduring national interests \n     in the oceans and has consistently taken the view that the \n     full range of these interests is best protected through a \n     widely accepted international framework governing uses of the \n     sea. . . . Each succeeding U.S. Administration has recognized \n     this as the cornerstone of U.S. ocean policy. . . . The \n     Convention advances the interests of the United States as a \n     global maritime power. It preserves the right of the U.S. \n     military to use the world's oceans to meet national security \n     requirements and of commercial vessels to carry sea-going \n     cargoes. . . . Early adherence by the United States to the \n     Convention and the Agreement is important to maintain a \n     stable legal regime for all uses of the sea, which covers \n     more than 70 percent of the surface of the globe. Maintenance \n     of such stability is vital to U.S. national security \n\n[[Page S 9196]]\n     and economic strength.'' (Treaty Doc. 103-39, p.iii-iv)\n\n  Secretary of Defense William Perry and Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher emphasized in a joint letter to the Congress last year \nthat:\n  As one of the world's major maritime powers, the United States has a \nmanifest national security interest in the ability to navigate and \noverfly the oceans freely.\n  A recent Department of Defense Report on National Security and the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea concluded that the United States\n\n       . . . national security interests in having a stable oceans \n     regime are, if anything, even more important today than in \n     1982 when the world had a roughly bipolar political dimension \n     and the U.S. had more abundant forces to project power to \n     wherever it was needed.'' (Hearing before the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations on the Current Status of the Convention on \n     the Law of the Sea, S. Hrg. 103-737, pp.61-75)\n\n  In his letter to the Senate accompanying that report Secretary Perry \ndeclared that:\n\n       . . . the Convention establishes a universal regime for \n     governance of the oceans which is needed to safeguard United \n     States security and economic interests, as well as to defuse \n     those situations in which competing uses of the oceans are \n     likely to result in conflict. . . . Historically, this \n     nation's security has depended upon the ability to conduct \n     military operations over, under and on the oceans. . . . To \n     send a strong signal that the United States is committed to \n     an ocean regulatory regime that is guided by the rule of law, \n     General Shalikashvili and I urge your support in securing \n     early advice and consent of the United Nations Convention on \n     the Law of the Sea and implementing Agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Perry's letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. With the end of the cold war, both our vital interests and \nour ability to defend them have shifted. In these fiscally difficult \ntimes, the convention allows us to concentrate our resources on the \nmost strategic points of our national security. Illustrations of this \nphenomenon can be found in the provisions of the Law of the Sea \nConvention that provide for innocent passage, transit passage, and \narchipelagic passage.\n  The convention allows a coastal State to claim a territorial sea that \nshall not exceed 12 nautical miles measured from the baseline. While \nthis provision recognizes the special rights of the coastal state in \nthe area immediately adjacent to its coastline, it also provides \nspecifically for the right of innocent passage for ships, including \nwarships and submarines, to transit through the territorial sea.\n  Likewise, in some areas, archipelagic states have been allowed to \nenclose waters located between the various islands of an archipelago, \nand to claim them as national waters. Unfortunately, some of these \ninstances involve islands located in international straits or along \nroutes used for international navigation and overflight of the highest \nstrategic importance. Here again, the convention strikes the perfect \nbalance by guaranteeing to all ships and aircraft, including warships, \nsubmarines, and military aircraft a right of passage on, over and under \ninternational straits and archipelagic sea lanes.\n  The need to protect freedom of navigation is not merely a theoretical \nissue. There have been recent situations where even U.S. allies denied \nour Armed Forces transit rights in times of need. Such an instance was \nthe 1973 Yom Kippur war when our ability to resupply Israel was \ncritically dependent on transit rights through the Strait of Gibraltar. \nAgain, in 1986, United States aircraft passed through the Strait to \nstrike Libyan targets in response to that government's acts of \nterrorism directed against the United States, after some of our allies \nhad denied us the right to transit through their airspace.\n  In April 1992, Peruvian fighters strafed a United States C-130 \naircraft that was 60 nautical miles off the Peruvian coast, well within \nPeru's claimed 200-nautical-mile territorial sea, but well outside the \n12-nautical-mile limit recognized by the Law of the Sea Convention and \nthe United States. This incident resulted in the death of one U.S. \nservice member and the wounding of several others, as well as the loss \nof the aircraft. Peru continues to challenge United States aircraft \nflying over its claimed territorial sea.\n  There are a number of other situations where having the Law of the \nSea in effect might have made a difference. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a summary of such instances be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PELL. Another way in which the convention protects our national \nsecurity interests is by bringing an incredible amount of stability and \ncertainty with regard to multiple and sometimes divergent ocean uses. \nMost importantly the convention provides the most effective brake on \nexcessive coastal state maritime claims in ocean areas adjacent to \ntheir coasts.\n  If the United States is not a party to the convention, preserving our \nnavigational rights in nonwartime situations becomes increasingly \ncostly. The Law of the Sea provides very clear rules and circumstances \naccording to which these claims need to be recognized. In addition, if \nthe rights of a transiting nation are impeded, the Law of the Sea \nprovides all parties with a very clear set of rules for the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes.\n  Only a few weeks ago, a potential conflict threatened to erupt over \nGreek territorial claims around its islands in the Aegean Sea. Turkey \nhas warned against the transformation of this area into a ``Greek \nLake'' and many have warned of the possibility of conflict over this \nissue. The Law of the Sea specifically calls for peaceful resolution of \nsuch disputes and, when the Hamburg Tribunal on the Law of the Sea is \nconvened, it could be seized to address disputes such as this one.\n  Another potential point of conflict is to be found in the South China \nSea, where conflicting claims have been staked over the Spratly \nIslands. These islands have been claimed by the People's Republic of \nChina, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. \nRecently, some of those claimants have engaged in aggressive \nactivities. The location of the Spratlys is\n of paramount importance, as the islands lie along strategic sea lanes \nthat connect the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf to the Pacific \nOcean. Seventy percent of Japan's oil imports travel through this route \nand both the United States and its allies would stand to lose if armed \nconflict erupted as a result of these conflicting claims. The \nadministration recently advised the various claimants that the United \nStates would view with serious concern any maritime claim or \nrestriction on maritime activity in the South China Sea that was not \nconsistent with the Law of the Sea Convention.\n\n  In that regard, on June 20, 1995, the Committee on Foreign Relations \nreported, and on June 22 the Senate agreed to, Senate Resolution 97, \nintroduced by Senator Thomas and Senator Robb, which I cosponsored. \nThis resolution calls on the parties involved in this dispute to solve \ntheir differences in a manner that is consistent with international \nlaw.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an op ed \npiece that was published on May 26, 1995 in the Washington Times and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. PELL. In it, Keith Eirinberg, a Fellow in the Asian Studies \nProgram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, calls \nthe Law of the Sea Convention perhaps the world's greatest diplomatic \nachievement for having established internationally accepted laws for \nthree fourths of the earth's surface. He also clearly demonstrates that \nexcessive claims have no standing under the Convention and that the \nU.S. ability to influence a peaceful settlement of the dispute over the \nSpratly Islands would be enhanced by U.S. ratification of the treaty.\n  In addition, on June 22, 1995, Rear Adm. Lloyd R. Vasey (Ret.), a \nsenior strategist specializing in Asia-Pacific security, wrote in the \nChristian Science Monitor that the claims over the Spratly Islands \nshould be resolved through international law and the UN \n\n[[Page S 9197]]\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. He added that for its own credibility \nthe U.S. needs to complete ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty. I \nask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. PELL. There are scores of other instances where maritime boundary \ndisputes were solved in a peaceful manner, precisely because the Law of \nthe Sea establishes such clear rules and limitations. If it does not \nratify the Convention, the United\n States will stand at risk of being left out of the enforcement of this \nConstitution for the Oceans, and will be subject to the uncertainties \nof customary international law.\n\n  I have heard arguments that the Convention's provisions on freedom of \nnavigation are not really important because they reflect customary \ninternational law. I disagree with that argument.\n  Customary international law is inherently unstable. Governments can \nbe less scrupulous about flouting the precedents of customary law than \nthey would be if such actions were seen as a violation of their treaty \nobligations.\n  Moreover, not all governments and scholars agree that all of the \ncritical navigation rights protected by the Convention are also \nprotected by customary law. They regard many of those rights as \ncontractual and, as such, available only to parties to the Convention.\n  The concordant judgment of those charged with responsibility for the \nnational security of our Nation is reflected in the report of the \nDepartment of Defense on National Security and the Law of the Sea, \nwhich states:\n\n       Our principal judgement is that public order of the oceans \n     is best established by a universally accepted Law of the Sea \n     treaty that is in the U.S. national interest. ... Reliance \n     upon customary international law in the absence of the \n     modified Convention would represent a necessarily imprecise \n     approach to the problem as well as one which requires the \n     United States to put forces in harm's way when principles of \n     law are not universally understood or accepted. A universal \n     Convention is the best guarantee of avoiding situations in \n     which U.S. forces must be used to assert navigational \n     freedoms, as well as the best method of fostering the growth \n     and use of various conflict avoidance schemes which are \n     contained in the Convention.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not merely my opinion but that of the \nprofessionals whose job it is to protect our Nation's security. We must \nnot ignore their advice: United States ratification of the Law of the \nSea Convention will enhance our national security interests.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1994.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In 1982, the United States made a \n     decision that it would not become a party to the United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea because of its \n     concerns about the deep seabed mining provisions, contained \n     in Part XI of the Convention. The Convention is due to enter \n     into force on November 16, 1994, now that the requisite \n     number of other states (60) have ratified it. However, \n     consultations were recently concluded which resulted in an \n     Agreement to correct what the United States has long viewed \n     as the Convention's flawed deep seabed mining provisions. The \n     United States now intends to sign the Agreement at the United \n     Nations on July 29, 1994. Accordingly, the Convention as \n     modified will be transmitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent at the end of the 103rd Congress.\n       The Department of Defense fully supports U.S. signature of \n     the Agreement, and ratification of the Convention as modified \n     by the Agreement. In the Administration's view, the new \n     Agreement satisfactorily resolves the issues that the U.S. \n     Government and ocean mining interests raised in the early \n     1980's during deliberations over whether the United States \n     should sign the Law of the Sea Convention. The new Agreement \n     meets these objections by correcting the serious \n     institutional and free market deficiencies in the original \n     Convention. We have received indications from other \n     industrialized nations that, with adoption of the new \n     Agreement, they will soon accede to the modified Convention.\n       The Convention establishes a universal regime for \n     governance of the oceans which is needed to safeguard U.S. \n     security and economic interests, as well as to defuse those \n     situations in which competing uses of the oceans are likely \n     to result in conflict. In addition to strongly supporting our \n     interests in freedom of navigation, the Convention provides \n     an effective framework for serious efforts to address land \n     and sea-based sources of pollution and overfishing. Moreover, \n     the Agreement provides us with an opportunity to participate \n     with other industrialized nations in a widely accepted \n     international order to regulate and safeguard the many \n     diverse activities, interests, and resources in the world's \n     oceans. Historically, this nation's security has depended \n     upon the ability to conduct military operations over, under, \n     and on the oceans. The best guarantee that this free and \n     unfettered access to the high seas will continue in the years \n     ahead is for the U.S. to become a party to the Convention, as \n     modified by the Agreement, at the earliest possible time.\n       In the coming months, we anticipate heightened public \n     debate of the merits of the Law of the Sea Convention. To put \n     that debate into perspective, you will find enclosed a paper \n     which briefly outlines the history of the original \n     Convention, the steps leading to the formalization of the \n     Part XI Agreement, and the nation's vital national security \n     and other interests in becoming bound by the modified \n     Convention.\n       To send a strong signal that the United States is committed \n     to an ocean regulatory regime that is guided by the rule of \n     law, General Shalikashvili and I urge your support in \n     securing early advice and consent of the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea and implementing Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n Particular Cases Where Having the Law of the Sea Convention in Effect \n                     Might Have Made a Difference:\n\n       Between 1961 and 1970, Peru seized 74 U.S. fishing vessels \n     over disputed tuna fisheries.\n       In 1986, Ecuador interfered with a USAF aircraft flight \n     over the high seas 175 miles from the Ecuadorian coast.\n       Since 1986, Peru has repeatedly challenged U.S. aircraft \n     flying over its claimed 200 nautical mile territorial sea. \n     During several of these challenges, the Peruvian aircraft \n     operated in a manner that unnecessarily and intentionally \n     endangered the safety of the transiting U.S. aircraft and its \n     crew. This includes an incident where a U.S. C-130 was fired \n     upon and a U.S. service member was killed.\n       In 1986, two Cuban MIG-21 aircraft intercepted a USCG HU-\n     25A Falcon flying outside of its 12 nautical mile territorial \n     sea, claiming it had entered Cuban Flight Information Region \n     (FIR) without permission.\n       In 1988, Soviet warships intentionally ``bumped'' two U.S. \n     warships engaged in innoncent passage south of Sevastopol in \n     the Black Sea.\n       In 1984, Mexican Navy vessels approached U.S. Coast Guard \n     vessels operating outside Mexican territorial waters and \n     interfered with valid USCG law enforcement activities.\n       Libyan claims to the Gulf of Sidra have resulted in \n     repeated challenges and hostile action against U.S. forces \n     operating in high seas.\n       During the 1980's, transits of the Northwest Passage by the \n     USCG POLAR SEA and POLAR STAR were challenged by the Canadian \n     Government.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 26, 1995]\n\n       U.N. Maritime Pact Could Produce South China Sea Solution\n\n                        (By Keith W. Eirinberg)\n\n       The recent Clinton administration statement on the Spratly \n     Islands dispute, urging negotiations instead of force, is the \n     strongest declaration yet of U.S. interests in the South \n     China Sea.\n       While critics of the administration argue that the United \n     States should ``draw a line in the sand'' against Chinese \n     aggression in the Spratlys, U.S. interests are better served \n     by efforts to persuade the contesting parties to follow \n     international law, including the newly effective 1982 U.N. \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea, and find a diplomatic \n     solution.\n       The Republican-controlled Senate can help America's efforts \n     to protect these interests by ratifying the Law of the Sea \n     accord, giving this country greater standing as it encourages \n     a peaceful resolution of the dispute.\n       The Spratly Islands imbroglio is essentially a maritime \n     controversy centered on the question of sovereignty and \n     jurisdiction over geologic features and adjacent waters in \n     the South China Sea.\n       Six nations claim part or all of the Spratlys: the People's \n     Republic of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia \n     and Brunei. The dispute has direct implications for U.S. \n     interests: freedom of navigation and overflight and the \n     maintenance of peace and stability in Southeast Asia.\n       The sovereignty issue appears intractable, so many of the \n     parties have voiced a desire to shelve this point and look to \n     joint development of the area's resources. China, in a \n     ``divide and conquer'' strategy, insists on negotiating \n     bilaterally and rejects a regional or international approach. \n     The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes \n     some of the claimants, is interested in a regional solution.\n       The parties to the dispute, except Brunei, claim ownership \n     over islands, reefs, atolls, rocks and cays in the Spratlys. \n     The Spratlys are important because they lie along strategic \n     sea lanes and lines of communication that connect the Indian \n     and Pacific oceans. More than 70 percent of Japan's oil \n     imports and a large volume of global commerce travel along \n     this maritime route. The Spratlys are domestically important \n     to the claimants \n\n[[Page S 9198]]\n     because of the politics and patriotism reflected in ownership.\n       It is the potential of vast hydrocarbon resources beneath \n     the seabed that has caused this dispute to become a flash \n     point in East Asia. The energy needs of the developing \n     claimants have made the exploitation of oil and gas beneath \n     the South China Sea especially attractive.\n       The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea--perhaps the \n     world's greatest diplomatic achievement for having \n     established internationally accepted laws for three-fourths \n     of the earth's surface--can provide the framework for a \n     diplomatic solution. For example, it prescribes the methods \n     for determining boundaries. Of the claimants, the Philippines \n     and Vietnam have ratified the convention.\n       To Beijing, however, ownership is nine-tenths of the law. \n     While advocating a diplomatic solution, it has aggressively \n     placed encampments and markers in contested areas of the \n     Spratlys. This ``talk and take'' pattern was most recently \n     illustrated in China's occupation of Mischief Reef in \n     Philippine-claimed territory.\n       China's cavalier attitude to international law is also \n     shown by its 1992 territorial sea law. This declares Chinese \n     jurisdiction over virtually all of the South China Sea--a \n     claim that has no basis in modern international law.\n       China must play by the rules. Washington encourages Beijing \n     to join the international community in many different areas, \n     from nuclear proliferation to human rights. But Washington \n     finds itself in a poor position to persuade Beijing to ratify \n     the Law of the Sea accord without having done so itself.\n       U.S. administrations had resisted ratification because of \n     inequities in the deep-seabed-mining provisions. But changes \n     to the convention have addressed U.S. objections.\n       Last year, with strong Defense Department backing, the \n     White House signed the amended Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea and sent it to the Senate for ratification.\n       America's ability to influence a peaceful settlement of the \n     Spratly Islands dispute would be enhanced by U.S. \n     ratification of the treaty. In light of the tensions in the \n     South China Sea, this step should be taken soon.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n          [From The Christian Science Monitor, June 22, 1995]\n\n Collision in the China Sea--World Oil and Shipping Lanes at Stake in \n                          Multination Dispute\n\n                          (By Lloyd R. Vasey)\n\n       East Asia's economic momentum may grind to a premature halt \n     unless political leaders find a way to defuse tensions over \n     territorial disputes in the South China Sea. With several \n     countries on a collision course, a major regional crisis is \n     waiting to happen.\n       At issue are claims of sovereignty over the Spratly and \n     Paracel Islands--hundreds of islets and reefs and surrounding \n     seas believed to be rich in oil, gas, and other resources. \n     China, which urgently needs new energy sources, is the \n     central disputant; others include Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, \n     the Philippines, and Taiwan. China's claims are historically \n     based, going back several centuries when the South China Sea \n     was an area of preeminent Chinese influence and power. \n     Currently they have no basis in international law, and claims \n     of some of the other countries are also questionable.\n       The prevailing view in Asia is that China is deliberately \n     expanding its geopolitical influence in the region. This \n     perception was dramatically reinforced in 1992 when the \n     Chinese People's Congress declared ownership of the waters \n     around the Spratlys and Paracels and readiness to use \n     military power to defend its interests. The claim would make \n     the South China Sea a virtual Chinese lake straddling \n     shipping lanes carrying huge volumes of global trade, \n     including the oil lifelines of Japan and South Korea.\n       Indonesia and other countries of the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have convened unofficial \n     forums seeking to resolve the disputes, but progress on the \n     issues has stalled.\n       Regional tensions escalated last month when Philippine \n     president Fidel Ramos challenged China's ``illegal'' \n     occupation of a small atoll in the Spratlys aptly named \n     Mischief Reef.\n       It lies well within the Philippine's 200 mile Exclusive \n     Economic Zone but also within the area claimed by Beijing.\n       China hasn't hesitated to use force in asserting \n     territorial claims. In 1974 it seized most of the Paracel \n     islands east of Vietnam. In 1988, the two engaged in bloody \n     clashes over the Spratlys.\n       Indonesians are deeply suspicious of China's revision of a \n     map that now depicts part of the maritime area around Natuna \n     island, hundreds of miles south of the Spratlys, to be under \n     Chinese jurisdiction. Indonesia's military leaders have \n     announced that they will defend their national interests by \n     force if necessary. What makes the issue particularly irksome \n     to Indonesia is that a $35 billion deal involving a United \n     States oil company was signed last year to help develop the \n     Natuna gas field, possibly one of the world's largest.\n       Such colliding claims ought to alert Washington to pay much \n     closer attention to this high-stakes strategic game. The \n     implications for American interests are disturbing: future \n     access to resources, freedom of the seas, the balance of \n     power, and regional stability are all involved.\n       The US should now revamp its policy of relying on ASEAN \n     even when important American interests are involved. Instead, \n     the US should volunteer to act as honest broker to work out \n     production-sharing agreements for joint development of \n     resources in contested areas, and request disputants to put \n     sovereignty claims on hold. These claims should be resolved \n     through international law and the UN Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea. For its own credibility the US needs to complete \n     ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty, now in the Senate. \n     Leadership won't cost Washington an extra dime, nor will it \n     require any troops. Crisis prevention is what it's all about.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/27/senate-section/article/S9195-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 8:40 A.M.
