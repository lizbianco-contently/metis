Mr. President, there are few things more disappointing and \ndisturbing than broken promises. Despite repeated assurances from \nRussian officials that they sincerely desire to fully abide by the \nprincipals of free and fair trade, they are once again considering \nbarriers against the import of agricultural products.\n  I have to add that there are few things more worrisome than to have \nour President visit Russia and tell us everything is OK when it is not. \nAnd this appears to be the case when it comes to United States-Russian \ntrade relations.\n  Yesterday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha \nannounced his Government's plans to introduce food import quotas that \nwill focus primarily on poultry purchases, the vast majority of which \ncome from the United States. The Deputy Prime Minister himself even \nemphasized that it is American poultry products against which these \nimport quotas are directed.\n  This is particularly outrageous in light of Russian Prime Minister's \nChernomyrdin's assurances to Vice President Gore that Moscow was going \nto back away from unfair trade practices that the Prime Minister \nannounced last February against agricultural imports into Russia.\n  Russia's new effort to restrict the import of American poultry \nproducts should not surprise us. For the last 6 months Moscow has \npersistently been trying to ban the import of American poultry \nproducts. First, they tried to impose a bogus health ban. When it \nbecame clear that could not fly, they have been trying to increase \ntariffs against our poultry products. Now, they are talking about \nimport quotas.\n  A decision by Moscow to impose import quotas, higher tariffs, or any \nother sanctions against American agricultural products would be most \nunfortunate. This is particularly true in the case of poultry. The \namazing growth of in our chicken sales in Russia over the past 5 years \ndemonstrates that Russian consumers recognize the quality and \nreasonable price of United States poultry. Needless to say, import \nquotas will only end up hurting United States poultry producers, \nRussian consumers, and the United States-Russian trade relationship.\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\n  I want to emphasize that this issue has repercussions that go well \nbeyond poultry. Indeed, agricultural import quotas are very much part \nof a broad turn toward protectionism in Russian economy policy.\n  This trend toward protectionism is particularly disturbing when seen \nin the light of overall United States-Russian Trade and United States \nforeign assistance programs to Russia. Today, the United States is \nrunning a trade deficit with Russia that amounts to over $2 billion \nannually. Import quotas against poultry and other agricultural imports \nwill only further restrict access to the Russian market by our most \ncompetitive exports and will further widen our trade deficit with \nRussia.\n  This is particularly outrageous when one considers that since 1992 \nthe United States has provided some $2.44 billion in foreign assistance \nto Russia. Much of this assistance is designed to help Russia develop a \nfully functioning free market economy. The American people would be \nwell justified in questioning such assistance to countries that close \ntheir markets to U.S. exports.\n  Should Russia actually decide to impose trade quotas against American \nexports, it is essential that United States Government respond with \nforceful and immediate measures.\n  How we respond to protectionist policies by Moscow will be closely \nwatched by other beneficiaries of American foreign assistance, \nparticularly those among the former Republics of the Soviet Union. \nThus, Russia's increasing protectionism and our response to it must be \nviewed through the lens not only of trade, but also the broader \ndimensions of United States relations with Russia, Central and Eastern \nEurope, and the world.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that we must send a strong message to \nRussia that we will not tolerate such blatant protectionism. Any less \nof a response will only send the wrong signal to Moscow and other \nnations that protectionism is a legitimate policy tool that they can \nuse with impunity.\n  The Russian Government must understand that free trade is a two-way \nstreet. If they want to benefit from our foreign assistance, sell their \nproducts and services to us, expand their economy, and become a full \nparticipant in the global market place, then they are going to have to \nlet us sell our products and services to them. If they insist on \nerecting protectionist trade barriers, such as the import quotas, then \nthey must fully understand that there will be a heavy price to pay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks the 81st anniversary of the \nArmenian genocide. Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire in Turkey \nsubjected the Armenian people to a brutal campaign of genocide that \nresulted in the deaths of 1\\1/2\\ million people. Those who were not \nimmediately killed died during the forced deportation of the Armenian \npopulation. One-third of the Armenian people died during these 8 tragic \nyears.\n  The crimes committed against the Armenians are among the worst \natrocities in human history. Tragically, this cruel and massive \nslaughter was only the first of a succession of state-sponsored \ngenocides carried out in this century. The recent mass graves uncovered \nin Bosnia remind us that the world has still not learned the lessons of \nthe history of the Armenian, Jewish, and Cambodian people.\n  I commend the Armenian Assembly of America and the Armenian National \nCommittee of America for their impressive continuing efforts to educate \nAmericans about Armenian history and culture. The tireless work of \nthese two effective organizations gives renewed hope and assurance that \nthe extraordinary sacrifices of the Armenian people will never be \nforgotten, and that the remarkable continuing contributions of \nArmenians to this country and many other lands will always be \nremembered and honored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4004-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate reported by a \nunanimous vote of 100 yeas to 0 the Health Insurance Reform Act, S. \n1028.\n  This legislation is designed to help millions of Americans gain \naccess to health insurance coverage as well as keep their coverage when \nchanging or losing their jobs.\n  Over the past several days, I have received numerous telephone calls \nand inquiries from across the country regarding the antifraud and abuse \nprovisions which were added to the bill last week. I understand that \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate and House have received similar \nphone calls. These individuals have expressed concern over the bill's \nimplications for alternative medicine as well as for services provided \nby nonmedical health care providers.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate approved on Thursday, April 18, \n1996, an amendment by Senators Dole and Roth that contained a \nsubstantive new health care antifraud and abuse program. These \nprovisions, now contained under title V of S. 1028, were essentially \ndeveloped by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nSenator Cohen.\n  The antifraud and abuse provisions are designed to provide for a more \ncoordinated Federal and State approach in addressing health care fraud \nand abuse, which is currently costing the Federal Government and \nprivate payers billions of dollars a year.\n  This is an issue which has been the subject of numerous congressional \nhearings in both the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the Special \nCommittee on Aging over the past several years.\n  It is evident there is a need for a more enhanced program to \nappropriately address the growing and deliberate menace by perpetrators \nwho deliberately scheme to defraud public and private payers of scarce \nhealth care dollars.\n  The health care antifraud and abuse provisions are not new to the \nSenate or the House. In large part, they were formulated from the \nlegislation developed by Senator Cohen, S. 1088, and were, in fact, \nsimilar to the provisions included in the Balanced Budget Act as passed \nby the Congress late last year.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned, however, that the antifraud provisions \ncould have unintended consequences and adversely impact the care \nprovided by health care professionals who utilize alternative \ntherapies, such as herbal treatments, or other nonmedical health care \nproviders.\n  It is certainly not my desire, and based on my discussions, nor the \nintent of my colleague Senator Cohen who drafted the original antifraud \nlanguage, that these provisions in any way impede consumers from access \nto alternative or nonmedical treatment therapies.\n  And, I would add that Senator Cohen and I specifically addressed \nthese concerns in our colloquy on the floor of the Senate last \nThursday, April 18, 1996, although I know that many people still have \nconcerns.\n  I want to assure my colleagues in both the Senate and House--and \nespecially those individuals in the alternative and nonmedicine \ncommunity--that I will continue my efforts to clarify, where necessary, \nand fine-tune the language as the bill moves to the conference \ncommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4004-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4004-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES. HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nthat for the week ending April 19, the United States imported 7,300,000 \nbarrels of oil each day--712,000 barrels fewer than the 8,012,000 \nbarrels imported during the same period a year ago.\n  This is one of those rare weeks when less oil was imported in 1996 \nthan in 1995. Nevertheless, as the box scores I regularly insert into \nthe Record indicate, the trend is steadily upward.\n  Americans now rely on foreign oil for more than 50 percent of their \nneeds, and there is no sign that this upward trend will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained 45 percent of its oil \nsupply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the \n1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. \nproducers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the \ncalamity that will result if and when foreign producers shut off our \nsupply, or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing \ninto the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4004-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today we commemorate the 81st \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide, a horrendous crime against \nhumanity which cannot be denied.\n  Beginning on April 24, 1915--81 years ago today--the declining \nOttoman Empire undertook a systematic effort to kill or drive out the \nArmenian people. By 1923, more than 1 million Armenians perished as a \nresult of execution, starvation, disease, the harsh environment, and \nphysical abuse. Others were driven from their homeland.\n  The terrible tragedy that befell the Armenian people was the first \nsystematic genocide in this century. Unfortunately, it was not the \nlast. The Nazi Holocaust, Stalin's purges, and the killings of \nCambodians by the Khmer Rouge are all further examples of brutality and \ndeath carried out in the name of the state. In Bosnia, American \nleadership and united international diplomacy and intervention has \nfinally brought an end to the genocidal ethnic cleansing, though ethnic \ndivisions there will be long in healing.\n  We mark this date in history because it is so important that we \nremember. We must remember the Armenian genocide and other abuses of \nstate authority against ethnic minorities. We must remember all of the \nvictims of crimes against humanity. Our memory, our vigilance, is \nessential to ensuring that these acts do not happen again, to Armenians \nor any other group.\n  The Armenian people and their culture have survived. The Armenian-\nAmerican community is thriving in a land where cultural and ethnic \ndiversity are increasingly valued. And the collapse of the Soviet Union \ngave rise to an independent, democratic Armenian state.\n  So let us remember the Armenian genocide, let us be vigilant to \nprevent such crimes in the future, and let us celebrate the Armenian \npeople, who have overcome this tragedy to thrive in independent Armenia \nand in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4005-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a year ago this month, a young child \nlabor activist, Iqbal Masih, was killed in his village in Pakistan. In \n1994, when Iqbal traveled to the United States to receive the Reebok \nHuman Rights Award, he also met with the students at Broad Meadows \nMiddle School in Quincy, MA. After Iqbal's death, the students at Broad \nMeadows decided to honor his memory by building a school in Iqbal's \nvillage.\n  Earlier this month, the students announced that they have raised \n$100,000 for a school which will be built by Sudhaar, a nongovernmental \norganization in Pakistan. Their dedication and commitment to Iqbal's \ndream assure that he will live on in the hearts and minds of all those \nwho will have a better chance in life because of the school they are \nbuilding. Armed with the advantages of education, these children in \nPakistan will be able to improve their own lives and the lives of their \nfamilies, their communities, their country, and even our common planet.\n  Last November, one of the recipients of the Robert F. Kennedy Human \nRights Award was Kailash Satyarthi, head of the South Asian Coalition \non Child Servitude, an independent non-governmental organization \ndedicated to the eradication of child labor and bonded labor in the \ncarpet industry.\n  Mr. Satyarthi and his colleagues have established what is known as \nthe Rugmark label, to identify carpets which have not been made with \nchild labor. They are urging consumers to purchase only carpets which \ncarry the label.\n  Mr. President, on the anniversary of Iqbal's death, Albert Shanker, \npresident of the American Federation of Teachers, has urged all \nAmericans to honor the Rugmark label. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. \nShanker's appeal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 14, 1996]\n\n                              Knotted Rugs\n\n                           (By Alert Shanker)\n\n       The murder of Iqbal Masih, a year ago this week, forced \n     many Americans to look at a problem they would have preferred \n     to avoid: child labor in developing countries. Iqbal was a \n     world-famous human rights activist. He was also a young \n     Pakistani boy whose mother had sold him to a rug maker when \n     he was four. Iqbal eventually freed himself, and by the time \n     he was murdered, at the age of twelve, he had helped free \n     3,000 other bonded child laborers. That is probably why he \n     was murdered. But many millions of children in Pakistan, \n     India, and other developing nations continue to work as gem \n     stone polishers, glass blowers, and makers of matches, \n     fireworks, clothing and hand-knotted rugs, often conditions \n     that are unspeakable.\n       Children who knot rugs are crowded into filthy, poorly lit \n     shops that have minimal ventilation for as many as 16 hours a \n     day, 7 days a week. They are often chained to their looms, \n     and they risk being beaten or even killed if they try to \n     escape. Many die anyway because of horrible conditions under \n     which they work. Manufacturers consider young children to be \n     desirable ``employees'' because they work hard and put up \n     with pay and conditions that adults would not tolerate. The \n     children receive no more than a couple of cents a day for \n     their work; many get nothing.\n       A number of developing nations--India and Nepal, for \n     example--have laws on the books banning child labor. \n     Nevertheless, you hear some people using hard-nosed economic \n     arguments to justify exploitation of children. They say that \n     if child labor is what it takes to bolster the economy in a \n     developing country, that's the price the country has to pay. \n     And it's really nobody else's business anyway. But many of \n     these countries also have very high unemployment among \n     adults. Why shouldn't companies hire adults so that parents \n     can support their children instead of having to sell them \n     into bondage?\n       However, we don't have to wait for the companies making \n     hand-knotted rugs to get religion (or for countries that are \n     dragging their feet to start enforcing their child labor \n     laws). These rugs are an important export item, and people \n     who buy them can have a big say about the conditions under \n     which they are made. The traditional weapon used by people \n     who want to protest economic injustice is the boycott: Don't \n     buy the product. But a boycott only punishes, and it often \n     punishes those who act responsibly as well as those who \n     don't.\n       An Indian child advocate named Kailash Satvarthi had a \n     better idea. He established a nonprofit foundation that \n     allows consumers to identify and buy hand-knotted rugs that \n     are not made with child labor. Rugmark, as the foundation is \n     called, inspects companies that apply for certification and \n     vouches for the fact that they are not using child labor to \n     make their hand-knotted rugs. Inspectors also pay surprise \n     visits to Rugmark-certified companies to make sure they \n     continue to abide by their commitment to use adult\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\n     labor only. Consumers can recognize Rugmark rugs by a label \n     that only they will carry.\n       Rugmark, which is now two years old, has signed up and \n     certified 15 percent of the companies producing hand-knotted \n     rugs in India. A number of others are moving toward \n     certification, but the process is complicated and many carpet \n     makers are understandably hostile to the idea of losing a \n     cheap, excellent, and plentiful supply of labor. So far, the \n     total production of Rugmark rugs has gone to Germany, where \n     the country's largest mail order firm and several large \n     department stores have agreed to carry them. But Rugmark has \n     recently opened up shop in Nepal, with the support of 70 \n     percent of the carpet manufacturers there. These rugs will \n     soon be available for import to the U.S. It's up to American \n     consumers to start talking to stores and catalog companies \n     that carry hand-knotted rugs. They should let the businesses \n     know that they do not want rugs made by children, and they \n     should urge them to put pressure on the importers they deal \n     with.\n       This coming week, the first Rugmark-certified rugs imported \n     to the U.S. will be auctioned off at a ceremony commemorating \n     the anniversary of Iqbal Masih's death last year. If American \n     consumers do their part, these rugs should be the first of \n     many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4005-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4006-S4007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY S. 735\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 1 year ago last week the American people \nwere forced to experience the unimaginable when terrorists placed a \nbomb in a Federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 innocent \ncitizens, some of them children. In response to that grisly deed, as \nwell as the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, \nand the downing of Pan American flight 103 over Scotland, the United \nStates Senate passed S. 735, the ``Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention \nAct,'' on June 7, 1995. The measure, I think it is important to note, \nwas supported by 91 Senators, myself included.\n  I supported that bill because I believed it was a good piece of \nlegislation that went a long way toward helping law enforcement \nagencies combat the rising scourge of domestic terrorism. It was an \neffective measure with many important provisions--important crime-\nfighting tools--specifically designed to thwart this growing menace. \nOur goal, or so I thought, had been to stop domestic terrorism before \nit could happen; to let terrorists know that they were going to be put \ndown before they could carry out their cowardly acts.\n  When S. 735 left the Senate last June, there were provisions in the \nbill that would have permitted Federal law enforcement agencies to \npursue known or suspected terrorist groups with the same means that \nthose agencies now employ when pursuing organized crime, or murderers, \nor bank swindlers. And, as I said, those provisions were endorsed by 91 \nSenators.\n  Unfortunately, though, what started out last June as a very \nworthwhile effort, has this past week been reported back by the \nconference committee disemboweled. In fact, this measure has been so \nthoroughly gutted that I do not see how anyone can honestly call it a \nterrorism ``prevention'' bill. Almost every provision designed to \nenhance the effectiveness of law enforcement officials, almost every \nprovision designed to make it more difficult for the terrorist to \noperate, and almost every provision that was fashioned to put a stop to \nthis type of activity, was simply sacrificed in conference.\n  Mr. President, consider this: The original Dole-Hatch bill, and the \nversion that passed the Senate, contained language that would have \nadded certain terrorist offenses to the current long list of crimes for \nwhich Federal law enforcement authorities can seek a wiretap. Using \nweapons of mass destruction, providing material support to terrorists, \nor engaging in violence at international airports--all of these were \nactivities for which a wiretap could have been sought. But the language \nthat would have added those crimes to the wiretap list was dropped by \nthe conference committee. Consequently, what that means is that, right \nnow, the FBI can institute a wiretap on someone suspected of bribing a \nbank officer, but not on someone who may be about to attack the New \nYork City subway system with poisonous gas.\n  That is ludicrous. It simply boggles the mind. If this is supposed to \nbe a bill to ``prevent'' terrorism, then how can we tie the hands of \nlaw enforcement authorities like that? What kind of message does that \nsend to some deranged individual who may be plotting a terrorist \nactivity? What does that say to those organizations that practice \ninternational terrorism and may be planning to target the United \nStates? Chasing terrorists with fewer tools than we would use to \napprehend someone suspected of bribing a bank official is not, in my \nopinion, the way to ``prevent'' terrorism.\n  When the Senate considered S. 735 last year, it added, by a vote of \n77 to 19, a provision that would have allowed law enforcement \nauthorities to obtain what are called multipoint wiretaps. In effect, \nthese special wiretaps allow officials to target an individual suspect \nrather than an individual telephone. Given the rapid development of \ncommunications technology, it is nearly impossible for Federal \nofficials to conduct meaningful investigations of suspected terrorists \nwhen all that person has to do is change telephones. Right now, a \nterrorist can move from his home phone to a car phone to a cellular \nphone and law enforcement officials--unless they can prove such \nmovement is intentionally meant to thwart the surveillance--will be \nleft in the dust. But the provision to allow multipoint wiretaps was \ndropped in conference.\n\n  Again, such action defies logic. How can we say that we are seriously \nworking to prevent terrorism when we will not even allow officials to \nkeep pace with the terrorists. What message are we sending when we say \nthat the only terrorists worthy of stopping before they act are those \nstupid enough to use a single telephone? This is not, I am sorry to \nsay, prevention.\n  Mr. President, last June the Senate also adopted an amendment to S. \n735 that would have allowed the Attorney General to request the \ntechnical and logistical assistance of the U.S. military in emergency \nsituations involving biological and chemical weapons of mass \ndestruction. Such authority already exists in the case of nuclear \nweapons. The amendment the Senate adopted merely extended that \nauthority to include biological and chemical weapons.\n  I believe this was an important amendment because the Armed Forces of \nthis Nation have special capabilities in this area, with individuals \nwho possess the training to counter biological or chemical weapons. The \npolice departments of our country and the fire departments of our \ncountry are not equipped to deal with these emergencies. They simply do \nnot have the expertise to handle a biological or chemical weapons \nattack. So the Senate adopted the provision, by unanimous consent I \nwould note, that allows for the technical expertise of the military to \nbe used should a terrorist attack occur in which biological or chemical \nweapons are used.\n  But that provision, too, was dropped by the conference committee. \nConsequently, we have a bill that purports to prevent terrorism, but \nhamstrings Federal, State, and local authorities in any case involving \nbiological or chemical weapons.\n  The citizens of New York City, or of Los Angeles, or of any city in \nthis Nation should not be forced to suffer a nuclear attack from a \nterrorist organization before they can expect help from the Federal \nGovernment. The American people should not be told, as this bill \nimplicitly tells them, that an imminent attack with chemical weapons is \nnot serious enough to warrant the use of the military. The American \npeople should not have to experience, as did the citizens of Tokyo in \nMarch 1995, a gas attack in a subway system before their Congress is \nwilling to act.\n  Last, when S. 735 was passed by the Senate last year, it contained a \nprovision that would have made it a Federal crime for any person to \ndistribute material that teaches someone how to make a bomb if that \nperson intends or knows that the bomb will be used to commit a crime. \nThat provision, offered by Senator Feinstein, was included in the \nSenate bill by unanimous consent. Not one of our colleagues stood up \nand objected to it. But, like many of these preventive tools, the \nFeinstein amendment was dropped by the conference committee.\n  It is simply absurd to expect this bill to negatively impact \nterrorists if the Congress is not even willing to prevent the \ndistribution of what amounts to terrorist training manuals. How can\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nanyone say that this legislation--absent the Feinstein amendment--is a \nserious effort aimed at prevention? How do we intend to stop a future \nterrorist from blowing up a Federal building if we will not even take \naway his instruction manual?\n  Mr. President, the provisions that I have highlighted here are just \nsome of the provisions that I believe made S. 735, the Comprehensive \nTerrorism Prevention Act, a good, tough, worthwhile bill. But as I have \nnoted, each of those was dropped from the final product. As such, we \nhave been left with a measure that, in many ways, is simply untrue to \nits title. No longer, in my opinion, is this bill comprehensive, or \ndirected at prevention. Accordingly, I was compelled to vote against \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Iowa we are \nin morning business with Senators allowed to speak up to 5 minutes \neach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4006-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4007-S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE VOID IN MORAL LEADERSHIP--PART SIX\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I continued my series of talks \non this floor on the failure of moral leadership in the White House. I \nunderstand that sometime after I spoke--and I am sorry I was not here \non the floor to politely listen to what he had to say--my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, addressed my comments. So I would like to \nrespond to his comments.\n  First, I want to echo what he said about our long friendship and \nrelationship working together, particularly to protect the taxpayers' \ninterests. And that cooperation includes not just saving billions in \ndefense cost overruns and defective weapons, as he mentioned yesterday, \nit also included the work that he and I did in passing the taxpayers' \nbill of rights. That was a bill to protect our taxpayers and to give \nthem more protections against the abusive practices of the IRS.\n  I have not known a Senator in this body who has been more dedicated \nto good Government than Senator Pryor has been. When he retires after \nthis Congress, we will lose not just a respected colleague and friend, \nbut an effective consensus builder. I will miss his leadership and I \nknow my colleagues will as well.\n  Yesterday my friend from Arkansas defended the President's record on \nthe environment in the wake of criticism that I had raised. What \nSenator Pryor said is fair enough. I do not have any problems with \nthat, because the Senator has a right to protect his friend, the former \nGovernor of his home State, when his record has been critiqued, as I \nhave been doing in several speeches on the floor of the Senate.\n  Apparently my friend from Arkansas misunderstood my comments \nregarding Earth Day. I did not mean to take exception to the President \ncelebrating Earth Day at our national parks. Earth Day should be \ncelebrated. Environmental protection is and should be a very high \npriority, and the President should continue to show his commitments to \nthis issue.\n  But put yourself in my position, or the position of a constituent \nfrom my State. I was referring yesterday to the director of the Iowa \nDepartment of Natural Resources, who wrote a letter that I placed in \nthe Record yesterday.\n  You can all read it. The director of the Iowa Department of Natural \nResources is charged with protecting the environment in my State of \nIowa. Yet, as he watched the President tout his environmental record on \nEarth Day, he is faced with the fact that the President's budget will \nresult in the termination of many important environmental programs. So, \nfor the director of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, he \nclearly sees President Clinton's actions falling far short of the \nrhetoric of the President of the United States.\n  However, I do find it interesting, Mr. President, that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas yesterday, in response to me, failed to address the main \npoints of my remarks. You see, my point was not to critique the \nPresident's record on the environment. Rather, it was a troubling \npattern that this President has in saying one thing and doing another. \nMy point was also to explain why a pattern like that can be so \ndamaging, because it does two things--first, it continues to nourish \nthe climate of cynicism that has swept the country, and, second, it \nfails to set a good record for the country, especially for the young \npeople. A country without leaders is a country without direction.\n  There is no more important attribute for a President, any President, \nthan moral leadership. That is according to a former great President, \nFDR, former member of the same party as my good friend from Arkansas. I \nknow Senator Pryor has regard for the judgment and wisdom of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. What did FDR mean when he said moral leadership is \nthe most important attribute of any President? He meant simply it is \nimportant for a President to set a good example, the kind of example \nthat we would like to see set for our children by our teachers, by our \ncommunity leaders, by our little league coaches, and, yes, even our \nparents.\n  I have laid out specifically in seven previous speeches where I \nthought our President has failed to set a proper example. The practice \ncuts across all issues, not just on the environment. It has happened on \nthe budget, happened on Travelgate, happened on Whitewater, on \nAmeriCorps, and on combating drugs.\n  Simply put, the programs do not do what the lofty rhetoric says they \ndo. There is tremendous damage done with this false advertising. It \nerodes the ability of our Nation's leaders to lead and undercuts their \nmoral authority to lead. That is when cynicism grows.\n  Mr. President, could I have 3 more minutes, please?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object; I do not intend to \nobject. There was an agreement to lay down the immigration bill at 10 \na.m. So, if we can get an agreement to extend the morning hour, if the \nSenator would ask to extend the morning hour.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. By 3 minutes? Five minutes? Ten minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thought my friend from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, would \nhave taken issue with my observations that the President has not set a \ngood example for the country and for the young people. I thought he \nwould take issue with some of the people I quoted who made other \nobservations, and I would like to give some examples.\n  The observation that James Stewart made in his book ``Blood Sport.'' \nHe said the story of Whitewater is about the arrogance of power, about \n``what people think they can get away with as an elected official, and \nthen how candid and honest they are when questioned about it.''\n  Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist, observed why the White \nHouse was covering up Travelgate and Whitewater even though there were \nnot any crimes. In January, he noted that ``the vanity of the Clintons \nis . . . that they are morally superior.'' He said, ``The offense is \nhypocrisy of a high order. Having posed as moral betters, they had to \ncover up. At stake is their image.''\n  The observation of Rouvain Benison, a Democrat, who was quoted in the \nWashington Post on March 24. He said, ``Whitewater is a symptom, the \nlack of moral leadership, of moral integrity, strength, courage--all \nthe good things in a person's character.''\n  The observation of Eric Pooley of Time magazine. He wrote recently \nthat, with this White House, ``speeches are as important as substance \nand rhetoric becomes its own reality.'' He then quotes a senior White \nHouse adviser as saying, ``Words are actions.'' In other words, it is \nnot important what the President does; just listen to what he says.\n  These are all examples that I have given over the past months in \nspeeches on the floor. I am merely compiling the observations of \nothers, of respected, credible individuals. This is what I thought my \nfriend from Arkansas would have responded to, because the important \nissue is moral leadership, leading by example, and the many instances--\nacross the board--in which this President has failed to show such \nleadership.\n  My friend from Arkansas knows, Mr. President, that I take seriously \nand\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nsincerely what Teddy Roosevelt said. I have quoted Teddy Roosevelt a \nfew times on this floor. To paraphrase, he said Americans have a \nresponsibility to critique the President more than any other person in \nAmerica. To not do so is both base and servile.\n  My friend also knows that I have spoken out about the leadership of \nPresidents of my own party. President Reagan busted the budget with his \ndefense spending. I questioned his wisdom and leadership in cracking \ndown on welfare queens while letting welfare queens in the defense \nindustry squeeze through the cracks. I questioned President Bush when \nhe proposed raising taxes in 1990. He promised he would not, but he \ndid; and I criticized him.\n  Now I am criticizing this President, President Clinton, for failing \nto set a good example across the board. It is a pattern. It is \npervasive. It encourages more cynicism by our people.\n  If we want to set a good example for the young people of this country \nand for the next generation, if we want to stop the growing cynicism in \nthis country toward our elected leaders and our institutions, then we \nmust begin by setting higher standards of conduct for ourselves. We \nmust set a good example for our country.\n  When we do not, Mr. President, when we do not do that, it is \nprecisely because of a failure of moral leadership. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, we are in morning business and \nentitled to address the Senate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4007-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, in just a few moments \nwe are going to return to the immigration bill. We have orders for \nvotes on various amendments. Then, hopefully, we will have the \nlegislation that will be open for amendment. I intend at the earliest \npossible time to offer an amendment on increasing the minimum wage. I \nwould be more than glad to enter into a time limitation so that our \nside would have 30 minutes and the other side would have 30 minutes. It \nseems to me that the 13 million families that will be affected by the \nminimum wage are entitled to have at least 30 minutes of the U.S. \nSenate's time in order to make their case before the U.S. Senate, and \nit seems to me that they are entitled to a decision by the U.S. Senate \nas to whether we are going to provide some economic justice and decency \nfor those Americans who have been left out and left behind on the lower \nrung of the economic ladder--who are working hard, trying to provide \nfor their families, and still existing in poverty.\n  Mr. President, I think the urgency for offering that amendment is \njust emphasized once again by what the leader in the House of \nRepresentatives talked about just yesterday, that he, Mr. Armey, as the \nHouse majority leader, has indicated his continued opposition to the \nincrease in the minimum wage. What he is basically talking about is a \nbrand new entitlement program, the elimination of the earned income tax \ncredit, which is a lifeline to working families, particularly working \nfamilies with children. All of us understand that the earned income tax \ncredit, which Ronald Reagan himself said was the best poverty program, \nprovides help and assistance for working families with children. The \nminimum wage makes a difference for those families. For the individual \nor couple who does not have children, the increase in the minimum wage \nmakes the greatest difference to them.\n  But what Mr. Armey is talking about is the elimination of the earned \nincome tax credit. He says we will develop a program. Who will run it? \nThe IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. They are going to be the ones \nwho run a new entitlement program.\n  Now, Mr. President, he says this will save $15 billion. You know \nwhere that $15 billion is going to come from? It will come from those \nwho benefit from the earned income tax credit, who are the neediest \nworking families in this country.\n  The increase in the minimum wage will provide $3.7 billion a year to \nthese families. So, in effect, what he is saying is we will take the \nearned income tax credit away from those families, we will put in the \nInternal Revenue Code a subsidy program, and the subsidy program, which \nwill be paid for by Federal taxpayers, generally will be contributed to \nby other workers.\n  Mr. President, it is about time we had a clear vote and a clean vote \non the increase in the minimum wage. We have a bipartisan group here in \nthe U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, who have supported \nthe increase in the minimum wage. We are going to take the first \nopportunity that presents itself, after the disposition of these votes, \nto offer that with a time limit so the American people will be able to \nfind out who is on their side.\n  I would hope that we would be able to work that out as a matter of \ncomity, but we are going to continue to press that issue as we move \nthrough with this legislation and other legislation until we have an \nopportunity to speak for those 13 million families that are, today, \nbeing left out and left behind.\n  There is no excuse for the majority leader not to schedule this \nprogram. We would not need to offer this amendment if we were given a \nreasonable time to debate this on a clean bill and do it at any time of \nthe day or evening that the majority leader wants to do it.\n  Let us have at least an opportunity to speak to this issue. Mr. \nMajority Leader, do not deny us economic justice for working families.\n  Mr. LOTT. Noticing that the manager of the bill is not on the floor \nyet, I ask unanimous consent that the time for morning business be \nextended for 10 minutes so I may address some comments to the ones just \nmade and speak briefly about this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I will not object as long \nas my friend and colleague will somehow be recognized during \nconsideration of morning business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry. My understanding was that morning \nbusiness was already extended 10 minutes by the unanimous consent, \nagreed to by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley. If that is the \ncase, the Senator from Mississippi is asking the 10 minutes be added to \nthat time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator. First, Mr. President, \nis that correct, it had already been extended?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business closes at 10:10.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was supposed to be accorded 15 minutes \nfor my remarks. I have to make these remarks this morning. I appreciate \nif it could be extended. I was on the list. Could I follow the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Chair, does the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota desire time also?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time is he interested in?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nmorning business be extended until 10:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could it be in this order: the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, then the Senator from Utah, then the Senator from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. LOTT. I modify the unanimous consent to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for working \nwith us as we get that worked out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4008-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4008-S4009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are here today going to take up \nlegislation that I hope will pass before the end of this legislative \nweek. It is very important legislation. It is major immigration reform.\n\n  We have a problem in America with illegal immigration. We are not \ncontrolling our borders. We have illegal immigrants in this country \nthat are taking advantage of the taxpayers of this country. There needs \nto be some changes. There needs to be some relief in the way we handle \nimmigration in America, particularly as it applies to illegal \nimmigrants.\n  This legislation has already been delayed a week now while we argue \nover\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nwhether or not to allow extraneous matters, amendments that are not \nrelevant to this legislation. Whether or not they will be added, it is \na distraction. We can work out these matters. They can be offered on \nother occasions, on other bills. I plead with my colleagues for us to \nkeep our focus on the bill before us--illegal immigration reform. If \nyou want this problem to be dealt with, you have to give us the time to \ndeal with the amendments that are relevant, those that are pending. \nOthers, I am sure, will be welcomed.\n  We can work on this legislation today and hopefully finish it \ntomorrow. If we get sidetracked with issues that are not relevant, have \nnot been considered by the committee that is bringing this bill up, it \nwill delay it, maybe even cause it to be withdrawn or maybe not be \ncompleted. The American people want this action. We need to face up to \ndoing the right thing.\n  The Senator makes the point about the minimum wage. I know there are \ndiscussions going on now in a bipartisan way, and among the leadership \non all sides of the Capitol, both sides of the Capitol, to come up with \na way to consider how we address the problems of job security in \nAmerica.\n  I am worried about job security. I am worried about people that will \nlose their jobs and small businesses that could lose jobs in their \nbusiness or have to pay the costs of what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is proposing. We need to think about how we proceed on \nthis. I think we can come up with a degree to proceed.\n  In the meantime, we need to address this problem: How we can help \nState and local officials in dealing with illegal immigrants. The bill \nreported from the Committee on the Judiciary focuses on the problem of \nillegal immigration, entry into the territory without official approval \nas an immigrant, refugee, or alien. That illegal entry is a crime. We \nneed to start with that. It is a crime. ``Illegal'' means you are doing \nsomething that is wrong and is a crime.\n  It may have extenuating circumstances. It may make sense for those \nwho undertake it to come into this country. Obviously, they are \nattracted to the free enterprise system in America. They have economic \nand social concerns for their families. It is a crime and strikes at \nthe heart of one of the conditions of nationhood: the ability to \ncontrol the borders of our own country. That is what this bill is about \nand what our debate this week should be about.\n\n  I hope we will not be treated to accusations of xenophobia and racism \nfrom those who oppose a legitimate crackdown on illegal immigration. \nYou talk about job loss; there are problems where jobs are being \nimproperly taken by these illegal immigrants. What we are trying to do \nwith this legislation is reestablish order and control over the process \nof entering the United States. Orderly immigration has always been a \nnet good for our country. If we tried to catalog the major \ncontributions--scientific, economic, cultural, patriotic--of immigrants \nin the last few decades, it would take more time than we could spare \nhere. Just as industrial America grew strong from the human capital of \nEllis Island, so is our country's future being created anew by our new \ncitizens that come in from every corner of the world. That is fine.\n  The Republican platform in 1992, the one some of the news media \ndenounce as antiimmigrant, put it this way:\n\n       Our Nation of immigrants continues to welcome those seeking \n     a better life. This reflects our past, when some newcomers \n     fled intolerance; some sought prosperity, some came as \n     slaves. All suffered and sacrificed but hoped their children \n     would have a better life. All searched for a shared vision--\n     and found one in America. Today we are stronger for their \n     diversity.\n\n  Uncontrolled immigration, however, is a different matter. We simply \ncannot allow our borders to be overrun, our laws flouted, and our \nnational generosity abused. Every year, over one million persons are \nturned back while attempting illegal entry into this country. But many \nmore are not apprehended and get into the country. There are probably \nmore than 4 million illegal aliens now in this country. Their numbers \nare growing at about 300,000 to 400,000 people each year. That is \nunacceptable. The American people are paying a tremendous price because \nof it.\n  It was not so long ago that Congress legislated amnesty for persons \nthen illegally in the United States. Hundreds of thousands illegal \naliens and undocumented aliens, they were preferred to be called, took \nthe opportunity to regularize their presence here. Many of them have \nnow become citizens. More power to them. But to balance that \nunprecedented amnesty--and to make sure it need never be repeated--we \nneed to pass this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep their focus on this important \nlegislation. We should get it done. It is overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4008-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4009-S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JUDGES AND CRIME\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the \nextraordinary remarks President Clinton made during the recent \ncongressional recess on crime and judicial appointments. Let me note, \nagain, that there is simply no substitute, as a practical matter, for \nthe sound exercise of Presidential judgment in nominating persons to \nlifetime Federal judgeships.\n  I find President Clinton's remarks on April 2--which have been echoed \nby Vice President Gore and by White House aides--concerning the \nadministration's record on judges to be a remarkable effort to dodge \nthe consequences of his own judicial selections and to deflect the \nattention of the American people from these selections. I welcome the \nopportunity to set the record straight and to dispel the \nadministration's myths they are attempting to weave to protect their \njudges and themselves.\n\n\n                               myth no. 1\n\n  The President said, regarding criticism of his judicial selections, \nthat this side is ``sort of embarrassed'' by our crime record. Vice \nPresident Gore repeated this assertion before a group of newspaper \neditors, and Jack Quinn, the White House counsel, echoed it in \nyesterday's USA Today. This simply is not true, no matter how many \ntimes the President repeats himself. And this from a President AWOL--\nabsent without leadership--in the war on drugs. He mentioned the Brady \nbill, the so-called assault weapon ban pertaining to 19 firearms, the \n100,000 police he keeps talking about, and the 1994 crime bill. I will \nexamine each in turn.\n  It is the swift apprehension, trial, and certain punishment of \ncriminals that is our best crime prevention mechanism, not the gun \ncontrol measures the President mentions. Hard-nosed judges, tough \nprosecution policies, and adequate prison space will do more to control \ncrime than these measures. I might add that it is particularly ironic \nto hear the President's comment this month. This side of the aisle has \njust sent the President the product of over a decade of Republican \nefforts to curb endless, frivolous death row appeals. The bill also \nplaces prohibitions on terrorist fundraising; contains provisions on \nterrorist and criminal alien removal and exclusion; strengthens the \nlaws pertaining to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons; \nauthorizes $1 billion over 4 years for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, the INS, U.S. attorneys, the Customs Service, and other law \nenforcement agencies; and a number of other tough provisions.\n  Although I expect the President to sign the antiterrorism bill today, \nhe worked against its key restrictions on the abuse of the writ of \nhabeas corpus. He even sent his former White House Counsel, Abner \nMikva, to lobby on the Hill to dilute these provisions, which will \nprovide for the swifter execution of death row murderers.\n  Meanwhile, his Solicitor General, Drew Days, has failed to appeal \ndecisions, such as the case of United States versus Cheely, that may \nhamper efforts to impose the death penalty on terrorists such as the \nunabomber in California. During a November hearing chaired by myself \nand my good friend Senator Thompson, the Judiciary Committee learned \nthat the Clinton administration's Solicitor General generally has \nceased the efforts of the Reagan and Bush administration to vigorously \ndefend the death penalty and tough criminal laws.\n  Instead, the Clinton administration's Solicitor General has refused \nto appeal soft-on-crime decisions to the Supreme Court, and he even has \nargued before the Court to narrow Federal child pornography laws.\n  The President talks about 100,000 new police officers. His plan will \nnot add\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\n100,000 police officers to the rolls of our law enforcement agencies.\n  The 1994 crime bill? When it left the Senate, it was a reasonably \ntough bill, not perfect, but a solid contribution to the swift \napprehension of criminals and tough, certain punishment. By the time \nthe other body and the Clinton administration got through with it, it \nwas softened and loaded with billions and billions of dollars of \nwasteful pork--old-fashioned Great Society social spending boondoggles. \nThis is why some of us opposed the bill.\n  Meanwhile, the President abandoned the bully pulpit in the fight \nagainst drugs. In 1993, he slashed the drug czar's office. He proposed \nsignificant drug enforcement personnel cuts to the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, the FBI, the INS, the Customs Service, and the Coast Guard. \nPresident Clinton has cut America's ability to interdict drug shipments \nin the transit zone. Through the 1980's and early 1990's, the United \nStates experienced dramatic and unprecedented reductions in casual drug \nuse. But since 1992 drug use among young people has shot back up.\n\n\n                               Myth No. 2\n\n  According to the Clinton administration, there are decisions by \nReagan and Bush judges that favor criminals. That is no doubt the case. \nI do not agree with every decision made by a Republican-appointed \njudge, nor do I disagree with every decision made by a Democratic-\nappointed judge. But, on the whole, Republican appointed judges are \ngoing to be tougher on crime. And the American people will never see a \nRepublican President appoint a Rosemary Barkett or a Lee Sarokin or a \nMartha Daughtrey to the Federal appellate bench.\n\n  Presidents Reagan and Bush appointed 573 judges to the Federal \ncourts, and some of them have served for more than a decade. They have \nthousands of decisions they have written, and some of these no doubt \nwill find in favor of a criminal defendant, and sometimes, of course, \nit is the case that the police or prosecutors have stepped over the \nline.\n  President Clinton has appointed 185 judges so far to the Federal \nbench, and many of them have served for only 2 years. Furthermore, \nseveral of these judges consistently have issued decisions that are \nsoft on crime--not just because of their result, but because of their \nreasoning. That is why I take such care to describe the facts and \nreasoning of these decisions, because once the American people learn \nwhat these activist judges have written, it is clear that they display \na tolerant attitude toward crime and drugs.\n\n\n                               myth no. 3\n\n  The Clinton administration alleges that I and other Republicans have \nfocused on only the same dozen criminal cases. They find references to \nthese cases meaningless, because they do not accurately represent the \nlarge number of cases decided correctly.\n  This answer is a red herring at best. It ignores the obvious fact \nthat some decisions by some courts are more important than others. \nDecisions by the Supreme Court are far more important than hundreds of \ndecisions by district court judges, because it is the decision of the \nHigh Court that binds all others.\n  Perhaps the most important judges are those who sit upon the 13 \nFederal courts of appeals, because these courts effectively exercise \nthe final say on most of the cases brought in the Federal courts. \nPresident Clinton has appointed 30 judges of the 175 judges who sit on \nthe appellate courts. Most of these judges have been on the bench 2 \nyears of less. But in those 2 years, more than half of those Clinton \njudges--at least 17 of the 30--have issued or joined activist opinions \nthat have been sympathetic to criminal defendants at the expense of \nlegitimate law enforcement interests, or that have sought to substitute \ntheir policy preferences for those of the people as expressed in \nwritten law. Judges Sarokin, Baird, and Daughtrey are only the most \negregious examples, because their crystal clear track records reflected \ntheir activist bent.\n  But take, for example, Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel, who have \nvoted with the liberal wing of the D.C. Circuit--probably the second \nmost powerful court in the land--in every important en banc case. In \nparticular, both judges dissented in Action for Children's Television \nv. F.C.C. [58 F.3d 654 (CADC 1995) (en banc)], in which the majority--\nall Reagan and Bush appointees--held that the Government could restrict \nindecent broadcasts on television during certain hours. Judges Rogers \nand Tatel joined two Carter judges in arguing that the Government was \nsomehow violating the first amendment. This is activism of the worst \nsort, and, as the distinguished majority leader pointed out yesterday, \nat odds with the President's posturing on the V-chip legislation.\n  Or take, for example, the performance of Judge Martha Daughtrey of \nthe sixth circuit. As I recall it, Vice President Gore was a strong \nsupporter of then Tennessee State Supreme Court Justice Martha \nDaughtrey when she was nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. We had a rollcall vote in the Judiciary Committee on Judge \nDaughtrey, where I voted against her. I believed she was insufficiently \ntough on crime. Among the concerns I expressed, when she was a member \nof an intermediate State court, ``she voted frequently, often in \ndissent, to reduce prison sentences for convicted criminals or to \neliminate them entirely in favor of mere probation.''\n  My concerns about Judge Daughtrey have been realized in certain \nrespects. In United States v. Garnier [28 F.3d 1214 (CA6 1994)], police \nin Johnson City, TN, stopped a car for making a left turn without \nsignaling and for erratic driving. The police believed that the driver \nmight have been under the influence. The traffic infractions alone \nprovided grounds to stop the car.\n  A field sobriety test of the driver was negative. But, during the \nstop, police noticed that a passenger reached several times into a bag \non the floorboard of the car. Reasonably concerned for their safety, \npolice asked the passenger to exit the vehicle and asked to look in the \nbag. Passenger Rudolph Garnier consented, but nothing was found.\n  When police frisked Garnier for weapons, they found a cellular phone, \na pocket beeper, and two rolls of cash totaling about $2,100. Police \nthen asked if they could search the trunk. Both the driver and Garnier \nconsented. The police found a shopping bag belonging to Garnier that \ncontained a baggie with a large amount of crack cocaine.\n  Here, we had erratic driving early in the morning, motions toward a \nbag, large amounts of cash, a cellular phone, and beeper. Law \nenforcement officers well know that drug dealers often carry large \namounts of cash and use cellular phones and beepers to set up sales. I \nthink most people would find the search reasonable, especially since it \ncame after the voluntary consent of the driver and passenger.\n  Judge James Ryan of the sixth circuit, appointed by President Reagan, \nwould also agree. When this case came up for appeal, he voted to uphold \nthe legality of the police search. He wrote,\n\n       These items provided the officer with sufficient \n     articulable suspicion to extend the purpose and scope of the \n     stop. No competent police officer in America, in 1993, would \n     fail to suspect, reasonably, that these items suggested that \n     narcotics might well be present somewhere in the vehicle.\n\n  Unfortunately for law abiding citizens, Judge Ryan's opinion was a \ndissent. The majority opinion, written by Judge Daughtrey, and joined \nby Judge Damon Keith, a Carter appointee, threw the evidence out of the \ncase. They held that unless police had found a weapon on Garnier, \npolice had no right to ask to search the trunk.\n\n  Frankly, Judge Daughtrey created this rule out of thin air. The \nfourth amendment, which Judge Daughtrey did not even quote in her \nopinion, prohibits only ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' There \nis no per se rule that a weapon must be found before an officer can \neven ask to search further. He only asked for permission to search, it \nwas not a coercive search. And, in fact, the defendant gave permission.\n  Think about it. In Judge Daughtrey's world, police are not even \nallowed to ask for permission to search a vehicle unless certain \npredicates are found to have occurred. Unfortunately, the citizens of \nMichigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky are going to have to live with \nJudge Daughtrey long after President Clinton has left office.\n  I will mention one more case involving Judge Daughtrey. In United \nStates versus Long, customs inspectors discovered child pornography \nvideos mailed from overseas to defendant's address. Police obtained a \nwarrant to search the defendant's residence and found 19 magazines, \nbooks, and drugs.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nJudge Milburn, a Reagan appointee, and senior Judge Weis, a Nixon \nappointee, upheld the search. Judge Daughtrey dissented on the ground \nthat there was no probable cause to search for additional pornographic \nmaterial at the defendant's home. She flatly ignored a law enforcement \nofficer's unrebutted affidavit, who said that based on his experience \nand from experts in the field that it was likely that more examples of \nchild pornography would be found.\n  These judges are typical of more than half of the Clinton appellate \njudges. These judges sit on high above the district court judges who \nmake the hundreds and thousands of usually uncontroversial, run-of-the-\nmill rulings that come up in a trial. These appellate judges make \nrulings on issues of law that will extend from the case before them to \nbind the other judges in that circuit on every similar case. The White \nHouse has cited decisions by Reagan-Bush judges as being soft on crime, \nbut these decisions are almost exclusively at the trial level and seem \nto be an aberration for the particular judge. By contrast, I have \nfocused attention previously on the important appellate decisions, and \nI have focused on particular judges rather than particular aberrational \ncases. It is clear that President Clinton has put on the bench \nparticular individual judges who are continually activist.\n  To be sure, there are 13 Clinton appellate judges who have yet to \nissue activist decisions. But many of them have been on the bench for \nonly a few months, and have yet to issue any significant opinions. And, \nquite honestly, I have not yet researched all of the decisions of all \nof these judges. who knows what I will find when I have more time to \nread these other decisions.\n\n\n                               myth no. 4\n\n  The Clinton administration maintains that it has appointed only \nmoderate, highly qualified judges because its nominees have received \nbetter ratings from the American Bar Association than those received by \njudges appointed by Republican Presidents. This is truly unconvincing, \nbecause the ABA itself is no longer just an impartial trade \nassociation; over time it has been transformed into an ideological \nadvocacy group.\n  The ABA has taken positions on some of the most divisive issues of \nour day, such as abortion, and it has vigorously lobbied on Capitol \nHill against many of the sensible legislation and reforms that we, in \nthe 104th Congress, have pursued. It has lobbied against the flag \ndesecration amendment, against mandatory minimum sentences, against \nchanges in the exclusionary rule, and against habeas corpus reform. It \nhas lobbied for proracial preference and quota legislation and against \nthe 104th Congress' efforts to end them. I question whether an \nideological organization such as the ABA can be trusted to play an \nimpartial role in any governmental process, such as judicial selection. \nIt is my hope that the ABA can play an impartial role. Only the future \nand the ABA's willingness to depoliticize itself, will tell.\n\n\n                               myth no. 5\n\n  The Clinton administration believes that it is hypocritical for \nRepublicans in the Senate to criticize the Clinton judiciary, because \nwe only voted against confirming a handful of the nominees. To be sure, \nsometimes we cannot predict how a nominee will act. In those cases \nwhere we can, in good faith, predict how a nominee will act, we have \nopposed the nomination, as in the cases of Judges Barkett, Sarokin, and \nDaughtrey.\n  But my main response is to remind the President of first \nconstitutional principles. The Senate's job is only to advise and \nconsent to those individuals nominated by the President. When \nPresidents Reagan and Bush lived with a Democratic Senate, we, \nRepublicans, argued that the Senate owed some discretion to the \nPresident.\n  We have remained consistent in that position even under a Democratic \nPresident. As Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist No. 66:\n\n       It will be the office of the president to nominate, and \n     with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint. There \n     will of course be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     senate. They may defeat one choice of the executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice of the \n     president.\n\n  The words of our Founding Fathers clearly explain why this election \nis so important. As a practical and as a constitutional matter, the \nSenate gives every President some deference in confirming judicial \ncandidates nominated by the President. It is the President's power to \nchoose Federal judges, and his alone. A Republican President would not \nnominate the same judges that a Democrat would, and vice versa. Thus, \nthe American people should keep in mind that when they elect a \nPresident, they elect his judges too--and not just for 4 years, but for \nlife. There simply is no substitute for the power to nominate Federal \njudges.\n  Finally, I would like to say this: We are not going to treat the \nClinton judges the way our judges were treated in the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations. We have treated them fairly. Yes, I would not have \nappointed very many of those judges. Neither would any other \nRepublican. Neither will Senator Dole when he becomes President. But \nthe fact of the matter is President Clinton was elected. He is our \nPresident. He has a right to choose these judges, and we have an \nobligation to support those judges unless we can show some very valid \nconstitutional reason or other reason why we should not.\n  As a general rule, we follow that rule and we do it even though we \nmay not agree with these particular selections. But that does not \nnegate the fact that in retrospect as you look over the record these \njudges are more liberal. They are deciding cases in a more liberal \nfashion. They are deciding cases in an activist fashion. They are \ndeciding cases that are soft on crime. And I have to say this is one of \nthe big issues of our time. Are we going to continue to put up with \nthis? Are we going to start realizing that these are important issues? \nAnd that is not to say that there are not Republican judges who make \nmistakes too. But these are more mistakes. These involve philosophy of \njudging that literally should not be a philosophy of judging. Judges \nare not elected to these positions. Judges are appointed for life and \nconfirmed for life. They should be interpreting the laws made by those \nelected to make them, and they should not be making laws as legislators \nfrom the bench. Unfortunately, that is what we are getting today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 8 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4009-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4011-S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Wyoming, if he has \na moment, would have an opportunity to hear what I have to say. The \nbusiness of the Senate as I understand from the majority leader's \nannouncement is to come back to the bill on illegal immigration which \nis to be managed by the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson.\n  Let me just in a couple of minutes of morning business say that I \nwill likely vote for the illegal immigration bill. There are a couple \nof issues in it that I think will be the subject of some controversy. \nBut I think the piece of legislation that has been constructed is \nworthy, and it is a reasonably good piece of legislation. It addresses \na subject that needs addressing, and that should be addressed. I have \nno problem with this bill at all.\n  I believe we find ourselves in the following circumstances. Consent \nwas given when the piece of legislation was introduced. Following the \nintroduction of the Dorgan amendment, consent was given to the Simpson \namendments. I think they were offered, and those amendments are \npending. There is an underlying amendment that I offered that has been \nsecond-degreed by Senator Kempthorne from Idaho. That is apparently \nwhere we find ourselves.\n  I wanted to explain again briefly what compelled me to offer an \namendment on this piece of legislation. And, if we can reach an \nunderstanding with the majority leader, I have no intention to keep the \namendment on this legislation. But here are the circumstances.\n  The majority leader has the right to bring a reconsideration vote on \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget at any time without \ndebate\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nand without amendment. He understands that. We understand that. He has \nindicated to me now that he does not intend to do that in the coming \ndays. It will probably be in a couple of weeks. But he had previously \nannounced that he would, at some point in April, perhaps mid-April, the \nend of April, force a reconsideration vote on the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n\n  The result was because we were going to have no opportunity to debate \nor to offer an amendment, and because some of us feel very strongly we \nwill vote for a constitutional amendment provided it takes the Social \nSecurity trust funds and sets them outside of the other Government \nrevenues and protects those trust funds. If it does that, we would vote \nfor an amendment. We had done that before. There are a number of us on \nthis side who have done that before. We offered it as an amendment. We \nvoted for it. But we will have no opportunity to do a similar thing at \nthis time, and my point was we would like the Senate to express itself \non that issue.\n  The only way I could conceive of doing that was to offer a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution was to say \nthat when a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is brought \nback to the floor of the Senate, it ought to include a provision that \nremoves the Social Security trust funds from the other operating \nrevenues of the Federal Government. We, incidentally, did that \npreviously in an amendment that I believe got 40 votes. If it does, I \nwould vote for it and I think there are probably a half dozen or dozen \nother Members who would similarly vote for it and we would have 70 or \n75 votes for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Because of circumstances and because of the parliamentary situation, \nI offered that as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It was then second-\ndegreed. The Senator from Wyoming became fairly upset about that, and I \nunderstand why. He is managing a bill dealing with immigration. He \nsaid, ``What does this have to do with immigration?''\n  Plenty of people have offered amendments that are not germane in the \nSenate. We do not have a germaneness rule. They have offered them \nbecause they felt the circumstances required them to offer them.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts indicated that he intends to offer an \namendment on the minimum wage, increasing the minimum wage on this \npiece of legislation. My expectation would be, if there were an \nagreement reached by which the Senate would be able to agree to a vote \non the minimum wage at some point, that amendment would go away as \nwell. I do not intend to press my amendment if I can reach an agreement \nwith the majority leader to give us an opportunity to offer, either a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget that protects the Social \nSecurity trust funds, or some other device that allows us to register \non that issue before we are forced to vote on reconsideration.\n\n  I want to make just another point on the Social Security issue \nbecause I think it is so important. We are not talking about just \npolitics, as some would suggest. Some say there is no money in the \nSocial Security trust fund. That is going to be a big surprise to some \nkid who tries to ask his father what he has in his savings account, and \nhis father says you have Government savings bonds, but there is really \nno money there. That is what is in the Social Security trust fund, \nsavings bonds, Government securities. Of course there is money there.\n  The problem is continuing to do as we have done for recent years, and \nthat is, instead of save the surplus that we every year now accumulate \nin the Social Security system, $71 billion this year, if we instead use \nit as an offset against other Government revenues we guarantee there \nwill be no money available in the Social Security trust funds when the \nbaby boomers retire. It is about a $700 billion issue in 10 years, and \nwe ought to address it. It is not unimportant. It is not politics. It \nmight be a nuisance for some for us to require that it be addressed at \nsome point or another, but those of us who want it addressed are not \ngoing to go away.\n  I guess I would say at this point that the two issues that have been \nraised--the one I have raised by the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I \nthink can be resolved if the majority leader, who was, from our last \nconversation yesterday, going to be visiting with the Parliamentarian \nto see if we could find a way to provide a method for a vote on the \napproach I have suggested and we have previously offered on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. If that happens, I do \nnot intend to be continuing to press the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat I had previously offered.\n  I wanted to speak in morning business only to describe what the \ncircumstances are on this piece of legislation. I am not here to make \nlife more difficult for the Senator from Wyoming. I have great respect \nfor him. I think the legislation he has brought to the floor has a \ngreat deal to commend it.\n  Even if we do not resolve this issue on the Social Security trust \nfunds, I would not intend to ask for more than 10, 15, 20 minutes \ndebate. I am not interested in holding up the bill. Under any \nconditions, I am not interested in holding up this bill.\n  I would agree to the shortest possible debate time, if we are not \nable to resolve the issue in another way. But my hope would be in the \nnext hour or so we might be able to resolve that issue in another way. \nWe would still, then, be asking, it seems to me, based on the \ndiscussions of Senator Kennedy, for some kind of commitment to allow \nthe Senate to proceed to deal with the issue of the minimum wage.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4011-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are near \nneighbors in that part of the world. I can understand the depth of his \nvery honest conviction about Social Security and the balanced budget. \nIt is not an opinion I share, because I feel that the Social Security \nSystem is going to go broke, whether you have it on budget, off budget, \nhanging from space or coming out of the Earth. It is going to go broke \nin the year 2029. It is going to start its huge swan song in 2012, and \nthe reason we know that is because the trustees of the system are \ntelling us that.

Mr. President, I appreciate the good will of my friend \nfrom Massachusetts. I think after an explanation of what the procedure \nwas, even though I know that that is a difficult one, that \nnevertheless, it is appropriate under the rules. I had expressed to the \nSenator from Massachusetts and to the Senator from North Dakota that it \nwould be my intent to proceed and move forward with regard to this \nissue. These other issues, I hope, can be addressed at some other \nforum.\n  The pending business of the U.S. Senate for the last week has been \nthe illegal immigration bill, not the balanced budget amendment, not \nSocial Security, not the minimum wage, not anything. It has been set \naside, and we have handled some very significant legislation in the \ninterim.\n  I want to commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum for the work \nthat they did, which was quite evident, the worth of it and the success \nof it, by a vote of 100 to 0, on an issue that has been creating \ntremendous difficulty with all of us. We have started down the road of \nreform with regard to health care, incremental as it is, but certainly \nsomething that the Senator from Massachusetts has been involved in in \nhis entire career in the U.S. Senate.\n  Sometimes he is a vexing adversary, sometimes he is a warm and \nhelpful ally; but there is one thing the Senator from Massachusetts is, \nhe is a master legislator. We do not have to agree, but if there is \nanyone who knows more about legislating in this place, I mean day-to-\nday legislating, the rules, the procedures of legislating, not simply \nprocedure--that helps--then it certainly is the Senator from \nMassachusetts who is one of the most able in this arena. With that--and \nI do not want to get too heavy; that would be totally uncharacteristic \nand unnecessary, Mr. President--I am pleased that we are once again \nconsidering the very important issue of immigration reform. This is \nabout immigration reform.\n\n  As the majority leader mentioned last week, wherever one visits in \nthis country, the issue is: When is Congress going to do something \nabout immigration? That always comes up. The people of this country \nwant reform. They want those who are not supposed to be in this country \nto be removed from this country. They do not want those who are subject \nto deportation to be allowed to roam the United States at will while \nawaiting their removal, also, working and taking away the jobs of \nAmerican citizens. They want a reduction in overall immigration \nnumbers. That is what they tell us on a consistent basis.\n  We now have an opportunity to accomplish all of that. We have a very \ngood bill before us, and we have many amendments proposed, some of \nwhich will improve the legislation. There will be amendments. Those \nhave been submitted. Those should be known to Members and staff by this \ntime. We will proceed with those. I trust my colleagues will bring \nthese amendments to the floor so we may conclude this contentious but \nimportant and consistent and ever-present debate and pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform during this week.\n  The Barbara Jordan Commission left a statement which I think is \nworthy of all of us to be reminded of on this date. It was to this \neffect: The credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a \nsimple yardstick. These are the words of Barbara Jordan, former \nCongresswoman, remarkable, remarkable American, a woman I greatly \nadmired and respected and was honored to participate at the memorial \nservice on her behalf at the Kennedy Center. That was a very, very \nemotional and touching thing for me. She said the simple yardstick is \nthis: People who should\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nget in, do get in; people who should not get in are kept out; and \npeople who are judged deportable are required to leave. You cannot \nstate it any more clearly than that.\n  The pending business is a Simpson second-degree amendment on a motion \nto recommit. This is the Simpson amendment No. 2, the pilot program. I \nbelieve that is now the pending business. I believe the debate on that \namendment has been had. It was at the desk. Let me just refresh your \nmemory on that. That was the amendment to provide a pilot student-\ntracking program. The aim was to enable the INS to keep track of \nforeign students studying in this country. The amendment would provide \na source of funding to the INS to establish a very basic, computer-\nbased system for keeping track of foreign students. It is a measure \nsupported by the FBI Director, who expressed deep concerns about our \nability to track such students in a 1994 memo regarding possible entry \nvenues for tourists.\n\n  This is not an intrusive provision. Colleges and universities already \nare required to provide this sort of information to the INS. The \nproblem in the past has been that the INS has not devoted sufficient \nresources to this activity to create a body of reliable information. So \nthe amendment's aim is to provide funding so the INS can implement a \nsystem to keep track of foreign students studying here. It seems \nreasonable that such funding should come from the students themselves \nand not from the taxpayer. A student who is willing to pay $10,000 or \n$20,000 in this country or $80,000 to $100,000 over the course of \nstudy, is unlikely to be greatly concerned at being asked to pay an \nadditional fee of $50 or $100 for the issuance of a student visa.\n  That is the substance of the amendment. I inquire if there is further \ndebate on the amendment, or move the question on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, effectively, in terms of the substance of \nthe legislation that we have before the Senate, I support these three \namendments, for the reasons we outlined the other evening when we \ncommenced the debate on these items. One allows us to be able to track \nforeign students to find out what happens to those students. We are \nunable to do so now. There is a serious question about whether the \nforeign student visas are being used for real education or as another \nway to circumvent the laws. That is reasonable.\n  The second amendment deals with the situation where a young person \ngets a students visa to be able to come in and attend a private \nuniversity and is able to demonstrate he or she has the resources to be \nable to do it and then makes a decision, after he or she is here, to go \nto a public university. It is a drain on the taxpayer funds. We want to \naddress that situation. It is not unimportant. We are supportive of \nthat particular legislation.\n  A final amendment deals with an individual who, either for employment \nor to get some kind of support funding, makes a false claim that they \nare a citizen when they are not. The amendment makes them subject to \ndeportation. I think that makes a good deal of sense. If an individual \nis trying to either displace an American in a job and misrepresents his \nor her status by lying to the employer and stating that he or she is a \ncitizen, or stating to other local or State or Federal officials that \nhe or she is a citizen, when they are not, in order to benefit from \nsome other kind of emergency services, that individual, I believe, \nought to be subject to deportation.\n  On the substance of these amendments, I support all of them. The \nsecond-degree amendments are only a means for effectively denying the \nopportunity to amend the underlying amendments. As I understand, the \nsubstance of those is to change the date of enactment of those \nparticular provisions by a day, meeting the requirements of the Senate \nrules in not changing the substance of it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I understand that because of the changes in \nthe parliamentary situation, now we will address those three at \nwhatever time it is fine to move ahead on those amendments as far as \nthis Senator is concerned. There may be other considerations which \nwould dictate a time designated by the majority-minority leaders for \nthe consideration of those measures.\n  Instead, moving back, then, to what would have been the Dorgan \namendment and have that the pending business through the changes in the \nparliamentary situation which were just agreed to. The Dorgan \namendment, for all intents and purposes, would not be the pending \nbusiness. There would be then an opportunity after these amendments are \naddressed to amend the underlying legislation at that time. The pending \nbusiness would no longer be the Dorgan amendment.\n  For those who are interested, both Senator Dorgan and myself will, at \nleast hopefully, have some opportunity to address for a brief time, but \nhopefully within an agreement of a short timeframe, either the minimum \nwage or Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n  I was glad to try to place the minimum wage as a second degree to \nunderlying amendments previously. We did not have the opportunity to do \nso. Perhaps there will be an effort to completely foreclose the \nopportunity to address it, but it is certainly my intention not to \ndelay this legislation but for a short timeframe to address the minimum \nwage. This legislation will be before the Senate for a time, and we \nwill try to at least see if there is some opportunity to do so. I know \nthat is not the desire of the floor manager to move ahead. In any \nevent, that would be my intention.\n  I yield to the majority leader without losing the right of \nrecognition after he has concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We will proceed now, but I would make a remark because I \ncertainly can understand the position of Senator Kennedy and the issue \nthat is driving him in this debate, but not necessarily on this bill, \nand also Senator Dorgan. As I heard Senator Kennedy describing what is \nout there, eventually, it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe in ``The Pit \nand the Pendulum,'' as the arc of the blade swung closer and closer to \nthe object. I just wanted to state that. It was a great iteration that \ncame over me--the blade swinging back and forth, and eventually it will \nhit, and we will have to do what we always do here, which is sometimes \ndifficult. It is called vote. And that is a time to come.\n  So with that, I urge the adoption of amendment No. 3726.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we were just trying to follow the \nnumbers. We had a series of amendments. Could the Senator just restate \nthat amendment number.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is the pilot program, originally Simpson No. 2.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3726) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3727 to Amendment No. 3725\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, this amendment, which was the original \nSimpson amendment No. 3, creates a new ground of exclusion and of \ndeportation for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would add a new section to the bill. \nThis is repetitive of remarks when we began the legislation, but this \nsection would create a new ground of exclusion and of deportation for \nfalsely representing oneself as a U.S. citizen.\n  This amendment is a complement to another one I am proposing. The \nother amendment would modify the bill section providing for pilot \nprojects on systems to verify work authorization and eligibility to \napply for public assistance.\n  One of the requirements of that other amendment is that the Attorney \nGeneral conduct certain specific pilot projects including one in which \nemployers would be required to verify the immigration status of aliens \nbut not persons claiming to be citizens. Such persons would be required \nonly to attest to being citizens. That came up in debate in the markup \nin the Judiciary Committee, that Americans, U.S. citizens, should not \nhave to do some of the things that we require of others, and so there \nwould be an attest provision.\n  Obviously, the major weakness in any such system as that is the \npotential for false claims of citizenship. That is why I am offering \nthe present amendment, which would create a major new disincentive for \nfalsely claiming U.S. citizenship. Lawful, permanent resident aliens \nwho falsely claim citizenship risk deportation and being permanently \nbarred from entering the United States of America. Since they are \nauthorized to work, they would have little reason to make a false claim \nof citizenship.\n  Illegal aliens, on the other hand, would know that they could not be \nverified if they admitted to being aliens and the verification process \nwas conducted; yet they would also know that if they falsely claimed to \nbe citizens and were caught, they could be deported and permanently \nbarred. Thus, the risk involved in making false claims would be high \nfor them, too, under such a pilot project if the present amendment were \nenacted into law.\n  Therefore, if this amendment were enacted, and the pilot project \ninvolving citizenship attestation were conducted, a significant number \neven of illegal aliens might well be deterred from seeking jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator has made a very clear \nstatement on the substance of the legislation. It is, I think, an \nimportant addition to the effort that we are undertaking to try and \ncontrol illegal immigration, and I think it is very worthwhile. I hope \nthe Senate will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment No. \n3727?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, this is the amendment to criminalize \nvoting by aliens in Federal elections and make unlawful voting a ground \nfor exclusion and deportation. That is what this amendment is. This is \nthe original Simpson No. 4.\n  This amendment has three parts. It has been changed from the \ndiscussion that we had in the markup of this particular amendment. \nFirst, the amendment would create a criminal penalty for voting by \naliens in any Federal election.\n  Please note that this new criminal offense would cover only Federal \nelections, unlike the provision that was in the original version of the \nbill and that was deleted at the committee markup, because you will \nrecall there was debate and discussion as to what that would do in a \nschool board election or county commissioner election, and certainly \nthose States should have the options to control that. That is the \nsubstance of this amendment.\n  This new offense would be a misdemeanor. It is not a felony. It would \nbe a misdemeanor.\n  An alien who voted in any election, who voted solely or in part \nelecting a candidate for President, Vice President, Presidential \nelector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives, \nDelegate from the District of Columbia or resident commissioner, would \nbe punishable by up to 6 months in prison and a $1,000 fine--not a \nfelony.\n  The second part of the amendment would create a ground of exclusion \nfor aliens who have unlawfully voted in any election, Federal, State, \nor local, in violation of a Federal, State or local constitutional \nprovision, statute, ordinance, or regulation.\n  And, third, the amendment would create a ground of deportation for \nsuch unlawful voting by an alien.\n  This amendment would help to guarantee that a majority of citizens of \nthe United States, those who owe their full political allegiance to \nthis country, retain political control of every political unit and \nevery political issue.\n  If aliens are allowed to vote, it becomes quite possible that a \nrelatively small group of citizens in a particular jurisdiction could \noutvote a citizen\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nmajority, if the group had enough noncitizen allies. I do not feel that \nthat is acceptable. That is not consistent with the form of government \nthat the Founding Fathers believed to be a fundamental right of the \nAmerican people.\n  I have not covered State or local elections in the criminal offense \nprovision, in the provision I just described, because  of  the  \nobjections  of  some Members who believe, and sincerely believe--as I \nbelieve my friend from Illinois indeed believes--that a temporary \nmajority of citizens in a local jurisdiction or a State should be able \nto authorize voting by aliens. They believe this, despite the fact that \nif aliens are once given the right to vote in a jurisdiction, it might \nbe difficult or nigh impossible for a majority of citizens in that \njurisdiction to reverse the decision later.\n  However, my amendment also creates new grounds of exclusion and \ndeportation for voting, if it is unlawful. It applies to any election. \nTherefore, there would be an additional disincentive for aliens to vote \nif there is a law prohibiting them from doing so.\n  During the markup and subsequently, some have raised the issue of \nconstitutionality of this prohibition. At this time, just may I say a \nfew words about that issue of constitutionality. A doubt has been \nexpressed about whether Congress has the authority to prohibit voting \nby aliens. I believe that view is unfounded. There are \nseveral constitutional grounds for this authority, including the \nplenary power of Congress over immigration matters, which has been \nreferred to so many times over the years by the U.S. Supreme Court and \nalso the clause that guarantees what is called a republican form of \ngovernment. That standard to be applied is a ``rational relationship to \na legitimate Federal Government purpose.''\n\n  So, obviously, enforcing the immigration laws of the United States \nand, in particular, the naturalization laws--the requirements and \nprocedures an alien must follow to become a naturalized U.S. citizen is \na legitimate Federal Government purpose. Indeed, immigration and \nnaturalization is, along with national defense, the most fundamental of \nthe Federal Government's responsibilities. That is undoubtedly why the \nSupreme Court has made such extraordinary statements over the years, \nabout just how plenary--``plenary'' meaning complete and absolutely--\nhow plenary that power is.\n  Just one example, quote from the case of Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. \nversus Stranahan, and then quoted later with approval in Fiallo versus \nBell and Kleindienst versus Mandel:\n\n       Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of \n     Congress more complete than it is over the admission of \n     aliens.\n\n  The encouragement of naturalization has been explicitly recognized by \nthe Supreme Court as a legitimate purpose of Federal actions favoring \ncitizens. That was the case of Hampton versus Mow Sun Wong.\n  So the prohibition of voting by aliens in Federal elections only \nwould clearly be rationally related to a purpose encouraging \nnaturalization, which is, as I say, one of the premium subjects in the \nlegislative power of Congress. So that is the extent of the amendment \nand my explanation of the amendment.\n  Further debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we support this legislation. I want to \nmake sure this does not displace what we have already agreed to in the \nmotor-voter legislation, which also deals with fraudulent elections, \nand where the penalty is somewhat larger. As I understand, this would \napply in the Federal, as compared to the participation in local or \nState, elections. At least I am informed by the Justice Department that \nthey, too, would feel illegal voting in a Federal election could be \nprosecuted under the Federal law. I am glad to accept this measure, or \nurge the measure be accepted. We can work this thing through to clarify \nit, perhaps, on our way to the conference.\n  We want to do what the Senator has rightfully pointed out is \nnecessary to be done, in ways that are not going to minimize other \nprovisions which might deal with this, also in a substantive way, that \nmay be even more effective. I will be glad to recommend we accept this \nnow. We can work through this and get a clearer definition as to how \nthis interacts with motor voter. I completely agree with the Senator in \nterms of the objectives.\n  I just inquire of the Senator what his feeling would be on this.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the concern my friend from Massachusetts \nexpresses, and what he has pointed out as something disturbing to him, \ncertainly is not the intent of this author, especially with regard to \nmotor voter. There may be some things that would have to be done here, \nbecause I believe in motor voter we had a criminal penalty when we \npassed that legislation. So I will just leave it in good faith, as we \nhave done for 17 years, with the Senator from Massachusetts to work \nthat out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. And be certain the things that cause him concern are not \nanything that I am intending to do in this amendment. We can work that \nout.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Mr. President, I think we might as well move ahead. \nI think we are absolutely--and the Senate would be--in accord with the \ndescription by the Senator. I urge we accept it. We will review those \nmeasures together to make sure we are consistent with what both the \nSenator wants to do and any other potential inconsistencies in current \nlaw.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate that. My amendment is not \nintended to supersede the present prohibition on unlawful voting. I \nmake that assurance once again. I therefore urge the adoption of the \namendment under those conditions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \nagreeing to amendment numbered 3728.\n  The amendment (No. 3728) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3729 to Amendment No. 3725\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes amendment \n     numbered 3729 to amendment No. 3725.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is in essence Simpson No. 1 which we \ndiscussed the other day when we began our debate on this issue. There \nis a minor change, of course, to accomplish one thing so that we can \naddress it here since it is the original underlying anchor on the \nprocedural aspects of where we are at this moment.\n  So the purpose of the amendment--again, it is a bit repetitive from \nour discussion when we proceeded with this legislation originally--this \nis an issue brought to us by Senator Feinstein. I want to say at this \nmoment that I have received a tremendous amount of support and \nassistance from Senator Feinstein. She, of course, represents a State \nthat is most powerfully affected by everything that is happening today \nand everything that is happening tomorrow with regard to illegal \nimmigration and legal immigration. So I say that I am deeply \nappreciative of her and her staff who have worked with my staff on many \nissues.\n  These children who are involved here are described as parachute kids. \nAnd that is a concern. This amendment is intended to prevent foreign \nstudents coming to the United States to obtain a free taxpayer-financed \neducation at a public elementary, secondary school. This is a growing \nproblem of children who come to the United States, stay with friends or \nrelatives, or even strangers, to whom they pay a fee, and attending \npublic schools then as residents of the school district.\n  This amendment prohibits consular officers from issuing visas for \nattendance at such public schools or the INS from approving such cases \nunless the foreign student can demonstrate that he or she would \nreimburse the public elementary or secondary school for the full \nunsubsidized per capita cost of providing such education or unless the \nschool waives reimbursement.\n  The amendment also provides for the exclusion and deportation of \nstudents who are admitted to attend private elementary or secondary \nschools but who do not remain enrolled then at the private school for \nthe duration of their elementary or secondary study in the United \nStates. The purpose here is designed to prevent students from obtaining \nadmission to a private school, which they often do, and then switching \nto a taxpayer-funded public school soon after arrival in the United \nStates.\n  The amendment would not prevent these children who are validly in the \nUnited States as dependents of persons lawfully residing here from \napplying for admission to public schools nor would it prevent public \nschools hosting foreign exchange students. We do not want to intrude on \nthat wonderful program, those who would continue to be admitted as \nexchange visitors on J visas.\n  The amendment is, however, designed to deal specifically with the \nproblem of the parachute kids which has received some attention and \ncertainly in California and in other locations, those who come here to \nreceive a U.S. education at taxpayer expense.\n  That is the conclusion of my remarks with regard to the amendment. I \nlook forward to further debate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this has been a phenomenon that has \ndeveloped in very recent years. It is now becoming more frequently \nutilized to the disadvantage of taxpayers in these local communities. \nThe Senator has made an excellent presentation. It is increasingly a \nproblem. We ought to address it. This particular proposal does address \nit. I hope, for the reasons that have been outlined earlier, that the \namendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3729 to amendment No. 3725.\n  The amendment (No. 3729) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3730 to Amendment No. 3725\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the ban on the search of open-fields by employees \nof the INS when they have probable cause to believe an illegal act has \n                               occurred)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes amendment \n     numbered 3730 to amendment No. 3725.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the last word in the amendment and insert: \n     ``enactment\n\n     ``SEC.   . OPEN-FIELD SEARCHES.\n\n       ``(a) Repeal.--Section 116 of Public Law 99-603 and section \n     287(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1357(e)) are repealed.\n       ``(b) Redesignation of Provision.--Subsection (f) of \n     section 287 of that Act is redesignated as subsection (e) of \n     that section.''\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this is not one that will pass by voice \nvote. We will require a rollcall vote on this issue. It is and always \nhas been contentious. This is the original Simpson amendment No. 8 \nwhich is to repeal the current ban on open field searches. Therefore, \nany staff watching these proceedings at this moment will have \nimmediately pressed a button, and the ejection device will propel their \nprincipal here to the floor to proceed with vigorous, vigorous debate \non this issue. But this one, like all, up or down, and then move on.\n  But here is where we are, ladies and gentlemen. Do not miss the \nimpact of this. This happened back in the days of putting together the \noriginal legislation and what you want to recall is that no other U.S. \nlaw enforcement agency--none--except the Immigration and Naturalization \nService requires a warrant, a search warrant, to enter and/or search \nopen agricultural farmland. No other agency of enforcement in the \nUnited States is required to do that. That requirement that the INS \nagents obtain a warrant for such a search was placed in the law in 1986 \nby what I refer to as an unholy alliance between the agricultural \ngrowers and the ACLU. You really will not find the ACLU and the \nagricultural growers in the same sack very often.\n  All other law enforcement agents--that is a DEA agent, a local police \nofficer, even a local sheriff--can, without a warrant, and if they have \nprobable cause, search an open field for drugs or for a dead body. INS \nofficers alone are prohibited by law from entering a field to enforce \nimmigration laws. Of course, the effect of this requirement is to make \nit extremely difficult to enforce our laws against the employment of \nillegal agricultural workers. There are tremendous abuses in that \nfield.\n  A further effect is to make it safer--that is the word--for employers \nto use illegal workers, at a time when the experts tell us that there \nare more than 1 million American agricultural workers that could \nperform that work. The present ban on open field searches, in other \nwords, then protects those who hire illegal workers. That helps to deny \nthose jobs to American workers. As a result, up to 40 percent of the \nagricultural workers on the west coast are illegal aliens.\n  One of our Nation's most noted immigration experts, Prof. Barry Fuchs \nof Brandeis University, and the executive director, Rev. Ted Hesburgh, \nSelect Committee on Immigration Policy and a member of the current \nCommission on Immigration Reform, has specifically recommended to us \nthat a\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nhigh priority be placed on repealing the ban on open field searches. \nProfessor Fuchs has noted that the ban has taken away an ``important \nenforcement tool of the INS.''\n  I hope we might listen to the words of our friend, Larry Fuchs. He is \nour friend. Senator Kennedy has known him longer than I. Larry Fuchs is \na remarkable resource for this country on legal and illegal immigration \nreform.\n  As I have indicated in the past, Senator Kennedy and I were both \noriginal Members of the U.S. Senate on the Select Commission on \nImmigration Refugee Policy, chaired so ably by Father Ted Hesburgh, who \nwas an inspiration to us and who is, to this day, one of the most \nremarkable people in this land and a loving friend.\n  We should heed the words of Professor Fuchs. Proponents of the \nrequirement--and you will hear that argument coming forth momentarily--\nproponents of the requirement for warrants argue that it prevents INS \nofficers from entering an open field simply because those who are \nworking there ``look Hispanic.'' That argument ignores the fact that \nseeing workers who look Hispanic is not probable cause. That is not \nprobable cause for a search. You cannot use that argument in that sense \nin any way. Entering a field for that purpose, that particular purpose, \nwould be illegal, even if search warrants were not required. I think \nthat is a very important distinction. I hope we will hold closely as we \ndebate this issue.\n  The American public wants us to enforce our laws against illegal \nimmigration. The case is even stronger when, by doing so, we would be \nmaking jobs available to hundreds of thousands of U.S. agricultural \nworkers, and there are hundreds of thousands of U.S. agricultural \nworkers.\n  Even though this is not quite ancillary to the debate, I was \nfascinated in my work in this field many years ago to find out what \nhappens when they go to the open field. Some agriculture employers back \nthen--not now, I do not know what the situation may be now--but they \nwere often putting some expendable people next to the highway with el \nemigres and the green truck came by so that there would be someone to \npick up, and then when all of that took place there was another rank in \nthe foothills who would come down and be ready to go right back to work \nagain.\n  Further, way up in the foothills where we were told there were never \nchildren, never spouses, personal investigation of the select committee \nfound obvious, obvious hovels of people who were just simply slave \nlabor for some agricultural pursuits--pampers, diapers, cans of milk \nall there in the foothills.\n  That was, as I say, not truly on target with this, but let me tell \nyou there is no reason in the world why the INS should be the only \nAgency of the Federal Government that cannot do a search with a search \nwarrant in an open field. And to say, then, the target would simply be \nto target people who ``look Hispanic'' so you can add a racist touch to \nthe argument, it will not sell, because if that was the only reason you \nwould not get the search warrant. That is not probable cause.\n  With that initial volley on this contentious issue, I look forward to \nthe debate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to speak on this issue. I saw my \nfriend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer, who had wanted to \naddress the underlying issue briefly, has been waiting here for some \nperiod of time. If she can be recognized, I will come back to address \nthis amendment before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to both my friends who are managing this \nbill, Senator Simpson and Senator Kennedy, who have been so helpful to \nme as I work on a couple of amendments that I hope will be accepted, \nwhich I will talk about briefly.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to speak about an issue \nthat profoundly impacts my State of California. That issue is illegal \nimmigration. I know that there has been a big debate in the Senate \ncommittee of jurisdiction over whether we should blend in the issues of \nlegal and illegal immigration.\n  I want to restate and reaffirm my position that I hope they will be \nhandled separately. I know that Chairman Simpson, who has worked so \nhard, would prefer to combine these two issues. The reason I believe it \nis important to have a separate debate is that one group of people, \nillegal immigrants, choose to break our laws, and legal immigrants \nchoose to follow our laws. Those are two distinct and important \ndifferences.\n  Mr. President, no State in the entire country receives more illegal \nimmigrants than the State of California. Out of the approximately \n300,000 illegal immigrants that come to the United States and stay each \nand every year, about 35 percent to 40 percent of them live in \nCalifornia.\n  Why do most illegal immigrants come to America? Clearly, it is to \nfind work. They are hired because we are not fully enforcing the laws \nwe have on the books, which make it unlawful to hire illegal \nimmigrants. That is clear. It is against the law.\n  Now, it seems to me we have to do more to enforce those laws.\n  I have always said that in order to control the problem of illegal \nimmigration, we need to do it at the border and at the workplace. To \nintercede elsewhere, in my opinion, is not particularly effective. \nClearly, if you enforce the immigration laws at the border, you stop \nthe problem immediately. If you miss that opportunity, the workplace is \nthe next best place to go.\n  The bill before us that deals with the issue of illegal immigration \nhas many provisions I very strongly support. I strongly support the \nprovisions in title I of the bill, which strengthens law enforcement's \nability to stop illegal immigration. For instance, the bill will \nincrease the number of Border Patrol agents by 4,000 for the next 4 \nfiscal years--a 90-percent increase over current levels, and it is \nneeded.\n  I also strongly support the bill's provisions to add up to 900 new \nINS investigators over the next 3 fiscal years to enforce the laws \nagainst alien smuggling and the unlawful employment of illegal \nimmigrants. This increase of 900 new INS investigators is a 100-percent \nincrease over current law. So, clearly, this bill is moving us in the \nright direction in regard to stopping illegal immigration at the border \nand the workplace.\n  I want to take an opportunity to thank and compliment the Clinton \nadministration for getting serious about enforcement at the Southwest \nborder. It is long overdue. We have had protestations from detractors \nof this administration that they do not do enough. The fact is that \nthis is the first administration to do anything about illegal \nimmigration.\n  Let me repeat that. The Clinton administration is the first \nadministration to do anything about illegal immigration. Whether it is \nto begin to reimburse the States for the costs they have to bear, which \nare outrageous--costs for emergency medical care, costs for putting \nthose criminal aliens into prison--we are finally beginning to see some \nreimbursement here. However, it is not enough, and we need to do more.\n  I compliment the leaders of this bill because there is an \nauthorization in there for full reimbursement for the costs of \nproviding emergency medical assistance to illegal immigrants.\n  We have also seen an increase in the National Guard at the border. \nTheir presence relieves Border Patrol agents from desk jobs, and their \nwork on such things as building fences and roads and repairing sensors \nand night scopes is very important.\n  At the time that I recommended bringing more National Guard to the \nborder, the National Guard at that time was about 145 in San Diego. Now \nthey number up to 400. So we see that there has been an increase in \nNational Guard at the border, doing such things as relieving the Border \nPatrol of desk jobs and these other engineering jobs that I have \noutlined for you.\n  When I first injected more National Guard presence, people thought I \nwas going to send them down to the border in uniform with weaponry. \nThat was never the point. We said it is a resource that ought to be \nused, and I think we ought to use them more.\n  In 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service kicked off \nOperation Gatekeeper, its initiative along California's border with \nMexico. In the last 2 fiscal years, we have seen an increase of 500 \nBorder Patrol agents in San Diego.\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\n  So we see that this administration is moving forward. But this bill \nis very necessary and gives us more resources at the border than we \nhave had up until now, and, I might add, more technology and equipment \nthat we need at the border--equipment such as infrared scopes, sensors, \nautomated fingerprint ID systems. INS will be installing a new radio \nnetwork in San Diego to handle encrypted voice communication, and that \nis very important.\n  As I said before, we have to stop illegal immigration at the border, \nand if we fail there, at the workplace. I think we have to remember \nthat that is why illegal immigrants come here--for work.\n  Now, how badly are our wage and hour laws being violated? We only \nhave to look at the case of the sweatshop uncovered in El Monte, CA, to \nget an idea. In El Monte, alien smugglers brought in 72 foreign workers \nfrom Thailand, where they were subsequently forced into involuntary \nservitude at a garment sweatshop. We thought we saw the end of that in \nthe pre-Depression era. The El Monte case is an extreme example, but it \nis not an isolated incident.\n\n  Mr. President, most employers in our country abide by our immigration \nand our labor laws, but, unfortunately, some choose not to, and they \nare undermining our laws and the wages of our workers as well. They are \nguilty of the lowest form of greed--human exploitation--and it must be \nstopped.\n  It is well known that employers engaging in wage and hour law \nviolations are often the same ones who hire illegal workers. I am very \npleased that the bill before us provides for 350 new wage and hour \ninvestigators at the Department of Labor over the next 2 fiscal years \nto enforce the existing employer sanctions we already have on the \nbooks. The bill also contains enhanced civil penalties for repeated or \nwillful violations of our Federal labor laws, which I strongly support.\n  I am disappointed that the committee voted to delete provisions to \nincrease the sanctions on employers who violate immigration laws. I am \ndisappointed about that. But I am glad that there are enhanced \npenalties for those who violate Federal labor laws.\n  Now, I think it is important that we give employers a better tool so \nthey can identify who is legal and who is not. The bill before us moves \nus forward toward worker verification. I have always opposed a national \nID card because I think if someone is walking in the street, they \nshould never be stopped and asked to show an ID card. But when they go \nfor a job, right now it is virtually impossible for employers to verify \nwhether they are legal or not. I think the approach taken in this bill \nis a good one, and I hope it will be part of the bill when it leaves \nthis Chamber.\n  I also think it is important that the bill authorizes an increase of \n300 new investigators at INS to go after the visa overstayers, because \nso many of our illegal immigrants are those who overstay their visa. So \nthat is excellent.\n  I have long supported cracking down on those who manufacture and use \nfraudulent documents. The last time I had a chance, on the crime bill, \nI offered an amendment that increased the penalties on those who \nmanufacture forged documents. But I think we need to do more, and this \nbill does go further to increase civil and criminal penalties for \ncrimes involving document fraud.\n  I want to take just a moment to talk about a problem we are seeing in \nCalifornia now more and more, where smugglers are driving vehicles \ncrashed through a checkpoint and lead local law enforcement on high-\nspeed chases. We all know what happened nationally when we saw one case \nwhere there was apparent overreaction from the police and use of \nexcessive force--that is what it appears to be.\n  But the fact of the matter is, we have to stop that kind of \nrecklessness, driving on a 60-, 70-mile chase where you endanger the \nlives of the police following you and you endanger the lives of those \npeople you are smuggling. Following that case when force was used, we \nhad seven illegal immigrants killed, who fell over a cliff when the \nsmuggling attempt led to disaster.\n  So, I was very surprised to see that there are no Federal penalties \nfor such reckless behavior. What I am offering, and what Senator \nSimpson and Senator Kennedy are working with me on, is a Federal \npenalty for those who crash through a Federal checkpoint and, in fact, \ndo not stop.\n  We want to make sure there is a Federal penalty of 5 years in prison \nfor those who do that, and perhaps--we are working with Senator Simpson \non this--an even tougher penalty where those people could be deported. \nBecause anyone who would lead law enforcement on a high-speed chase not \nonly endangering the police officers themselves but also the cargo they \nare carrying--by that I mean human cargo--and all the drivers on the \nroad, they deserve to be thrown in jail or deported.\n  I also want to briefly touch on an amendment that I am cosponsoring \nwith Senator Feinstein which deals with the triple fence authorized in \nthe bill. I will not go into all of the details in the interest of \ntime. But we feel that the Border Patrol could do better if we did not \ndictate exactly that a $12 million fence should be built, or inhibit \ntheir ability to design fencing in the way they want and to use some of \nthe money for other needed infrastructure improvements. Moreover, we \ncertainly do not want to force law enforcement to build a triple fence \nif they feel it would endanger their lives. And that is what they have \ntold us.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to speak about an issue \nthat profoundly impacts the State of California. That issue is illegal \nimmigration.\n  And before I go any further, I want to reaffirm my position that \nlegal and illegal immigration must be treated separately. I know that \nChairman Simpson, who has worked very hard on the issue of immigration, \nwould prefer to link these two issues together.\n  However, I believe having a separate debate on the two issues will \nbetter ensure that Congress recognizes the critical difference between \nthose illegal immigrants who choose to break our laws, and those legal \nimmigrants who choose to follow them.\n  Mr. President, no State in the entire country receives more illegal \nimmigrants than California. Out of the approximately 300,000 illegal \nimmigrants that come to the United States and stay every year, about 35 \nto 40 percent of them live in California.\n  Why do they come here? Most of them come to find work. And they are \nhired because we are not enforcing the laws we have on the books which \nmake it unlawful to hire illegal immigrants. That must change.\n  I have always said that in order to control the problem of illegal \nimmigration, we need to do it at the border and the workplace. To \nintercede elsewhere, in my opinion, is not effective.\n  The bill before us today is S. 1664, the Immigration Control and \nFinancial Responsibility Act of 1996. The bill contains many provisions \nwhich are praiseworthy. I strongly support the provisions in title I of \nthe bill which strengthen law enforcement's abilities to stop illegal \nimmigration. For instance, the bill would increase the number of Border \nPatrol agents by 4,000 for the next 4 fiscal years--a 90-percent \nincrease over current levels.\n  I also strongly support the bill's provisions to add up to 900 new \nINS investigators to enforce the laws against alien smuggling and the \nunlawful employment of illegal immigrants. This is an increase of about \n100 percent over current law.\n  I want to take this opportunity to compliment the Clinton \nadministration for getting serious about enforcement at the Southwest \nborder. It is about time and long overdue, for despite protestations \nfrom detractors of this administration in California--this is the first \nadministration to do anything about illegal immigration.\n  And we have seen an increase in the National Guard at the border. \nTheir presence relieves Border Patrol agents from desk jobs, and their \nwork on such things as building fences and roads, and repairing sensors \nand night scopes. At the time I recommended bringing more National \nGuard at the border, they numbered 145 at the San Diego border. Now \nthey number as high as 400.\n  In 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] kicked off \nOperation Gatekeeper--its initiative along California's border with \nMexico. In the last 2 fiscal years, we have seen an increase of 1,150 \nborder patrol agents nationally--more than 500 of\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\nwhom have been deployed in San Diego.\n  Counting the 800 new Border Patrol agents for this fiscal year, the \nBorder Patrol force will have been increased by 40 percent since the \nClinton administration took over. California now has over 1,500 Border \nPatrol agents patrolling our border and enforcing our immigration laws.\n  But as we all know, Mr. President, any smart strategy to regain \ncontrol of our borders will take heightened technology which is being \nused in Operation Gatekeeper. Infrared scopes, low-light-level \ntelevision systems, and ground sensors are all being used to enhance \nour effectiveness at the border. San Diego has been the recipient of \nnew infrared scopes, sensors, and a new automated fingerprint \nidentification system. INS will be installing a new radio network in \nSan Diego to handle encrypted voice communication.\n  And we cannot forget why most illegal immigrants come here in the \nfirst place: work. How badly are our wage and hour laws being violated? \nWe only have to look at the case of the sweatshop uncovered in El \nMonte, CA, to get an idea. In El Monte, alien smugglers brought in 72 \nforeign workers from Thailand where they were subsequently forced into \ninvoluntary servitude at a garment sweatshop. The El Monte case is an \nextreme example. But it is not an isolated incident.\n  Mr. President, most employers in our country abide by our immigration \nand labor laws. However, those who choose not to, not only undermine \nour laws, but the wages of American workers as well. They are guilty of \nthe lowest form of greed--human exploitation. It must be stopped.\n  It is well-known that employers engaging in wage and hour law \nviolations are often the same ones who hire illegal workers. I am \npleased that the bill before us provides for 350 new wage and hour \ninvestigators at the Department of Labor over the next 2 fiscal years \nto enforce the existing employer sanctions we already have on the \nbooks.\n  Furthermore, the bill contains enhanced civil penalties for repeated \nor willful violations of our Federal labor laws, which I strongly \nsupport. However, I am deeply disappointed that the committee voted to \ndelete provisions to increase the sanctions on employers who violate \nimmigration laws.\n\n  Of course it is imperative for employers to better ascertain who is \nauthorized to work, and who is not. The bill before us moves us toward \nimproved verification for work and public benefits through the creation \nof several regional or local demonstration projects.\n  After the pilots have been tested, the administration will be \nrequired to return to Congress to make a recommendation on a permanent \nsystem. Implementation of a recommended system will require \ncongressional action. The approach contained in the bill will allow \nCongress to review which methods of verification are the most effective \nbefore enacting a larger scale system.\n  I support the privacy protections contained in the bill to provide \nbalance as we move toward a national verification system. I am further \npleased that the bill explicitly prohibits a national ID card which I \noppose.\n  It is important to have a foolproof method to ensure a potential \nemployee is legal--I believe it would be dangerous to put in place a \nsystem where someone walking down the street could be stopped and asked \nfor their papers. That situation would infringe on our lives.\n  A key fact of illegal immigration which often is overlooked is that \napproximately half of the illegal aliens currently in our country \nentered legally and overstayed their visas. This bill authorizes an \nincrease of 300 new investigators at INS to go after these visa \noverstayers. I support this.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions in the bill to \nincrease penalties on alien smugglers and those committing document \nfraud. I have long supported cracking down on those who manufacture and \nuse fraudulent documents. When I toured the California-Mexico border \nwith Attorney General Reno and Senator Feinstein, we met with INS \nagents who told us it was key to beef up penalties for document \nforgery. Thousands of illegal immigrants each year use these documents \nto enter the United States illegally or continue to stay and work here \nillegally.\n  In the 1994 crime bill, I proposed an amendment to double the \ncriminal penalties for forgers and distributors of fraudulent \ndocuments. These heightened penalties passed and are now law.\n  The provisions contained in S. 1664 go even further to increase \ncriminal and civil penalties for crimes involving document fraud. We \nmust send a message to these wrongdoers that we will not tolerate those \nwho flout our immigration and criminal laws. These tougher penalties \nshould serve as an effective deterrent to such actions.\n  For instance, for fraudulent use of government-issued documents, the \nbill increases the maximum fine from $250,000 to $500,000, and the \nmaximum criminal sentence from 5 years to 15 years.\n  I would like to take a minute to specifically discuss alien \nsmuggling. Recent incidents involving alien smugglers have received \nconsiderable press attention. The beating of two illegal immigrants \nafter a 80-mile chase ending in El Monte put a face on the human cargo \nbeing brought into our country by alien smugglers.\n  Recently in California, 7 people were killed and 19 injured when a \npickup carrying immigrants being smuggled into the country skidded, \nflipped over, and plunged off a rural road west of Temecula while being \nfollowed by Border Patrol agents. We must stop such occurrences.\n  S. 1664 stiffens criminal penalties for alien smuggling. The bill \nalso contains provisions to expand the Federal Government's ability to \npursue alien smugglers through expansion of the RICO [Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations] statute and wiretap authority.\n  I plan to offer an amendment to provide a new, tough Federal penalty \non those who flee border checkpoints, creating dangerous high-speed \nchases. My amendment would provide a Federal penalty of imprisonment of \nup to 5 years. I am working with Senator Simpson and Senator Kennedy \nand hope this amendment will be accepted.\n  Alien smugglers do deserve to be punished. They take advantage of \npeople in desperate situations--often threatening their safety and \npotentially those of hundreds who could be exposed to them. We must \nmake every effort to ensure that such tragedies do not continue to \noccur.\n  One concern I have with the bill relates to the authorization of a \n14-mile triple fence for the 14 miles eastward of the Pacific Ocean in \nSan Diego. Let me be clear about one thing: I support fencing and \nreinforcement of physical barriers along the border. But when the \nBorder Patrol itself says these provisions would endanger the physical \nsafety of their personnel, I think we should defer to their expertise.\n  Along with the INS, the Border Patrol points to the tactical and \nlogistical problems of a contiguous triple fence. They also raise \nconcerns about alien smugglers taking advantage of the triple fence \nconfiguration to ambush Border Patrol agents.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring an amendment with Senator Feinstein to \nput the $12 million authorized for the triple fence toward needed \nborder infrastructure improvements--including construction of all-\nweather roads, low-light television systems, lighting, sensors, and \nmultiple fencing where it makes sense to do so.\n  Title II of the bill addresses immigrant--legal and illegal--use of \npublic benefits. Illegal immigrants are largely ineligible for public \nwelfare benefits. Where they are eligible, I support full Federal \nreimbursement for any resulting costs to States and localities.\n  The bill sets out the general prohibition barring illegal immigrants \nfrom receiving public benefits but exempts a limited number of \nservices. In fiscal year 1994, the General Accounting Office estimated \nthat the cost of providing elementary and secondary education, \nemergency Medicaid, and incarceration of alien felons was $2.35 billion \nfor my State of California.\n  Immigration is a Federal responsibility. However, until this \nadministration, California had not received any reimbursement for its \ncosts resulting from illegal immigration. Today, California is \nreceiving reimbursement for its costs of incarcerating criminal aliens \nunder the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. And while the crime \nbill authorized $1.7 billion to reimburse these costs, California has \nyet to receive full repayment.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n  I want to commend the chairman for including an authorization to \nfully reimburse States and localities for emergency medical services \nprovided to illegal immigrants. Right now, the Federal Government pays \nhalf of this cost and the remainder is borne by the State. In \nCalifornia, this amounted to a cost for California of $395 million in \nfiscal year 1994. I strongly support reimbursement for these costs.\n  With respect to benefits for legal immigrants, I support \nstrengthening the responsibility of sponsors. That is why I agree we \nmust make affidavits of support signed by sponsors legally enforceable. \nIndividuals who want to sponsor a family member must not shirk their \nresponsibilities to the immigrant once they arrive.\n  By making the affidavits legally enforceable, the agency providing \nassistance to a needy legal immigrant has the ability to be repaid for \ntheir costs. This approach makes sense.\n  As a final note, Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss the \nimportance of naturalization. Naturalization--the process by which a \nlegal immigrant is granted the full rights and responsibilities of \ncitizenship--represents the final step in a journey toward the American \ndream, a journey played by the rules.\n  The latest surge in naturalization applications submitted is nowhere \nmore evident than in California. In fiscal year 1995, over 380,000 \neligible legal immigrants applied to naturalize in California. This is \na 500 percent increase over the totals for fiscal year 1991.\n  I am pleased that we now have a leader at INS who is doing something \nabout it. Under Commissioner Doris Meissner, INS has been actively \nattempting to meet the latest surge in naturalization through its \ninitiative, Citizenship USA. I commend Commissioner Meissner for the \nagency's efforts to put the ``N'' back in INS.\n  However, an immigrant who has already waited for at least 5 years to \nbecome eligible to naturalize can wait for an additional 12 to 16 \nmonths in cities like San Francisco and San Jose, CA, for their \napplication to be processed because of enormous increases in demand.\n  We owe it to those who patiently follow the rules to do better.\n  Mr. President, I plan to offer an amendment to create demonstration \nprojects around the country that set up citizen swearing-in ceremonies \naround July 4. The amendment which passed the House, authored by \nCongressman Sam Farr, would authorize INS to use the fees it already \ncollects to fund the minimal additional costs of holding these symbolic \nceremonies for 500 people.\n  Under the amendment, 10 demonstration projects would be authorized \neach year for 5 years. The demonstration projects would enable INS to \nreach out to local communities to encourage their involvement in the \ncelebration of citizenship. The swearing-in ceremonies would be a \ncommunitywide celebration reminding citizens why we are proud to be \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to those who want to follow the rules \nand become full participants in American society. Earlier this month, I \nintroduced S. 1677, the Citizenship Promotion Act.\n  My bill would establish a Citizenship Promotion Agency [CPA] within \nINS to assist eligible immigrants with naturalization. The CPA would be \nable to work with government agencies as well as nonprofit \norganizations to assist in its naturalization outreach obligations.\n  My bill would also create a nine-member National Advisory Board on \nCitizenship to advise on naturalization objectives. And finally, my \nlegislation would establish a naturalization examinations fee account \nwithin the U.S. Treasury to ensure that naturalization fees are spent \non naturalization--not redirected elsewhere. Such naturalization \nactivities could include English language instruction for immigrants \ntrying to become citizens.\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate my support for many of the \nprovisions in the illegal immigration bill. I look forward to working \nwith both Chairman Simpson and Senator Kennedy in making further \nimprovements to this legislation. Thank you.\n  I will close by saying this. I said at the outset that there is a \nreal difference between illegal immigration and legal immigration. My \nown mother became a naturalized citizen in 1937. When she died in 1991, \nshe left me a very special little pouch that had two things in it: Her \nwedding band and her certificate of naturalization. I think Americans \nunderstand how much naturalized citizens cherish this homeland.\n  Therefore, I am working with Senator Simpson and Senator Kennedy to \nget an amendment adopted which would recognize the beauty of those \nnaturalization ceremonies. And I pick up on an amendment that passed \noverwhelmingly in the House that would give some modest sums of money \nto conduct those naturalization ceremonies. We want to put the ``N'' \nback into the INS--``naturalization.'' It is a beautiful ceremony, and \nthose are some of our finest citizens.\n  I could give you the list of some of those naturalized citizens. But \nI think you all know how many of our wonderful leaders in this country \nin entertainment, in politics, and in all fields are naturalized \ncitizens.\n  So I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me so \ngenerously of his time. I feel this is such an important issue to my \nState. I wanted to have this opportunity to compliment my friends who \nhave led on this bill, for what they have done, and I hope to be able \nto support it.\n  Again, I thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see a number of our colleagues who have \nbeen very interested in this issue that would like to speak to it. I \nwill respond at an appropriate time after they speak to the current \namendment--to the Simpson amendment.\n  But I want to just point out to the Members about where we are. The \nparliamentary situation effectively excludes the opportunity for \nrecognition of the minority, the Democratic manager of this \nlegislation. Under the right of recognition it always goes to the \nmajority as the time-honored tradition, and we understand that and \nrespect that. But given the parliamentary situation we are effectively \ndenied on our side any Member offering an amendment. I mean, with \nrespect to the processing of amendments, we are at the point now where \nwe are processing nongermane amendments because eventually at some time \nwe will move toward cloture. By beginning to understand what the \nsituation is we will dispose of various amendments that apparently are \nagreeable to the floor managers prior to the time that a cloture \npetition is put down which will exclude any chance of other Members to \ncome back in here and offer any amendments. That is an extraordinary \nprocess and procedure.\n  We have to ask ourselves about how long we really want to put up with \nthat. I have been trying as a matter of comity in working with the \nSenator from Wyoming to move through this in a way which permits us to \ntry to deal with some of the basic substantive issues. But we, as the \ntime moves on, are caught in this particular situation. We are \neffectively dealing, and only dealing, with the amendments represented \nby the majority, and we are precluded under this whole process of \noffering any amendments.\n  This is not a personal comment on my good friend, the Senator from \nWyoming, because he is responding to the wishes of the majority leader \nin this case. And the matters that he is raising here are matters that \nhave been raised in the Judiciary Committee, matters which he had \nindicated to us that during the course of the debate he was going to \nraise, and matters which are of very fundamental importance in terms of \nthe substance of the issue.\n  But we are still in a situation where we are being told we can only--\nthe Senate of the United States on an important piece of legislation \nlike this can only--deal with those amendments that are put forward by \nthe manager of the bill because under the right of recognition he gets \nit. If there are other Members that want to have amendments considered \nthey would go to him. If he thinks that he may support them, I imagine \nhe will put them forward. And, if he does not, he will not.\n  So we are in a situation where we have effectively a very small gate. \nMy good friend and colleague--again I say with deference to him--\nbecause he has always, as I have stated on every occasion, been \nentirely up front and entirely fair in dealing with all the members of \nthe committee, Republicans and\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nDemocrats alike. But he is caught in this position was well.\n  So it does seem to me that our colleagues ought to understand that \neffectively we have a clearance system here that unless an amendment is \ncleared through the acting majority leader we are being closed out. And \nI think the American people and our Senators ought to know that this is \nnot a freewheeling debate where we are going to have the opportunity \nfor the Members who want to represent their States and their interests \nto be able to get recognized to be able to pursue that.\n  This is an extremely important amendment, and I hope we can deal with \nthis amendment in a timely way. But at some time we are going to have \nto ask ourselves whether we are going to just go ahead and consider all \nof the nongermane amendments that come through our colleague over here \nand none of the nongermane amendments to be considered by other \nMembers. Then we get into cloture, and they have taken care of those \nnongermane amendments. We will be just back on the germane amendments. \nIt is a rather unusual way to proceed.\n  I just raise that now because there are those, myself included, who \nwant to try to get at least some opportunity for recognition so that we \nwould have a chance to offer at least a minimum wage amendment on this \nwith a very short time agreement. We are effectively being closed out \nfrom that possibility. We understand that. But the other Members of the \nSenate ought to understand that as well. Hopefully the majority and \nminority leaders can bring their good common sense and judgment to help \nus find a way through this particular dilemma.\n  I will yield the floor because others want to speak. I will come back \nand speak to the substance of this measure. I want to again point out \nthat the substance of this issue is enormously important. It is \nabsolutely relevant. We ought to address it. It is extremely \nsignificant. But some time in the not-too-distant future I think we \nought to have some kind of a decision about how we want to proceed.\n  This issue of illegal immigration is extremely important. We have \nsupported the expansion of the border guards. We have supported the \nmeasures that Senator Simpson and I cosponsored--measures to try to \ncreate a more effective process for being able to identify the \nlegitimate Americans versus illegals in the job market, which is \nextraordinarily important. There are other provisions as well in the \nillegal immigration bill which are very, very important and some which \nthere is some difference on.\n  But we are in an unusual situation, and it is something that I know \nMembers have to be concerned with as well.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I can understand the frustration of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. He expressed that frustration in a very \nclear way. Let us then review the bidding so that we do all hear what \nwe are doing.\n  We are dealing with illegal immigration. That has been the pending \nbusiness before this body for over a week. The pending business of the \nSenate is the measure with regard to illegal immigration, which when we \nfinish the amending process will probably pass by a rather significant \nvote. So if we are talking about important legislation, then surely we \nshould be talking about this.\n  So what occurred here today is nothing mysterious, nothing sinister, \nnothing harsh. It is called legislating, and it is called using the \nrules of procedure, and it is done beautifully by the Democrats when \nthey are in the majority and by the Republicans when they are in the \nmajority.\n  So if we are talking about what is germane, what could be more \nnongermane than Social Security and an attempt to say that Social \nSecurity somehow is not to be dealt with when we do a balanced budget, \nwhen Social Security is $360 billion of the national budget.\n  That is what we are talking about, nothing mysterious, nothing \nsinister. What are we talking about that is germane about minimum wage? \nBut there might be something very interesting and germane with minimum \nwage because the same people who are seeking an increase in the minimum \nwage are at the same time restricting efforts--some--restricting \nefforts to reduce the number of low-skilled immigrants who are entering \nunder the family preference system.\n  I hope that we are able to divine that extraordinary difference. It \nis these low-skilled newcomers who flood the labor market which results \nthen in stagnant wages. That is what happens. So this is one of the \nmost curious parts of the entire debate to me.\n  I am not attributing that to Senator Kennedy. I am attributing it to \nsome who continue to resist the fact that we are trying to say that \nlow-skilled persons are no longer required to come here under our \nimmigration laws. We need people with skills. We need people with \nability. We need people who are here to pull their share. We need \npeople to come here whose sponsors say, ``When you come here, I will \nassure that you do not become a public charge.'' That is what we are up \nto here. No mystery, nothing sinister.\n  You asked how we could be precluded from dealing with things that are \nvery important to Senator Kennedy or to Senator Dorgan. The same would \nbe my argument. I am being precluded from dealing with illegal \nimmigration reform. And I think that we want to keep all those \ninteresting balances before the body. That is a very important thing.\n  I wish to insert in the Record a very interesting column that was in \nthe Washington Post in the Outlook section last Sunday about this \nextraordinary argument about the minimum wage and the extraordinary, \nremarkable flight from common sense of those who will not allow us to \nreduce the number of those people presently entering under the \npreference system.\n  We have a situation now with regard to naturalization, with regard to \na movement toward naturalization created by the legalization of the \n1986 bill, created by people who are stunned and alarmed by proposition \n187 and think, boy, if they are going to treat people who are permanent \nresident aliens like that, I want to get naturalized. There is another \nmovement toward that, and so you are going to have more numbers coming \nto the United States than you ever did before, even if we did the \nminimum under the ``legal immigration bill.''\n  And remember, there is a legal immigration bill at the desk which \npassed the committee by a vote of 13 to 4. That is legal immigration. \nThere is also the illegal immigration bill, which passed the committee \nby a vote of 13 to 4, and that is what we are considering at the \npresent time.\n  Let me assure you that if you are talking about germane and \nnongermane, there should be not much question, at least in the eyes of \nthe general American public, of a certain thing which is total reality, \nwhich is sometimes difficult to attain here, that the reason we talk \nabout them together--whether you split them or puree them is not the \nissue--split, whole or pureed, you do not escape the fact that over one \nhalf of the people who come here legally become the illegal aliens \nwhich are the subject of this bill.\n  Please hear that, I hope, and know that we are talking about people \nwho come here, half of them who come here legally become illegal. They \nthen go out of status with a tourist visa. They go out of status with a \nstudent visa. They then become part of the illegal community.\n  So those are some things, and we are not here to disrupt things but \nwe are here to deal with the bill as we do health care, we do line-item \nveto, we do this and we do that, and try and proceed. If the entire \nexercise should end in an hour, I can assure you that it will come back \nat some future time, but I thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for at least processing four or five amendments. That is what we \nshould be doing. There are two choices here: Be about our business on \nan illegal immigration bill or the leader will be required to pull up \nsomething else and the issue will simply never go away, either of the \nissues or all of the issues.\n  So I just wanted to express that with I hope some clarity, that we \nare moving on an illegal immigration bill with a significant amendment \nhere at the present time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nallow me to ask him a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Indeed, I say to my friend from Kentucky, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator from Wyoming understands better than most\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nwhy the minimum wage amendment is being placed here. That is about the \nonly place we can get a chance to do it. He understands that well. And \nalso the sense of the Senate on the balanced budget amendment, not \nusing Social Security. He understands that question well. Could it not \nbe worked out and taken off the bill? If a time agreement to vote on \nthis bill--on those two questions be agreed to in 30 seconds, they \nwould both be off the bill, would they not?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it will be up to our leader to determine \nthe course of business. The Senator from Kentucky and I both filled the \nrole as assistant leader of our parties, and I think we both realize \nthat we were somewhat muted on final decisions.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that. But we do know that if the leaders would \nmake a decision and give us the time for a stand-alone vote on it, \nthese two items would not be on the immigration bill. And as we have \nseen both sides do in the past, you take an opportunity when it is \npresented to you. All I wish to know is if the Senator would agree that \nif the leaders would give us an opportunity to vote on minimum wage and \nthe opportunity to vote on a sense of the Senate as it relates to the \nbalanced budget, not using Social Security, that they would not be on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think that all of us know when we reach \nthese sticking points in this body--and that is often--people then \nhuddle and decide what to do. The leaders trust and admire each other \nand they will work together and move the legislation of the Senate. And \nthat is the way it will always work.\n  On the other issue of minimum wage, I understand there are serious \ndiscussions going on about minimum wage, training wage, and getting the \nminimum wage to the people who do require it most and not to someone \nfrom a fine family that decided to go work in McDonald's for the summer \nand pretend that that is the issue of minimum wage when someone is a \nprivileged young person who is simply in the work force.\n  There are real things here. For every horror story on one side, we \nhave the horror story on the other side. That is the only way I have \nbeen able to exist in this body for 18 years.\n  So, for every one that is presented to us, then there is something on \nthe other side about people who lose their jobs, employers who are on \nthe edge and say, ``Minimum wage? I cannot do it.''\n  You can make fun of those people and say they should, I guess, be \nsubsidized by the Government or something to pay the minimum wage. But \nthe issue is, they say ``I will go broke. So, therefore, I will not do \nthat. Or, if that is the law, I cannot do it and I'm out.'' That is an \nargument just as valid as the one about children and spouses and the \nworking man, and all of those things are what the American people know \nand see that is what we do. And that is what we do.\n  So, I am going to leave the issue for resolvement to that. And know \nthat, at this point, this procedure of filling the tree and moving \nforward is not a patented process by the Republican majority; it is a \npatented process by the Democratic majority when they are in power. It \nis a tool to move legislation.\n  We have two choices here. Pull up something else or move forward. How \ncan anyone argue--regardless of the passion of what you want to present \nto the body--how can you argue about not moving forward with a very \nimportant bill, and that is what we are attempting to do. It really is \nnot as strange as it would appear.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I agree that the points the Senator from \nWyoming made are valid points which ought to be part of a debate on the \nminimum wage. But effectively we are being precluded from the \nopportunity for action and for resolution. That is all we are asking \nfor, whether 13 million families are entitled to 30 minutes of the \nSenate's time so we can make a decision on the issue of the minimum \nwage and also the proposal of Senator Dorgan. That is really what we \nare asking. It is not a great deal, but in order to preclude the Senate \nfrom taking that action we are finding out that we are using the \nunusual--and it is unusual--process by which the only amendments we are \ngoing to debate are going to be the amendments of the Senator from \nWyoming or amendments that come through the process of the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  So this is not progress in the sense it is giving Members of the \nSenate an opportunity to be able to raise issues that are important. \nThey are effectively precluded from that because they are denied the \nright of recognition.\n  So we have to press, again, and indicate at the first opportunity we \nare going to offer it. Eventually the opportunity is going to come, \nbecause eventually--and people ought to understand it--when the time \ncomes, and the final amendment is either agreed to or rejected, that \nprior to the time there is going to be disposition or a vote on this, \nit is going to be open, and others will be able to offer their \namendments. So it might take a little while to be able to do that. We \nunderstand that. But that will eventually be the reality on that.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I enjoy, obviously, the Senator from \nMassachusetts because he does his work with a--down there, always--a \ncrinkle in his eye and a twinkle. I know that one. I have seen it many \ntimes. This is, really--this is theater. It is Shakespeare--minor, \nminor, I can assure you. It is street Shakespeare. I do it, too. I will \nbe Lear, raging into the wind, and Senator Kennedy will be Puck.\n  Let me tell you, the minimum wage, when the Democrats had the control \nof this body and the House of Representatives and the Presidency, never \nappeared in this Chamber under any scenario from the wings--not once. \nNot once did President Clinton ever suggest we deal with the minimum \nwage. And since it became something that appeared in the focus groups, \nor the Knight tracking polls, it has been mentioned 47 times by the \nPresident.\n  So it is theater. But, really, if you stay in this game long enough--\nand I have been legislating for 30 years and obviously love it, but I \nam ready to do something else--if you play with the wheel with the \nfanny kicker on it, it will come around and get you. Hear this from my \nfriend, Senator Ted Kennedy, as we dealt with the health care reform \nbill. The Congressional Record, April 18, 1996, page S3513, quote of my \nfriend, Senator Kennedy:\n\n       Members of the Senate who are serious about insurance \n     reform should vote against all controversial amendments--\n     including medical savings accounts. Senator Kassebaum and I \n     have agreed that we will vigorously oppose all such \n     amendments--even those that we might support under other \n     circumstances.\n\n  Now, with the approval of the body, I ask unanimous consent that we \ninsert the phrase ``illegal immigration reform'' and then just adopt \nthat, because that is exactly what I am saying.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Simpson may say that this is \ntheater, but it has dramatic results, by our action or inaction, for \nthe 13 million families that would be affected about whether we are \ngoing to address the increase in the minimum wage, No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, the Senator, by mentioning the health care debate, \nunderstands--or should understand or may understand after this--that \nthe increase in the minimum wage was deferred at that time because the \nimpact and the effect on the hourly worker was considered to be a 40-\ncent to 50-cent increase as a result of a health care system. Those of \nus who had responsibility in that asked the workers do they want us to \nfight for an increase in the minimum wage, or do they want us to try \nand fight for health care, and overwhelmingly they said health care. We \nknow it is 40 to 50 cents an hour. That was the battle. That was the \nbattle then.\n  So the idea that we did not bring it up then--we did not bring it up \nthen because we were fighting for the expansion of health care for the \nprotection of workers, and we were denied that opportunity to have it \nbecause of Republican opposition.\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\n  I keep reading about who is responsible and who is not responsible \nabout it. It was basically a Republican decision not to permit a vote \non the U.S. Senate floor on health care, in order to show that we could \nnot deal with that issue, and the Congress was ineffective in dealing \nwith it. We understand that. We are not trying to rewrite history at \nthis particular time, and we should not attempt to do it here today. \nThat was the bottom line.\n  The value of health care, if we had gotten it, would have been that \n40 to 50 cents an hour. So, once the Republicans effectively defeated \nit we moved on in, in terms of the introduction of the minimum wage as \none of the first orders of business, if you look on our side. It was \none of the first six pieces of legislation, and we have been asking for \na vote on it for over 1 year and still are denied it, even though the \nRepublicans support it and even though Republican Presidents \nEisenhower, Nixon, and Bush actually voted in support of that measure.\n  So, I welcome the opportunity to have a substantive judgment and \ndecision on that matter, which, eventually, when we go through these \nvarious amendments, we will have the chance to do, because we are not \ngoing to be closed out. We can go on and use these Senate rules in a \nway to put our good friend and colleague as the gatekeeper for the \namendments, and he can use the rules in that particular way. But you \nare not going to get away from acting on the minimum wage at some \nparticular time.\n  Finally, I do not think I really have to justify the decision that \nwas made with regard to health care. That was a judgment that was made \nby Senator Kassebaum as well as myself.\n  So, if the Senator wants to have that kind of dispute as a way of \ngetting legislation effectively through, it is a procedure which is \nused at other times, generally when the floor manager and the minority \nagree. We differed on this legislation, for some very important \nsubstantive reasons.\n  So, I think the circumstances are very much different. All we are \nlooking for is 30 minutes on the minimum wage. Then we can get about \nconcluding this very important legislation and be able to vote on it. \nWe had, as the Senator from Wyoming knows, excellent markups with \noverwhelming participation, Republicans and Democrats, in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  It was a great tribute to the Senator from Wyoming, for the \ninvolvement of the Members and the expression of differing views, that \nthis legislation was reported out of committee. I am sure the Senate is \ngoing to make a judgment on this measure as well. But the idea that \ntaking 30 minutes or an hour out of this kind of debate while we are \nprocessing amendments is unreasonable is incorrect--I would be glad to \ncut back our time.\n  I do not think I have used very much time in agreeing with the \namendments of the Senator from Wyoming on these measures. Surely, we \ncan cut out 1 hour of this day or tomorrow or whenever to debate the \nminimum wage when we have had important Republican support. The issue \nwill not go away. I appreciate and understand the Senator's position on \nit.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. SIMON. When Senator Simpson mentions the health care bill and \nyour statement and Senator Kassebaum's statement that they would resist \nany amendments, is it not true that any Member could offer an \namendment, and, in fact, Senator Domenici offered an amendment with \nSenator Kerry here in this body? Any single Member could have offered a \nminimum wage amendment at that point. The procedure we are following \nhere is dramatically different. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is entirely correct. We did not attempt to \ngag the membership, which effectively this process does. The only way \nyou get consideration is to have the Senator from Wyoming, with the \nposition of the majority leader, recognized. That has been a time-\nhonored tradition which I respect and support. If not, then it goes to \nthe minority leader. Under the Senate rules, Senator Daschle could come \nout here and offer that amendment. Then Senator Dole would have to come \nout here and proceed in order to block that amendment.\n  We could go through that kind of a routine and put the Senate in \nstalemate. I mean, we are all dealing with this and understand the \nnature of these rules. I suppose sometime that will come to pass. But \nwhat we are trying to do is get an orderly procedure to be able to go \nforward.\n  Just finally, I say to my friend and colleague, maybe these \ndiscussions about how we could try to find common ground in the minimum \nwage are going on, but I do not know where they are going on. I do not \nthink those of us who have been most involved--myself, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Wellstone, other Members, and, to the best of my knowledge, \nSenator Daschle--are aware of these negotiations.\n  What we are aware of is the preposterous position that the majority \nleader of the House of Representatives put forward yesterday as a \nposition of the Republicans in the House, which effectively would say \nwe are going to repeal the EITC, and therefore save $15 billion. That \nwould be funds that would go to the people who are working on the \nlowest rung of the ladder, the economic ladder, and then we will set up \nan entirely new entitlement with the Internal Revenue Code to subsidize \nthese workers who are working in restaurants and as teachers aides and \nas other health aides, working in Head Start programs, cleaning out \nbuildings, that they would still get the $4.25 but get another subsidy \nfrom the Federal Government--a new entitlement.\n  Of course, that subsidy will be paid for by taxes that are coming \nfrom other workers. That is a new entitlement, a new bureaucracy, a new \nsubsidy for companies. If that is the proposal, why do we not just get \nabout the business of debating it and disposing of it. Maybe there are \nthose who want to do it. But as the Senator from Illinois points out, \nlet us at least permit a vote on this measure. Let us at least permit \nthe Senate to speak. Let us get a short time period and have a debate \non it.\n  That is what we are prepared to do. We are not trying to say, well, \nwe are not prepared to go through, even though we are being denied an \nopportunity to vote on the minimum wage, which has received Republican \nand Democratic support. We are not at this point saying, well, we are \nnot going to play ball with you on immigration. We could certainly have \ndone that. We believe that is an important measure. But up to this time \nthat has not been done. Eventually we will, under the Senate rules, \nhave an opportunity to have these offerings of amendments on the \nminimum wage on other measures.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think we could go on--and we may--but I \nthink, as we get back to the substance of minimum wage--and apparently \nthe Senator does that--and I think I misspoke earlier about \nShakespeare. I think Senator Kennedy is King Lear and I am puck, \nbecause certainly he launched one end of the tempest there, and here I \nam. But we will resolve this.\n  We will move forward perhaps, or we will not. If suddenly the \nprocedure fails at this time, we will come back to it tomorrow or the \nnext day, whatever it may be. But since we want to talk about the \nsubstance of minimum wage, I think it is important then just quickly, \nif I may, to talk about it in connection with immigration, because the \nother day in debate the Senator from Massachusetts talked about \njanitors.\n  Do you know what happened to janitors in the last 15 years? Janitors \nin Los Angeles in public buildings were making $12 an hour or $14. You \nknow what they make now? $6. You know why? Because we in this body have \nallowed a glut of immigration to come to the United States and \nespecially to that city, and the union janitors no longer are in a job \nat $12. The nonunion foreign immigrants came and knocked off the union \nwage.\n  Now we have the situation--if we are wanting to talk about the plight \nof janitors--there is a study by the General Accounting Office noting \nthat janitors in downtown Los Angeles office buildings had won \nexcellent wages and working conditions through their unions since World \nWar II. By 1983, the prevailing wage reached $12 an hour--this is a GAO \nreport. The ability to deliver credible threats to strike if wage \nincreases were not forthcoming played a very important role in that \nsuccess.\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\n  I know where Senator Kennedy is on that one. But Congress, those of \nus in Congress, overriding the recommendations of a Federal commission \non which Senator Kennedy and I served, continued a legal immigration \nprogram that poured hundreds of thousands of foreign workers into the \ncountry annually during the 1980's--hundreds of thousands. Thus, \nWashington, thus us, inadvertently provided the opportunity for \naggressive, nonunion businesses to take the jobs or deflate the wages \nof union workers, union workers in the Los Angeles area, taking over \nthe office building contracts. Most of the native born workers were \nthen driven from their jobs. Real wages for the foreign born and \nremaining native born have fallen further toward and even down to the \nminimum wage. There is a tie here somewhere, and we will get to it. We \nwill discuss it. Now I have opened Pandora's box once again, but \nrealizing the hazard of that. But there is where we are. We go ping \npong all day long. It is theater, any way you cut it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Florida has been very accommodative. I \nwill just take one moment.\n  The Senator's comments are old news, old news to certainly this \nSenator and, I think, to most Senators. That is why in the legal \nimmigration we have effectively cut out the unskilled workers. That was \ninitially either a proposal of mine or Senator Simpson on which we both \nhad agreement. So that particular feature is excluded.\n  The reason we are continuing to see the depression in terms of those \nwages is because of illegal, not the legal, because we have effectively \nterminated that.\n  I will welcome the opportunity for debate about how this legislation \nand the legal immigration is going to protect American workers. I say \nin fairness that the Senator from Wyoming had included in initial \nproposals some additional provisions for the protections of American \nworkers which I supported. I think we could have expanded on it.\n  Now, with regard to the legislation actually reported out of the \ncommittee, we have moved back from those kinds of protections. I think \nit is enormously important that we have those kind of protections. We \nwill have a chance to talk about that as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue of illegal immigration is an \nextremely serious one for America. Few places are as affected by that \nissue as my State of Florida. My State represents approximately 6 \npercent of the population in the United States. It is estimated that 10 \npercent to 15 percent of the illegal aliens who are in the United \nStates are in the State of Florida. Within the last 4 years there were \nperiods in which over 4,000 persons from Haiti alone entered into small \nboats in order to get to the United States, primarily through Florida, \nand would have added further to that population of illegal aliens.\n  Mr. President, my concern, therefore, is not that this Congress \nshould deal with this subject. It is important, critical that we do. \nRather, I believe there are at least two areas of this bill through \nwhich a serious fault line runs. This is not Shakespearian theater. \nThis is structural engineering. The first of those fault lines, and the \ntwo are related, is that while this bill has as its label, illegal \nimmigration, S. 1664 says in its heading, in its title, ``To Amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to Increase Control Over Immigration to \nthe United States by Increasing Border Patrol,'' et cetera. The focus \nof this bill is illegal immigration.\n  The first fault line, however, is that within this bill on illegal \nimmigration there are major provisions which affect legal aliens, \neither totally affect legal aliens or substantially affect legal \naliens. To pick one specific example which I hope will be dealt with \nbefore we complete action on this legislation, this bill that purports \nto deal with illegal immigration would change the conditions under \nwhich persons who are in this country with a legal status are allowed \nto adjust that legal status.\n  Since the early 1980's, the United States has recognized the special \ncircumstances of Cubans coming to the United States and have had \nspecial provisions in which persons who were here legally of Cuban \nnationality can adjust their status. This bill, which purports to deal \nwith illegal aliens would substantially restrict that right. This is \nonly available to persons who are here legally. I cite that as just one \nexample.\n\n  Other examples of the mixture of illegal and legal go to the fact \nthat by changing the eligibility standards for legal aliens, \nsubstantial additional costs are going to be imposed upon the \ncommunities and States in which these aliens live. So the second \nfaultline in this legislation are significant unfunded mandates which \nare being imposed upon States and local communities.\n  It is ironic, Mr. President, that the very first bill introduced in \nthis Congress, S. 1, was a bill which had as its title the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995. Let me read from the statement of the \npurpose of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The purpose of \nthis act, which is now Public Law 104-4, the fourth bill that became \nlaw as a result of actions of the 104th Congress, the purposes of the \nact are:\n\n       To strengthen the partnership between the Federal \n     Government and State, local, and tribal governments; 2, to \n     end the imposition in the absence of full consideration by \n     Congress of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without adequate Federal funding in a manner that \n     may displace other essential State, local, and tribal \n     governmental priorities . . . 6, to establish a point of \n     order vote on the consideration in the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives of legislation containing significant \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates without providing adequate \n     funding to comply with such mandates.\n\n  Those were some of the purposes that led this Congress to adopt as \nits fourth legislative action of the 104th Congress the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  When the Senate was debating this proposal, Mr. President, the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, stated,\n\n       Mr. President, the time has come for a little legislative \n     truth in advertising. Before Members of Congress vote for a \n     piece of legislation, they need to know how it would impact \n     the States and localities they represent. If Members of \n     Congress want to pass a new law, they should be willing to \n     make the tough choices needed to pay for it.\n\n   That statement by our majority leader was an important part of this \nSenate's determination to pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995.\n  So what are we about today, Mr. President? We are about legislation \nwhich would impose massive unfunded mandates on States and local \ncommunities in America. The Congressional Budget Office has, in a very \nlimited time, reviewed this legislation's very broad sweeping impact on \nState and local governments. They have determined that this bill does, \nin fact, meet the $50 million threshold for unfunded mandates \nprocedures due to the bill's requirements governing just two items: \nBirth certificates and drivers' licenses. Thus, although the bill would \nimpact literally hundreds of programs run by State and local \ngovernments, just these two relatively minor programs reach the \nthreshold of $50 million, which under the legislation constitutes \nunfunded mandates.\n\n  With respect to the all-encompassing deeming requirements imposed on \nhundreds of Federal, State, and local programs in this legislation, the \nCongressional Budget Office says,\n\n       Given the scope and complexity of the affected programs, \n     however, the Congressional Budget Office has not been able to \n     estimate either the likelihood or magnitude of such cost at \n     this time. These costs could be significant, depending on how \n     strictly the deeming requirements are enforced by the Federal \n     Government.\n  On another issue, the Congressional Budget Office has stated under \nthe terms of means tested State and local tested programs,\n\n       It is likely that some aliens displaced from Federal \n     assistance programs would turn to assistance programs funded \n     by State and local governments, thereby increasing the cost \n     of these programs. While several provisions of the bill could \n     mitigate these costs, CBO states that such tools would be \n     used only in limited circumstances in the near future. At \n     some point, State, and particularly local governments, become \n     the providers of last resort, and as such we anticipate that \n     they would face added financial pressure on their financial \n     assistance programs.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill fails to meet the majority leader's truth-\nin-advertising test. It is not strictly an illegal immigration bill, \nand it does have serious\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nfinancial implications for States and local communities. We are \npreparing to vote on a bill that we truly have not the foggiest idea \nwhat the impact will be on our constituents. They certainly are \nextremely concerned and strongly supportive of resolving this issue of \nunfunded mandates.\n  I have a letter dated April 16 from the National Conference of State \nLegislatures. This letter is also joined by the National Association of \nCounties and the National League of Cities. This letter urges all \nSenators to support a point of order against S. 1664, the illegal \nimmigration bill, based on the violation of the unfunded mandates bill. \nThis so states--the President of the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the President of the National Association of Counties, \nand the President of the National League of Cities--``This constitutes \na critical test of your commitment to preventing cost shifts to an \nunfunded administrative burden on State and local governments.'' This \nis what the leaders of State and local governments have described as \nthe seriousness of the issue of unfunded mandates raised by this bill.\n\n  During the Judiciary Committee markup of this bill, Gov. Tommy \nThompson of Wisconsin and Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada wrote in a letter, \ndated March 6, on behalf of the National Governors' Association, \nexpressing concern about ``administrative provisions contained in the \nbill,'' which, if enacted, ``could result in an unfunded mandate being \npassed on to State and local governments.''\n  This concern of Governors Thompson and Miller has, of course, now \nbeen confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office. Moreover, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals wrote to all Senators on April \n12, noting, ``This bill will lead to an increase in the number of \nuninsured patients and exacerbate an already tremendous burden of \nuncompensated care on public hospitals.''\n  This gets to another point that I offered in the unfunded mandates \nbill, which seemingly has gone unnoticed by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, despite a vote of 93 to 6. That was a provision, which is now \npart of the Public Law 104-4, which states that any Federal reductions \nin ``reimbursements to State, local, and tribal governments for the \ncosts associated with illegal, deportable, and excludable aliens, \nincluding court-mandated expenses related to emergency health care, \neducation, or criminal justice,'' constitute part of the potential new \nobligations imposed upon States and are subject to the point of order \nas unfunded mandates.\n  In numerous ways, S. 1664 does exactly that. It eliminates Federal \nreimbursement to the States, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, by about $7 billion. I repeat, it eliminates Federal \nreimbursement to the States by about $7 billion over the period 1996 to \n2002, a substantial portion of which is in health care costs associated \nwith immigrants.\n  In short, this bill, once again, creates an enormous unfunded mandate \non State and local governments. Once again, I repeat the quote from the \nCongressional Budget Office: ``Given the scope and complexity of the \naffected programs, however, CBO has not been able to estimate either \nthe likelihood or magnitude of such costs at this time. These costs \ncould be significant, depending on how strictly the deeming provisions \nare enforced by the Federal Government.''\n\n  Mr. President, while the CBO has been unable to do a comprehensive \nreport, the National Conference of State Legislatures has undertaken \nthat task. Our colleagues in the State capitals across the Nation, \nlegislators, as are we, who administer these programs we are talking \nabout today, have assessed what the impact will be on States. Although \nthey were, like the Congressional Budget Office, limited in the time \navailable to complete this analysis, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures developed a very conservative cost estimate for just 10 of \nthe affected programs.\n  This study did not include Medicaid and 40 other Federal means-tested \nprograms. What did the National Conference of State Legislatures find?\n  First, after contacting more than 10 States, States of varying size, \nthey concluded that ``regardless of the size of the immigrant \npopulation, all States and localities will have to implement these \nunfunded mandates.''\n  In other words, the bill impacts a city in Iowa or Delaware just as \nit might in Los Angeles, CA, or Miami, FL. The bill requires all \nFederal, State, and local means-tested programs to have a new \ncitizenship verification bureaucracy imposed upon them.\n  All programs, regardless of whether the new bureaucracy costs exceed \nbenefits, regardless of whether it imposes a very large unfunded \nmandate on State and local programs, all programs are impacted by this \nbill. What are the estimated costs, even for just the 10 programs which \nhave been studied? According to the NCSL study, ``The cost of these new \nrequirements for 10 selected programs would result in a $744 million \nunfunded mandate.'' Repeating, ``The cost of new requirements for 10 \nselected programs would result in a $744 million unfunded mandate.''\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures adds, ``Of course, if \nthe 40 other programs, including Medicaid, adoption assistance, and the \nWIC programs, are included, the unfunded administrative burdens on \nStates and localities would substantially increase.''\n  Mr. President, the NCSL study indicates that unfunded mandates for \njust 10 programs will be $744 million. Once the other multitude of \nprograms are analyzed, the costs imposed on State and local government \ncould far exceed a billion dollars. It could very well amount to \nseveral billion dollars.\n  However, Mr. President, there are no provisions in the pending \nlegislation to reimburse State and local governments for the \nadministrative costs and the cost shifts which will be imposed upon \nthem by this bill.\n  As the majority leader said on January 4, 1995, when we were passing \nthe unfunded mandates bill:\n\n       We do not have all the answers in Washington, DC. Why \n     should we tell Idaho, or the State of Kansas, or the State of \n     South Dakota, or any other State, that we are going to pass \n     this Federal law and we are going to require that you do \n     certain things, but we are not going to send you any money? \n     So you raise taxes in the local communities or in your State. \n     You tax the people, and when they complain about it, say, \n     ``Well, we cannot help it because the Federal Government \n     passed this mandate.'' So we are going to continue our drive \n     to return power to our States and our people through the \n     104th Congress.\n\n  Those were the words of Senator Dole on January 4, 1995. Mr. \nPresident, we have now come to a point of decision as to our \ncredibility. When we passed this legislation, as the fourth bill of the \n104th Congress, one of the items in the Contract With America, one of \nthe items upon which State and local governments are now making \nimportant decisions, which they have believed the legitimacy of our \nrepresentations that we are no longer going to be casually and in an \nunstudied way, imposing major costs upon them. Are we now going to be \nprepared to meet the test?\n  We have a bill which says that it only relates to illegal aliens; \nyet, an analysis indicates that it clearly has major impacts on legal \naliens.\n  Second, we find that a significant part of that impact on legal \naliens is to impose significant new unfunded mandates--financial \nresponsibilities--on States and local communities. I do not think that \nis what we want to do. We have a choice. Clearly, a point of order is \nnow available against this bill. We could end further discussion. I am \nreticent to raise that point of order because I believe it is important \nthat we pass an illegal immigration bill that will in fact strengthen \nour ability to protect the borders of America and to assure that our \nlawful means by which persons can come to the United States are \navailable and are not dismissed, as they have been so frequently in the \nrecent past, by persons who come here illegally.\n  I also am reluctant to raise this point of order at this time because \nwe still have an opportunity to correct this legislation and to remove \nthose provisions which are imposing these mammoth unfunded mandates on \nStates and local communities.\n  We are in a strange parliamentary process, but I hope that even \nthrough this byzantine process we will be able to consider those \namendments that will be faithful to our commitments not to impose new \nunfunded mandates in the manner in which we are doing in this \nlegislation upon our citizens at the State and local level.\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, my purpose in these remarks is to raise these two \nimportant structural defects in the bill--a mixture of impacts on legal \naliens, and a bill that is labeled ``illegal immigration'' and the \nimposition of major unfunded mandates on States and local communities.\n  It is my hope that by raising these issues, it will contribute to \nreforming this bill in a way that brings a good engineer into the \nfoundation of this legislation, pour some concrete, and strengthen the \nintegrity of this legislation. If that is done, then the unfunded \nmandate point of order would no longer be available.\n  If that is not done, I want to assure my colleagues that the point of \norder will be raised because I am committed that we not only strengthen \nour resolve against illegal immigration but that we also demonstrate \nour credibility to not impose mammoth unfunded mandates on our State \nand local governments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and other material from the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Conference of State Legislatures, National \n           Association of Counties, National League of Cities,\n                                                   April 16, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL), the National Association of Counties \n     (NACo) and the National League of Cities (NLC), we are \n     writing to alert you that according to both the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) and our own analysis S. 1664, The \n     Immigration and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, is in \n     violation of P.L. 104-4, The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n       Certain portions of S. 1664 would place unfunded federal \n     mandates on states and localities through new national \n     requirements for driver's licenses and birth certificates and \n     by extending legal immigrant benefit restrictions to all \n     federal means-tested programs. CBO estimates that the \n     driver's license and the birth certificate mandates alone \n     could cost states and localities in excess of $200 million. \n     This clearly exceeds the $50 million threshold needed for a \n     point of order against S. 1664 in accordance with P.L. 104-4.\n       In addition, a study by the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures has found that the deeming requirements of S. \n     1664 would impose even greater unfunded federal costs on \n     state and local governments. (CBO was unable to conduct an \n     analysis of the deeming requirements, but stated that ``it is \n     possible that the administrative costs associated with \n     applying deeming requirements to some federal means-tested \n     entitlement programs would be considered mandate costs as \n     defined in P.L. 104-4.'') The NCSL study of just ten affected \n     programs, not including Medicaid and 40 other programs, \n     reveals that the costs to state and local government of these \n     new requirements is $744 million.\n       As you know, ``deeming'' is attributing a sponsor's income \n     to the immigrant when determining program eligibility. S. \n     1664 would extend deeming from three programs (AFDC, SSI and \n     Food Stamps) to 50 federal means-tested programs including \n     foster care, adoption assistance, school lunch and WIC. \n     Regardless of the size of the immigrant population, all \n     states and localities will have to implement these unfunded \n     mandates. By mandating that state and local governments deem \n     for all these programs, the legislation requires states and \n     localities to extend a complicated administrative procedure \n     to more than 50 federal programs. These mandates will require \n     states to verify citizenship status, immigration status, \n     sponsorship status, and length of time in the U.S. in each \n     eligibility determination for the deemed federal programs. \n     They will also require state and local governments to \n     implement and maintain costly data information systems.\n       Therefore, we urge you to support a point of order against \n     S. 1664 based on the violation of P.L. 104-4. This is a \n     critical test of your commitment to preventing cost-shifts to \n     and unfunded administrative burdens on state and local \n     government.\n       NCSL, NACo and NLC will support subsequent amendments to \n     reduce the scope of the deeming provisions and the onerous \n     administrative requirements. We oppose the provision to \n     extend the deeming requirements to all non-cash, federal \n     means-tested programs. These mandates also garner almost \n     no federal savings and should be eliminated as part of the \n     Congressional commitment to eliminating cost shifts to \n     state and local budgets and taxpayers. We urge you to \n     support amendments to limit deeming to the federal \n     programs that deliver income support and food assistance \n     and to ensure that states and localities will not have to \n     implement deeming for any program where administrative \n     costs would exceed any estimated net savings or benefit \n     expenditures.\n       Without this amendment, states and localities will have to \n     deem applicants for everything funded by federal means-tested \n     programs from foster care to children's soccer leagues to \n     mobile meals to after-school tutoring programs. The \n     administrative burden would severely restrict the number of \n     services that could be provided and be a bureaucratic \n     nightmare, especially for states and localities with fewer \n     immigrants.\n       We also strongly support amendments to exempt vulnerable \n     populations such as legal immigrants who become disabled \n     after arrival, children under 18, pre-natal and post-partum \n     women, and veterans and their families from the deeming \n     restrictions. These groups are among the most vulnerable \n     members of our communities. NCSL, NACo and NLC are also \n     concerned about immigrants who enter the U.S. legally and \n     comply with U.S. immigration laws in good faith. Legal \n     immigrants who play by the rules should not be barred from \n     the SSI program if they become disabled after arrival. No one \n     can predict when they might suffer a disability; these \n     immigrants must be included in the SSI program.\n       We are especially concerned about the impact of extending \n     the deeming requirements to the Medicaid program. Without \n     this program eligibility, many legal immigrants will not have \n     access to health care. Legal immigrants will be forced to \n     turn to state indigent health care programs, public \n     hospitals, and emergency rooms for assistance or avoid \n     treatment altogether. This will in turn endanger the public \n     health and increase the cost of providing health care to \n     everyone. Furthermore, without Medicaid reimbursement, public \n     hospitals and clinics and states and localities would incur \n     increased unreimbursed costs for treating legal immigrants. \n     Exempting emergency Medicaid services from sponsor deeming is \n     especially justified because emergency medical care must be \n     provided by all hospitals with emergency rooms without regard \n     to the patient's ability to pay or immigration status.\n       Finally, we are also concerned about the provisions \n     mandating national standards for state and local documents \n     such as birth certificates and driver's licenses. We support \n     maintaining state and local choice in the design of these \n     documents. These are very sensitive public policy issues. S. \n     1664 would preempt a number of state laws including those \n     that specifically prevent using social security numbers as \n     identification on driver's licenses and other identification \n     cards. These mandates may violate the Supreme Court decision \n     in New York v. United States that prohibits making states the \n     administrative arm of the federal government. Furthermore, \n     these provisions also place costly unfunded mandates on state \n     and local governments that prevent such use of social \n     security numbers or do not use tamper-proof paper for birth \n     certificates.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our concerns and urge \n     you to support these amendments to minimize the cost shift \n     and unfunded mandates to states and localities.\n           Sincerely,\n     James J.

Marilina Sanz, National Association of \n         Counties.\n     Date: April 15, 1996.\n     Re: Unfunded Mandate Violations of More Than $900 Million In \n         S.1664/S.269.\n       As you may be aware, on Friday (4/12/96) the Congressional \n     Budget Office released its score of S.269 (now S.1664), the \n     Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996. \n     In this score, CBO states that a number of provisions in \n     S.1664 would place unfunded federal mandates on states and \n     localities. CBO estimates that the driver's license and birth \n     certificate provisions alone could cost states and localities \n     in excess of $200 million. This alone is a violation of the \n     provisions of S.1, the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 and is \n     certainly more than the $50 million threshold needed for a \n     point of order against S.1664 on the Senate floor.\n       As for S.1664's new deeming requirements for all federal \n     means-tested programs, CBO states that given the scope and \n     complexity of the affected programs, they were unable to \n     estimate these costs at this time. CBO found that ``it is \n     possible that the administrative costs associated with \n     applying deeming requirements to some federal means-tested \n     entitlement programs would be considered mandate costs as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4.'' As you know, S.1664 would \n     extend deeming from the 3 current programs (AFDC, SSI, and \n     Food Stamps) to more than 50 federal means-tested programs, \n     most of which provide social services at the local level.\n       The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) has \n     developed cost estimates for 10 affected programs (not \n     including one of the largest, Medicaid, and 40 other federal \n     means-tested programs). We have consulted with more than 10 \n     states of varying size. However, regardless of the size of \n     the immigrant population, all states and localities will have \n     to implement these unfunded mandates. The NCSL study found \n     that the cost of these new requirements for 10 selected \n     programs would result in a $744 million unfunded mandate. Of \n     course, if the 40 other\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\n     programs, including Medicaid, Adoption Assistance, and WIC, \n     are included the unfunded administrative burden on states and \n     localities would substantially increase.\n       In the Senate debate, NCSL and NACo will strongly support a \n     point of order against S.1664 and subsequent amendments to \n     reduce the scope of the deeming requirements and the \n     administrative burden the requirements place on states and \n     localities.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               National Conference of State Legislatures\n\n\n Unfunded Mandates in Immigration Bill: Cost Estimate of S.269/S.1664 \n                            Deeming Mandate\n\n       Enclosed are the following: (1) the list of programs that \n     we believe meet the unfunded mandate criteria contained in \n     S.1 Unfunded Mandates Act and CBO's interpretation of the \n     law; (2) an estimate of the infrastructure, training and \n     implementation costs that states and localities would incur \n     in order to implement deeming for these 10 programs; and (3) \n     the list of over 40 additional federal means-tested programs \n     that do not meet the criteria in S.1 but the states and \n     localities would also have to implement deeming for. We \n     estimate that the total cost of the deeming unfunded mandate \n     in S. 1664 for the 10 programs that meet S.1 criteria is \n     $743.66 million. These costs rise substantially when all \n     other federal means-tested programs, such as Medicaid, \n     Adoption Assistance, WIC, and others, are included (see \n     attachment part III).\n\n                       Assumptions about deeming\n\n       In order to comply with the deeming mandates in S.269 (``to \n     implement deeming for all federal means-tested programs'') we \n     believe that states and localities will have to adhere to a \n     process similar to the following.\n       A citizenship verification must be made for all applicants \n     of all federal means-tested programs. This means that each \n     applicant must have an interview with a caseworker who will \n     verify citizenship status and check valid documentation \n     (e.g., birth certificate, passport, etc.). We do not believe \n     that a written attestation of citizenship will be sufficient \n     because any applicant for assistance could claim citizenship \n     status, even illegal immigrants. Federal means-tested \n     programs that do not have an intake process and an \n     eligibility determination system in place will have to create \n     them to provide a credible verification of citizenship \n     status. We believe that creating these systems and hiring \n     staff to administer them will be very costly (see #1 below).\n       After establishing who the noncitizens are, the caseworker \n     must use the System of Alien Verification of Eligibility \n     (SAVE) secondary verification process to determine which \n     noncitizens have sponsors. As with the citizenship \n     verification, we believe that requiring a written attestation \n     of sponsorship status is not credible because of the enormous \n     loophole in creates. At this time the SAVE secondary \n     verification process is the only credible way to verify \n     sponsorship status. With extensive training, caseworkers may \n     be able to identify as many as \\1/3\\ of all noncitizen \n     applicants who would not have sponsors without accessing SAVE \n     through secondary verification. Therefore, we estimate that \n     \\2/3\\ of all noncitizen applicants will need to be checked \n     for sponsorship through the SAVE secondary verification \n     process.\n       States and localities report that it currently takes INS an \n     average of 3.5 weeks to respond through secondary \n     verification on sponsorship requests for the three programs \n     that deem. We would expect this time lag to increase as more \n     programs deem (whether it be the 10 that meet S.1 criteria or \n     the 50-odd possible means-tested programs) and SAVE's \n     secondary verification process is overwhelmed. This may \n     conflict with federal application processing requirements \n     leading to difficulties with audits and quality control \n     sanctions, especially in programs like AFDC, Medicaid, Foster \n     Care and IV-D Child Support.\n       After INS informs the caseworkers about sponsorship, \n     caseworkers must calculate deemed income. State and local \n     administrative staff will have to be trained to verify \n     citizenship, identify immigration documents, use the SAVE \n     secondary verification process, calculate deemed income and \n     understand deeming exceptions to make this process workable \n     and credible. In addition to infrastructure and training \n     costs, states and localities will also experience on-going \n     implementation costs associated with the staff time needed to \n     access SAVE and make the complicated deeming calculation.\n       For more information please contact Jon Dunlap, or Sheri \n     Steisel, in NCSL's Washington, DC office.\n\n\nI. Selected Federal Means-Tested Programs Affected by Deeming Unfunded \n                           Mandate in S. 269:\n\n       No Intake Process and No Current Deeming Requirement: \n     School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Food \n     Program, Vocational Rehabilitation, Title XX Social Services \n     Block Grant.\n       No Current Deeming Requirement: Foster Care, IV-A Child \n     Care, IV-D Child Support, Medicare--QMB.\n       Deeming: Food Stamps, AFDC.\n\n\n                           II. Cost Estimate\n\n       We have separated the costs into three parts: (1) capital/\n     infrastructure; (2) staff training; and (3) on-going/\n     implementation.\n       1. Capital and Infrastructure Costs: A citizenship \n     verification must be made for all applicants of all federal \n     means-tested programs. This means that each applicant must \n     have an interview with a caseworker who will verify \n     citizenship status and check valid documentation (e.g., birth \n     certificate, passport, etc.). Federal means-tested programs \n     that do not have an intake process and an eligibility \n     determination system in place will have to create them to \n     provide a credible verification of citizenship status.\n       A. What federal means-tested programs do not have an intake \n     process?\n       1. Examples: School Lunch/Breakfast, Child and Adult Care \n     Food, Title XX, Voc. Rehab.\n       B. What is the cost for creating an intake process?\n       1. Number of programs needing intake process = 4.\n       2. Number of new staff/program needed to admin. new intake \n     processes:\n       a. School Lunch-Breakfast = 1 staff/school district 14,881 \n     school districts = 14,881 staff (American School Food Service \n     Association).\n       b. Adult and Child Care Food = 1 staff/county x 3,042 \n     counties = 3,042 staff.\n       c. Title XX SSBG = 1 staff/county 3,042 counties = 3,042 \n     staff.\n       d. Vocational Rehabilitation = 1 staff/county 3,042 \n     counties = 3,042 staff.\n       3. Total number of new staff to create new intake processes \n     = 24,007 staff.\n       4. Average annual salary of new staff = $30,000/staff/year \n     (National Eligibility Workers Association and National \n     Association of Social Workers).\n       5. Total cost of new staff = 24,007 new staff $30,000 avg. \n     staff salary = $720.21 million.\n       6. Creating or updating eligibility manual (including \n     pictures of acceptable documentation) and reprogramming \n     computers = $2 million (this could be higher, we are checking \n     with state welfare agencies)\n       Subtotals: New Staff = $720.21 million, Other Costs = $2.0 \n     million, Federal Administration Contribution = $0 (None of \n     these programs would be federal admin. funds).\n       Total: $722.21 - $0 (Fed Share) = $722.21 million.\n       2. Staff Training for Immigration Verification, SAVE and \n     Deeming Administration: After establishing who the \n     noncitizens are, the caseworker must use the System of Alien \n     Verification of Eligibility (SAVE) secondary verification \n     process to determine which noncitizens have sponsors. With \n     extensive training, caseworkers may be able to identify as \n     many as \\1/3\\ of all noncitizen applicants who would not have \n     sponsors without accessing SAVE through secondary \n     verification. Therefore, we estimate that \\2/3\\ of all \n     noncitizen applicants must be checked for sponsorship through \n     the SAVE secondary verification process. When INS informs the \n     caseworkers about sponsorship, caseworkers must calculate \n     deemed income. State and local administrative staff will have \n     to be trained to verify citizenship, identify immigration \n     documents, use the SAVE secondary verification process, \n     calculate deemed income and understand deeming exceptions.\n       A. Staff time costs: 1 day training at $15.00/hour8 \n     hours=$120.00/day/person.\n       B. Trainer's costs: $1200/training session (Center for the \n     Development of Human Services--NY).\n       C. Number of people needing training:\n       1. school lunch-breakfast=14,881 staff.\n       2. child and adult care food=3,042 staff.\n       3. Title XX=3,042 staff.\n       4. Vocational Rehabilitation=3,042 staff.\n       5. IV-E Foster Care=3,042 staff.\n       6. Medicare QMB=3,042 staff.\n       7. IV-A Child Care=3,042 staff.\n       8. IV-D Child Support=3,042 staff.\n       Total=36,175 staff.\n       D. Number of people trained per session=35 (Ctr. for Dev. \n     of Human Services--NY).\n       F. Total number of training sessions: 36,175 staff/35=1,033 \n     sessions.\n       G. Total cost/session=$1,200 trainer+($120/person35 \n     attendees=$4,200 staff time/session)=$5,400.\n       Subtotal: Total cost of start-up training=$5,400 (cost/\n     session)1033 (number of sessions)=$5.58 million Total Federal \n     Administration Contribution=$1.8 million (30% Federal \n     reimbursement after accounting for average of 50% federal \n     administrative reimbursement for most programs but no federal \n     assistance for the large nutrition programs such as school \n     lunch/breakfast and child and adult care food admin. cost).\n       Total: $5.58 million-$1.8 million (Fed Share)=$3.78 \n     million.\n       3. On-Going Implementation Costs: After consulting with a \n     range of state and local officials, including LA County, \n     Colorado, New York, Rhode Island, Iowa, West Virginia, \n     Virginia, Minnesota, and Texas, we believe that the on-going \n     implementation of deeming will be cost prohibitive. According \n     to the 1994 Census, 15 million noncitizens reside in the U.S. \n     After consulting with the INS and the urban Institute, we \n     estimate the approximately 10%, or 1.5 million, will apply \n     for a federal means-tested program each year. This percentage \n     would be even higher if we used research from George Borjas, \n     a well-known immigration demographer, who estimates immigrant \n     public assistance use at closer to 20%. Many noncitizens will \n     apply for multiple programs or apply for a single program \n     multiple times. We are unsure about how to account for the \n     number of noncitizens who might file multiple applications. \n     Because no comprehensive information system exists to record \n     and unify data on all federal means-tested programs, each \n     application will require a separate verification and inquiry \n     of the SAVE secondary verification system. After consulting \n     with Los Angeles County, we multiply the number of\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\n     applicants by a factor of 1.5 to account for additional \n     procedures resulting from multiple applications. After \n     consulting with the INS, we estimate that if caseworkers \n     receive extensive training in reading immigration documents, \n     they will be able to vet up to \\1/3\\ of all noncitizen \n     applications. The remaining applications will have to be \n     referred to the SAVE secondary verification process. We \n     estimate that 50% of all secondary SAVE inquiries will \n     require a deeming procedure (Congressional Research Service). \n     We divide the total number of SAVE inquiries in half to bet \n     the total number of deeming procedures per year.\n       A. Total number of noncitizens applying for selected \n     federal means-tested programs per year = # SAVE 2nd \n     verifications inquiries to be scored by CBO: 15 million non-\n     citizens in U.S. (census 1994)--10% (1.5 million) apply for \n     one of the selected federal means-tested programs--we use a \n     1.5 multiplier for selected federal means-tested programs \n     (1.5 million 1.5 multiplier = 2.25 million applications)--\n     One-third of applications can be vetted through immigration \n     document checking (2.25 mil - 742,500 = 1.49 million) = 1.49 \n     million SAVE inquiries per year for the selected federal \n     means-tested programs.\n       B. Total number of deeming procedures/year = 1.49 million \n     2nd SAVE inquiries .5 for noncitizens without sponsors = \n     742,500 deeming procedures/year for selected programs.\n       C. Average cost per inquiry of SAVE 2nd verification (staff \n     time, costs for accessing save):\n       1. 30 min. of staff time per 2nd verification inquiry at \n     $15.00/hour = $7.50/inquiry of staff time (HHS Office of \n     Inspector General).\n       2. Other costs for accessing SAVE might include phone, \n     copying, mailing, etc. = $1 million.\n       D. Average additional cost of administering deeming \n     procedures (reinterview, calculation, exemptions).\n       1. 1.5 hours staff time/deeming procedure at $15.00/hour = \n     $22.50/deeming procedure (National Eligibility Workers \n     Association survey).\n       E. On-going training costs:\n       1. Avg. annual turnover of caseworker staff = 10% (National \n     Association of Social Workers).\n       2. Number of new staff/year = 36,175 staff 10% turnover = \n     3,617 new staff/year.\n       3. Number of new training sessions/year = 3,617 new staff/\n     35 per session = 103 sessions/year.\n       4. Total cost of on-gong training/year = 103 sessions \n     $4,500/session = 556,200/year.\n       Subtotals: SAVE inquiry costs = $7.50/per inquiry 1.49 \n     inquiries = $11.18 million. Other ongoing admin. costs = $1.0 \n     million. Deeming staff costs = $22.50/per deeming procedure \n     742,500 procedures = $16.71 million. On-going training cost = \n     $556,200.\n       Federal Administrative contribution: $8.84 million (30% \n     Federal reimbursement after accounting for average of 50% \n     federal administrative reimbursement for most programs but no \n     federal assistance for the large nutrition programs such as \n     school lunch/breakfast and child and adult care food admin. \n     costs).\n       Net Total: $29.45 million (On-going cost) - $8.84 million \n     (Fed Share) = $17.67 million.\n       Estimated total net Capital/Infrastructure cost: $722.21 \n     million.\n       Estimated total net training cost: $3.78 million.\n       Estimated total net on-going implementation cost: $17.67 \n     million.\n       Estimated total net cost: $722.21 million + $3.78 million + \n     $17.67 million = $743.66 million.\n\n\n                iv. other federal means-tested programs\n\n       Medical Benefits: Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health \n     Services Block Grant, Migrant Health Centers, Community \n     Health Services, Title XX Family Planning Services.\n       Cash Benefits: SSI-Supplement, Adoption Assistance, \n     Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first compliment my colleague and \nfriend from Florida for his very fine statement, particularly in regard \nto his recitation of the unfunded mandates that are in this bill. I \nhave several of the same concerns that he does.\n  We have an employer verification system here that is going to cost \nmoney. It is going to cost money for employers. It is going to cost \nmoney for States and local communities.\n  I have other serious concerns about this employer verification system \nas well.\n  My colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, will be offering later \nin this debate an amendment dealing with that employer verification \nproblem that is in the bill. My friend from Florida has also pointed \nout another, I think, very important problem, a huge unfunded mandate; \nthat is, the birth certificate changes that are required in this bill.\n  I think it is going to come as a shock, when we get into this debate, \nto my colleagues and to the American people to find that under the \nterms of this bill the birth certificates that every American has are \nstill going to be valid after the bill passes. They just will not be \nable to use them much for anything. You are going to have to go back to \nthe place where the birth took place and get a new birth certificate if \nyou want to get a passport or if you want to use it for other official \nbusiness. It is just going to be absolutely a total nightmare.\n  Now is not the time to get into this in detail, but I will be \noffering an amendment at the appropriate time to strike that provision \nbecause it would be very, very ironic that a U.S. Congress that has put \nitself on the block and said finally we are going to heed what local \nelected officials are telling us, finally we are going to listen, \nfinally we passed this unfunded mandate bill saying we are not going to \ndo this anymore, or at least, if we do, we are going to recognize that \nwe are doing it and admit that we are doing it--it would be the height \nof irony if this Congress which said that would pass such a huge \nunfunded mandate that my colleague from Florida has pointed out is \nabsolutely huge.\n  Imagine telling everybody in this country that your birth certificate \nis still valid technically but you just cannot use it for much of \nanything. Imagine the cost to the counties, or whatever local \njurisdiction you have in your home State that issues birth \ncertificates, when people start flocking back and going home to get \nthese new birth certificates issued to qualify. The only way they \nqualify is if some Federal bureaucrat in Washington, DC, says, ``Well, \nyes, that is OK. That type of format is OK. The paper is OK. The format \nis OK. The information is OK. Yes, you can use that type of birth \ncertificate.'' A huge unfunded mandate that is absolutely crazy.\n  I think when my colleagues look at this issue and we get into the \ndebate about the cost of this, people are going to really be shocked.\n  Let me turn, if I could, Mr. President, to what I understand is the \npending business; that is, the Simpson amendment that deals with open \nfield searches.\n  Let me just bring my colleagues up to date, or kind of capsulize \nexactly where we are on this issue. This issue was looked at by the \nJudiciary Committee. In fact, by a vote of 12 to 5, Senator Simpson's \nposition was rejected. The position that he has taken and the position \nthat this amendment would take would be to reverse--let me say that \nagain--reverse a very delicate compromise that was reached in 1986 in \nthe Simpson-Mazzoli bill in regard to open field searches.\n  Let me go back and review very quickly some of the history behind \nthis. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court said that a search warrant was \nnot required for open field searches but in its opinion invited \nCongress to look at the issue and to take action in this regard.\n  In 1986, some 2 years later, when we looked at this whole issue of \nillegal immigration, Congress did speak, and it was an integral part of \nthat compromise. A very delicate compromise was worked out when I was \nin the House of Representatives. Senator Simpson was the leader here in \nthe Senate. That compromise provided that, for an open field search, a \nsearch warrant would, in fact, be required. So, if we accept the \nSimpson amendment, it really is a rejection of a compromise that was \nmade in 1986.\n  The bill, Mr. President, as it currently stands on the Senate floor \nwith the vote by the Judiciary Committee--a 12 to 5 vote to reject the \nSimpson position on open field searches--the current bill is the status \nquo. The current\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\nbill is where the law is today. I want to emphasize that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the merits of this issue. The current \nlaw is that the INS has to get permission to conduct a search in an \nopen field involving agricultural workers. That is the same situation \nthat exists today if the INS wants to go into a restaurant or wants to \ngo into some other building and conduct a search. If they want to \nconduct a search, under current law, they can get permission, which \noftentimes is granted; but if they cannot get permission, then current \nlaw treats all employers and all employees equally in this regard. The \nINS has to go in and get a search warrant, if they do not get \npermission. That is true whether they are dealing with a building or \nwhether they are dealing with work that is taking place on a farm or a \nranch.\n  To change this, as the Simpson amendment would do--first of all, \nthere is no compelling reason to do it. In fact, there is no reason to \ndo it at all.\n  In fact, there is no reason to do it at all, if you ask the INS. They \nare the ones enforcing it. They are the ones who have the duty imposed \nby Congress to get the search warrant.\n  What the INS says is we do not need to change the law. They are not \nhere asking for the change. We do not need the change in the law is \nwhat the INS says. They are the ones who in a sense we have been \nrestricting.\n  Second, a change in the law, which adoption of the Simpson amendment \nwould be, puts a burden on farmers, and, yes, on ranchers. I do not \nhave to remind anyone in this body who has a farmer or a rancher in \ntheir State--and that includes every State I guess--how time sensitive \nthe harvest of any crop is.\n  I experienced this in my home county. My family ran a seed business \nfor many years. And when it came time to harvest the wheat, they \nharvested the wheat. You had a fine window in there to get it done. If \nyou did not do it at the time to do it, you might lose the crop. It \nmight rain; you might have problems. The same is true for any \nperishable crop--tremendous disruption of going in and conducting these \nsearches without a search warrant. That is one of the compelling \nreasons that this was such an important part of the compromise that was \nreached in 1986 in the Simpson-Mazzoli bill.\n  In addition to the burden that this amendment would place on \nemployers, equally important, and maybe even more important, is the \nburden it is going to place on employees.\n  Open fields. Let us think of the real world. Let us think of the real \nworld. INS would drive by and look at this open field. Where are they \ngoing to go? It is not unreasonable to think that there is certainly a \ndistinct possibility, however well intentioned people who work at INS \nare, that they are going to go where they see people look a little \ndifferent than the vast majority of Americans, or at least the vast \nmajority of people in most parts of the country, that they are going to \ngo where maybe someone's skin is a little browner. They are going to go \nwhere they have some suspicions.\n  I think that is wrong. I think they should be held to the same \nstandard they have been held to for the last decade under the Simpson-\nMazzoli compromise, and that is they have to get a search warrant. It \nis not too burdensome.\n  Again, I think it is important that all employers be treated equally \nand all employees be treated equally. The situation has to be dealt \nwith in the same sense, and that is true of the status quo, and that \nwill be changed if the Simpson amendment today is adopted.\n  What was the background of this? What led to people looking at this \nand saying, ``Hey, there is a problem.'' It is my understanding that \nbefore the 1986 act was passed, 15 percent of the illegal immigration \nproblem in the work force was in agriculture and yet 75 percent of all \nsearches, all the raids occurred in agriculture. That is no \ncoincidence. They went where it was easier. They went where they could \nsee into the open fields. I would submit they sometimes may have gone \nwhere somebody's skin was brown or somebody looked a little different, \nlooking at that as a good prospect. I think it is wrong to change that \nlaw.\n\n  We are going to hear the argument in the Chamber that the only law \nenforcement agency that is required to have a search warrant in an open \nfield situation is the INS. Yes, that is technically true. To state \nthat is to state the obvious, but it is also looking at it from a very \nsimplistic point of view. Those of us who have been involved in law \nenforcement know that searches by law enforcement agencies that are \nlooking at what we consider to be crimes historically--rape, murder, \ntheft--they are not just going and looking at fields and walking into \nthose fields because they see who is working there. That just is not \nthe way it works. There is a normal progression of the research that \nhas to be done, the evidence that has to be presented, even if the \nplain view doctrine to go onto a field does in fact apply, which I \nthink it does. That is frankly the argument that proponents might make, \ncomparing apples and oranges--just a totally different situation.\n  Senator Hatch received a letter on March 13, and this letter is \nsigned by a number of groups in this country that oppose the Simpson \nposition. Let me read the names of these groups and then let me take a \nbrief excerpt from the letter itself.\n  Groups that oppose this amendment include the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, Agricultural Affiliates, American Association of \nNurserymen, American Sheep Industry Association, California Farm Bureau \nFederation, Florida Strawberry Growers Association, Florida Fruit and \nVegetable Association, Illinois Specialty Growers Association, Michigan \nFarm Bureau, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Council of \nFarmer Cooperatives, Northern Christmas Trees and Nursery, Northwest \nHorticultural Council, Society of American Florists, Sun-Maid Growers \nof California, Texas Produce Association, United Fresh Fruit and \nVegetable Association, Ventura County Agricultural Association, \nVirginia State Horticultural Society, Wasco County Fruit Produce \nLeague, Washington Growers Clearinghouse, Western Growers Association, \nWisconsin Christmas Tree Producers' Association, and Wisconsin Nursery \nAssociation.\n\n  Let me point out that this letter, dated March 13, obviously did not \nhave to do with this specific amendment. What it did have to do with is \nthe same identical subject. Let me quote from this letter. This letter \nwas signed by the groups that I just read. This is paragraph 2.\n\n       S. 269 also proposes to repeal the open agricultural field \n     search warrant requirement enacted as part of the Immigration \n     Reform and Control Act of 1986. This provision requires \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to obtain the \n     permission of the property owner prior to entering the \n     property searching for illegal aliens, or to obtain a search \n     warrant. This is the same procedure required of INS searching \n     for illegal aliens in any other workplace, such as factories, \n     restaurants, and retail establishments enclosed by buildings \n     or other structures. This provision of current law affords \n     growers the same protections from warrantless searches and \n     unreasonable disruption of business activity enjoyed by any \n     other businesses with walls and doors.\n\n  The fourth paragraph reads in part as follows, again the same letter \nsigned by the same groups:\n\n       Prior to enactment of the open agricultural field search \n     warrant requirement, INS was accused in several instances of \n     unlawful detention of America's citizens and legal permanent \n     resident aliens, damage to crops and property, violations of \n     property rights, and injuries to agricultural workers fleeing \n     INS searches. We believe the requirement that INS obtain \n     either property owner permission or a search warrant prior to \n     conducting a search for illegal aliens has fostered \n     cooperation between INS and growers, and has reduced property \n     damage, crop losses and farmworker injuries.\n\n  Again I would point out in light of this statement that I just read, \nthat is INS' position in the sense that they are not asking for a \nchange in the law.\n  Let me also cite, if I could, Mr. President, a letter from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation--actually not a letter but a statement \nthat was put out. I have no date on this but it was within the last \nmonth. Let me just read a portion of this:\n\n       Farm Bureau has been very active in lobbying Capitol Hill \n     to seek retention of the open-field search warrant provision \n     enacted as part of the 1986 Immigration Reform bill. The \n     provision of S. 269 repealing the open-field search warrant \n     requirement has received no examination in public hearings, \n     despite the fact that it reverses policy adopted by clear \n     majorities of both Houses of Congress during the 1986 reform \n     debate.\n\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\n\n  Continuing the quote now:\n\n       Congress enacted the so-called open-field search warrant \n     requirement as a part of the 1986 immigration reform bill in \n     response to concerns among the agriculture community that \n     farmers were treated differently by Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service as a result of the nature of their \n     business; that it is conducted outdoors rather than indoors \n     and it thus had been more vulnerable to abusive searches.\n\n  That is a partial quote from the letter.\n  Let me also point out what the INS can do today, again under the \ncurrent status of the law, again under the 1986 compromise, the \nSimpson-Mazzoli compromise.\n  They can go in property in hot pursuit. They can do that today. We do \nnot need to change the law today to do that. They can do that hot \npursuit. Further, they do not need a search warrant if the land is \nlocated within 25 miles of the border. So, again, two of the problems, \nor what you might think would be serious problems, have been dealt with \nand were dealt with in 1986.\n  Finally, of course, to again restate the obvious, if permission is \ngranted, consent is given, they can go on right now.\n  So let me state I think this is an important issue. The Simpson \namendment changes the status quo. I see my friend is on the floor and \nmay at this point or later want to respond. But I think the status quo \nis correct. The Judiciary Committee voted by a 12-to-5 vote to keep the \nstatus quo. The INS does not see a reason to change the law, and \ntherefore I ask my colleagues to vote against the Simpson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nlegislation before us. Before I do, let me just say a word or two about \nthe comments about the minimum wage. I am pleased that that issue is \nbeing discussed at this time. I am pleased to see the reemergence of \nsome bipartisan support for an increase in the minimum wage. I think \nthe time is now. Whether it be on this piece of legislation with a \nlimited time agreement or some other piece of legislation in the near \nfuture, I think it is something we ought to take up now rather than \nwait until later. It is at least of as great importance as the matter \nbefore us today.\n  But I do rise in opposition to this bill. I fear this legislation not \nonly embraces the wrong approach to curbing illegal immigration, but I \nthink it contradicts past efforts to reform the Federal regulatory \nframework and to prevent the Congress from passing unfunded Federal \nmandates that will needlessly burden employers and local governments \nalike.\n  In 1994, we witnessed a very emotional and pointed debate in \nCalifornia over a ballot issue that we have all come to know and \ndescribe as proposition 187. That debate, which evolved into a \nrhetorical backlash against both legal and illegal immigrants, clearly \ndemonstrated that the issue of immigration has the very strong \npotential to further divide and alienate those in our communities who \nare now faced, even more than at any time in the past, with the daily \nanxieties of economic insecurity and social instability.\n\n  During the extensive consideration of this legislation in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I did oppose certain efforts to curtail legal \nimmigration, whether it was an effort to prevent families from \nreuniting with loved ones or an effort to place additional hurdles \nbefore persons who are fleeing persecution in their home countries and \nhave a legitimate right to ask for asylum. As I indicated then, my \nstrong support for preserving ample levels of legal immigration does \nnot compromise in any way my feeling, and the feeling I think of every \nMember of this body, that we do need to take bold and aggressive steps \nto curtail illegal immigration.\n  I do believe there are reforms that are responsible and reasonable, \nand that we should make every effort to pursue on this bill. For \nexample, the bill authorizes the hiring of over 4,500 new Border Patrol \nagents over the course of the next 5 years. This massive increase in \npersonnel will nearly double the existing number of Border Patrol \nagents under the jurisdiction of the INS.\n  I was also, therefore, pleased that an amendment I offered in \ncommittee was adopted by the committee, which provides that these many \nnew personnel will be hired and adequately trained, pursuant to \nappropriate standards of law enforcement.\n  I am also strongly supportive of provisions in S. 269, offered by \nSenator Kennedy, to enhance the penalties for virtually all forms of \nalien smuggling and document fraud, as well as related offenses.\n  Additionally, these provisions provide stiff penalties for those \nindividuals who operate sweatshops which force people, many in this \ncountry illegally, to work in often inhumane conditions for minimal \ncompensation. Like these new enforcement personnel and alien smuggling \npenalties, it is critical that any measure we consider to curtail \nillegal immigration be targeted against those who are actually breaking \nour laws.\n  Nothing stands in more stark contrast to this sort of targeted \napproach than what I believe to be the single most troubling component \nof this legislation and that is the creation of a new, costly and \nmassive worker verification demonstration project which is intended by \nthe proponents, I believe, to lead to a nationwide verification system \nwithin a few years.\n  The worker verification proposal contained in this legislation, and \nthe worker verification concept itself, is not a targeted approach to \nconfronting the problem of illegal immigration. Instead, it is an \napproach which seeks to deputize thousands of business owners and \nfarmers and other entrepreneurs, and virtually turn our Nation's \nworkplaces into some kind of internal border patrol, mini-INS's, if you \nwill. These employers are then charged with the responsibility of \nnavigating a complex new electronic verification system in an effort to \nroot illegal immigrants out from a massive American work force.\n\n  I find it shortsighted and untenable to suggest that we cannot combat \nillegal immigration without requiring every person in America to have \nhis or her identity checked by a Federal data base each time each \nperson in this country applies for a job or for Government assistance. \nDespite good-faith efforts by the proponents of this provision to try \nto build in adequate privacy protections, the fact remains that every \ntime an American applies for a job he or she will be stepping into a \ncivil liberties minefield, if this system develops as I am concerned \nthe authors intend.\n  Who in our society will be required to have their identities \nverified? Potentially everyone. It could be the 40-year-old father of \nfour, applying for an executive position with a Fortune 500 company. It \ncould be a 20-year-old college student applying for student aid. If I \nam reading this bill correctly, even a 12-year-old paper boy could have \nto have his identity verified by a Washington official before he could \nbe hired to deliver newspapers. That, I am afraid, is the practical \neffect of a national worker verification system. It is light-years away \nfrom a targeted approach. And it is based on the proposition that it is \nperfectly appropriate to have ID checks potentially required from 98 \npercent of our population, that which consists of U.S. citizens and \nlegal immigrants, in order to root out the 2 percent of our population \nthat is here illegally.\n  During judiciary hearing consideration of this bill, the junior \nSenator from Michigan and I offered a bipartisan amendment to strike \nthe worker verification concept from this legislation and replace it \nwith stronger enforcement and penalties for those who break the law by \noverstaying their legal visas. Although the committee accepted these \nnew provisions relating to visa overstayers, our amendment to strike \nworker verification proposals lost on a tie 9 to 9 vote.\n  The original nationwide system was later replaced by the so-called \ndemonstration projects. But make no mistake, Mr. President, the \nfundamental flaws contained in the original proposal remain. Only now \nwe will go through a somewhat longer process before it is actually \nimposed nationwide on all Americans.\n  Senator Abraham and I will offer an amendment later on during this \ndebate to strike those demonstration projects and programs and will \nspeak more on this at another time. But it is strangely ironic, Mr. \nPresident, that some of the same Senators who stood here on the Senate \nfloor a year ago and cried\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\nout for meaningful regulatory reform legislation now are some of the \nstrongest advocates for a massive national worker verification system \nand that somehow that is an appropriate solution for our illegal \nimmigration problems.\n  Another provision of this legislation that is troubling to me relates \nto birth certificates and driver's licenses. The bill currently \nrequires all Government agencies to begin issuing uniform Federal birth \ncertificates based on standards developed here in Washington, DC. \nMoreover, no Government agency may accept for official purposes a birth \ncertificate or driver's license that does not meet the Federal \nguidelines established in this and presumably future legislation.\n  Originally, this provision required agencies to collect fingerprints \nor other biometric data. The Department of Justice referred to these \nfingerprinted birth certificates as ``de facto national identification \ndocuments.''\n  Thankfully, we were able to delete the fingerprinting requirement in \nthe Judiciary Committee, but I think it demonstrates the steps that \nsome are willing to take in this area. I do not believe for 1 minute \nthat we have seen the last of this fingerprinting idea. Even without \nthe fingerprints, I think this provision is still distressing. For \nexample, the bill language requires every State department of motor \nvehicles to begin issuing driver's licenses with safety features as \nprescribed by a Federal regulatory agency. This language also states \nthat anyone applying for a driver's license must present certain \ninformation as designated by the National Department of Transportation \nto establish their identity.\n\n  So, if the Department of Transportation elects to promulgate a \nregulation next year requiring every State department of motor vehicles \nto begin collecting fingerprints, it would be legal under this \nlegislation. So we see the fingerprints very easily coming back in, \ndespite our efforts in the committee, through another route. Moreover, \nthis section seems to ignore one of the 104th Congress' few bipartisan \nsuccesses so far, the enactment of legislation to stop the Federal \nGovernment from passing unfunded mandates on to local and State \ngovernment agencies.\n  I think the Chair and I both know that one of the most consistent \nthemes you hear in our home States is that they did not want new \nunfunded mandates.\n  I recently received a letter from the Wisconsin Department of \nTransportation outlining their very justifiable concerns with these \nbirth certificate and driver's license provisions. They are concerned, \nof course, with the cost that they will incur as a result of this new \nFederal mandate. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has \nestimated these provisions could cost my State alone up to $3 million \nto comply with requirements relating to a specific Federal format for \nthese documents and antifraud security features, not to mention Federal \nverification of all birth certificates and driver's licenses.\n  This letter states that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation \n``views this bill as yet another unfunded Federal mandate. The costs \nassociated with it are substantial.''\n  The letter also points out that this State agency has had its \noperating budget reduced by 6 percent by the Wisconsin State \nlegislature and Governor and would have no means, Mr. President, no way \nby which to pick up these additional costs that this new Federal \nmandate would impose.\n  Mr. President, that is why I and the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, and others view this provision as completely contrary to the \nletter and the spirit of the unfunded mandates legislation passed by \nthis body just over a year ago and signed into law by President \nClinton.\n  There is not a word in this bill, Mr. President, about how the local \nand State agencies are to pay for this costly new procedure of issuing \nuniform Federal birth certificates and driver's licenses, even though \nit is plainly obvious that such a process is going to be an enormous \nfinancial burden on such entities.\n  Mr. President, let me also take this opportunity to express my \nconcerns about provisions in the legal immigration bill that are likely \nto surface in the near future. Although the Judiciary Committee, on a \nstrong vote, split the two bills, split the legal and illegal \nimmigration bills, there may well be another attempt to put these \nprovisions back in this bill. I hope not, because these are very \ndifferent issues.\n\n  In committee, Mr. President, I was a cosponsor of the Kennedy-Abraham \namendment to restore adequate levels of family immigration because I \nconsider it to be essential to allow U.S. citizens to reunite with \ntheir children, their parents, and other loved ones who may be residing \nin other countries.\n  There may be some abuse of our current family immigration system, but \nthat does not mean we should completely prohibit a U.S. citizen from \nreuniting with their 22-year-old daughter, their 66-year-old parent, or \ntheir 15-year-old brother. Those were in fact the so-called reforms \nthat were included in the original Simpson legislation and later \nexpunged from the bill during committee markup.\n  Considering the House voted decisively to remove all cutbacks of \nlegal immigration from their bill, it is my hope that we have seen the \nlast of efforts to further restrict family immigration.\n  Mr. President, I also have serious concerns with the provisions in \nthe legal immigration bill relating to persons seeking asylum in this \ncountry.\n  Originally the bill required anyone seeking asylum to do so within 30 \ndays of entering the United States or their claims would be invalid. I \njoined the junior Senator from Ohio and others in fighting this 30-day \ntime limit because it was harsh, it was arbitrary, and would have \nlikely had disastrous consequences for thousands of persons who have, \nin most cases, fled their homelands to escape persecution, torture or \nworse for expressing thoughts and opinions counter to those held by \nthose governments in other lands.\n  We have had, no doubt, serious problems and abuses with our past \nasylum process. Previously, a large number of nonmeritorious claims \nwere filed in an effort to obtain certain benefits that asylum \nclaimants are entitled to, such as automatic work authorization. This \npractice did result in a mammoth backlog of pending applications that \nhave prevented or delayed some very legitimate claims from being \nprocessed in a timely fashion.\n  Unfortunately, though, Mr. President, lost in all the hyperbole about \nthis problem is the fact that the Clinton administration has made \ntremendous progress in clamping down on asylum fraud and abuse. As a \nresult of these new administration reforms, in the past year alone, new \nasylum claims have been cut in half, and INS has more than doubled \ntheir productivity in terms of processing pending claims.\n\n  Mr. President, these promising reforms by the Clinton administration \nare in their infancy, and we should not mandate such a harsh and \narbitrary deadline that is likely to not only be disastrous for \nlegitimate asylum seekers, but also completely unnecessary. During \ncommittee markup, an amendment was adopted that extended the 30-day \ndeadline to 1 year and also provided an exception to this time limit if \nthe applicant had good cause to wait for more than 1 year. I found this \nacceptable because it provided legitimate asylum seekers a waiver if \nthey had justifiable reasons for waiting beyond the 1-year period.\n  Unfortunately, the committee report language is more restrictive with \nrespect to this waiver process than I had anticipated and hoped.\n  Mr. President, America has a proud history of representing a safe \nhaven for those who believe in democracy and who have been tormented \nfor embracing particular political and religious viewpoints. We should \ncontinue to do so. I intend to work with the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, and others in restoring and guaranteeing a fair and suitable \nwaiver process.\n  Mr. President, as we debate this issue over the next few days, we \nmust be mindful of the inherent dangers that this immigration issue \nencompasses. We find ourselves today in the heart of an election year. \nHistory has shown that it is not uncommon for politicians, not only \nhere, but in many countries, to use the issue of immigration to further \ndivide people, in this country to divide Americans along racial, \nethnic, and cultural lines.\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\n  Playing to the fears of the American people on this issue may only \nprovide further ammunition to those who seek to exploit those fears and \ncoax the American people into believing that immigrants come to the \nUnited States only to commit crimes, to collect welfare benefits, and \nto steal jobs away from working Americans. That is an injustice, not \nonly to the immigrants who currently reside in the United States, but \nan injustice as well to the historical legacy of immigrants who came \nhere with purpose and promise and, as we must acknowledge, built this \ngreat Nation.\n  Let me say this at this point. I do not doubt for a minute the \nintentions of the Senator from Wyoming in this regard. In many ways he \nhas been a very important source of not only expertise but moderation \nand thoughtfulness on this issue. I believe he has made a good-faith \neffort to reform a system that is clearly in need of some repair. I do \nregret that I have some fundamental disagreements with respect to how \nwe should address those flaws in the current immigration system.\n  I look forward to working with other Senators in attempts to improve \nthis legislation and passing reforms that truly differentiate between \nthose who play by the rules and those who choose to break them.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to join, first of all, in the \ncomments that Senator Feingold made about Senator Simpson.\n  Our title here is ``United States,'' not Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator from Colorado, Senator from Illinois, Senator from California \nor Wisconsin. Alan Simpson has served the people of Wyoming well. But \nhe has also been a U.S. Senator who has looked at the broad scope of \nthings and has been a real legislator and has contributed immensely.\n  I will differ with him on this particular amendment. Let me add, I \nwill differ with my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, with whom \nI rarely differ, on this matter of pilot verification that he was just \ntalking about.\n  Senator Simpson has reminded us over and over again on the floor that \nwe have to stop the magnet that is the economic pull to people to come \ninto this country illegally. So we passed, a few years ago, employer \nsanctions. It was a matter of controversy. I ended up being a minority \non this side, joining the Senator from Wyoming and voting for that.\n  Employer sanctions have not worked as well as we had hoped. I think \nthe key is verification. Unless we are willing to try a pilot \nverification program, and here is where I differ with my friend from \nWisconsin, I do not think you will have any meaningful way of stopping \na steady flow of people who come up here for economic reasons. To say \nwe are going to just have a slight tap on the wrist to employers and \ntell people who are desperate, ``We are going to be tougher on you if \nyou come up here and try to work,'' they will still come up here and \ntry to work.\n  I point out one other reason on the verification, and that is the GAO \nreport that says there is discrimination. If you appear to be Hispanic \nor Polish or Asian, and particularly if you speak with a bit of an \naccent, it is inevitable, unless we have some system of verification, \nthat there is going to be discrimination. I think it is important, and \nI think we will have a close vote on this, but I think it is important \nthat we have a pilot verification program.\n  The question on this immediate amendment is, is it worthwhile to give \nup some basic liberties in order to have this amendment, and are we \ngoing to accomplish that much? I think we will not accomplish very, \nvery much at all in terms of discouraging the employment of illegal \nworkers here. I think it is one more step in taking away basic civil \nliberties.\n\n  The reason this passed originally, we had a lot of problems with \npeople who would be driving down the highway, and all of a sudden they \nlook at a field and it looks like there are a bunch of ``foreign-\nlooking workers there.'' They stop, go out, and make a raid.\n  We have a tradition in our country with the fourth amendment you have \nto go into court in order to have a search. We ought to abide by that. \nNow, the argument is made, well, you can have that search. You can go \ninto court. How many farmers are going to go into court? It just is not \ngoing to happen. It makes it very costly.\n  Second, whenever you give people in any field arbitrary power, \nwhether it is law enforcement or anything else, there is an invitation \nto corruption. I think we have to recognize that. This can be a \nshakedown kind of thing.\n  My staff has given me two examples of the kind of abuses that take \nplace when you do not go in to court. As far as I know, and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming can correct me, as far as I know, there have been no \ndenials for any Immigration Service requests to have a search of the \nfield by the courts. Maybe they have existed--I do not know. In Pasco, \nWA, INS agents entered a field for 29 straight days searching for \nundocumented workers. On some occasions the agents drove their trucks \nacross the bean fields, causing substantial damage to the bean crop. \nThe latter part of that is not that significant, but if you want to go \n29 straight days to search somebody's field, you ought to go into court \n29 straight days to get a court OK for doing that.\n  In Othello, WA, INS agents entered a farm four times in 1 month \nlooking for undocumented workers. Their last three trips were without a \nwarrant, and they found no undocumented workers. They arrested two \nworkers who were Japanese, but it turned out they were exchange \nstudents who had a lawful right to be in this country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have been here, now, 22 years in the House \nand the Senate. We always find some excuse for giving up basic civil \nliberties. I think we ought to be very, very careful on this. If there \nis an overwhelming reason to have an infringement on the fourth \namendment that is kind of gray, maybe we should consider it. It ought \nto be an overwhelming reason. This is not an overwhelming reason to \nviolate that basic constitutional protection.\n  My hope is the amendment will be defeated. My vote, with all due \nrespect to my friend from Wyoming, will be in opposition to his \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I \njoin with those in thanking the distinguished chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from \nWyoming, for what is extraordinarily thankless on a subject that \nperhaps has more controversy than almost any other I have seen since I \nhave been in the U.S. Senate.\n  I will give my views on the bill that is now before us, the \nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1996. I come, obviously, along with \nmy colleague, Senator Boxer, from the State most heavily impacted by \nillegal immigration in the Nation. The presentation of the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service to the Judiciary Committee showed that \nCalifornia is on a tier all by itself. The estimates on numbers vary, \nbut they go anywhere from 1.6 million to 2 million, 3 million, and even \n4 million people in our State illegally, depending upon whom one \nchooses to believe. Most authorities agree that the right number is in \nthe vicinity of 2 million people in California illegally right now.\n  One concern is overriding--that illegal immigration is a serious \nproblem. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment, not the States, to prevent it. Californians went to the \nballot and overwhelmingly approved the most stringent of propositions, \nproposition 187.\n  One part of proposition 187 provided that if a youngster is in this \ncountry illegally, he or she could not go to a public school. A teacher \nwould have to act as an INS agent and ferret out that youngster and \nremove him or her from school. Even more strongly, the people said that \nif the parents are here illegally, that youngster would still be denied \nthe right to a basic elementary school education.\n  The people of California overwhelmingly approved it. I believe one of \nthe reasons they did was out of frustration, because the Federal \nGovernment has not responded to what is an increasing and growing \nproblem.\n  The bill before us today tackles illegal immigration at the border, \nmainly by adding strength to our Border Patrol and border facilities. \nIn the past 3 years, the administration and the Congress, both Houses \nand both parties, have come together, recognizing the\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nneed and beginning to improve border infrastructure, such as lights and \ninfrared-seeing devices, and manpower. And the Border Patrol has, for 3 \nyears in a row, had additions of about 700 agents a year.\n  This legislation would add an additional 700 Border Patrol agents in \nthe current fiscal year, and 1,000 more for the next 4 years, bringing \nthe total number of agents to 4,700 by the year 1999. That is more than \ndouble the entire force that was in place when I came to the U.S. \nSenate 3 years ago. It would establish a 2-year pilot program for \ninterior repatriation. The reason for that is, people come across, they \nare picked up, they are held for an hour, they are sent back right \nacross the border to Tijuana. Three hours later, they try again, the \nsame thing happens, and they try again and again. The pilot project \nwould try to determine whether people who are repatriated into the \ninterior of the country are less inclined or less able to cross that \nborder again illegally than those not repatriated to the interior of \nthe country.\n  The bill would add 300 full-time INS investigators for the next 3 \nfiscal years to enforce laws against alien smuggling, something that, \ntoday in America, is a $3 billion industry.\n  As a matter of fact, last week, the Justice Department made 23 \narrests in California, which showed that organized gangs from New York \nto California were all participating in the alien smuggling of illegals \nfrom China to the United States in boats, transferring them to fishing \nboats, landing them, providing drop houses, and moving them back to New \nYork.\n  The bill would add alien smuggling and document fraud offenses to the \nlist of predicate acts under our Nation's racketeering laws, something \nmany Federal prosecutors have told me is extremely important.\n  The bill would increase the maximum penalty for involuntary servitude \nto discourage cases like the one we saw recently, where scores of \nillegal workers from Thailand were smuggled into our country, then put \nin an apartment building with a fence around it and forced to work in \nsubhuman conditions against their will in southern California.\n  This bill would strengthen staffing and infrastructure at the border, \nand it would provide for facilities for incarcerating illegal aliens. \nIt would require all land border crossings to be fully staffed to \nfacilitate legal crossing.\n  I can tell you that in San Diego, CA, at the border crossing gates, \nthere are hours of waiting. There are 24 crossing gates at this one \nstation. Only one-half of them are manned. Consequently, people engaged \nin legal, normal commerce sit at that gate and wait, sometimes for many \nhours, backed up in traffic.\n  This bill would increase space at Federal detention facilities to at \nleast 9,000 beds. That is a 66-percent increase in detention capacity \nfor the incarceration of criminal aliens. I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident, out of 120,000 inmates in the California Department of \nCorrections, between 15,000 and 20,000 of them are illegal immigrants, \nserving felony time in California. The cost to the State is literally \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n  The bill would create a demonstration project in Anaheim, CA, to use \nINS personnel to identify illegal immigrants in prison, so that they \ncan be more rapidly deported.\n  Historically, the way Congress has handled illegal immigration is \nthrough what are called employer sanctions. I think the intent--\nalthough I was not here, and the Senator from Wyoming knows far better \nthan I--was that the reason most illegals--and I say ``most''--come \nhere illegally is because of the lure of jobs. That is the magnet. \nTherefore, if you remove this magnet and prevent people from working \nillegally, you will deter illegal immigration.\n  In order to work, though, employer sanctions need an accurate method \nof verifying whether an applicant for a job is legally entitled to \nwork. Up to this point, relying primarily on employer sanctions, the \nbasis on which all illegal immigration is handled in the United States, \nhas been a colossal failure. The reason for the failure is that \nemployers have no reliable way to determine if a prospective employee \nis legally entitled to work.\n  Let me explain why. Presently, if an employer is interviewing someone \nfor a job, he or she might say, ``Can you show me that you are legally \nentitled to work?'' They can present to the employer 29 different \ndocuments, under present law. Under present law, no prospective \nemployer can say, ``May I see your green card?'' That is a violation of \nlaw. So they must take one, two, three or four of the 29 different \nmethods of identification offered.\n  If somebody came in to me and I said, ``Do you have an identification \nto show that you are a resident of California?'' They would say, ``Oh, \nyes,'' and hold up this card. I would see that it is a California \nidentification card, and its address is Interlock, CA, and it has a \nState seal on it. It is encased in plastic, and it looks very legal to \nme. Wrong. This very card is a forgery. Or they might hand me a Social \nSecurity card, and I would look at it and see all the traditional \nsigns. The paper looks right, the color looks right. There is a number \non it and a signature, just like on my own Social Security card. Could \nI trust it? No. This is a forgery.\n  The fact of the matter is that on the streets of Los Angeles, CA, you \ncan buy both of these cards for under $50, and you can get them in 20 \nminutes, and they can have your photograph printed on them. You can \npurchase documents there anywhere from----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I object to this procedure. This is \ntotally out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator has a right to--\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It is a crude exercise, a truly crude exercise.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What is the status of the present situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A cloture motion has been sent to the desk.\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What is the correct procedure? Is that motion \nappropriate in the midst of a singular address, at the time of an \nopening statement with regard to a piece of legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Allow the Chair to consult with the \nParliamentarian.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe I had the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the Senator from California has the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Dorgan \n     amendment No. 3667 regarding Social Security:\n         Byron L. Dorgan, Max Baucus, Daniel P. Moynihan, Barbara \n           A. Mikulski, Tom Daschle, J.J. Exon, Joe Biden, Paul \n           Simon, Joe Lieberman, John F. Kerry, Paul Sarbanes, \n           Fritz Hollings, D.K. Inouye, Wendell Ford, Claiborne \n           Pell, John Glenn, Russell D. Feingold.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before I was interrupted, the point I was trying to \nmake is that no matter how well intended an employer is, it is \nextraordinarily difficult to tell the difference between real documents \nand counterfeit documents, and that is what enables illegal immigrants \nto obtain welfare. They are ineligible for cash welfare programs under \nFederal law now. However, if they have false documents, they can obtain \nthe very things that they are prohibited from obtaining--whether it is \nSocial Security, whether it is SSI, or whether it is AFDC.\n  An entire industry of counterfeit documents has grown up in \nCalifornia. The most frequently counterfeited document is a birth \ncertificate. You can pay anything from $25 for a Social Security card \nto $1,000 or more for a passport, as well as personal identification \ndocuments.\n  These documents are so authentic-looking that employers cannot tell \nthe difference. In fact, it is estimated that tens of thousands of \nillegal immigrants today receive welfare benefits in California by \nusing counterfeit documents.\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\n This bill makes a major effort to reduce this problem. It reduces the \nnumber of acceptable employment verification documents from the current \n29 to 6 so that employers are better able to determine which documents \nare valid. Employers will only have to review 6, not 29.\n  Also, the bill doubles the maximum penalties against employers who \nknowingly hire illegal aliens, increasing them from $2,000 to $4,000 \nfor a first offense with graduated penalties for subsequent offenses. \nTherefore, the bill adds substantial teeth to the employer-sanction \nlaws. It establishes a pilot program to test the verification system \nunder so that employers can readily and accurately determine an \napplicant's eligibility to work.\n  The system could also be used to determine an applicant's eligibility \nfor public benefits, therefore, avoiding welfare fraud. It also attacks \nthe serious problem of document fraud by setting Federal standards for \nmaking key identification documents, birth certificates, and drivers' \nlicenses tamperproof and counterfeit resistant. The result is that the \nmost counterfeited document, a birth certificate, would be \ncounterfeitproof, as would drivers' licenses.\n  The bill before us would increase the criminal penalties for document \nfraud, including raising the maximum fine for fraudulent use of the \nGovernment's seal to $500,000, and increasing the fine for lying on \nimmigration documents to $250,000 and 5 years in prison. The bill also \ndenies the earned-income tax credit to persons here illegally.\n  You might say, is this a strong, tough bill? I would have to say, \nyes. It is a strong, tough bill. Former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan \nand the immigration commission which she chaired said this eloquently. \n``We are a Nation of laws.'' We are also a Nation that has the most \nliberal immigration quotas in the world today. No country absorbs more \nforeign-born people than does the United States of America in the \ncourse of a year.\n  So there is more opportunity for an individual to come to the United \nStates than virtually any other place on Earth. Therefore, because we \nare a Nation of laws and because we have a liberal immigration system, \nit is not unjust, unfair, or unwise to require that we follow our laws \nand make sure that we enforce the prohibition against illegal entry \ninto our country.\n  The largest source of illegal immigration, next to visa overstays, \ncomes from people who slip across our borders. That is what this bill \naddresses. The bill also addresses visa overstays. As many as 700,000 \npeople a year overstay their visas. This bill would require that \nimmigrants who overstay their visas either be deported or be denied \nfuture visas. So there is some visa enforcement in this legislation.\n  The need for the legislation has been and will be explained at length \nover the course of this debate. From the point of view of my State, the \nproblem of illegal immigration is severe. Forty-five percent of the \nNation's illegal immigrants now reside in California. That is between \n1.6 million and 2.3 million, as I mentioned earlier. Fifteen percent of \nillegal aliens are in our State prisons. Forty-five percent, or \n150,000, of all pending asylum applications come from people in \nCalifornia, and 35 percent, or 40,000, of the 113,000 refugees entering \nthe U.S. claimed residency in California in 1993.\n  Our county governments are being forced to absorb more and more of \nthe costs of medical care, social services, and incarceration for \nillegal immigrants, and those costs are going up--not down. In the \n1996-1997 fiscal year, California will spend $454 million in \nincarceration costs for criminal aliens.\n  So it is fair to say that the State most affected by this bill is the \nState of California. This U.S. Senator strongly supports this \nlegislation. The need is very clear.\n  Mr. President, at a later time, I would like to complete this \nstatement, and also at the appropriate time to present a series of \namendments that deal with certain unresolved issues.\n  I have some major concerns about the triple fence in the bill, about \nthe fact that cases brought under the bill be tried in Federal court \nrather than in State court, and that the deportation documents be \nwritten in Spanish as well as in English. I hope I can offer these \namendments at a later time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their patience \nin the procedure intervening there. Without question, I see why you are \nall gathered at the desk for some reason. Yes. Is there something \nsinister going on?\n  Nevertheless, we have a cloture petition which was quite \nsurreptitiously slid to the desk, which was remarkable to watch. I have \nnever seen that in 18 years of my presence here. I have found in my \ntime here that those who remain obsessed about certain aspects of \nlegislation almost always find that that obsessive behavior is often \nvisited subsequently on the perpetrator.\n  That is not my idea. That is just the way that works. It is always a \nmore genial approach. I visited with Senator Dorgan this morning, told \nhim exactly what the lay of the land was and why. I did not receive \nthat same courtesy.\n  Enough of that. We can debate that at any time in the future. It \nseems to me the present status of the issue is with regard to this \namendment on the current ban on open-field searches. That is the \namendment at hand. I would just add one dimension to that, and then I \nthink we are ready to go to a rollcall vote on that, unless there is \nfurther debate. I ask any of those who wish to further debate this \nissue to present themselves.\n  Senator Simon asked a valid question, and I cannot tell you how much \nI have enjoyed working with that gentleman through the years. We met \nwhen we were State legislators in 1971. We kept close ties and worked \ntogether here in a very steady, bipartisan fashion.\n  He asked a question. He wondered if there were denials when INS \nagents sought warrants to search open fields and inquired if I knew of \nany.\n  I do not know of any denials either, but I do know this, that the \nrequiring of agents to prepare an affidavit, find a judge, and get a \nsearch warrant has resulted in a great reduction in immigration \nenforcement in agriculture. That I do know. In fact, it has practically \neliminated employer sanctions enforcement in agriculture. Of course, \nthat was the purpose of it. As I say, it was a rather unholy alliance \nat the time, still perhaps defined as that, when you have the ACLU \njoining with the agricultural growers, who I found to be absolutely \ninsatitable with regard to everything I ever proposed. It is estimated \nnow that 40 percent or more of the field workers in west coast \nagriculture are illegal.\n  Some of my colleagues in the debate have pointed out that although \nprobable cause requires more than mere appearance, immigration officers \nwill search on that basis anyway. I would say, in response to that \nargument, if immigration officers would be willing to ignore the legal \nrequirements for warrantless searches, why do my colleagues believe \nthat these officers follow the current requirements for a warrant? I \nbelieve that we should assume that immigration officers, like other law \nenforcement officers, generally follow the law. Of course, there are \nexceptions. We should try to minimize the number of such exceptions by \nvigorous oversight of INS and disciplinary action against the INS \nofficers who do violate the law.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues the reason the present ban was \nadded to the law in 1986 was that there was no constitutional right at \nall of the type that my friend from Illinois, Senator Simon, had \ndescribed. That is why only--only--INS officers are required to have a \nwarrant to enter and to search open agricultural fields even when they \nhave probable cause to believe that unlawful activity is taking place, \nwhich is the present constitutional standard and the one applied to law \nenforcement officials in every other Federal or State agency.\n  Why--and this is the purpose of my amendment--should only the INS \nofficers need a warrant? Of all Federal law enforcement personnel, why \nshould the INS alone and their officers need a warrant even when they \nhave probable cause, and only for agricultural fields? It makes no \nsense.\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\n  That is a phrase that has been used in the debate from time to time, \nthat something may make no sense, and in this event I think this is a \nclassic case of that. Why should every single other law enforcement \nagency of the Federal Government have this power to do warrantless \nsearches except the INS? The reason: to take care of growers who use \nblatantly so many illegal agricultural workers and say they are \ndependent upon them, and if they did not have them, they would go \nbroke.\n  I have heard that argument now for 17 years. In the course of \nresponding to some of the arguments in the opening statements or \ncomments, let me assure my colleagues that all of this effort here is \nnot the creation of Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming. Every single thing \nthat has been presented to the body has not been possibly more \nconsidered, more debated, more crafted--I do not know what it could \nbe--than this issue because we have had it through the years with the \nSelect Commission on Immigration Refugee Policy.\n  That is where the ideas came from. That was the Commission in 1980. \nSome say, where do these things come from? Where does this evil spirit \ncome from?\n  There is no evil spirit. Everything I have been trying to do with \nregard to legal immigration is a direct result of the work of the \nBarbara Jordan Commission. I hope that that will be heard. I notice \nthat sometimes detractors of the legislation will say, ``How could it \npossibly be that we are turning our back?''\n  ``How can it possibly be that we are so treating these people who \nplay by the rules?''\n  ``How can it possibly be that we could turn our back on the Statue of \nLiberty?''\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not doing that. Does anyone here believe \nthat former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan would be involved in such an \neffort? That is absurd and bizarre.\n  When someone says, ``Well, do you realize this is going to apply to \neveryone?'' the answer is, yes, it will apply to everyone. When we do \nthis final procedure, whether it is this year or in 6 years or in 10 \nyears, and when we have a more secure and verifiable document and when \nwe have a more secure system, whether it is the call system or whether \nit is documentation or whatever it may be, of course, it will apply to \neveryone. If it did not, then it would be truly discriminatory.\n  If it is some document, are we going to ask it only of people who \nlook foreign? Of course not. It is for people who look foreign and bald \nAnglo-Saxons like me, too. That is how it works. It happens only twice \nin a lifetime. You use it when you are seeking funds from a State or \nFederal Government on welfare or public assistance; you present or go \nthrough this verification procedure. That is one. The other one is \nsimply at the time of seeking employment. That is two. That is it. \nThere is no third strike and you are out. That is it.\n  We hear of the great burden placed on American citizens. Ladies and \ngentlemen, why do you think proposition 187 came about? It came about \nbecause of the great burden on the people of California who are tired \nof that burden. The greatest burden on the people of the United States \nis people who are gimmicking and using our systems. That is a lot \ngreater gimmick, a lot greater burden than somebody asking when they go \nto work--and remember you already do that when you go to work. There is \na form called the I-9. It is one page. I hear the argument, what will \nemployers think when they have to go through this exercise? I tell you \nwhat they will probably think: ``Thank Heaven somebody came to change \nthe law so we wouldn't have to go through 29 documents. Thank Heaven \nsomebody changed the law so that if I ask a person for a different or \nadditional document, I am not charged with discrimination. Thank Heaven \nthey are going to start working out something where I do not need the \nI-9.'' That is in this bill. That is what we have. All of these so-\ncalled reforms that are sometimes rather negatively portrayed, all came \nfrom either the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, \nchaired by Ted Hesburgh, or the Commission on Immigration Reform \nchaired by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. They were not ripped \nfrom the air to vex American employers, nor were they ripped from the \nair to turn our back on our heritage of legal immigration. That is not \nwhere they came from. They have a fine-founded, deep-rooted source in \nthe realistic work of two very splendid commissions. I hope that will \nbe recalled in the course of the activities.\n\n  I call the question on the amendment with regard to open field \nsearches.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this issue, although a fresh one for \nCongress, is an issue that has been out there and around for a number \nof years. It was debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1983 and \n1986. I will make some brief comments. I know there have been some \nexcellent comments made by Senator Simon, Senator DeWine, and others, \nbut I will just very briefly mention my concerns about what this \nproposal would do and what it would not do.\n  It is important to point out exactly what the statutory prohibition \nagainst open field searches is about. It does not prevent law \nenforcement authorities from engaging in searches if they observe \ncriminal conduct such as drug activity taking place. So, if they \nobserve criminal conduct, they can move towards the presence in the \nfield in pursuit of the illegal activity which has been observed.\n  All this does is it simply prevents INS officials from walking onto a \nfield without a warrant and demanding that workers produce immigration \ndocuments. If the INS conducts a search, for example, in the front \noffice, they need a warrant. If they conduct a search in the barn, they \nneed a search warrant. In 1986, provisions simply stated if they do it \nin the fields, they have to get a warrant as well.\n  The prohibition against warrantless open-field searches ensures that \nforeign-looking agricultural workers are not subjected to harassment or \nunfair treatment simply because of the color of their skin. We know \nnow, by and large, those who are working out in the fields are American \ncitizens, ever since we freed ourselves from the bracero program. There \nare a number of illegals out there as well. It is difficult to estimate \nthe percentage, to be sure. But, by most observations, the great \nmajority of the individuals who are working out in those fields are \nAmerican citizens. So we are talking about protecting American \ncitizens.\n  If, as we said, the search is going to be in the front office or out \nin the barn, there has to be a warrant. Why? Because we are concerned \nabout the rights and liberties of American citizens. The American \ncitizens working out in the field, if there are observations about \nactivities, there is every legitimate reason and authority to pursue \nthose. But, nonetheless, what we have to do is look at what the \nconditions were prior to 1986. We see the abuses that were rampant in \nmany parts of the country by the INS, just for the very reasons we are \noutlining our opposition to the amendment which has been identified \ntoday.\n  This is not just an issue of protection for the individuals. It is \nalso an issue of safety. I will not take the time to read into the \nRecord about what has happened when there is a sudden INS raid in some \nof these agricultural areas in the fields, about trucks moving across \nthe open fields, sometimes in the evening time, and the great distress \nand the panic that anyone would feel when they are confronted with \nsignificant numbers of police authority chasing them through the fields \nin search of various identity cards.\n  That happened. That was more the case than not during that period of \ntime. Then, in 1986, we insisted on getting a warrant in order to try \nto address that issue. I find there has been very little, other than \ngeneral observations, that would justify going back to the law prior to \n1986.\n\n  The prohibition against the warrant- less open-field searches ensures \nthat foreign-looking agricultural workers are not subjected to \nharassment or unfair treatment simply because of the color of their \nskin. Those who support the repeal of the statutory ban contend that \nthe fourth amendment provides sufficient protection against the \nunreasonable searches of agricultural workers. This is simply not the \ncase. Nor is the fact that INS officers, without this provision, would \nbe able to enter open fields with impunity and be able to ask\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nanyone for identification. The fourth amendment was around prior to \n1986, and this is when all these abuses occurred.\n  The reason for this warrant has been well documented in the abuses \nthat took place prior to 1986. If anyone goes back and reads the record \nduring that period, there is page after page about what was happening \nout in the fields and the real issues of safety for many American \ncitizens who were working in the fields at that time as a result of \nthese kinds of raids.\n  Since then, we have had the warrant. I do not believe the case has \nreally been made in the course of the hearings that that has really \nimpeded the effectiveness in trying to deal with the fundamental issues \nof jobs in the workplace. We are working on that issue. We have \nprovided very important, I think, additional steps, both in trying to \nreach documents in terms of the antifraud provisions that have been \nbuilt into this legislation, including the pilot programs that will be \ninitiated to find out what is effective, and in protecting American \nworkers from displacement or as a result of foreign workers. The \nprohibition against the warrantless open-field searches is working \nwell. It is a necessary safeguard against the abuses of individual \nrights. We should retain it.\n  I have a more extensive comment upon that measure, which I will \nperhaps get into later on, or include it as part of the Record.\n  Mr. President, it is now 2:30, 20 minutes of 3. We have been on this \nlegislation since 10:30 this morning. We have taken a number of the \namendments, half a dozen amendments that might have been found to be \nnot germane if we moved toward cloture. I know there are others as \nwell, and those are important, extremely important, measures. I think \nthe Senate should address them at some time on the basis of their \nmerits. But we are in the situation now where we have a cloture motion \nthat has been entered on the Dorgan amendment that will ripen, based \nupon the Senate schedule, probably an hour after we go into business on \nFriday or at a time when the majority leader effectively chooses, based \nupon his ability to move toward this measure.\n  We are faced, again, with the situation that if we move toward a \ncloture motion--for example, say, we were able to move it on the \nunderlying amendment--that would have to be done prior to a cloture \nmotion on the bill. Because if we put a cloture motion on the bill, all \nthat we have done today would effectively be discarded. So we would \nneed to have a cloture motion on the underlying amendments in order to \nhave them acceptable, so that we would have them irrelevant. Then you \nwould need a cloture motion, and if that was not taken, or if we did \nget it, there would still be 30 hours on that proposal and then you \nwould get a cloture motion on the underlying legislation on which there \nwould be some 30 hours.\n  So we have ourselves now wrapped into a situation in which, I must \nsay, in terms of the overall progress on this legislation, even though \nwe have spent the full day on it, is difficult really to perceive what \nis being accomplished. Even if we continue to go on to additional \namendments that would be offered, we would, by necessity, have to \naddress the Dorgan amendment first. Or there is the possibility of \npossible disposition of the Dorgan amendment prior to the time that we \nwould move toward other action.\n  That is really a question and issue up to the majority leader. But I \nam reminded now as we come to a quarter of 3 in the afternoon, that we \nare going to be voting cloture on the Dorgan amendment. Even if they \nget cloture, we would still have some period of time before we would be \nable to move to these other issues. If we get cloture on the underlying \namendment, which has been amended today, there still would be a period \nof time for Senators to comment on that before we ever got a cloture \nmotion on the bill itself, and all because we have not had the ability \nto get a limited period of time to vote on the minimum wage, \neffectively, and Senator Dorgan's as well. We will have spent all of \nthis time, whichever amount of time that we have that is now going to \nbe required for Senate action--and I am prepared on these matters to \nvote. I would like to speak and address the Senate briefly. But I \nthink, as we see during the course of the day, we have not trespassed \non the Senate's time.\n  Basically, on the earlier amendments, we were making brief comments \nin support of them. These are measures which we have debated and \ndiscussed during the course of our own deliberations. As a matter of \nfact, this amendment, I think, was rejected in the Judiciary Committee \nwhen it was addressed by the members of the committee. So these are not \nreally new issues for many of us on the Judiciary Committee, very \nimportant measures for all of the members. But many of us have--all of \nus, I think, on the committee have--taken positions on it.\n  So, we are quite prepared to justify those positions, raise some of \nour concerns, and move forward. But because we are denying at least a \n1-hour consideration--we could cut that even further on this \nlegislation--or giving us a time definite on a clear bill on the \nminimum wage with time allocated, we have effectively spun the wheels \nof the Senate during the course of the day. We will be coming back to \nrevisit these measures, as well as the underlying measure, as well as \nthe Dorgan amendment because of the cloture motion, in the next several \ndays.\n  So it gets back to the question whether we are going to do this \nnicely or not do it nicely. We are quite ready to try to work out a \ntime definite for a vote on the minimum wage and to do it with a short \ntimeframe. I know the Senator from North Dakota is prepared to do that, \nto move ahead in terms of all the different amendments on this \nlegislation and consider those. I certainly would support that way of \nproceeding.\n  But, effectively, all of our interests and all of our rights are \nbeing shaved because of the unwillingness of the majority leader, in \nthis case, to give us a chance to vote on this measure. Here we are at \na quarter of 3, having thought we were really making progress, and \nfinding ourselves tied up on an issue which is of enormous importance \nand in which the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from California \nand other Members have spent a long time and understand how important \nit is as an issue for this country.\n  So we are caught in this particular dilemma. We are caught in the \ndilemma where we want to see action or resolution on the illegal \nimmigration, but we also feel that we ought to be able to have a short \ntime period set aside to speak to the issues which are of fundamental \neconomic importance to 13 million American families. We think their \ninterests are important, too. We think their interests should at least \ndemand a half hour or an hour of the Senate's time this afternoon. We \nthink their interests should be addressed in a reasonable way or an \nagreement made that, if not upon this bill, that we will be at least \nafforded an opportunity to do it as a clean bill so as not to interfere \nwith the ordinary deliberations of the Senate.\n\n  We have had brief discussions and comments earlier today about why we \ndid not bring this up before. We have explained about those major \nissues that we were addressing in the last Congress, the comprehensive \nhealth program that would have made about a 40- or 50-cents-an-hour \nadditional benefit to workers. The workers themselves and working \nfamilies have said they would prefer that measure to just the increase \nin the minimum wage. After we had disposed of that, unfortunately, the \nworkers themselves were left further behind, and now it gives an \nadditional sense of urgency for the increase in the minimum wage.\n  A number of us over a year ago began the process of raising this \nissue in sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, as amendments, or wherever we \npossibly could. Each and every time, even though a large number of the \nMembers of the Senate supported the Senate addressing this issue--and \non the last vote that we had, we had Republican and Democrat Senators \nalike; a majority, including unanimity among the Democrats and a very \nstrong group of Republicans who indicated that they supported it. \nRaising the minimum wage is the majority will of the Senate.\n  We are just asking for the Senate to be able to make a statement, \nmake a judgment. We may be successful; we may not be. But I do believe \nthat we are entitled to a determination of what the will of the Senate \nis on that particular issue. So, we are caught in this\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nsituation where we effectively are being denied that. But we are still \nasked to go ahead and consider some of the measures on the immigration \nbill.\n  On the one hand, they are saying, look, why are we not just going \nahead on the immigration bill and trying to move ahead? And on the \nother hand, we are asking, at least--we are quite prepared to move \nahead on immigration, but at some time, somewhere, somehow, we ought to \nbe permitted to get a time where we can address this question of the \nminimum wage.\n  None of us were denied the opportunity to make some progress this \nmorning on some of these measures. But at some time we have to ask \nourselves, when and who is going to speak for those Americans and \nAmerican families that are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder \nand speak for them to make sure that their economic interests are \nattended to? We continue every single day--every single day--to read \nmore about corporate profits and corporate salaries. We read about the \nincreasing accumulation of wealth in the top 1 percent, 5 percent. We \nhave come to understand the continued loss of those working families \nthat are on the bottom rung of these matters.\n  We have seen in the last 20 years a 25-percent increase in \nproductivity and about a 25-percent reduction in terms of purchasing \npower for workers earning the minimum wage, which is completely \nincongruous.\n  What is most troublesome of all, Mr. President, is when we have had \nthis issue that has been before us and where we have had statements, \n``Well, we're trying to work out a process to be able to address it,'' \nwe have the majority leader in the House of Representatives coming up \ntoday--and it is printed in newspapers all over this country--who says, \n``Well, we've got a new way of addressing the economic problems of the \nneedy in our society. What we are going to do is abolish the earned-\nincome tax credit,'' which President Reagan had indicated was the best \nprogram to address the problems of poverty in this country--strong \nsupport by a Republican President.\n  We have the statements that were made by Mr. Armey that we are going \nto phase that down and collect $15 billion in the next 5 years, 5 to 7 \nyears--$15 billion. We know where that is going to be collected from \nwith the elimination of the earned-income tax credit. That is going to \ncome from these same working families that are eligible for the \nincrease in the minimum wage. Then what we will do is we will still \nkeep the minimum wage where it is, but we will develop a massive new \nsubsidy entitlement program that will be run by the Internal Revenue \nService that will provide the difference between the $4.25 and the $7 \nor $8 an hour depending upon how many children the particular worker \nhad, which would be basically a subsidy to these industries--a taxpayer \nsubsidy to the industries. It would cost the taxpayers a great deal \nmore because they would have to provide for the funding and the \nresources to be able to pay that subsidy, and at the same time instead \nof letting these families rise out of poverty, which effectively would \nreduce their ability to draw upon the various safety net programs, \nbecause their incomes would move up to be too high. If we raise the \nminimum wage, on the other hand, they would go out of those safety net \nprograms and thereby be less of a drag on the American taxpayers \nbecause they would then no longer be eligible for these programs. So we \nwould save tax revenues there.\n\n  That is an important part of this whole proposal. By providing the \nincrease in the minimum wage, we would be cutting some in those safety \nnet programs by moving people above the eligibility thresholds. They \nwould be making more than they had been, so they would not be eligible \nfor support systems. That saves funds and resources that would have to \nbe paid in by American taxpayers.\n  But, no, our Republican friends say, no, we will leave it at $4.25. \nWe will draw down some $15 billion from these same families. We will \nput in place a new entitlement program run by the Internal Revenue \nService. When I heard that I was so surprised that the leaders of the \nRepublican House who have been spending all of their time castigating \nthe IRS, now believe they can run a complicated program that will pay \nso much an hour to someone that has one child, so much an hour to \nsomeone that has two children, if they are married, so much, so much if \nthey are separated, and follow this monthly, evidently, across the \nlandscape wherever these needy people are going to be--imagine the \nbureaucracy that will be needed, imagine what the costs will be for \nthat bureaucracy, and what it would mean for these people.\n  Mr. President, this is a wonderful, wonderful program because as Mr. \nArmey pointed out, they would save $15 billion out of the earned-income \ntax credit. The value of the increase in the minimum wage is $3.7 \nbillion in one year. For those people that say that this is an \ninflationary kind of impact, $3.7 billion in 1 year when the total GDP \nis about $7 trillion, and our budget, $1.65 or $1.7 trillion we are \ntalking about--of course it is not inflationary. We are talking about \n$3.7 billion that will be added to the value of good work, for working \nfamilies in this country.\n  There is another reason that I believe it was urgent to bring this \nmeasure up on the floor today. We do not see, really, any interest by \nthe leadership, the opposition leadership, in trying to work out, at \nleast, some important and responsible alternative.\n  I am basically opposed to trying to compromise this measure any \nlonger, because quite frankly, when my initial proposal was advanced, \nit was for three 50-cent increases with an inflator to correspond to \nthe increased cost of living.\n  What did we do in terms of compromising that effort to try and bring \npeople together on it? We said, ``All right, we will drop the third \nyear even though by that time it will be justified merely to maintain \nthe cost of living. We will put that aside, and beyond that we will put \naside the cost of living inflator as well. We will put those two \naside.'' Mr. President, that was a painful decision in terms of trying \nto protect the purchasing power of working families.\n  Now we are being asked to say, ``All right. Just wait around a little \nwhile. Sometime when we get ready to do it, we are going to do \nsomething. You will get a vote on something that will deal with wages, \nsomething that will deal with some other matters that you might not \nlike.'' That is generally the way it is put. ``You might not like the \ncombination of things we put together but you will get your vote.''\n  We reject that out of hand. Working families ought to reject it \nbecause that is failing to provide the kind of respect for those \nfamilies that they deserve. You are toying with the lives of those \nfamilies that are at such high risk today. So many of those, \nMr. President, are women that are out there, working, and working hard, \nand the impact of the increase in the minimum wage is very, very \nimportant in terms of their children.\n\n  This is basically a women's issue and basically a children's issue. \nThere will be 7 million females that will be affected; 5 million of \nthose are adult women. Four million of those women are 25 years of age \nor older. Of the 12 to 13 million that will be affected, 4 million will \nbe women 25 years of age or older. We find when we study this measure, \nwhen we look at those that are heads of households and those that are \nbeing affected or impacted by this, we find that, once again, it is the \ngreat majority of women that are the ones that are affected.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of all the women who are working to earn \nthe minimum wage are married and 23 percent are single heads of \nhousehold. That represents 2 million women who are the heads of \nhousehold with children. It is almost unbelievable that any person in \nthis country who is a head of a household, single, woman, dependent on \nthe minimum wage at $4.25 an hour is going to be able to make it for \nherself and for her children. And this is at a time when we have seen \nour own earnings here in the Senate increase three times since the last \nincrease in the minimum wage. We see where corporate income has gone up \n23 percent in this last year alone.\n  Mr. President, in all of the reports that we have seen, even as of \nthis morning from the Council of Economic Advisers, all of them \ndescribe how well this economy is basically doing, how sound it is \ntoday. We did not have nearly the strength in the American economy in \n1989 that we have at the present time. At that time we had\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nPresident Bush supporting this measure and a majority of the \nRepublicans, including Senator Dole, Congressman Gingrich, supporting \nthe increase of the minimum wage. What has changed? We have the real \npurchasing power now for those workers being as low as it was in 1989, \nwhen the economy was not as strong and when we still took action on the \nminimum wage. Why not now?\n  One of the arguments, of course, is that we will lose jobs. This is \nvery interesting, Mr. President, because sometime in the future we will \ntalk about the various studies, 12 in all, that show just the opposite. \nI will not take the time this afternoon to get into them, but if you \nlook at the various studies that have been done with regard to the \nminimum wage, you cannot make that case about losing the jobs. You can \ntake a more important relevant factor, and that is what is happening in \nthe States recently.\n  My State of Massachusetts, over the objection and over the veto of \nour Republican Governor, increased the minimum wage by 50 cents. What \nhas happened since the increase took effect in January of this year? \nWhat has happened is unemployment has gone down in Massachusetts, and \nunemployment in our neighboring State of New Hampshire, which did not \nraise it, has gone up.\n  I hope we will have a chance to debate those issues about loss of \njobs. It is always interesting to hear those who are opposed to an \nincrease in the minimum wage saying, ``I am concerned about those young \nminorities and all those Americans that are needy. We want to protect \nthem.'' All you have to do is look at the studies that are out there, \nabout what they want--94 percent of them want an increase. They are \nprepared to see an increase in the minimum wage because they do not \nbelieve, as I do not believe, that it will threaten their job.\n  Imagine you had over 120 million Americans working.\n  If you took 100 people that were making the minimum wage today and \nsaid it will be a 1-percent loss of jobs, but you can have a 25-percent \nincrease in your pay, what do you think their reaction is going to be? \n``We want to get that increase, and we will take our chances.'' We \nbelieve that job loss is a myth, as has been demonstrated in study \nafter study. Job growth is happening in my own State of Massachusetts, \nand in other States, and nationally we will be able to see an expansion \nof the job market, which has been true in many cases.\n  So, Mr. President, we find that the case is compelling. We have the \nvarious studies about the minimum wage, about what has happened \nhistorically on this minimum wage, going back to the year 1949, on the \nissues of job growth or job loss. We went, in 1949, from 40 cents to 75 \ncents. The national economy improved from 5.9 unemployment to 5.3 \npercent. In 1955, it went from 75 cents to $1. In 1961, from $1 to \n$1.15. Unemployment decreased from 6.7 to 5.5 percent. It went from \n$1.25 to $1.40 in 1967. In 1974, it went from $1.60 to $2. Despite a \nrecession, retail employment increased from 1978 to 1981. Employment \nincreased by 8.3 million jobs and 1.4 million retail jobs. From 1990 to \n1991, a recession that was underway quickly leveled off.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that those statements and studies \nthat proclaim the dangers of job loss can really be justified. They \ncertainly cannot in terms of the history of the increase in the minimum \nwage. Mr. President, all you have to do is look at this chart here, \nwhich demonstrates the increase in the total number of jobs, up to \nabout 118 million jobs from 108 million in 1991.\n  Since we had the increase in 1991, we have seen the steady increase \nin the total employment numbers. And look at what has happened in the \nmost recent times, in my own State of Massachusetts, and look at what \nhappened the last time we increased the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, this chart is another indication about what has been \nhappening. This is from 1979 to 1993. ``Growing apart. Real family \nincome.'' This is what happened in terms of America's working families. \nFrom 1959 to 1970, each of these groups, the bottom 20, second 20, and \nmid 20, all across the top all moved up together. From 1980 to 1993, we \nhave seen a growing apart in America. Those on the bottom rungs have \nbeen falling further and further behind.\n  Mr. President, you can see on this chart here about what has been \nhappening to the purchasing power of the minimum wage. In constant \ndollars, you go as high as $6.45 in 1966, and $5.95 in 1976. It went up \na small amount in 1990-91 as the increase in the minimum wage took \neffect--some 90 cents, and since that time, it has been dropping. It \nwould, today, be right down there at the lowest level in 40 years. That \nis measuring the real purchasing power.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, here we have the difference between \nwhat has been happening to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, somewhat \nbelow 2,000 here, and up over above 5,000 now. This is between 1979 and \n1995. This is good. This is an indication of economic strength and \ngrowth. We are glad these are the circumstances. But, on the other \nhand, look at what has been happening, in purchasing power, to the \nminimum wage. As the Dow Jones has been going up in that very steep \nrise, we see the real minimum wage going lower and lower.\n  Mr. President, this chart here shows what is happening to the real \npay of workers, and in terms of the CEOs' pay. ``Green Tree is a Money \nTree.'' ``$65.6 Million Package Angers Compensation Critics.'' These \nare newspaper articles. We find these extraordinary increases.\n  Mr. President, compare CEO pay with what happens in a minimum wage \nfamily. Three weeks of earnings. This chart indicates the $510 a \nminimum wage family would have earned compared with the tens of \nthousands of dollars a CEO of a major company would have earned and the \ndramatic disparity that has taken place.\n  Here are the final two charts, Mr. President. Wage earners from $4.25 \nto $5.14. Who are these individuals? What you see here is 31 percent \nare 16 to 19 years old. Over 20 years of age, almost 70 percent.\n  Mr. President, if you take the total value of earnings of the 90-cent \nincrease in the minimum wage, 76 percent of that money will go to a \nfamily that is below the average income for the Nation. That is, 76 \npercent will accrue to families in the lower half of incomes.\n  That is an important figure. I do not believe it is as dramatic as \nthe 2 million American women that are single heads of households with \nchildren, trying to make a go of it, but it is dramatic.\n  This chart shows 60 percent are women and for men, some 40 percent. \nAgain, it is an issue for women, an issue for children, and it is an \nissue of fundamental economic justice. This Senate is familiar with \nthis issue. It is uncomplicated. We have debated it and discussed it. \nIt is time that the majority leader gives us a time to vote on a clean \nbill with time limits.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I will inquire of my friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry. How much time do you require?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask my friend for maybe 10 minutes. I do not think I \nwill use it all.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am trying to get a unanimous-consent request to a time \ncertain for the vote on this amendment. So if I might get Senator \nKennedy's attention. I am trying to obtain a unanimous-consent \nagreement that a vote occur on or in relation to the pending amendment \nat the hour of 3:40, or at a time when the group returns from the White \nHouse with regard to the activities in the signing of the antiterrorist \nbill. Would that be appropriate at 3:40 so our Members might be \napprised of this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I will consult with the leadership \nto find out what the disposition is. At that time, I will report \nimmediately to the Senator. They will not be returning until 3:30 or \n3:45, Republicans and Democrats alike. So we are in a situation where \nwe are not in a position to make the judgment at this time. As soon as \nthe leaders return, we will consult with them to find out what their \ndisposition would be in terms of this issue.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The pending business is the amendment. Let me respond \nbriefly to the remarks of Senator Kennedy. I am fully aware--I think \nall of us are aware--of what this is. It is, again, an attempt to drive \nthe issue of minimum wage into the work of the\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\nU.S. Senate. There is nothing else to this. I referred to it earlier in \nthe day as somewhat like theater, with myself in the role of Puck and \nSenator Kennedy in the role of King Lear. It is about class warfare.\n  It is about the rich versus the poor. It is about poor women and poor \nchildren. Ladies and gentleman, if we cannot grasp the issue of what we \nare talking about--we are talking about an issue which on one side the \neconomists tell us that, if it passes, employers will quit hiring \nanybody.\n  I love the debate about human rights. It is a touching thing. But the \nbest human right is a job. You do not get a job if the employer is not \nhiring people.\n  It is always stunning to me that some--I do not attribute to a person \nin any sense--but some who have this strange feeling that they love \nemployees and hate employers. Employers employ employees.\n  I heard one part of the debate several days ago that the taxpayers \nare not going to pay this--that the employers are going to pay it. \nWell, who are employers? Employers are taxpayers.\n  It is the most remarkable flight of phantasmagoria, whether it is \nspun--whatever way you spin it--or whether we do it nicely, or whether \nwe have to do it harshly, or whether we just watch a continual \nobsessive activity with two amendments that everybody knows are good \nstuff. It is pretty molten right now--dealing, mix them while they are \nhot. And they are molten, and everybody is watching. But that is really \nnot the way it is.\n  What we ought to do is just get right with it because if we do not \nAmerica will stop, and we will be dealing with illegal immigration in a \nseparate matter.\n  I am not obsessed with illegal immigration. Let me say that. If you \nwant to bury the dead right now on that, that is fine with me. I do not \nthink the issue will go away. But I want the Record to be very clear \nwhere the sponsor of the legislation is. And the sponsor of this \nlegislation is saying you can do anything you want with this. I have \nplenty of work to do. I am missing a hearing today on veterans that I \nwas to chair as chairman of that committee.\n  I am stunned at the essence of the debate and the class warfare \naspects about it.\n  So I just want to throw into the mix so we all chomp around on it. It \nis like bear meat. The more you chew it, the bigger it gets.\n  I know this is shocking. We should not really ever do this. But the \nCongressional Budget Office reports. Guess who pays the taxes in \nAmerica? Who pays the most taxes? The rich. I know that is a shocking \nthing. I wish I had not said it.\n  So let us just put it in. The top 1 percent of all tax, the top 1 \npercent of the people in America, pay 15.8 percent of all taxes. The \ntop 5 percent of all the rich in America pay 31 percent of all taxes. \nThe top 10 percent of all the ugly rich in America pay 42.7 percent of \nthe taxes. And the top 20 percent pay 59.2 percent of the taxes that \nfuel the Government of the United States. And most of them are called \n``employers.'' I guess the rest of them are called ``rich.''\n\n  But I have always had a philosophy that we should not talk about the \nrich versus the poor. We should not talk about hitting them a little \nmore. What we should do is confiscate every cent of those on the \nForbe's list and the Fortune 500--take it all, every stock certificate, \nevery Treasury bill, every yacht, every ranch--and guess what? It would \nbe about $349 billion, and would run the country for 83 days.\n  It is absolutely bizarre to hear exercises of that nature with regard \nto the rich versus the poor while the real issue is how do you get a \njob and how do you keep a job? If we are talking about the women, the \nchildren, and all the rest of it in theater, then let us let the \nAmerican people know. No wonder they look at both sides and all of us \nin these types of debates and say, ``I mean, I cannot believe it.''\n  Does anybody here think that those--some of us--over here care less \nabout children, or less about women, or less about men, or the poor? \nBizarre, absurd, and offensive, best described as absolutely offensive \nthat somehow those of us on the other side of an issue are simply \nuncaring, and do not have any compassion. That is balderdash of the \nfirst order.\n  And I guess, as someone said, ``minimum wages'' mean minimum jobs. As \none person said, they say there are 8 million new jobs. I know. I have \nthree of them.\n  So that is where we are. But where we really are is dealing with \nillegal immigration and that is going to be difficult enough.\n  I just have been advised of a remarkable thing which I will put in \nthe Record--a news release that the INS has given us phony figures on \nlegal immigration. Instead of 800,000, it would be closer to 1 million, \nand here they were--their minions were giving us a press conference the \nday we are debating this bill on March 28 so that everybody could read \nup and see how we are diddling America. We do not need to do anything \nup here because the report released that day said ``widely \ncirculated.'' Oh, indeed it was. They said, ``Well, we reported what it \nwas. We just did not spin the future.''\n  So they have left us now with a situation under any scenario where \nlegal immigration is going to go up a million a year, and that they \nhave lied to us and given us phony figures that there are at least \n100,000 to 150,000 persons a year off.\n\n  So now we are going to have that debate. Somewhere along the line we \nare going to have an honest debate about honest numbers. I think the \npeople of America will demand that. I would like to know how anyone is \ngoing to get around addressing that issue with this kind of Jim \nCrackry, and it is extraordinary. It is hard to imagine.\n  I cannot imagine my friend, Doris Meissner, being part of that. I am \nsure she will have an opportunity to explain her position because there \nwill certainly be hearings that will be joined in a bipartisan way on \nthat particular bizarre and false information which was to prevent us \nfrom doing anything in the law to lower legal immigration because they, \nbless them, were doing it themselves, and they lied. That is another \none in this line of work that goes with our particular conduct.\n  So now I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation \nto the pending amendment 3730 at the hour of 3:30, and, further, that \ntime be divided as follows: Senator Kerry, 10 minutes; and Senator \nDeWine, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, those times go beyond 3:30. \nIt is contradictory. If you have 5 minutes and 10 minutes, it goes \nbeyond 3:30. Therefore, if the order is set for 3:30, to fill the time \nwe do not vote at 3:30. The unanimous consent request asked for a total \nof 15 minutes and it is now almost 20 after. I am trying to reconcile.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I amend my request to the time of 3:40.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I must tell \nthe chairman that I am opposed to this amendment. I need the time to \nexpress that opposition, and I would ask for 5 minutes to do so.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that is perfectly appropriate. We have \nbeen holding the amendment open and asking for those who wished to \ndebate it, and Senator DeWine has been good and vigorous in that. I \nappreciate having the participation.\n  I would expand the unanimous-consent request to 3:45 for an extra 5 \nminutes for the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman for accommodating \nme. I have been chairing the Veterans' Committee in his behalf. I thank \nhim very much.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Now wait. That deserves a little added comment, Mr. \nPresident. He indeed can have any time he wants.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the manager.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I was required to chair a hearing and could not do that, \nand my friend from Idaho graciously agreed to do that with the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs. I deeply appreciate that. Here I am \nurging him to come forth and he was doing my work. My abject apologies. \nI appreciate what he did do for me today in every respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Wyoming? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, let me respond, if I may, to a couple of comments made \nby the Senator from Wyoming. I am pleased to support the efforts of my \nsenior colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and I thank him \nfor his persistent efforts to try to push this on the agenda. I regret \nthat the reaction of my colleague from Wyoming is to suggest that \nraising the minimum wage is somehow not an appropriate effort in the \nSenate; that it is intruding on business of the Senate.\n  Raising the minimum wage is the business of the Senate. It is the \nbusiness of the Senate particularly when you consider the fact that all \nfour of the amendments approved for debate are amendments of the \nRepublican Party. In effect, what is happening here is that the \nlegitimate process of the Senate under the rules by which amendments \nare permitted, are part of the business of the Senate, the minimum wage \nis being closed out by parliamentary tactics of the Republican Party \nthat does not want a vote on it.\n  I would suggest respectfully to my friend that this is not an issue \nof class warfare. There are countless rich people in America who \nsupport raising the minimum wage. There are countless people at the \nmiddle, at the upper, and at the very top level of our economy, all of \nwhom believe that it is fair to raise the minimum wage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article which appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal, which one might have thought would not have articulated \nsuch an opinion, on April 19, last week, be printed in the Record. It \nis an article which says, ``Minimal Impact From Minimum Wage. Increase \nWon't Have Much Effect on Economy.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 19, 1996]\n\n                    Minimal Impact From Minimum Wage\n\n\n               increase won't have much effect on economy\n\n                           (By Jackie Calmes)\n\n       Washington.--Here's an economic prediction should Congress, \n     as suddenly seems likely, raise the minimum wage: The costs \n     will be smaller than opponents suggest, just as the benefits \n     will fall short of supporters' claims.\n       While nearly all economists agree a minimum-wage increase \n     can theoretically cost jobs and spike inflation if some \n     employers cut payrolls or raise prices in response, they add \n     hastily that actual effects depend on the specific proposal \n     at hand. And President Clinton's relatively modest call for a \n     90-cent increase over two years, to $5.15 an hour, would have \n     little negative impact, most agree. The same would be true if \n     a liberal Republican proposal for a $1 increase became law.\n       But even if such increases wouldn't hurt the economy, they \n     likewise would do little to help average workers even though \n     Democrats have made the issue a fundamental part of their \n     response to the problem of continued wage stagnation. Labor \n     economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, a \n     proponent of the minimum-wage increase, says flatly, ``It's \n     not going to help the middle-class worker.''\n       Whenever an increase is the issue, some conservative \n     economists and lawmakers always are tempted to refight the \n     original Depression-era battle over whether there should be \n     such a law in the first place. ``I find it hard to support an \n     increase in the minimum wage at all,'' says economist Marvin \n     Kosters at the American Enterprise Institute.\n       But on the narrower question of the increase now proposed, \n     a broad range of economists generally come together. That is \n     illustrated by the endorsement from 101 of them, including \n     several Nobel laureates, of the president's initiative. They \n     concluded the overall impact on workers and the economy would \n     be positive.\n       Likewise, Chairman Joseph Stiglitz of Mr. Clinton's Council \n     of Economic Advisers cites the modest level of the proposed \n     increase and the declining value of the current $4.25-an-hour \n     rate, now at a 40-year low in buying power. He says this \n     explains why his current support for an increase doesn't \n     contradict the negative things that, as a university \n     professor, he once wrote about the minimum wage in an \n     economics textbook.\n       Yesterday, at a meeting with House Democrats, Treasury \n     Secretary Robert Rubin said a moderate increase would have \n     ``no statistical effect on the economy.'' He called the \n     proposal ``without question . . . the right thing to do four \n     our economy.''\n       Still, there are costs; the question is how much.\n       Lawrence Lindsey, a governor at the Federal Reserve Board, \n     says internal staff studies suggest a 90-cent increase would \n     reduce employment by about 400,000 jobs over the long term. \n     And that could have implications for inflation, he said. \n     Assuming roughly half of those who lose jobs join the ranks \n     of the structurally unemployed, the ``natural rate'' of \n     unemployment--that is, the rate below which inflation begins \n     to accelerate--would rise somewhat. And Fed Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan recently told a House subcommittee, ``I think the \n     evidence is persuasive'' that a boost in the wage floor \n     increases unemployment.\n       John Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford University \n     who was a member of President George Bush's Council of \n     Economic Advisers, says of a minimum-wage increase, ``I'm \n     pretty much of the view, having looked at it and written \n     about it, that it costs jobs of low-skilled and minority \n     workers.'' Of the specific proposals on the table, he says, \n     ``This is not as bad as raising it to $6, but it's still \n     going to cost jobs.''\n       And just last month, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of \n     Texas dismissed the idea that Congress would vote to increase \n     the minimum wage, snapping, ``I'm not interested in \n     increasing the number of nonworking poor.''\n       But Mr. Burtless argues, ``When the minimum wage is as low \n     in relationship to average wages as $4.25 is now to average \n     wages in the United States, then even a rise of $1 an hour is \n     not going to dis-employ that many people.'' Moreover, he says \n     the effect on inflation would be small because, he has \n     calculated, the pay of minimum-wage employees equals less \n     than 1% of all compensation paid to U.S. workers.\n       At Harvard University, economics professor Lawrence Katz \n     says ``there are no ways of improving the conditions of poor \n     or low-wage working people that don't have some costs or some \n     distortions.'' But he says the current low minimum wage \n     argues for ``a modest increase,'' adding that ``the evidence \n     suggests that the gains to low-income working people outweigh \n     the employment costs.''\n       Meanwhile, the current debate has heightened attention to a \n     recent study of Princeton professors Alan Krueger and David \n     Card, who found no drop in employment among New Jersey's \n     fast-food restaurants after the state raised its minimum wage \n     in 1992 by 80 cents, to $5.05 an hour. (New Jersey is one of \n     10 states that have set minimum-wage levels above the federal \n     standard.) Critics have challenged their methodology but, Mr. \n     Krueger says, ``most academic studies find very little or no \n     job loss. Indeed, about two dozen impartial academic studies \n     have found insignificant evidence of job loss.''\n       So who benefits? Last year just over 5% of workers were \n     paid the minimum wage. Economists generally agree those \n     making just above the minimum wage, up to $6 an hour, could \n     see a bump in pay as an indirect consequence of a minimum-\n     wage increase. The liberal Economic Policy Institute \n     estimates that 11.7% of the work force, of about 12.2 million \n     people, make between $4.25 and $5.15.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. KERRY. In fact, 101 economists have all signed a letter, three of \nthem Nobel laureates, suggesting this would have absolutely minimal \nimpact just as it has since 1938.\n  It is not as if we are suddenly coming to the floor and debating some \nnew concept in America. This was passed in 1938, and it has been passed \nagain and again and again, that we have increased the minimum wage. On \nsome occasions we have increased the minimum wage when it has been \nworth more than it is today. It is now worth 27 percent of what it was \nin 1979. If we let it go to the end of this year, it will be at a \nrecord 40-year low.\n  Leaving aside rhetoric about rich and poor, let us consider the \nrhetoric of work, the rhetoric of getting off welfare, the rhetoric of \nthe values of our society. If you are going to value work, you have to \npay people a fair wage for the day's work. What we are effectively \nsaying, if we are going to ask people to vote below the level of \npoverty, is that we do not believe that a day's work in the United \nStates is what it has been worth since 1938 or at those periods where \nwe have raised the minimum wage to reflect what we thought it ought to \nbe with respect to that day's work.\n  Someone in my office was walking down to Union Station for lunch \ntoday and on the way back bumped into a panhandler and had a \nconversation with the panhandler, and asked him, ``How much do you \nmanage to collect out here during lunch hour?'' He said, ``I usually \nmake about six bucks out here during lunch hour.''\n  So what the Republican Party is suggesting is that people ought to go \nto work for a wage that is worth less than a panhandler can make in 1 \nhour during lunch hour near the Nation's Capitol.\n  Is that a value of work? It seems to me, Mr. President, that if we \nare going to tell people you ought to get off of welfare and you ought \nto go to work, we ought to reflect the reality of who is working for \nwhat in this country. The fact is that, of those people on the\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nminimum wage, 62 percent of the people on the minimum wage now live in \na household in which someone else is also working. The vast majority, \n46 percent, of those people in the work force in America are women; 60-\nplus percent of those working for the minimum wage are women. They are \nnot teenagers; they are people out there struggling to try to work to \nbreak out of poverty.\n  The fact is that you can work at the minimum wage in the United \nStates today for the full 40-hour week without health care, without a \npension benefit, without any of the kinds of benefits that most workers \nget, and you are working at three-quarters the rate of poverty. The \nmaximum salary you take home is $8,500 a year. Our Republican friends \nseem to suggest it is OK for people to work for $8,500 a year and it is \nOK for them simultaneously to suggest taking away $32 billion of the \nearned-income tax credit over a 7-year period.\n\n  So they want to have it both ways. They want to suggest that they can \ngive a $245 billion tax break, most of which--these are not our words; \nthis is the result of their construction--most of which goes to people \nwho already have money. It is just a fact. If you are earning $300,000 \na year, in the Republican tax break, you get about $12,000 a year. But \nif you are working at $30,000 a year or less and you are getting the \nearned-income tax credit, your taxes go up.\n  That is not class warfare. That is just a fundamental question of \nfairness. Is it fair to give somebody who earns $300,000 a year $12,000 \nmore and take away money from somebody earning $30,000 a year? The \ntheory of that is that if you do make a lot of money and you work \nharder, you ought to make a lot more, but if you do not make a lot of \nmoney and you work harder, you ought to earn less. It is the most \nincredible equation I have ever heard of in my life.\n  We are going to raise the minimum wage sometime around here. We are \ngoing to do it. We are going to do it because this issue is not going \naway. It is just like in the past. In 1989, we finally raised the \nminimum wage. Eighty-six Senators joined together to raise the minimum \nwage. All we are trying to do is get it back to that level when 86 of \nus were able to agree that it was the right thing to do. We will raise \nthe minimum wage, but it will be after an extraordinary amount of \nexpended political capital and energy and, frankly, wasted time. \nUltimately, we are going to come to some kind of agreement around here \nbecause that is ultimately what I think most people will agree is fair.\n  The last time we raised the minimum wage--it is very interesting--\nSenator Dole, the majority leader, said and I quote:\n\n       This is not an issue where we ought to be standing and \n     holding up anybody's getting 30 to 40 cents an hour pay \n     increase at the same time that we are talking about capital \n     gains.\n       I never thought the Republican Party should stand for \n     squeezing every last nickel from the minimum wage.\n\n  But here we are in 1996; it is worth less, and yet we are not just \nsqueezing every nickel from it; we are squeezing every penny out of it \nat the very same time Republicans are talking about a tax break for a \nwhole lot of people who make a lot more money than people on the \nminimum wage.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think we ought to be talking about rich \nversus poor. We ought to be talking about basic economics and what is \ngood for the Nation. Every decade we have debated this you hear the \nsame arguments. People come back and say: ``Oh, you can't do this \nbecause we are going to lose jobs.'' But in fact we do not lose jobs. \nAmerica keeps growing. America gets stronger. America is creating more \njobs.\n  The fact is that studies have shown, for instance, in New Jersey, \nwhen New Jersey raised the minimum wage, measured against Pennsylvania, \nthe argument was, ``Oh, don't do this because Pennsylvania will have an \nunfair advantage, and all the jobs are going to go across the border to \nPennsylvania.''\n  Well, lo and behold, Messrs. Card and Krueger did a study, Princeton \nUniversity did a study, Rutgers University did a study, and it showed \nthat jobs increased. We have had testimony from chief executive \nofficers of businesses who not only pay the minimum wage but they also \ngive full health care to their workers, and they find that their \nbusiness grows, they prosper, and they are able to actually hold on to \npeople because they treat them decently.\n  So I think this is an issue, the time of which has come, because the \nminimum wage is simply worth less than it was worth a few years ago. If \nwe do not raise the minimum wage, we will have reached the \nunconscionable fact in this country that it is at the lowest it has \nbeen in 40 years at the very time that people are making the most \npolitical hay out of the rhetoric of going to work, getting off \nwelfare, and living out American values. American values also require \nfairness. I hope we are going to have that fairness in this debate \nsomewhere in the next days.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for up to \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor in opposition to the \namendment that we will soon be voting on, that the chairman of the \ncommittee has brought to the floor. I say that because I believe that \nAmerica, out of fairness and justness, wants to stay with current law. \nCurrent law, now known as the McClure amendment, treats agricultural \ngrowers the same as all other businesses and business owners. I think \nit is important that we maintain the balance of fair play and property \nrights as recognized by current law.\n  The Simpson amendment in effect says if a farmer could put walls \naround or a roof over his or her fields, then the INS could not conduct \nan open-field warrantless search. But since this farmer cannot do that \nin a 10-acre, 50-acre, 100-acre, 500-acre field, since he cannot build \na roof over his or her field, that workplace does not enjoy the same \nprivate property rights as all other workplaces. The McClure amendment, \nnow current law, is applying the same INS search warrant procedures to \nall employers.\n  In this instance, I would argue the Senate ought to maintain the kind \nof fairness of the current law. If you want to search for illegal \naliens, then you get the employer's permission, or if you have probable \ncause, then you get a search warrant. That is called fairness and \nequity in this society. I think that is what we have to strive for.\n  The McClure amendment applies only to unjustified searches and only \nto the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It does not apply to any \nother law enforcement agency such as DEA or State or local law \nenforcement officers. I think that is important to specify. INS agents \nin hot pursuit of illegal aliens or others who are violating the law \ncould still enter the field. In other words, we have not created a wall \nhere; we have created a protection of property rights.\n\n  The McClure amendment was originally passed because of evidence that \nthe INS was abusing open-field searches. In my State of Idaho, prior to \nthis law being in place, we had numerous occasions when, without \nnotification, INS agents, with drawn guns, were running through \norchards in the State of Idaho. That, to me, is a formula for disaster. \nInnocent people could accidentally become hurt as a result of this. And \nit did nothing, absolutely nothing, to enforce the laws as they \ncurrently were at that time.\n  The McClure amendment was originally passed for a lot of these \nreasons. The unlawful detaining of American citizens I have already \nmentioned. If current law protects property rights, then apparently \nthere was a violation of property rights. I believe the Simpson \namendment--not intending to do so--could see us fall backwards into \nthat circumstance that I think would be very dangerous to do. It could \nresult in the injuring of agricultural workers, causing damage to crops \nand property that is already well documented, that has occurred in the \npast.\n  Here is what is interesting. The Judiciary Committee voted 12 to 5 to \nreject a similar Simpson amendment and retain basically current law. \nThey were right to do so. I cannot understand for the life of me, if \nthat was the vote of the committee, that we are back here on the floor \nwith this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the National Council of \nAgricultural Employers and also a letter from Dean R. Kleckner, \npresident of the American Farm Bureau Federation, be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Council of Agricultural Employers,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate will begin voting on amendments to \n     the Simpson Immigration Reform bills tomorrow. Two of those \n     amendments are detrimental to agricultural employers:\n       1. Simpson Amendment to repeal the agricultural search \n     warrant provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act \n     of 1986.\n       2. Kennedy Amendment to strike the intent standard for \n     document abuse discrimination.\n       The search warrant provision under current law requires the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to obtain \n     permission from the property owner prior to entering the \n     property to search for illegal aliens, or to obtain a search \n     warrant. This provision affords growers the same protection \n     from warrantless searches and unreasonable disruption of \n     business activity enjoyed by any other business. By a vote of \n     12 to 5 in the Judiciary Committee mark-up, Senator DeWine \n     successfully struck from the immigration reform bill earlier \n     language to repeal the search warrant provision. Please \n     uphold this decision and vote against Senator Simpson's \n     amendment.\n       Also during Judiciary Committee mark-up, an intent standard \n     for document abuse discrimination was added to the \n     legislation. Under current law, employers are held strictly \n     liable for document abuse discrimination if they ask a job \n     applicant to provide a specific employment authorization \n     document or request more documents than are required under \n     the law. Even though applicants are not denied a job and \n     alternative documents are accepted by the employer, the \n     Office of Special Counsel at the Department of Justice has \n     taken the position that the mere requesting (as opposed to \n     requiring) of particular documents is an automatic violation \n     of the law. This position is held regardless of the \n     employer's intent and whether or not anyone was denied \n     employment. Senator Kennedy's amendment would delete the \n     intent standard from the reform legislation and replace it \n     with language that essentially restates current law. Please \n     vote against the Kennedy amendment.\n       Thank you for your consideration on these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sharon M. Hughes,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      A Farm Bureau Speedline,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The American Farm Bureau has two concerns \n     with regard to the illegal immigration reform bill under \n     consideration by the Senate today. First, Sen. Alan Simpson \n     (R-WY) will offer an amendment to his illegal immigration \n     reform bill, S. 1664, to repeal the current-law requirement \n     that INS agents obtain either a property owner's permission \n     or a search warrant prior to entering agricultural fields in \n     search of illegal aliens.\n       This requirement was enacted as part of the Immigration \n     Reform and Control Act of 1986. The amendment to accomplish \n     this, offered by then-Sen. James McClure (R-ID), attracted \n     bi-partisan support. An amendment to strike a similar \n     proposal originally included in the predecessor bill to S. \n     1664 was stricken by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a \n     bipartisan 12-5 vote, approving a motion offered by Sen. Mike \n     DeWine (R-OH).\n       The Administration has indicated neutrality on this issue, \n     and has further indicated that the Department of Justice will \n     not change its enforcement practices even if the open-field \n     search warrant requirement is repealed.\n       Second, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) will offer an amendment \n     to strike the intent standard provision of S. 1664. This \n     provision of S. 1664 would create a new intent standard for \n     discrimination allegations based on employer requests for \n     more or different employment eligibility documents to prove \n     work authorization. Farm Bureau supports this provision, and \n     we oppose Sen. Kennedy's amendment to strike it.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation urges you to oppose the \n     Simpson and Kennedy amendments.\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n                                                        President,\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, when this vote occurs \nin a few moments, to abide by current law and private property rights \nand the protection of the security of individuals. Consider the risks \nthat could result as a result of us voting for the Simpson amendment \nand returning to law what this Congress rejected by substantial margin \nseveral years ago and has retained as the right position to hold when \nit comes to open-field searches and agriculture employers.\n  I yield the remainder of any time that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for up to \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to speak again in opposition to the \nSimpson amendment. I commend my colleague from Idaho for his very \neloquent statement.\n  I urge my colleagues to retain current law, to retain the compromise \nthat was made in 1986, and to vote the same way as the Judiciary \nCommittee did, by an overwhelming vote of 12 to 5.\n  This bill does represent, as it is written today, the status quo. I \nthink it would be a mistake to change that. It is interesting to note \nthat the INS says there is no reason to change current law.\n  What is the history of this? Go back to 1984. You had a Supreme Court \ndecision that said, in fact, you did not need a search warrant to go \ninto an open field. But the court, in essence, invited Congress to \nspeak on the issue.\n  Two years later, with the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, Congress did speak on \nthe issue and said that an open field, when used for agriculture \nemployment, should have the same basic protection, that the employees \nand employers should have the same basic protection that they had if \nthat business had been conducted within a building, if we had been in a \nrestaurant or another form of business. So, what the status quo does is \nkeep a level playing field and keep both types of businesses being \ndealt with by the INS the same way.\n  We look at this many times from the point of view of the employer and \nsay it would be unfair to ranchers, unfair to farmers, because of the \ntime-sensitive nature of agriculture, to allow these searches without a \nsearch warrant. That is true. I think we also have to look at it from \nthe point of view of the employee, because the reality is that before \nthe law was passed, even though agriculture represented only 15 percent \nof the problem of illegal workers in the work force, 75 percent of the \nraids occurred in agriculture. I do not think you have to stretch your \nimagination too far to understand one reason why. It is easier. It is \neasier.\n  The other reason is, however good, however well intentioned the \nemployees of the INS are and the agents are, when they look into a \nfield and see brown faces, they think that may be a place we need to \ngo. That is a problem. It is a problem that we do not need to return \nto.\n  My friend has just pointed out we need to talk about what the current \nstatus of the law is and what it is not. It says you have to have a \nsearch warrant. But many cases are resolved, obviously, by consent. If \nyou have consent, the INS can go onto the property. Current law also \nprovides that if INS is in hot pursuit, they can go onto the open \nfield. Finally, current law also says if you are within 25 miles of the \nborder, this provision does not apply; INS can go onto the property.\n  So I urge my colleagues--we are just a few minutes away from the \nscheduled vote--I urge them to support the position of the Judiciary \nCommittee, a 12 to 5 vote. Support current law. Support the employees \nand employers. Keep in mind the position of the INS who sees no reason \nfor any change in law.\n\n  I would also ask my colleagues to keep in mind the position of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau. I also talked about this issue. I already read \nthe names on the other letter that I talked about, a letter dated March \n13, 1996, to all the members of the Judiciary Committee--American Farm \nBureau, Agricultural Affiliates, American Association of Nurserymen. It \ngoes on and on and on with basically a page of names. Their position is \nto keep the current State of the law and to oppose the Simpson \namendment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it has been a good debate. I think I know \nwhere it is going with the vote, that all the votes are not there for \nmy particular activity. But let us be very clear. I say to Senator \nDeWine and Senator Craig--let me tell you, the law before 1986 was that \nthe INS could go do a warrantless search, ladies and gentlemen. Before \nwe changed the law, with this linkage of the ACLU and the agricultural \nworkers and the growers, the law of the United States was just like \nthis for everybody else.\n  The FBI could go into a field in plain view for a body or drugs, and \nwith a warrantless search go forward. The INS could do that, the FBI \ncould do that, the DEA. In 1986 we changed it. So the requirement that \nwe have now is the special law. That is what is fascinating in this \ndebate, I must say. I just think\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nI have been here too long. This was on the books.\n  There is not a single other law enforcement agency in the United \nStates, when they come upon an open field and in plain view see \nsomething that gives them probable cause to believe there is a \nviolation of the law--they go and do it. The only agency of the Federal \nGovernment that cannot is the INS. That is where we are. At least let \nus be realistic about what we have done. We retain it. That is the way \nit is. Move on to the next item of business.\n  But let us be totally candid. And let us not have anybody with their \nown opinion; let us all have our own facts. That was the law before \n1986.\n  But I just want to add--since we were talking, I think, about the \nminimum wage for a moment--here is the one you want to keep in mind \nwith the minimum wage and all you have heard all day long. This is from \nthe New York Times of April 19, 1996. It is called ``Minimum Wage: A \nPortrait.'' Here is the portrait as compiled by the New York Times. \nThere are three little items of interest.\n\n       Number of times in 1993 and 1994, when Democrats controlled \n     Congress, that President Clinton mentioned in public his \n     advocacy of a minimum wage increase: 0.\n\n  Next little item:\n\n       Number of times the President has done so in 1995 and \n     1996--through March 11--when Republicans have controlled \n     Congress: 47.\n\n  Since March 11 there have probably been 47 more. Then finally:\n\n       Number of Congressional hearings Democrats held on the \n     minimum wage in 1993 and 1994: 0.\n\n  Pure theater.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 3730 offered by the Senator from Wyoming. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGraham now be recognized for up to 15 minutes for debate on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to be recorded as voting no on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, nearly 1 month ago, after passing the 12th continuing \nresolution, we are now enacting the 13th continuing resolution. At the \ntime we passed the 12th extension of the budget for fiscal year 1995, I \nsaid it was the last one that I would support.\n  Mr. President, I am here to keep my word. Frankly, the lack of \nleadership by this Congress is a national embarrassment. It is nearly 7 \nmonths into the fiscal year 1996, and we still do not have five budgets \nfor five of the most important agencies of the Federal Government. This \nis no way for the world's largest economic entity to manage its \nresources.\n  It is almost as if the Congress has become addicted to this form of \nBand-Aid budgeting. When you think about it, there is a correlation \nbetween a drug addict's action and those of this Congress. We began \nthis process on September 30, 1995, when we passed the first continuing \nresolution.\n  I analogize that action on September 30, 1995, as a casual, \noccasional user of marijuana. As we have proceeded over the days, \nweeks, and months since then, we have continued to become more and more \naddicted to this approach, to this avoidance of difficult decisions, to \nthe willingness to say we failed to do it today so we will put it off \nuntil tomorrow.\n  Today, Mr. President, we are mainline injecting heroin as we sell \nourselves: ``Oh, we only need one more day and we will be able to \nresolve this impasse.'' We have heard that ``one more day'' so many \ntimes. I remember distinctly when we voted on the 12th continuing \nresolution that the leadership of the appropriations process in the \nHouse of Representatives said they were so close to reaching a final \nresolution that would have carried us through the balance of the fiscal \nyear and avoided the necessity of the 12th continuing resolution, and \nthat failing that small increment to close on a final agreement, now we \nwere going to have to use the period made available by the Easter-\nPassover recess. That certainly would be a period of time in which we \ncould come to closure on this matter.\n  We failed again. Now, again, we are taking the heroin of a temporary \nextension of a budget that is more than a year old as a means of \navoiding difficult decisions. We are acting, also, Mr. President, like \nthe drug addict who is in a state of denial. We are denying that our \nfailure to reach decisions was having serious effects on Americans. I \nbelieve that clearly our actions are having serious effects. They are \nnot just the serious effects on the faceless bureaucrats under which we \noften wish to assign our failures to act.\n  The fact is that the Band-Aid approach to budgeting has broad \nramifications. Just last month when we voted on the 12th continuing \nresolution, I used examples that have been\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nbrought to my attention from my State of Florida. As an example, the \nSalvation Army in Fort Myers, FL, when I last discussed this case a \nmonth ago, I explained that the Salvation Army used funds which were \nprovided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to promote food and \nhousing to the homeless.\n  In February 1996, the Salvation Army received its first installment \nfor the fiscal year. In a normal year, that first installment would \nhave been made available in October 1995. This is anything but a normal \nyear. The Salvation Army was expecting they would receive their final \nallotment of Federal funds in early March. True to form, these funds \nhave not yet been provided. There is only one thing consistent about \nthis year, and that is total inconsistency.\n  On April 10, I visited the Florida State Legislature in its session. \nThe question that many members of the legislature asked me is: When are \nyou going to make up your mind? The less charitable members of the \nlegislature asked the question: Have you lost your mind? Here is our \nState legislature, trying to prepare a budget for the fourth largest \nState in the Nation, with many of their important decisions based on a \npartnership with the Federal Government in health, education, job \ntraining, and many other areas. Yet, they do not know what their \nFederal partner's policy, what the Federal partner's commitment will be \nto that program halfway through the fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. President, we have had almost a month to work out this \nappropriations bill. When I was speaking to the legislature, I \napologized for the fact we were so negligent in performing our work. I \ngave them hopeful assurances that we would soon end this too long \nimpasse. Again, today, for the 13th time we are passing a continuing \nresolution putting off the decisions, putting off the commitment to \nshape up and get sober, put it off until another day, until we need \nanother injection.\n  Mr. President, this continuing resolution is passed by a voice vote. \nThis Congress has reasserted its addiction and that it cannot be \nexpected to go cold turkey. The 13th continuing resolution will pass \nwith one less vote than the 12th, and I hope if we have a 14th, I hope \nit will pass with substantially fewer votes than the 13th, and finally \nwe will end this process of procrastination, delay, indecision, and \npass the consequences on to the American people.\n  We cannot deny that this Congress is addicted to Band-Aid budgeting \nand that there are not serious ramifications to these actions. We must \nstop this cycle of dependency and face up to the difficult decisions \nwhich are ours.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be recorded as voting ``no'' on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nRecord will so indicate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that I \nmay proceed for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the action by the PLO today changing its \ncharter and eliminating the provision calling for the destruction of \nIsrael should put all Palestinian terrorists on notice that terrorism \nand the destruction of Israel is no longer the order of the day as far \nas the PLO is concerned.\n  This was a vote of 10 to 1; some 500 voted in favor of changing the \nPLO charter, some 54 voted against, a vote of 10 to 1 by the \nPalestinian national authority saying that the charter ought to be \nchanged. No longer is it the PLO position that Israel ought to be \ndestroyed. That ought to have a significant effect on changing the \nattitude of the terrorists who are trying to destroy Israel and trying \nto destroy the peace process, because now technically it is the \nPalestinian Parliament in exile which has called for the dropping of \nthat language. It is the Palestinian National Council which voted 504 \nin favor of amending the 32-year-old charter, 54 against, and 4 \nabstaining saying that no longer is it the PLO policy to seek to \ndestroy Israel.\n  You have at the present time Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist \norganizations carrying on a reign of terror, of bloodshed, killing, an \neffort to destroy Israel and an effort to defeat the peace process. But \nwith this action today by the PLO officially formally changing the \ncharter, eliminating the call for the destruction of Israel, it is now \nevident that terrorism is out of step with the dominant Palestinian \nview. That ought to be followed, and every Palestinian who seeks to \ndestroy Israel, every terrorist who seeks to destroy Israel, knows now \nthat it is the official position, led by Chairman Yasser Arafat, that \nthat idea has changed, that idea is passe, that idea is gone, and that \nthe emphasis by responsible Palestinian leaders is to promote the peace \nprocess and to end terrorism.\n  With action by the U.S. Congress in 1994 in adopting the amendment \nput forward by Senator Shelby and myself, which conditions U.S. aid on \nthe change in the charter and more active action on the part of the PLO \nin combating terrorism, at least the first part has now been fulfilled.\n  The issue of the Mideast peace process has been tortuous. There have \nbeen so many developments since Israel emerged as a state in 1949. The \nenmity which has existed for thousands of years has meant senseless \nkilling, terrorism against women and children as well as men in Israel, \nHezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel, prompting the justified \nretaliation by Israel as a matter of national self-defense.\n  That killing and those terrorist activities ought now to stop in view \nof this official declaration by the Palestinian leaders that no longer \ndoes the charter of the PLO call for the destruction of Israel.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the activities by Secretary of State \nChristopher will reach fruition. It is not an easy matter. The press is \nfull of reports about how President Assad of Syria is keeping Secretary \nChristopher cooling his heels while President Assad talks to others or \nPresident Assad is otherwise busy. It is not an easy matter to \nnegotiate in the Mideast. I compliment Secretary of State Christopher, \nand I compliment the President on the accomplishments which have been \nmade.\n  The Mideast has been a particular point of interest to me. I made my \nfirst trip to Israel back in 1964. I traveled there again as a private \ncitizen in 1969, again in 1978, again in 1980, and after being elected \nto the Senate traveled there considerably. I have had the opportunity \nto visit Damascus on many occasions. I made my first trip there in \n1984.\n  As long as the Secretary of State has cooled his heels, this Senator \ncooled his heels a lot longer. I returned there in 1988 after the \nSoviets had advised the Syrians they were no longer going to finance \nSyrian military operations, and in 1988 President Assad was prepared to \nsee Arlen Specter; I had a meeting of 4 hours and 35 minutes, and I \nhave made many trips back and have had an opportunity to gain some \nunderstanding as to the negotiating process in the Mideast.\n  I suggest that the attitude of the Syrians has changed considerably \nin the 12 years which have intervened since my first trip to Damascus \nin 1984 and today, 1996. When I first had an opportunity to talk to \nPresident Assad, the idea of negotiations with Israel was totally out \nof the question. We have seen problems that the United States has had \nin Lebanon with the killing of so many of our marines, and we have seen \ngrave difficulties in Lebanon in 1982 with Israeli action there. I \nbelieve that a cease-fire can be attained there, and I believe the \npeace process can be promoted.\n  We had the historic activity of President Sadat of Egypt in the first \nbreakthrough back in 1978 and 1979. We have since seen the peace \nprocess with an Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement. We\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\nhave seen an event at the White House lawn back on September 13, 1993, \nthat I never thought would have been possible with Chairman Arafat \nhonored there. But when then Prime Minister Rabin shook the hand of \nChairman Arafat and then Foreign Minister Peres shook the hand of \nChairman Arafat, the U.S. policy was to support the peace process. If \nIsrael, which had been the principal object of PLO terrorism, was \nprepared to deal with Chairman Arafat, then so was the United States.\n  I have had an opportunity to meet with Chairman Arafat on three \noccasions since that historic event at the White House on September 13, \n1993. I have gone there in a visit with Senator Brown in August of last \nyear, carrying with us a list of specific terrorists where we thought \nthe Palestinian authority had not turned them over to Israeli officials \nin accordance with the agreements which had been made, presented them \none by one, and, candidly, heard many excuses offered by Chairman \nArafat.\n  Senator Shelby and I had an opportunity to visit again with Chairman \nArafat this past January 2 and again talked about the language of the \nPLO charter and pushed to have it revised. At that time, Chairman \nArafat said he would do his utmost. The elections were coming up with \nthe Palestinians on January 20. Those elections were held, and now we \nhave had this historic event with the Palestinian Parliament in exile \ndropping the language by a vote of 504 in favor of eliminating the \nlanguage calling for the destruction of Israel, 54 against, and 14 \nabstaining. That language had been in the charter for some 32 years.\n  So, you have a vote of 10 to 1, a very, very sizable majority, which \nought to put all of the Palestinian terrorists on notice that it is no \nlonger acceptable, even from the Palestinian point of view, to call for \nthe destruction of Israel and to carry out acts of terrorism.\n  So it is my hope that this historic vote, when it is communicated to \nthe Palestinians in that region, when it is communicated to the \nPalestinians around the world, may have the effect of letting the \nPalestinian terrorists know--Hezbollah, Hamas, and the other terrorist \norganizations--that it is no longer appropriate, it is no longer \nproper, it is condemned by the Palestinian authority itself, that \nterrorist acts against Israel ought not to be carried forward. If we \ncan stop Hezbollah, if we can stop Hamas and the other terrorist \norganizations, then I think we can move forward with the peace process.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send the modification of the amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Amendment No. 3672, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       (1) social security is supported by taxes deducted from \n     workers' earnings and matching deductions from their \n     employers that are deposited into independent trust funds;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) 138,000,000 American workers pay taxes into the social \n     security system;\n       (6) social security is currently a self-financed program \n     that is not contributing to the Federal budget deficit; in \n     fact, the social security trust funds now have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (7) these current reserves will be necessary to pay monthly \n     benefits for current and future beneficiaries when the annual \n     surpluses turn to deficits after 2018;\n       (8) recognizing that social security is currently a self-\n     financed program, Congress in 1990 established a ``firewall'' \n     to prevent a raid on the social security trust funds;\n       (9) raiding the social security trust funds would further \n     undermine confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (10) the American people overwhelmingly reject arbitrary \n     cuts in social security benefits; and\n       (11) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     deserve to be reassured that their benefits will not be \n     subject to cuts and their social security payroll taxes will \n     not be increased as a result of legislation to implement a \n     balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any legislation required to implement a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution shall \n     specifically prevent social security benefits from being \n     reduced or social security taxes from being increased to meet \n     the balanced budget requirement.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nA couple of colleagues wish to come to speak on this amendment as well.\n  First of all, the circumstances are we will vote on a Kempthorne \namendment. I have no objection to that amendment. I intend to vote for \nit.\n  It contains conclusions that I support, talks about the desire to \nbalance the budget, to do so without Social Security benefits being \nreduced or Social Security taxes being increased. I have no objection \nto that. I intend to vote for it.\n  But that is not the issue. The issue is the second vote on the \namendment that I offered, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That \namendment is very simple. It is an amendment that says that when a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is brought to the floor \nof the Senate it ought to include a firewall between the Social \nSecurity trust funds and the other revenues of the Federal Government.\n  The reason I feel that way is because we are now accumulating a \nyearly surplus in the Social Security trust funds. It is not an \naccident. It is a deliberate part of public policy to create a surplus \nin the Social Security trust funds now in order to save for the future.\n  The reason I know that is the case is because in 1983 I helped write \nthe Social Security reform bill. I was a member of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee at the time. We decided in the Social Security reform \nbill to create savings each year. This year $71 billion more is coming \ninto the Federal Government in receipts from Social Security taxes over \nwhat we will spend this year--a $71 billion surplus this year alone, \nnot accidental but a surplus designed to be saved for the future.\n  It is not saved for the future if it is used as an offset against \nother revenue of the Federal Government. If it is simply becoming part \nof the revenue stream that is used to balance the budget and the \noperating budget deficit, it means this $71 billion will not be there \nwhen it is needed.\n  I have heard all of the debate about, well, this is just an effort by \nsome of those who would not vote for the other constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget, just an effort to justify their vote. No. There \nwere two constitutional amendments to balance the budget offered in the \nU.S. Senate last year. One of them balanced the budget and did so by \nthe year 2002, using the Social Security trust funds as part of the \noperating revenue in the Federal Government. I do not happen to think \nthat is the way we ought to do it.\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n  The Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, is on the floor. He has \nbeen one of the authors of that particular amendment. I happen to know \nthat he changed his mind on this issue. He originally felt we should \nnot include the Social Security trust fund money as part of the \noperating revenue of the Federal budget.\n  I still believe fervently we should not do that. One of the sober, \nsane things that was done in the 1980's in public policy was to create \na surplus each year in the Social Security accounts to save for the \nfuture when it is needed, when the baby boomers retire. To simply \ndecide to throw that all in as operating revenues and provide for it in \na constitutional amendment to the Constitution, and use it to help \nbalance the operating budget of the Federal Government, is in my \njudgment not honest budgeting.\n\n  We are either going to save this or not. If we are not going to save \nit we ought not collect it from the workers. If the workers have it \ntaken from their paychecks and are told, ``This money coming from your \npaycheck goes into a Social Security trust fund,'' and if it goes into \nthe Social Security trust fund and then is used as other revenue to \nbalance the Federal operating budget, it is not going to be there when \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  That is the import of this amendment. If those who propose a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget would bring to the floor \na constitutional amendment with section 7 changed as we proposed it \npreviously and voted on it that says it is identical in every respect \nto the constitutional amendment offered by Senator Simon, Senator Dole, \nand others with the exemption that the Social Security trust funds \nshall not be used as operating revenue in the Federal budget to balance \nthe budget, they would get 70 or 80 votes, 75 votes perhaps for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Because they did not do that, they fell one vote short. They intend \nto bring a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to the floor \nof the Senate again, and have announced they intend to do it under a \nreconsideration vote. They have a right to do that. We simply want an \nopportunity to provide a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to say to all \nof those in the Senate, when you bring this, do it the right way this \ntime. If you do it the right way you will, in my judgment, pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget out of this Senate and \nsend it to the States for ratification.\n  That is what this sense-of-the-Senate vote is about. It is not about \nprotecting anybody. It is not about setting up a scarecrow. It is about \nvery serious, important public policy issues. Anyone who says this is \nnot an important or serious issue apparently misunderstands what the \npolicy issues are here. I did not vote to reform the Social Security \nsystem--I did not vote to increase payroll taxes in the 1980's, as did \nmost Members of Congress, in order to have that money go into the \noperating budget of the United States and not be saved for the future \nin the Social Security trust funds as we promised the American people \nit would be.\n\n  Last year the Budget Committee brought to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate a budget. They said, ``Here is our balanced budget.'' And on \npage 3 it says, ``Deficits--'' in 2002, $108 billion. How can that be \nthe case? Because technically they say, ``We haven't yet balanced the \nbudget, technically in law, but what we have done is promised we will \nuse this money to show a zero balance because these Social Security \ntrust funds, to the tune of $108 billion, will be used to balance the \nFederal budget.''\n  It is not an honest way to do business. It ought not be done. We can, \nin my judgment, remedy this problem very quickly. Voting for my sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution, and including in the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget that is brought to the floor of the Senate, the \nprovision I have described, which is fair to the American workers, \nkeeps our promise with the American workers, is fair to senior citizens \nin this country, and does what we said in 1983 we were going to do for \nthe future of the Social Security system.\n  I am a little weary of hearing people stand on the floor of the \nSenate saying the Social Security system is going broke. The system has \nbeen around 60 years. In the year 2029, which is 30-some years from \nnow, we have financing problems with it, yes, but we are going to \nrespond to those long before 2029. For someone to say a system that has \nbeen around here for some 60 years is going to go broke because in the \nyear 2029--33 years from now--we have financing trouble is, in my \njudgment, unfathomable.\n  This is a wonderful contribution to this country of ours, the Social \nSecurity system. We can and have made it work, and will make it work in \nthe future. But I will guarantee you that it will not work in the \nfuture the way we expect it to, to help the people who are going to \nretire in the future in this country, the baby boomers especially, if \nwe do not take steps to protect the Social Security trust funds and use \nthem for the purpose that they were intended back in the 1983 Social \nSecurity Reform Act.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of Senator \nDomenici and Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan has approximately 12 \nminutes left of his time. Senator Domenici, who I do not see at this \npoint, has 10 minutes under his time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, since I have not spoken to Senator \nDomenici, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 3 \nminutes and not have it charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with 90 percent of what my friend \nfrom North Dakota has to say. Where I do differ is--and let me add in \nthe Budget Committee I supported Senator Fritz Hollings in saying that \nwe should exclude Social Security as we balance the budget. I \ncosponsored that legislation. What is true, however, is that the \nbalanced budget amendment that we proposed, as it was, protects Social \nSecurity more than the present law does. Bob Myers, chief actuary for \nSocial Security for 21 years, strongly supported the balanced budget \namendment saying it was essential to the protection of Social Security.\n  I recognize that we are close to getting something worked out. I hope \nwe can. I do think it is unrealistic, the amendment offered by my \nfriend from North Dakota, that by the year 2002, we can do this, \nexcluding Social Security. I think if we go on a glidepath for a few \nyears later, that can be worked out.\n  To those who question that, that provides a great deal more \nprotection than you have in the present law. The present law gives \ntheoretical protection, but it is not there. The Constitution gives \nmuscle to that.\n  Now, I add that I want to make sure that, in the years we have \ndeficits, we fill those deficits, that we do not exclude both the \nreceipts and the deficits, because the time will come--I may not be \naround to need it but the Senator from North Dakota will--when we need \nto protect those deficits and make clear that is a liability of the \nFederal Government.\n  I am hopeful something can get worked out yet. There are various \nversions floating around right now. It would be a great day for the \nAmerican public if we could get it worked out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time do \nthe Democrats have and how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is remaining 12 minutes 15 seconds under \nthe control of Senator Dorgan and 9 minutes 50 seconds under the \ncontrol of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not sure I need all my time. Let me \nyield myself 5 minutes at this point.\n  Mr. President, I guess I start this by paraphrasing Ronald Reagan: \nHere we go again. Every time we get into a balanced budget debate, \nsomeone tries to claim that Congress is raiding the Social Security \ntrust fund. Every single time it happens, somebody gets up and claims \nwe are not doing it right.\n  I simply want to note that there is a bit of irony in this debate in \nthe Dorgan amendment. In 1995, we saw a plethora of budget proposals \nfrom both sides of the aisle. We saw a number\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nfrom that side of the aisle. Indeed, at last count, the President \nhimself has proposed 10 different budgets since January 1995. Each and \nevery one of those budgets, including the President's 1997 budget, \nincludes Social Security in the deficit calculations.\n  I am not suggesting that is in any way violating the law, because it \nis not. It is not violating the law to produce a balanced budget and \ncall it a balanced budget under the unified concept which has been used \nsince Lyndon Johnson's time, when at the direction of Arthur Burns, one \nof the best economists we have ever had serve us, the United States \ndecided to put everything on budget, because everything on that budget \nhad an impact on the economy of the United States. So does the trust \nfund have an impact on the economy. The unified budget was a concept of \nputting everything on there that has any economic impact on the people \nof the United States and the American economy.\n\n  Somehow, it seems to me, we have some kind of a gap here. Unless I am \nreading wrong, Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, two of the sponsors of \nthis so-called Social Security amendment, promoted a balanced budget \nhere in the U.S. Congress. If I am wrong, the Senator can tell me I am \nwrong. Somehow, it seems to me that something must have escaped, \nescaped the mind, because that plan could only claim to reach balance \nin 2002 including the Social Security trust fund.\n  As a matter of fact, I have not seen any budget produced that has \nbeen offered as an instrument upon which we would vote here in the \nSenate that produces the kind of balanced budget that is now being \nencouraged by this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Republican \nbudget, the first one that balanced the budget, the first one to pass \nCongress to balance the budget in two generations, also included the \nSocial Security trust funds in this deficit calculation.\n  That does not mean that in doing that you are detracting from the \nsolvency of the Social Security fund. As a matter of fact, in each and \nevery one of the budgets I have been discussing, to my recollection, \nthe nine the President has offered, two of which have been balanced, \nthe others that I have referred to in a very, very formidable way, \nthose budgets do not touch Social Security. They do not touch the \nbenefits. They do not touch the taxes that are attributable to Social \nSecurity. You get a balanced budget without in any way doing harm to \nthe Social Security trust fund and the taxes that are imposed on the \nAmerican people in order to get that done.\n  Frankly, it seems to me, for those who would like to make sure we get \na balanced budget and not use the Social Security trust fund in the \ncalculations, I wonder how they get to balance. I have not seen any \nproposals that have accomplished that. From this Senator's standpoint, \nif we are going to get there by 2002, which I think is everybody's \nagenda, I believe it is inconceivable that you can get there and in the \nfinal calculations--that is why I am saying in the calculations--you do \nnot use the unified budget concept, which for more than 20 years has \nbeen used in almost every examination of the impact of the Federal \nbudget on the people of this country.\n  Maybe I am missing something. Maybe somebody knows another way to do \nit by 2002 and reduce the expenditures of our Government by another \n$190 to $200 billion. I do not believe, in my efforts, which I think \nhave been at least, if not successful, at least we have shown various \nways--and it has been a rather formidable exercise--I do not think we \nhave ever come up with anything that could do that.\n\n  While I understand the debate is a useful debate, we ought to be very \nconcerned about it. I think it is truly, ``Here we go again,'' and I \nhope the U.S. Senate decides we ought to get on with the subject, get a \nbalanced budget, and get a constitutional amendment and not do the \nsense of the Senate at this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Obviously, I do not take any pleasure in correcting the record made \nby my distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I served as \nchairman of the Budget Committee and had the best of cooperation from \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico. I hope we can cooperate \nagain in getting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that \nprotects social security.\n  Last year on March 1, 1995, five Senators signed a letter to the \nmajority leader stating that we were ready, willing and able to vote \n``aye'' on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so long as \nwe did not repeal the statutory law of the United States that prohibits \nthe use of Social Security trust funds in computing either deficits or \nsurpluses of the Federal Government.\n  Now my distinguished friend from New Mexico says that both sides use \nit, and he starts, of course, with President Lyndon Johnson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na budget table of the deficits and surpluses for the past 40 years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  U.S.

You will not find the word ``unified'' in it. You, will, \nhowever, find section 13301 of the statutory laws of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that section printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, section 13301 says you cannot use Social \nSecurity. In our failure to follow that law, we should not wonder why \nthe people do not have any faith or trust in their Government.\n  Let us go back to Social Security. In 1983, we increased the Social \nSecurity payroll taxes in order to save the program. We said these \nmoneys would be used only for Social Security. We were going to balance \nthe budget for general government and build up Social Security \nsurpluses to ensure that money would be there when they baby boomers \nretire. However, working in the Budget Committee with the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, you could see what was happening. Budget \ndeficits went up, up and away. We had less than a trillion-dollar debt \nwhen Reagan came to town. It is now $5 trillion. So in the Budget \nCommittee, on July 10, 1990, I offered an amendment to protect the \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust fund. It was my amendment that \npassed the committed by a vote of 20-1.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the vote printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay:\n        Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     Mr. Bond.\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, after our success in the Budget \nCommittee, I worked with Senator Heinz to offer the same amendment on \nthe Senate floor on October 18, 1990. The vote was 98-2, and the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico voted both in July, and in \nOctober to not use Social Security trust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that vote be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Hollings-Heinz, et al., amendment which excludes the Social \n     Security Trust Funds from the budget deficit calculation, \n     beginning in FY 1991.\n\n\n                               yeas (98)\n\n       Democrats (55 or 100%)--Adams, Akaka, Baucus, Bentsen, \n     Biden, Bingaman, Boren, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, \n     Burdick, Byrd, Conrad, Cranston, Daschle, DeConcini, Dixon, \n     Dodd, Exon, Ford, Fowler, Glenn, Gore, Graham, Harkin, \n     Helfin, Hollings, Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, \n     Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, \n     Mikulski, Mitchell, Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, \n     Riegle, Robb, Rockefeller, Sanford, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, \n     Simon, Wirth.\n       Republicans (43 or 96%)--Bond, Boschwitz, Burns, Chafee, \n     Coats, Cochran, Cohen, D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, \n     Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, Gramm, Grassley, Hatch, Hatfield, \n     Heinz, Helms, Humphrey, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kasten, Lott, \n     Lugar, Mack, McCain, McClure, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, \n     Packwood, Pressler, Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Specter, Stevens, \n     Symms, Thurmond, Warner, Wilson.\n\n\n                                NAYS (2)\n\n       Republicans (2 or 4 %)--Armstrong, Wallop.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, when the both sides continued to use the \nsurpluses--I teamed up with Senator Moynihan. I said, ``Look, you are \nusing these moneys for defense, education, housing, foreign aid, for \neverything but Social Security. Let us just stop the increase in taxes \non Social Security.''\n  So exactly 5 years ago, on April 24, 1991, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico moved to table the Moynihan-Kasten-Hollings amendment \nthat would have reduced Social Security revenues in the budget \nresolution by about $190 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that vote be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Domenici motion to table the Moynihan-Kasten-Hollings \n     amendment which reduces Social Security revenues in the \n     budget resolution by $24.6 billion in FY 1992, $27.6 billion \n     in 1993, $38.2 billion in 1994, $44.0 billion in 1995, and \n     $61.7 billion in 1996; and returns Social Security to pay-as-\n     you-go financing.\n\n\n                               yeas (60)\n\n       Democrats (26 or 47%)--Baucus, Bentsen, Bingaman, Bradley, \n     Breaux, Bumpers, Burdick, Byrd, Conrad, Daschle, DeConcini, \n     Dixon, Ford, Glenn, Graham, Heflin, Johnston, Kohl, \n     Lautenberg, Levin, Mikulski, Robb, Rockefeller, Sasser, \n     Shelby, Simon.\n       Republicans (34 or 79%)--Bond, Brown, Burns, Chafee, Coats, \n     Cochran, Cohen, D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, \n     Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, Gramm, Grassley, Hatfield, \n     Jeffords, Kassebaum, Lott, Lugar, McCain, McConnell, \n     Murkowski, Packwood, Pressler, Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Smith, \n     Specter, Stevens, Thurmond, Warner.\n\n\n                               nays (38)\n\n       Democrats (29 or 53%)--Adams, Akaka, Biden, Boren, Bryan, \n     Cranston, Dodd, Exon, Fowler, Gore, Harkin, Hollings, Inouye, \n     Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, Leahy, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, \n     Mitchell, Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Reid, Riegle, Sanford, \n     Sarbanes, Wellstone, Wirth.\n       Republicans (9 or 21%)--Craig, Hatch, Helms, Kasten, Mack, \n     Nickles, Seymour, Symms, Wallop.\n\n\n                             not voting (1)\n\n       Democrats (1)--Pryor.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on November 13, 1995, the Senator from \nNew Mexico again joined with us on a vote of 97-0 not to use Social \nSecurity trust funds. But in March of last year they were trying to get \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that used an additional \n$636 billion in Social Security trust funds.\n  Under that approach, we would come around to the year 2002 and say, \n``Whoopee, we have finally done our duty under the Constitution and we \nhave balanced the budget.'' But we would have at the same time caused \nat least a trillion-dollar deficit in Social Security. Who is going to \nvote to increase Social Security taxes, or any other tax, to bring in a \ntrillion dollars?\n  That is our point here. That is why we have offered this sense of the \nSenate. What happens is the media goes right along. I want to quote \nfrom an April 15 article in Time magazine which talks about the \nsurpluses in the highway trust fund:\n\n       Supporters argue, rightly, that the money would go where it \n     was intended--building roads and operating airports. But the \n     supposedly untapped funds are actually an accounting figment.\n\n  That is what we will have to say about Social Security in 2002 \nbecause the money will not be there. Let us cut out this charade, stop \nthe fraud, and be honest with each other. Let us get truth in \nbudgeting.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Ford.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota. I think \neveryone should have listened to my friend from South Carolina. He has \nbeen there from year one. He knows the history of it. He understands \nit, and he says it straight.\n  I listened to my good friend from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, one of the smartest financial wizards in the Senate. I \nbelieve, honestly and sincerely, that he knows how to operate to be \nsure that Social Security funds are not used. He says he only wants to \nuse them for calculation. He does not touch the fund, the taxes; he \ndoes not touch anything. If you do not touch them, why use them? If you \ndo not touch them, why use them?\n  We have a contract with the people of this country. Social Security \nis doing better. There are 8.4 million new jobs, all of them paying \ninto Social Security. Things are beginning to look a little better. But \nif we take Social Security funds to balance the budget, then we are \ndeceiving the American public.\n  I voted for a balanced budget every time except the last time \nbecause, before that, it excluded Social Security funds. This last \ntime, it included Social Security funds. You had at least seven more \nvotes--we would be in the seventies on the balanced budget amendment \nhad you said we exclude Social Security moneys.\n  So when you say you are not using them, you will not spend them, you \nare not going to touch taxes, there ought to be a way, and there should \nbe a way, that we can pass a balanced budget here without using those \nfunds.\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to Senator Dorgan and Senator \nHollings and that we approve this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I suspect my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator from New Mexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I told Senator Dorgan I would use our \ntime up and he could close. Senator Simpson has arrived. He is never \nwithout something to say on this subject. I yield half of my remaining \ntime to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator. It will not take 2 minutes. It does \nnot take too many minutes to explain that there is no Social Security \ntrust fund. To come to this floor time after time and listen to the \nstories about the Social Security trust fund is phantasmorgia and \nalchemy. There is no Social Security trust fund. The trustees know it, \nwe know it, everyone in this Chamber knows it.\n  What you have is a law that says if there are any reserves in the \nSocial Security system, they will be invested in securities of the \nUnited States, based on the full faith and credit of the United States. \nTherefore, they are. They consist of the bills, savings bonds, and they \nare issued all over the United States. Some here own them, and banks \nown them. The interest on those is paid from the General Treasury, not \nsome great kitty or some Social Security piggy bank. This is the \ngreatest deception of all time.\n  The sooner we wake up and realize that the trustees of the Social \nSecurity system, consisting of three Members of the President's \nCabinet, consisting of Dona Shalala, Robert Rubin, and Robert Reisch, \nCommissioner Shirley Chater, one Republican and one Democrat, are \ntelling us this system will be broke in the year 2029 and will begin to \ngo broke in the year 2012--there is no way to avoid it unless you cut \nthe benefit or raise the payroll tax. Guess which one we will do at the \nurging of the senior citizens? We will raise the payroll tax one more \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have a letter dated January 19 signed \nby Senator Exon, Senator Daschle, and Senator Dorgan with reference to \na proposed balanced budget that they wanted the Republicans to join \nthem in with some common ground.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Democratic Leader,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We are disturbed by several remarks you \n     made yesterday at your news conference on the status of \n     budget negotiations. It is unclear to us why your public \n     comments concerning the budget continue to grow more \n     pessimistic even as the gap between our two plans continues \n     to narrow.\n       We believe a workable solution to balancing the budget is \n     indeed at hand. Since our House counterparts appear less \n     willing, or less able, to discuss alternatives, we ask that \n     you take the initiative and join us to build support for a \n     ``common ground'' balance budget. This budget would be based \n     on the $711 billion in reductions to which all parties in the \n     budget negotiations have already agreed. (Please see the \n     attached chart outlining those areas of agreement.)\n       Democrats and Republicans have made a great deal of \n     progress over the past few weeks in narrowing the gap between \n     our two plans. The biggest remaining gap, of course, it the \n     difference between our two tax cut proposals. The current \n     Republican plan calls for $115 billion more in tax cuts than \n     does the plan offered by the President and Congressional \n     Democrats. Your plan pays for these additional tax breaks by \n     cutting $132 billion--above and beyond what Democrats have \n     agreed to--from programs that are essential to working \n     families.\n       Spefically, your plan cuts Medicare by $44 billion more \n     than the Democratic plan. It cuts Medicaid by $26 billion \n     more. It cuts domestic investments in areas such as education \n     and the environment by $52 billion more. And it raises taxes \n     on working families by $10 billion.\n       The Democratic plan, by contrast, allows us to balance the \n     budget in seven years using CBO numbers, provide a reasonable \n     tax cut of $130 billion for working families, and still \n     protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.\n       We should act decisively to balance the budget immediately. \n     If balancing the budget is the goal, we can reach it now by \n     banking the ``common ground'' savings on which we all agree.\n       We ask you to return with us to the White House to resume \n     budget negotiations with the Administration before the \n     current continuing resolution expires next Friday, January \n     26. If you will agree to return to the table, reduce your tax \n     cut, and adopt the ``common ground'' reductions to which we \n     have all agreed, we can reach an agreement immediately. We \n     can balance the budget in seven years--and provide America's \n     families with tax relief--without eviscerating the programs \n     on which their economic security depends.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. James Exon,\n     Tom Daschle,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note that the proposed balanced budget \nis in the unified budget manner using the Social Security trust funds \nin calculating the balance.\n  I just want to close by saying that we can go on with these arguments \nas long as we want. The truth of the matter is seniors should know \nthat, if you can get a unified balanced budget by the year 2002 which \nhelps the American economy grow, prosper, and which brings interest \nrates down, it is the best thing you can do for the Social Security \ntrust fund. That is exactly what it needs.\n  There is no chance of success unless the American economy is growing \nand prospering. For that to happen you have to balance the unified \nbudget. If you want to say 4 years after that you will balance without \nthe use of the funds, fine. You put that on a line and show it.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Hollings, that we are engaged now in \ntrying to write some language for a balanced budget constitutionally \nwhich would put it in balance in the unified way by a certain time, and \nunder the ideas that the Senator from South Carolina has, by 4 years \nlater to try to put that in the constitutional amendment. We are \nworking with the Senator and others. We hope to have it done very soon, \nat which point when it clears with the Senator from South Carolina and \nothers, we will be glad to give it to the leadership to see what they \nwant to do with it.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments. Even though they were not all \ndirected to agreeing with me, we are working on the same wavelength.\n  I yield the floor and yield any time which I may have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes twenty-one seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me use the remaining time.\n  I guess now we have heard the three stages of denial. Let me rephrase \nthe three stages of denial.\n  One, there are no Social Security trust funds;\n  Two, if there are Social Security trust funds, we are not using them \nto balance the budget;\n  Or, three, if there are Social Security trust funds and we are using \nthem to balance the budget, we will stop by the year 2006.\n  All three positions have been given us in response to our position on \nthis floor--the three stages of denial.\n  I watched the debate on the floor of the House of Representatives the \nother night. A fellow had a chart, and he talked about the income tax \nburden by various groups of taxpayers. He said, you look at the folks \nat the bottom level here. They are not paying higher income taxes. We \nhave not increased their income tax burden. He strutted around and \ntalked about how wonderful that was. He did not say with his chart what \nhad happened to those folks in the last decade with respect to payroll \ntaxes. No, their income tax has not increased. Their payroll tax \nskyrocketed because this Congress increased the payroll tax, determined \nto want to save the payroll taxes in the trust fund and build that \ntrust fund for the future.\n\n  That is why people are paying higher payroll taxes. In fact, this \nyear, $71 billion more is collected in receipts in the Social Security \nsystem than will be paid out. The question is, What is that for? If \nthere is no trust fund, what is that for? Did the Congress increase \npayroll taxes so they could take the most regressive form of taxation \nand say to people, By the way, we will use that to finance the \nGovernment? Is\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nthat what they did? That would not have gotten one vote in the House \nnor the Senate, even by accident.\n  You all know it is wrong. There is not one person in here in a silent \nmoment who would not admit that it is wrong to increase these payroll \ntaxes and promise workers that you are going to take their money, put \nit in a trust fund and save it and say, ``By the way. It is either not \nhere, or it is here and we are misusing it, or, by the way, if we are \nmisusing it, we will stop in 2006.'' What on Earth kind of debate is \nthat?\n  Let us decide what is wrong, and when we see what is wrong, let us \nfix it.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution says there is a very serious \nproblem. This problem is not a nickel and dime problem. It might be an \ninconvenience to some. But this problem is $600 billion to $700 billion \nin the next 7 years. This is big money. This has to do with the future \nof Social Security. This has to do with very important financial \nconsiderations in this Government.\n  My point is, let us balance the Federal budget. Yes; let us even put \na requirement to do so in the Constitution. But let us not enshrine in \nthe Constitution a provision that we ought to take money from workers \nin this country, promise them we will save it in a trust fund, and then \nmisuse it by saying it becomes part of the operating revenue of this \ncountry.\n  I have heard all of the debate about what is wrong with what Senator \nHollings, I, Senator Ford, and others have said. I have not heard one \npiece of persuasive evidence that the payroll taxes are not being \nsystematically misused when we promised that it would be saved in \ntrust, and in fact they are used as an offset to other operating \nrevenues to try to show a lower budget balance.\n\n  That is why I say to those who say that they produce a balanced \nbudget, show us a document that shows even when they say it is in \nbalance. It is $108 billion in deficit. But they say we will fix that \nbecause we will take the $108 billion out of Social Security and pledge \nto you it is in balance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \nof the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The failure to formally segregate the Social Security trust funds is \nnot the only reason I oppose the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, but it is certainly one of the reasons.\n  Even if there were no other reasons, the assault on Social Security \nis reason enough to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  And make no mistake, Mr. President.\n  The unwillingness to formally exempt it from the proposed \nconstitutional language is nothing less than an assault on Social \nSecurity.\n  The opponents of this exemption want those funds, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, it is unlikely that we will hear a plain statement to \nthat effect here on the floor.\n  Other reasons will be provided.\n  But the bottom line is that the opponents of exempting Social \nSecurity in a constitutional amendment want to be able to tap into \nSocial Security revenues for the rest of Government.\n  To a certain extent, we already have that.\n  The so-called unified budget includes the Social Security surpluses \nwith the on-budget deficit to reduce our apparent budget deficit.\n  I do not single out one party; both Democrats and Republicans have \nused that technique.\n  To date, it has been a bookkeeping maneuver.\n  But in a few years, when the Social Security Program begins to draw \non the surpluses that have built up over the past several years, the \nfree ride will stop, and many of the favorite spending programs of the \nadvocates of the constitutional amendment will be at risk.\n  Programs which have been so successful in escaping the budget \nscalpel, including our bloated defense budget and the billions in \nwasteful spending done through the Tax Code, may finally be asked to \njustify themselves a little more carefully.\n  Mr. President, it is precisely that moment that those who oppose \nexcluding Social Security from the constitutional amendment are \nanticipating.\n  I fear that many would prefer to put Social Security on the block \nrather than ask these other areas to bear their fair share of reducing \nthe deficit.\n  Mr. President, some may argue that current law provides adequate \nprotection for Social Security, or that if the balanced budget \namendment is ratified, Social Security can be protected as part of \nimplementing legislation.\n  We should recall, though, that many of those who make that argument \nalso maintain that mere statutory mandates are insufficient to move \nCongress to do what it needs to do.\n  They argue that only constitutional authority is sufficient to \nengender the will necessary to reduce the deficit.\n  Using the reasoning of the supporters of the balanced budget \namendment, the willpower needed to resist the temptation to raid the \nSocial Security cookie jar can only come from a constitutional mandate.\n  Those who oppose giving this extra, constitutional protection for \nSocial Security often suggest that there is no practical need for the \nprotection because Social Security will compete very well with other \nprograms.\n  Let me respond to that argument with two comments.\n  First, Social Security should not have to compete with anything.\n  As many have noted, it is a separate program with a dedicated funding \nsource, intended to be self-funding.\n  Second, any assessment of the political potency of any particular \nprogram must be reappraised when we enter the brave new world of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  One prominent Governor was reported as suggesting that areas many \nclaim are untouchable should be subject to cuts.\n  Specifically including Social Security in that list, this Governor \nworried that\n\n       Otherwise, the states are going to bear a disproportionate \n     share. We're the ones who are going to have to raise taxes.\n\n  And in a moment of revealing honesty, another Governor argued that \nSocial Security must be asked to shoulder the burden of reducing the \ndeficit.\n\n  Reports quote him as saying that to take Social Security off the \ntable, and then impose a burden on other spending systems is not going \nto be acceptable.\n  There can be no more revealing statement of intent by many of those \nwho oppose constitutionally separating Social Security than this \nstatement.\n  Given the growing support of State-based approaches to problems--a \ndevelopment I applaud--as well as the resurgent influence of States on \nFederal policy, how can anyone confidently predict that Social Security \nwill remain untouched while we cut programs in which States have a \nsignificant interest.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is fiscally and politically a special \nprogram.\n  Apart from the fiscal problems of not excluding Social Security, the \nspecial political nature of the program makes it worthy of protection.\n  Social Security is singular as a public contract between the people \nof the United States and their elected government.\n  The elected government promised that if workers and their employers \npaid into the Social Security fund, they would be able to draw upon \nthat fund when they retired.\n  But the singular nature of Social Security, and the special regard in \nwhich it is held by the public, does not flow from some transitory \nnostalgia.\n  Social Security has provided real help for millions of seniors.\n  According to the Kerrey-Danforth Bipartisan Entitlement Commission, \nthe poverty rate for senior households is about 13 percent, but without \nSocial Security, it could increase to as much as 50 percent.\n  For almost half of the senior households below the poverty line, \nSocial Security provides at least 90 percent of total income.\n  For those seniors, and for millions of others, the Social Security \ncontract is very real and vitally necessary.\n  Anything other than partitioning Social Security off from the rest of \nthe budget risks a breach of that public contract.\n  Mr. President, some may try to characterize the proposed exemption \nfor Social Security in a possible balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution as pandering to senior citizens.\n  With that assertion is the implication that somehow there is \nsomething wrong with older Americans who want their Social Security \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n  But, Mr. President, I do agree with those proponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment who argue that no one will touch the benefits of \ntoday's retirees.\n  Today's retirees are not at risk if the balanced budget amendment \npasses without exempting Social Security.\n  However, there are three generations that are very much at risk.\n  The first is my own generation--the baby boomers.\n  If Congress has the ability to monkey around with Social Security \nbenefits, under cover of a constitutional mandate, I can guarantee you \nthere will not be anything left when the baby boomer generation reaches \nretirement age.\n  There are a lot of Americans in that generation, and they also have a \nright to the benefits that they paid for and were told they were going \nto get by participating in this system.\n  Mr. President, a second generation is very concerned about the future \nof Social Security.\n  They are young adults in their late twenties and early thirties--the \nso-called Generation X.\n  They are skeptical of there being any Social Security system on which \nto rely when they retire.\n  They see today's retirees, and the huge group of baby boomers ahead \nof them, and they are concerned that the system into which they are now \npaying will not be around when they need it.\n  Mr. President, there is a third generation--the generation of my \nchildren.\n  They do not understand all of this debate.\n  But some are aware of the big Federal deficit we have.\n  And some are coming to realize that as they graduate from high school \nand go into the work force, they will be the ultimate victims of our \nfiscal irresponsibility if we do not protect Social Security.\n  For those three generations, the future health of the Social Security \nsystem is a real concern.\n  One of the most important results of the Kerrey-Danforth Entitlement \nCommission was to highlight this issue, and as I have mentioned on \nother occasions, I for one am willing to consider some of the proposals \nput forward by that commission to help ensure the long-term health of \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. President, if we are ever to address the long-term solvency of \nSocial Security in an honest way, especially in the context of a \nconstitutional balanced budget requirement, keeping Social Security \nseparate is vital.\n  Just as a Social Security system that is enmeshed in the rest of the \nFederal budget poses a temptation when the system is in surplus, so too \nwill it become an enormous drain on resources if it starts to compete \nfor general revenue.\n  Providing a constitutional partition will serve both to protect \nSocial Security, and to highlight the need for long-term reform.\n  Mr. President, those who advocate a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution frequently argue that it is needed if we are to protect \nour children and grandchildren.\n  How ironic if in the name of helping those children and grandchildren \nwe deny them the protection of Social Security.\n  We risk taking away the same rights and protections that so many of \nus hope to enjoy.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Now we \nare in the situation where at the end of the day, we ask unanimous \nconsent that they would have sat during the course of the day.\n  I understand now that this was in order for earlier today. But I want \nto make it very clear that I raised this at an earlier time. If the \nSenate does not get the clearance, the chairmen pay the bills. That is \na good order for why we require this to be done beforehand, whether it \nis our side or their side. I just want to make sure. We are dealing \nwith a lot of very important legislation as we are going on. I have not \nobjected to committee meetings. But I want to make it very clear that \nwe are going to preserve that institutional right where overriding \nother ones that will be addressed as well. But we are not going to get \ninto a situation where we are clearing at the end of the day, whether \nit is on our side or theirs.\n  I will not object at this time.

The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate the desire addressed \njust now by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I had indicated to \nthe majority leader that it was not our desire tonight to bring up \nminimum wage in an effort to expedite some of these other immigration-\nrelated amendments. We have that understanding.\n  It may be that we do not have a colleague here tonight to offer the \namendments that I anticipated at least on our side. But that was my \nintention.\n  I want to emphasize, as well, what the Senator from Massachusetts has \nsaid so ably. It is our desire to continue to press for a minimum wage \namendment and a vote. We will not do it tonight--not under these \ncircumstances. But it is our desire to continue to find a way with \nwhich to get an up-or-down vote. We want it sooner rather than later. \nLet us hope we can do it sometime very soon. But with the understanding \nthat I had with the majority leader, tonight we certainly want to \naccommodate our colleagues providing an opportunity to offer other \namendments. We are prepared to do that tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate those remarks by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader. I did understand that agreement \nhad been reached with the leader. I appreciate the minority leader \ncoming back out and clarifying the situation--that we would go forward \nwith some amendments tonight related to the immigration bill which is \npending. I think we have at least one Senator who is ready to offer an \namendment, and maybe others that relate to the immigration bill. So we \nare prepared to go forward.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me assure colleagues, too, as Senator \nKennedy has assured, that there will be no amendment with regard to \nminimum wage, there will be no amendment tonight of mine with regard to \nthe issue of numbers and legal immigration as expressed by the majority \ncommission. The issue will come up tomorrow. But if we can take \namendments tonight while there are still some of us here, we are \nprepared to do that.

Mr. President, this is an amendment which we offered in the \nsubcommittee which Senator Kennedy and I worked on, and I believe that \nwe have reached an agreement on this matter of immunization.\n  I note that I have two other amendments. But I think Senator Kennedy \nwould have an interest in both of them. So if he is going to have to \nleave, I will defer offering those amendments until he has an \nopportunity to be here.\n  Might I inquire of Senator Kennedy? After we do the immunization \namendment, it is my intention to offer two other amendments. But I \nbelieve the Senator from Massachusetts would have an interest in both \nof them. Would he prefer that we offer those tomorrow?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is very kind. I was going to be absent for a \nshort while. Senator Simon is coming, and then I was coming back at \n8:30 so we can continue through it. I think we have worked this out.\n  I appreciate the cooperative efforts of the Senator from Arizona. \nThese are issues involving immunization, legitimacy of immunization, \nand public health matters related thereto. We have worked out those \nmeasures.\n  I think really the problem was because of lack of proper \nimmunization, and we wanted to address that particular question. We \nhave worked out an accommodation on that program. We are hopeful that \nwe would get acceptance of this amendment, but if the Senator wanted to \nproceed, I believe, on the others, if I could just go over them, review \nthem quickly, I will be in touch.\n  Mr. KYL. I will be very brief in describing this amendment, and we \ncan lay it aside.\n  The next one that I would propose to offer relates to public housing \nand the qualification for being able to receive public housing. That \none there may be some difference of opinion on because the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development agrees with all of the amendment \nexcept they would prefer a 6-month rather than 3-month qualification \nperiod. My amendment tracks the House of Representatives, specifically \nthe amendment which was adopted there as part of the managers' \namendment and provided for a 3-month qualification period.\n  Perhaps, as I am describing in more detail the immunization \namendment, the Senator or his staff would determine how they want to \nproceed.\n  Very briefly, this immunization amendment, which was tentatively \napproved in the Immigration Subcommittee, simply requires that an \nindividual applying for permanent residency status must be immunized \nfor vaccine-preventable diseases.\n  To give you an idea of what it would require, before a visa is \napproved, an individual applying for permanent residency status must \nreceive a vaccination assessment or be vaccinated against measles and \npolio for those under 5 years of age and any other vaccination \ndetermined necessary by Health and Human Services before they arrive in \nthe United States.\n  Aliens who have not received the entire series of vaccinations as \nrecommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices--and \nthis includes a list of about 10 different particular diseases--would \nbe required to return within 30 days of entry to the United States to a \ncivil surgeon to receive these vaccinations. Mumps is actually required \nbefore entry into the United States.\n  To recover costs of establishing and administering the civil surgeon \nand panel physician programs, the Attorney General would be required to \nimpose a fee on aliens applying for permanent resident status.\n  Currently, when any of the approximately 800,000 legal immigrants \narrive annually in the United States, they are not required to be \nimmunized against vaccine-preventable diseases. This amendment will \nhelp ensure that immigrants receive the recommended immunizations.\n\n  It should not present a financial difficulty for the immigrant. The \nestimated cost for all childhood vaccines is estimated to be $248.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has made immunization of \nthe U.S. population a top priority and by the year 2000 hopes to \neradicate or reduce infinitely vaccine-preventable diseases.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is needed to prevent the spread of \nthese\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\ndiseases. I believe it has the support of everyone.\n  Unless there is further discussion on this, I would inquire of the \nSenator from Wyoming what procedure he would like to follow with \nrespect to moving on to additional amendments and call for votes since \nI doubt that this would need a vote.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it would be a wonderful opportunity to do \nsomething, but I will not. Senator Kennedy is absent from the Chamber.\n  I understand that Senator Simon will be here to deal with the issues \nthat might arise if we can do some further business. But I believe, if \nI heard what transpired, we might adopt the amendment, and we will then \nhave a quorum call until a Member of the Democratic Party is here.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KYL. I will not call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3735) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, late this afternoon the conference committee \non the five major appropriations bills had a breakthrough and reached \nan agreement. I want to reinforce what has been said by other Members \nof leadership and by Chairman Hatfield, Chairman Livingston on the \nHouse side, and their Democratic counterparts.\n  In my view, after a long, long difficult process, I believe we have a \npackage that can be supported by hopefully nearly everybody on both \nsides of the aisle. Some will complain the cuts are not deep enough. \nOthers are going to complain the cuts go too far. But I believe that in \nthe final analysis we will save about $23 billion over the last fiscal \nyear through the appropriations process. That is very significant. That \nis a lot of money.\n  That is an indication that the appropriations process has worked and \nwe can make reductions, the Government can continue even though we make \nreductions. Many of us hoped we could do better.\n  There are also a number of environmental issues that were resolved to \nthe satisfaction, I believe, of most everyone in the conference. Some \nwill be raised again on subsequent appropriations bills. But I wanted \nto take a moment to thank all those who were involved in the \nnegotiations and all those who were willing to give and take so that \nthis matter could be resolved and get it behind us.\n  It is time to move on to 1997 appropriations. We look forward to \nthat. We hope we can pass all the appropriations bills by August 1 of \nthis year. So keep in mind, we will take this up tomorrow. The House \nwill act first. We hope to dispose of it before we go out tomorrow \nevening. We need to dispose of it before we go out tomorrow evening. \nBut the bottom line is, according to those who have been keeping track \nof the numbers, we will save $23 billion this fiscal year because of \nthe appropriators and the appropriations process and their good work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

EXCLUSION GROUNDS FOR OFFENSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, \n                   STALKING, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN, AND CRIMES \n                   OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 241(a)(2) (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) Domestic violence, violation of protection order, \n     crimes against children and stalking.--(i) Any alien who at \n     any time after entry is convicted of a crime of domestic \n     violence is deportable.\n       ``(ii) Any alien who at any time after entry engages in \n     conduct that violates the portion of a protection order that \n     involves protection against credible threats of violence, \n     repeated harassment, or bodily injury to the person or \n     persons for whom the protection order was issued is \n     deportable.\n       ``(iii) Any alien who at any time after entry is convicted \n     of a crime of stalking is deportable.\n       ``(iv) Any alien who at any time after entry is convicted \n     of a crime of child abuse, child sexual abuse, child neglect, \n     or child abandonment is deportable.\n       ``(F) Crimes of sexual violence.--Any alien who at any time \n     after entry is convicted of a crime of rape, aggravated \n     sodomy, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual \n     contact, or other crime of sexual violence is deportable.''.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 101(a) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(47) The term `crime of domestic' means any felony or \n     misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or \n     former spouse of the victim, by a person with whom the victim \n     shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with \n     or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, by a person \n     similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction where \n     the offense occurs, or by any other adult person against a \n     victim who is protected from that person's acts under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the United States or any \n     State, Indian tribal government, or unit of local government.\n       ``(48) The term `protection order' means any injunction \n     issued for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening \n     acts of domestic violence, including temporary or final \n     orders issued by civil or criminal courts (other than support \n     or child custody orders or provisions) whether obtained by \n     filing an independent action or as a pendente lite order in \n     another proceeding.''.\n       (c) This section will become effective one day after the \n     date of enactment of the Act.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, aliens are deportable for criminal \noffenses under section 241(a)(2) under four broad headings: General \ncrime, controlled substances, certain firearm offenses, and \nmiscellaneous crimes. This proposed amendment to S. 1664 creates two \nnew headings: Domestic violence, violation of a protection order, \ncrimes against children, and stalking. The other heading, crimes of \nsexual violence.\n  We are adding as offenses for grounds for deportation, the following \noffenses: Conviction of a crime of domestic violence; violation of a \njudicial protection order in a domestic violence context; conviction \nfor stalking; conviction for child abuse, child sexual abuse, child \nnegligence, or child abandonment; conviction of rape, aggravated \nsodomy, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact, \nor other crimes of sexual violence.\n  Mr. President, while some of these offenses may be deportable under \nexisting headings of crimes of moral turpitude or aggravated felony, \nthey are not necessarily covered. Uniformity is also a problem. Whether \na crime is one of\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nmoral turpitude is a question of State law and thus varies from State \nto State. An offense may be deportable in one State and not deportable \nin another. Misdemeanor offenses would not be covered under existing \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, under our amendment, stalkers would be deportable on \ntheir first offense. The second offense may be too late for their \nvictims, who could well be injured or dead as a result.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that over 200,000 women are stalked \neach year in the United States. Approximately 5 percent of all women \nwill be stalked at some time in their lives. Investigations by State \nchild protective service agencies in 48 States determined that 1.12 \nmillion children were victims of child abuse and negligence in 1994. \nThis represents a 27 percent increase since 1990 when approximately \n800,000 children were found to be victims of maltreatment.\n  Among the children, Mr. President, for whom maltreatment was \nsubstantiated or indicated in 1994, 53 percent suffered negligence, 26 \npercent physical abuse, 14 percent sexual abuse, 5 percent emotional \nabuse, and 3 percent medical negligence.\n  Mr. President, this is a good amendment. Mr. President, this will \nprotect women and children in our society. As I said, it will have a \nvery positive affect on the ability to deport an alien involved with \nthese offenses that we are adding through these two new headings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, a number of \ncriminal offenses are deemed deportable offenses. However, although \naliens are deportable for criminal offenses, there are a number of \ncrimes that should be grounds for deportation that are left \nunaddressed; and the wording of the statute itself uses vague language \nlike crimes of moral turpitude that lack the certainty we should \ndesire.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Coverdell and myself seeks to remedy \nthis problem by making clear that our society will not tolerate crimes \nagainst women and children. The criminal law should be a reflection of \nthe best of our values, and it is important that we not only send a \nmessage that we will protect our citizens against these assaults, but \nthat we back it up as well.\n  Under our amendment, certain criminal offenses would be grounds for \ndeportation. These offenses include: conviction of a crime of domestic \nviolence; violation of a judicial protection order in a domestic \nviolence context; conviction for stalking; conviction for child abuse, \nchild sexual abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment, and conviction \nof rape, aggravated sodomy, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, \nabusive sexual contact, or other crimes of sexual violence.\n\n\n                      crimes of domestic violence\n\n  Adding these additional and specified categories of offenses closes \nthe existing loopholes. Many crimes, ranging from simple assault to \nmurder can be committed in a domestic violence context. Simple assault \nor assault and battery are not necessarily going to be interpreted as \ncrimes of moral turpitude. Yet, because they may not otherwise fall \nwithin the other definitions--such as an aggravated felony--of \ndeportable offenses, an alien convicted of such a crime might not be \ndeported.\n  Our amendment would cover all convictions for domestic violence \noffenses, including those for which a sentence of less than 1 year is \navailable.\n\n\n                    violation of a protective order\n\n  In many States, protective orders in domestic violence situations \nhave been ineffective due to problems with enforceability and \ninsufficient penalties for violations. This is undoubtedly one reason \nall 50 States have passed anti-stalking legislation.\n  Greater attention to the problem has influenced a number of States to \nmake violation of a protective order a separate criminal offense. \nHowever, making violation of a protective order a grounds for \ndeportation will put more teeth into such an order.\n  The amendment does not require a conviction of violating protection \norder and thus would cover violations even in States where violating an \norder is not a separate criminal offense. This is an important loophole \nthat must be closed.\n\n\n                                stalking\n\n  It is long past time to stop the vicious act of stalking in our \ncountry. We cannot prevent in every case the often justified fear that \ntoo often haunts our citizens. But we can make sure that any alien that \ncommits such an act we no longer remain within our borders.\n  It is estimated that over 200,000 women are stalked each year in the \nUnited States. Approximately 5 percent of all women will be stalked at \nsome point in their lives. Stalking behavior often leads to violence \nwhich may result in the serious injury or death of stalking victims.\n  Stalkers often repeat their stalking behavior and escalate to \nviolence. Of all the women killed in the United States by husbands or \nboyfriends, 90 percent were stalked before being murdered.\n  But since stalking laws are fairly new, they may not be defined as \ncrimes of moral turpitude in many States--they thus may not be covered \nby existing law. Similarly, in many States, the maximum penalty for \nstalking is less than 1 year--which strikes me as far too little--and \ntherefore an alien may be convicted of a stalking offense and yet not \nbe deported.\n  We can't wait for stalkers to strike a second time. Let's deport them \nthe first time.\n  Mr. President, we face the same kinds of problems with existing law \nwhen we confront other crimes against women and children. While some of \nthese offenses may be deportable under the existing headings of crimes \nof moral turpitude or aggravated felony, they are not necessarily and \nalways covered. They should be.\n  Uniformity is also a problem. Whether a crime is one of moral \nturpitude is a question of State law and thus varies from State to \nState. An offense may be deportable in one State and not deportable in \nanother.\n  Mr. President, America already bears a horrendous burden when it \ncomes to the level of violence among our citizens. It is not asking too \nmuch that we insist that we treat crimes against women and children as \nseriously as we do other offenses. Nor should we have to wait for that \nlast violent act. When someone is an alien and has already shown a \npredisposition toward violence against women and children, we should \nget rid of them the first time. We owe that much to our citizens.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I was just shown this amendment a few \nminutes ago by Senator Coverdell and Senator Dole. I have every reason \nto believe that we can work out, if not this specific language, some \nmodification to do this. I commend my colleague from Georgia for the \namendment.\n  I ask, and we have an understanding on this, I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be set aside until tomorrow.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I also acknowledge that the Senator \nfrom Illinois has only had a brief moment to scan the outline of the \namendment. We understand that and have agreed to set it aside so there \nis a more appropriate period of time for his side to view the contents \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is laid aside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4058-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

This year's \ndinner raised money for the Yankee Foundation, and paid special tribute \nto one of the Yankees' and indeed one of pro baseball's great players, \nthe late Mickey Mantle. Former and current Yankees along with their \nfriends and family will be on hand.\n  The Yankee Foundation raises money for youth programs and youth \norganizations throughout the Greater New York City area. The Yankees' \nprincipal owner George Steinbrenner presented the traditional ``Pride \nof the Yankees'' award to Mr. James M. Benson, president and chief \noperating officer of the Equitable Life Insurance Society. Mr. Benson \nreceived this honor\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nfor his tireless work on behalf of the numerous philanthropic causes \nthe Yankees are involved in.\n  Mr. William Denis Fugazy of Fugazy International also deserves \nmention. I know Bill Fugazy. He has been the general chairman of this \ndinner since its inception. Through Bill Fugazy's leadership, many \nyoung people have been given a chance to participate in some of the \nyouth programs supported by the Yankees. The opportunity to participate \nin these programs helps young people develop skills which they can \ncarry with them always. It is good to see sports franchises like the \nNew York Yankees offer their communities more than just baseball games, \nand associate themselves with quality people like Bill Fugazy.\n  This year's dinner also honored the late great Mickey Mantle. All of \nus know of his well chronicled, storied career. Many of us followed his \nachievements on the field when we were kids. From his exciting rookie \nyear through his triple crown, and MVP years, all of the World Series \nin which he participated, to his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame, \nMantle provided many exciting memories for young and old fans alike. \nFew would disagree that he will remain the Pride of the Yankees, and \nall of baseball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4059-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the victims of the \nArmenian genocide, the first such crime against a people in the 20th \ncentury.\n  On April 24, 1915, 81 years ago today, the Ottoman Turkish Empire \nbegan the systematic rounding up and slaughter of Armenian \nintellectuals, clergy, businessmen, and other leaders of the community. \nUltimately the horror claimed 1\\1/2\\ million lives and resulted in the \nexile of Armenians from much of their historic homeland in Asia Minor.\n  I like to think that some good can come from even the most horrifying \nevil. In this case a large segment of the Armenian diaspora, banished \nfrom its ancestral home, reached these shores. They and their \ndescendents have immeasurably enriched the United States of America. In \nremembering the martyrdom of their fellow Armenians eight decades ago, \nwe are also paying tribute to Armenian-Americans--to their patriotism, \nand to their many contributions to this land of freedom.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately there are some who would trivialize the \nArmenian genocide or even attempt to deny that it ever took place, just \nas there remain a twisted few who continue to deny the Holocaust that \nclaimed 6 million Jews.\n  But, Mr. President, there is no denying the undeniable. The Armenians \nin the Ottoman Empire were not murdered because they were talented \nbusinessmen. They were not butchered because their community produced \noutstanding intellectuals. They were not slaughtered for any \nsocioeconomic reason, however perverted. No, the Armenians were \nmurdered because they were Armenians. This Mr. President, was genocide.\n  Unfortunately, genocide is a recurring fact of the 20th century. \nFifteen years after the Armenian genocide occurred, Stalin began his \ninsane collectivization that decimated the Ukrainian people.\n  I have already mentioned the Nazis' extermination of 6 million Jews \nin the Holocaust.\n  The 1970's witnessed Cambodia's killing fields where a significant \nproportion of the Khmer people perished.\n  The 1990's have seen the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda and the \nunspeakable horrors perpetrated upon Bosnian Muslims, cynically given \nthe euphemism, ethnic cleansing.\n  Mr. President, we must endeavor to ensure that these vile deeds are \nnever repeated yet another time. The first step in that process is to \nensure that the memory of genocide is kept alive so that the truth will \nprevail over the purveyors of historical lies. The Holocaust memorial \nMuseum here in Washington is serving a vital function in that regard.\n  Similarly, the proposed Armenian Genocide Memorial Museum of America \npromises to be an important vehicle for preserving and disseminating \nthe truth.\n  On this solemn day of remembrance, I join millions of other Americans \nin commemorating the martyrdom of the Armenians and praying that their \neternal sacrifice shall not have been in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4060-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4060-S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ``LEGISLATING THE REVOLUTION''--HISTORY OF THE 104TH CONGRESS' FIRST \n                                100 DAYS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, having written two books myself, I \nappreciate the great time and energy involved in preparing, \nresearching, and writing a book, especially one recounting a complex \nseries of historical events. As an enthusiast and lifelong student of \nhistory, I am pleased to bring to my colleagues' attention \n``Legislating the Revolution,'' by James G. Gimpel. Jim is a native of \nwestern South Dakota. His thorough recounting of the Contract With \nAmerica during the first 100 days of this Congress so impressed me that \nI hope my colleagues will take the opportunity to read it.\n  The book is fair, factual, and comprehensive. Appealing to a spectrum \nof readers ranging from the social scientist to the concerned citizen, \nJim's book already is being used in college classrooms across the \ncountry as a resource and reference book. After countless interviews \nwith Members of Congress, congressional staff, interest group \nrepresentatives, pollsters and party leadership, the product is a \ndetailed, thoughtful chronological record of the events which shaped \nthe so-called Contract With America. The book examines the many \nindividuals who, behind the scenes, created the Contract itself and the \ncampaign that played such a significant part in the Republican takeover \nof Congress in November 1994. The first 100 days of the 104th Congress \nmay have been history in the making, but the period prior to the \nContract With America was a new and equally historic era. Republicans \nhad not controlled both Houses of Congress simultaneously for more than \n40 years. The late House Speaker Tip O'Neil coined the famous phrase, \n``All politics is local.'' The Contract With America challenged that \nnotion by nationalizing the congressional elections and unifying the \nRepublican Party around common goals.\n  Jim Gimpel's examination of Republican and Democratic National \nCommittee fundraising and campaigning, party and committee leadership, \nSouthern Democratic influence and the mass electoral revolution, \npresents readers with a cornucopia of information and an understanding \nof the historic scope of the 1994 Congressional Revolution. He offers \nan overview of the efforts to pass the Contract in Congress, examining \nvoting records and providing political analysis. The detailed accounts \nof the voting and the behind-the-scenes efforts made on both sides of \nthe aisle paint a dramatic picture of the grueling give-and-take that \nproduced unprecedented legislation. Through a series of theory testing, \ngraphical representation, voting distributions, and the Perot factor, \nGimpel thoroughly explains the background and the planks of the \nContract With America, and forecasts the implications of these efforts \non future elections and legislation.\n  Although Jim Gimpel covers each plank in the Contract with America, I \nwould like to highlight several areas of personal interest, first, the \nFiscal Responsibility Act and second, the Personal Responsibility Act. \nJim's analysis of the balanced budget amendment and term limits--the \nFiscal Responsibility Act--was outstanding. Jim offers a truly \ncompelling and easy to grasp explanation of the importance of a \nbalanced budget for the United States. As more and more Americans are \nbeginning to realize, if the Federal Government continues to spend \nbeyond our means, more and more of our taxes must finance debt \nrepayment, instead of important programs such as agriculture, \neducation, Social Security, and veterans programs. Jim brings this \nvital point home clearly and effectively.\n  He is equally clear and effective in his coverage of the welfare \nreform debate. As we all know, the original intent of the welfare \nsystem was to provide a simple safety net for the needy. The reality is \nthe opposite: The current system acts as a harness holding down the \nrecipients from taking personal responsibility for their own lives. \nJim's tracking of the history, legislation, debates, and votes that \nproduced the\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nHouse welfare reform bill--Personal Responsibility Act--is precise and \naccurate. I know my constituents would find this chapter of particular \ninterest, if not shocking. South Dakotans work hard every day to \nprovide for their families without Government assistance. They pride \nthemselves on hard work, but as the book points out, the failed welfare \nsystem promotes costly dependency. Jim offers more than just a \nlegislative history of this sensitive issue. He demonstrates the basic \nsocial need that requires Congress to act on this problem.\n  The importance of history cannot adequately be underscored. History--\nthe understanding of history--is our map of not only our past, but also \nour future. ``Legislating the Revolution'' is a compelling map of an \nexciting past and an extraordinary future for policy-makers and voters. \nIt is a must read for every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4060-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today, I join with many of our \ncolleagues in commemorating the 81st anniversary of the Armenian \ngenocide. Today marks the exact day when 200 of the Armenia's academic, \npolitical, and religious leaders were taken from the city of Istanbul \nin 1915. The ability of Armenians to free themselves from the Ottoman \nEmpire rested heavily on the plans and ideas of those who vanished. It \nwas an ominous beginning to one of this century's darkest tragedies. \nThis Senate should recognize and all Americans should remember, what \noccurred over there 81 years ago. That is why I stand here with my \ncolleagues to urge an accurate remembrance of the past, of those who \nwere slain by the Ottoman Turks, and plead that such hateful crimes \nagainst humanity never happen again. We stand in honor of those who \nwere unable to take a stand 81 years ago today. We must try to heal the \nwounds of the past by remembering and recording the historical truths.\n  The Ottoman Empire's actions--deliberate, planned, and deceitful \nactions--against the Armenian people should be remembered for what it \nactually was--genocide. The Armenian genocide was a hateful act whose \nobjective was focused on the systematic annihilation of a people, their \nheritage, their culture, their identity, and their future. It is \nunfortunate that in recent years historians and politicians alike have \ntried to soften the terms used to describe this heinous crime against \nhumanity. What occurred involves deportation, slavery, the loss of \nbasic human rights, and wholesale murder--all targeted deliberately and \nmethodically against one ethnic group. The record is clear. Genocide is \ngenocide. To shy away from recognizing the Armenian genocide is to \nignore and deny the historic truth, and that would put at risk the \nharsh lessons that must be learned if we are to avoid repeating that \ntragic history. The Armenians remember, but all must recognize and \nembrace the past, painful as it may be. It is said that the bitter \npills of the past are the better tonics of a brighter future.\n  About 600,000 Americans who consider themselves to be Armenians live \nin the United States. Many are survivors of the genocide, or are the \nchildren of survivors. About 1.5 million Armenians were killed or died \nduring the mass deportation which began in 1915 and continued for many \nyears. Two-thirds of all Armenians in Turkey were killed. In the region \nof Anatolia and western Armenia, the entire community of Armenians was \nextinguished or deported.\n  It has been 81 years since that awful tragedy. Turkey has not \napologized to the Armenians. That is unfortunate.\n  Armenians are a strong, resilient people, struggling to heal the \nwounds of the past. But the wounds cannot be sealed until the story is \ncomplete. Until the Armenian genocide is officially acknowledged, the \nwounds will remain unhealed and the lessons will not be firmly learned. \nWe do not deny the brutal nature of the Holocaust to the Jewish-\nAmerican community. We are coming to grips with the severe violence \nagainst the people of Bosnia. We should not deny the Armenian people a \nsimilar place in history. To do so would dishonor ourselves, and spoil \naccurate understanding of the past. It is in the best interest of the \nAmerican people and the entire global community to remember the past \naccurately. That is why we commemorate and honor those who were \naffected by the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4061-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today marks the 81st anniversary of the \nArmenian Genocide. As Armenians gather worldwide today to commemorate \nthe anniversary, I rise to pay tribute to the victims of this tragedy. \nAlthough some still refuse to recognize historical fact, there should \nbe no doubt that the Armenian people suffered the first genocide of the \nmodern age.\n  As many of my colleagues know, between the years 1915-23, 1.5 million \nArmenians were subjected to systematic extermination through a policy \nof deportation, torture, starvation, and massacre. At the time, the \nworld recognized that the Ottoman Empire had committed a crime against \nhumanity, though the term ``genocide'' would not be coined until years \nlater. The United States condemned the brutal treatment of the \nArmenians. The United States rendered humanitarian assistance to many \nof the survivors in the largest relief effort every organized by this \ncountry. Yet even with all the facts that we have before us, most of \nwhich have been compiled by U.S. sources, some still refuse to \nacknowledge that there was a genocide.\n  Most of us are willing to look history in the eye and see the danger \nof closing our eyes and hearts to the truth of the tragedy which took \nplace. We will not cease in our efforts to remember what happened. This \nyear, along with 25 of my colleagues, I signed a bipartisan letter \nurging the President to use the word ``genocide'' in his statement \ncommemorating the anniversary. Mr. President, while nearly every other \nnation recognizes the Genocide, one nation still insists that the \nGenocide never happened--the Government of Turkey. As I have stated in \nthe past, no responsibility for the history of the Genocide rests with \neither the Turkish people or their modern-day government. The Ottoman \nEmpire, which committed the Genocide against the Armenians, has not \nexisted since October 19, 1923. As Operation Desert Storm again \ndemonstrated, Turkey is an important friend and partner to the United \nStates, and we highly value our friendship with the Turkish Government \nand people. That friendship would not suffer from, and in fact, would \nbe strengthened, by recognizing the fact of the Armenian Genocide.\n  At a time when the world is beset by problems, including acts of \ngenocide, the United States cannot fail to send a unified message. Only \nby issuing a clear statement on genocide can the United States convey \nto the world our Nation's resolve and determination to prevent such \ncrimes from recurring. We cannot allow history to dictate the future, \nbut neither can we forget history nor turn our backs on the truth. On \nthis 81st anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, let all of us as \nAmericans, even as we remember the tragic events of the past, \nrededicate ourselves to making sure it never happens again. Finally, I \nwould add that President Clinton has just issued his statement \ncommemorating the anniversary of the Genocide. It is unfortunate that \nunlike his statement in 1992, this year's statement does not use the \nhistorically correct word of ``genocide'' to describe what happened to \nthe Armenian people from 1915 to 1923.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our letter to the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This year marks the 81st anniversary of \n     the Armenian Genocide. Armenian-Americans throughout the \n     United States and the world will be commemorating this event \n     on April 24th.\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\n       As you know, the Armenian people of the Ottoman Empire were \n     subjected to a ruthless, systematic and well-organized policy \n     of deportation, confiscation of property, slave labor, denial \n     of basic rights and, ultimately, murder. It is estimated that \n     a million and a half Armenians eventually perished. The world \n     recognized at the time that a crime against humanity had been \n     committed. The United States condemned the brutal treatment \n     of the Armenians and rendered humanitarian assistance to many \n     of the survivors in the largest relief effort ever organized \n     by this country.\n       This year, in a bi-partisan initiative, members of Congress \n     will again call on you to reaffirm the Armenian Genocide as a \n     crime against humanity. We believe there is a difference \n     between using the word ``massacres'', rather than the word \n     ``genocide'', to describe the systematic annihilation of 1.5 \n     million Armenians. This is a distinction between a random \n     series of atrocities and a methodical, ethnically-based \n     policy of extermination. The historical record--much of it \n     compiled from American sources--clearly indicates that the \n     latter description reflects the truth.\n       Mr. President, the survivors and their descendants, who now \n     number one million Americans, have not forgotten the Armenian \n     Genocide. We again ask you to issue a clear and unambiguous \n     statement reaffirming the Armenian Genocide as a crime \n     against humanity.\n       At a time when the world is beset by problems, including \n     acts of genocide, the United States cannot fail to send a \n     unified message that can prevent future acts of inhumanity. \n     Only by issuing such a statement can the United States convey \n     to the world our nation's resolve and determination to \n     prevent such crimes from recurring.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bob Dole, Olympia Snowe, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Larry \n           Pressler, Chuck Robb, Mike DeWine, Jesse Helms, Alfonse \n           D'Amato, John Ashcroft, Frank R.

A bill to amend the independent counsel statute to require \nthat an individual appointed to be an independent counsel must agree to \nsuspend any outside legal work or affiliation with a law firm until the \nindividual's service as independent counsel is complete; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n             the independent counsel amendment act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of the distinguished Minority leader and myself that amends the \nindependent counsel statute.\n  In my opinion recent events have made clear that Congress should \nreview the statute providing for the appointment of an independent \ncounsel. The specific problem that concerns me, and which my bill will \naddress, is the perception that an independent counsel who continues to \npractice law and represent clients while serving as independent counsel \nopens himself or herself to charges of conflict of interest resulting \nfrom continued representation of private clients.\n  The bill I am introducing today amends the independent counsel \nstatute to eliminate the possibility that such a conflict of interest \nwill arise by requiring that, upon assuming the duties of independent \ncounsel, an attorney refrain from representing clients until her duties \nas independent counsel have been completed. Additionally, my bill \nrequires that the independent counsel not receive any compensation for \naffiliating with or being employed by an entity that provides \nprofessional legal services during the time of their service as \nindependent counsel.\n  This bill would not apply to the current independent counsel \ninvestigating the Whitewater matter. It would only apply to independent \ncounsels appointed after the effective date of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nPryor pointed out yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the \ncurrent independent counsel, Mr. Starr, has retained the services of \nSam Dash, former chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee and a \nnoted scholar on issues relating to legal ethics to advise Mr. Starr on \nmatters stemming from his continued affiliation with his law firm and \ncontinued representation of clients.\n  Setting aside for a moment the fact that Mr. Starr has seen fit to \nretain Mr. Dash on a part-time basis at a cost to the taxpayers of over \n$166,000, it strikes many as a little odd, Mr. President, that \nan independent counsel has for the first time hired someone to advise \nhim on what is ethical and what is not. It is my understanding from \npublished reports in the Washington Post, the New Yorker, and other \nsources,\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nthat the primary ``ethical'' concern that Mr. Dash is advising the \nWhitewater independent counsel on, is related to issues that have \narisen as a result of Mr. Starr's continued private practice of law and \nhis continued representation of clients who, at the very least, have \nagendas that are diametrically opposed to one of the primary targets of \nthe Whitewater investigation--the Clinton administration. Commenting on \nthe issues that have been raised by Mr. Starr's involvement with the \nBradley Foundation, a conservative foundation that gives money to many \nvirulent critics of the Clinton administration, Ellen Miller, executive \ndirector of the Center for Responsive Politics said, ``But you don't \nhave to scratch far beneath the surface to find not just one but many, \nmany, many conflicts of interest.''\n\n  Mr. President, I am not here to judge the numerous allegations of \nconflicts of interests that have been brought against the current \nWhitewater independent counsel. Those issues need to be addressed by \nthe special panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia which appointed Mr. Starr. However, I do think \nthat the Congress has an opportunity and indeed the obligation to \nensure that the current troubles plaguing Mr. Starr do not plague \nfuture independent counsels.\n  Mr. President, I think that too often we search for complicated \nsolutions to simple problems. We devise complex mechanisms to deal with \nrather straightforward issues. I believe that we can and should avoid \ndoing that in this case. My legislation addresses a serious concern \nwith a simple and straightforward response. Potential conflicts of \ninterest resulting from continued, outside employment by a law firm and \nfrom representation of outside clients can be avoided by simply \nrequiring that the independent counsel devote her fulltime attention to \nthe duties of the independent counsel's office.\n  No one will argue, Mr. President, that the office of independent \ncounsel has not served an important function since the days of \nWatergate. The integrity and impartiality of the office is far too \nimportant to its proper functioning to risk under circumstances like \nthose swirling around the current Whitewater independent counsel. That \nis why I offer this legislation. I am trying by this pro-active \nlegislation to eliminate the need for other independent counsel to hire \nMr. Dash or anyone else to advise them on potential conflicts of \ninterest they might have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STANDARDS OF CONDUCT FOR INDEPENDENT COUNSELS.\n\n       Paragraph (1) of section 594(j) of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Restrictions on employment while independent counsel \n     and appointees are serving.--(A) During the period in which \n     an independent counsel is serving under this chapter, the \n     independent counsel shall not--\n       ``(i) engage in any legal work other than as required for \n     service under this chapter; or\n       ``(ii) receive any compensation for affiliating with or \n     being employed by an entity that provides professional legal \n     services.\n       ``(B) During the period in which an independent counsel is \n     serving under this chapter, any person associated with a firm \n     with which such independent counsel is associated, may not \n     represent in any matter any person involved in any \n     investigation or prosecution under this chapter. During the \n     period in which any person appointed by an independent \n     counsel under subsection (c) is serving in the office of \n     independent counsel, such person may not represent in any \n     matter any person involved in any investigation or \n     prosecution under this chapter.''.\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1699. A bill to establish the National Cave and Karst Research \nInstitute in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       The National Cave and Karst Research Institute Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in December 1994, Congress received the \nNational Cave and Karst Research Institute Study from the National Park \nService. The report studied the feasibility of creating a National Cave \nand Karst Research Institute in the vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns \nNational Park, NM, as directed by Public Law 101-578. Today, I am here \nto introduce a bill which follows the guidelines of that report and \nwhich will establish the National Cave and Karst Research Institute in \nCarlsbad, NM.\n  While other nations have recognized the importance of cave resource \nmanagement information and have sponsored cave and karst research, the \nUnited States has failed, until recently, to appreciate or work to \nunderstand cave and karst systems and their importance. As we approach \nthe 21st century, the protection and management of our water resources \nhas been identified as one of the major issues facing the world. In \nAmerica, the majority of the Nation's freshwater is ground water--of \nwhich 25 percent is located in cave and karst regions.\n  Recent studies have also indicated that caves contain valuable \ninformation related to global climate change, waste disposal, ground \nwater supply and contamination, petroleum recovery, and biomedical \ninvestigations. Caves provide a unique understanding of the historic \nevents of humankind. Further they are considered sacred and have \nreligious significance for American Indians and other native Americans.\n  According to the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act, karst is \ndefined as a landform characterized by sinkholes, caves, dry valleys, \nfluted rocks, enclosed depressions, underground streamways and spring \nresurgences. As a whole, 20 percent of the United States is karst. In \nfact, east of central Oklahoma, 40 percent of the country is karst. Our \nNational Park System manages 58 units with caves and karst features, \nyet academic programs on these systems are virtually nonexistent. Most \nresearch is conducted with little or no funding and the resulting data \nis scattered and often hard to locate. The few cave and karst \norganizations and programs which do exist, have substantially different \nmissions, locations, and funding sources and there is no centralized \nprogram to analyze data or determine future research needs.\n  In 1988, Congress directed the Secretaries of the Interior and \nAgriculture to provide an inventory of caves on Federal lands and to \nprovide for the management and dissemination of information about the \ncaves. That directive has served only to make Federal land management \nagencies more aware of the need for a cave research program and a \nrepository for cave and karst resources. In 1990, Congress further \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the \nNational Park Service, to establish and administer a cave research \nprogram and prepare a proposal for Congress on the feasibility of a \ncentralized National Cave and Karst Research Institute.\n  The National Cave and Karst Research Institute study report to \nCongress was released in December 1994 and not only supports \nestablishing the institute, but lists several serious threats to \ncontinued uninformed management practices. Threats such as: alterations \nin the surface waterflow patterns in karst regions, alterations in or \npollution of water infiltration routes, inappropriately placed toxic \nwaste repositories, and poorly managed or designed sewage systems and \nlandfills. The findings of the report conclude that it is only through \na better understanding of cave resources that we can prevent \ndetrimental impacts to America's natural resources and cave ecosystems.\n  The goals of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute, as \noutlined in the report, would be to further the science of speleology, \nto centralize speleological information, to further interdisciplinary \ncooperation in cave and karst research programs, and to promote \nenvironmentally sound, sustainable resource management practices. These \ngoals would work hand in hand with the proposed objectives of the \ninstitute to establish a comprehensive cave and karst library and \ninformation data base, to sponsor national and international cave and \nkarst symposiums, to develop longterm research studies, to produce \ncave-related educational publications and to develop cooperative \nagreements with all Federal agencies having cave management \nresponsibilities.\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  The vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park is ideal due to the \ncommunity support which already exists for the establishment of the \ninstitute and the diverse cave and karst resources which are found \nthroughout the region.\n  Carlsbad, NM has grown from a small railroad stop on what is now the \nSanta Fe Railroad to a growing city with a population of over 170,000 \nin the tricounty area. It continues to attract new businesses, small \nmanufacturers, retirees, and research facilities, including the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's Carlsbad area office. In addition, Carlsbad \nCaverns National Park attracts over 700,000 visitors per year.\n  The National Cave and Karst Research Institute would be jointly \nadministered by the National Park Service and another public or private \nagency, organization or institution as determined by the Secretary. The \nCarlsbad Department of Development [CDOD], after reviewing the National \nCave and Karst Research Institute study report, has developed proposals \nto obtain financial support from available and supportive \norganizational resources--including personnel, facilities, equipment, \nand volunteers. They further believe that they can obtain serious \nfinancial support from the private sector and would seek a matching \ngrant from the State of New Mexico equal to the available Federal \nfunds.\n  Carlsbad already has in place many of the needed cooperative \ninstitutions, facilities, and volunteers that will work toward the \nsuccess of the National Cave and Karst Institute. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to increase our understanding of \ncave and karst systems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce interstate street gang and organized crime \nactivity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the federal gang violence act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Gang \nViolence Act. I am pleased to be joined in this important effort by \nSenator Feinstein, as well as by Senators Kerry, Harkin, Reid, and \nD'Amato.\n  Gang violence in many of our communities is reaching frightening \nlevels. Recently, Asipeli Mohi, a 17-year-old Utahn, was tried and \nconvicted of the gang-related beating and shooting death of another \nteenager, Aaron Chapman. Why was Aaron Chapman murdered? He was wearing \nred, apparently the color of a rival gang. Ironically, Mr. Chapman was \non his way home from attending an antigang benefit concert when he was \nkilled. Before committing this murder, the killer had racked up a \nrecord of 5 felonies and 15 misdemeanors in juvenile court. Sadly, this \nexample of senseless gang violence is not an isolated incident in my \nState or elsewhere. It is a scene replayed daily with disturbing \nfrequency.\n  Gang violence is now common even in places where this would have been \nunthinkable several years ago. Indeed, many people find it hard to \nbelieve that Salt Lake City or Ogden could have such a problem--gangs, \nthey think, are a problem in cities like New York, Chicago, and Los \nAngeles, but not in our smaller cities.\n  However, reality is much grimmer. Since 1992, gang activity in Salt \nLake City has increased tremendously. For instance, the number of \nidentified gangs has increased 55 percent, from 185 to 288, and the \nnumber of gang members has increased 115 percent, from 1,438 to 3,104.\n  The number of gang-related crimes has increased a staggering 388 \npercent, from 1,741 in 1992 to 8,496 in 1995. In 1995, 174 of these \ninvolved drive-by shootings, and in the first quarter of 1996 alone, \nthere were 64 gang-related drive-by shootings.\n  Our problem is severe. Moreover, there is a significant role the \nFederal Government can play in fighting this battle. I am not one to \nadvocate the unbridled extension of Federal jurisdiction. Indeed, I \noften think that we have federalized too many crimes. However, in the \ncase of criminal street gangs, which increasingly are moving interstate \nto commit crimes, there is a very proper role for the Federal \nGovernment to play.\n  This bill will strengthen the coordinated, cooperative response of \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement to criminal street gangs by \nproviding more flexibility to the Federal partners in this effort. \nAmong the important provisions of this bill:\n  This legislation increases the ability of the Federal Government to \nprosecute criminal street gangs that operate interstate or commit \nFederal or State gang related crimes, by updating the criminal gang and \nTravel Act provisions of the Federal criminal code. Under our bill, \nthese laws will cover criminal activities typically engaged in by \ngangs.\n  Our bill adds a 1- to 10-year sentence for the recruitment of persons \ninto a gang. Importantly, there are even tougher penalties for \nrecruiting a minor into a gang, including a 4-year mandatory minimum \nsentence.\n  The bill adds the use of a minor in a crime to the list of offenses \nfor which a person can be prosecuted under the Federal racketeering \nlaws, known as RICO.\n  It enhances the penalties for transferring a handgun to a minor, \nknowing that it will be used in a crime of violence; and adds a new \nFederal penalty for the use of body armor in the commission of a \nFederal crime.\n  Finally, the legislation we introduce today adds serious juvenile \ndrug offenses to the list of predicates under\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\nthe Federal Armed Career Criminal Act, and authorizes $20 million over \n5 years to hire Federal prosecutors to crack down on criminal gangs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not a panacea for our youth \nviolence crisis. But it is a large and critical step in addressing this \nissue. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bill, and \nurge their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Short title\n       This section identifies the Act as the ``Federal Gang \n     Violence Act.''\n     Section 2. Increase in offense level for participation of \n         crime as gang member\n       This legislation doubles the penalty for any member of an \n     organized criminal street gang who commits a federal crime.\n       Current federal law increases the penalties for organizers, \n     leaders, managers and supervisors of criminal activity--\n     including gang leaders--who commit a federal crime. However, \n     members of known criminal street gangs currently are not \n     subjected to higher penalties when a federal crime is \n     committed. Many prosecutors and law enforcement leaders \n     indicate that gang members--in addition to the leaders and \n     supervisors of gangs--should see their penalties increased to \n     provide a stronger deterrent for children to stay away from \n     gangs.\n       This legislation amends the Sentencing Guidelines so that \n     individual gang members convicted of felonies would have \n     their sentencing level approximately doubled, by adding six \n     levels to the base offense level for the crime they \n     committed. Gang leaders and organizers would also have their \n     sentences increased by six sentencing levels.\n       There are some examples of the effect of this increase for \n     gang members, assuming they have no other aggravating or \n     mitigating factors:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             First-time offender                    Second-time offender        \n              Crime              -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Current              Proposed             Current            Proposed   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDrive-by shooting related to 20   1\\1/4\\ to 1\\3/4\\...  2\\3/4\\ to 3\\1/2\\...  1\\3/4\\ to 2\\1/4\\...  3\\1/2\\ to 4\\3/ \n grams of cocaine.                                                                                4\\            \nBurglary........................  2 to 2\\1/2\\........  4 to 4\\3/4\\........  2\\1/2\\ to 3........  4\\3/4\\ to 6    \nExtortion.......................  2\\3/4\\ to 3\\1/2\\...  5\\1/4\\ to 6\\1/2\\...  3\\1/2\\ to 4\\1/4\\...  6\\3/4\\ to 8    \nWitness intimidation............  2\\3/4\\ to 3\\1/2\\...  5\\1/4\\ to 6\\1/2\\...  3\\1/2\\ to 4\\1/4\\...  6\\1/2\\ to 8    \nGun trafficking.................  4\\3/4\\ to 6........  9 to 11\\1/4\\.......  6 to 7\\1/4\\........  11\\1/4\\ to 14  \nRobbery with a handgun..........  5\\1/4\\ to 6\\1/2\\...  10 to 12\\1/2\\......  6\\1/2\\ to 8........  12\\1/2\\ to 15\\3/\n                                                                                                  4\\            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Section 3. Amendment to title 18 with respect to criminal \n         street gangs\n       This legislation expends the definition of criminal street \n     gangs to better reflect modern day gang activity.\n       Current federal law bases the definition and penalties for \n     criminal street gangs upon the commission of a federal crime \n     of violence or a federal crime involving a controlled \n     substance. Under existing federal law, a person eligible for \n     prosecution as a criminal street gang member must have been \n     convicted within the previous 5 years of a federal or state \n     drug crime or crime of violence, as well as having \n     participated in, or furthered the activities of, a gang. This \n     legislation broadens the definition of criminal street gang \n     activity to include many types of state crimes, such as \n     drive-by shootings, rape, torture, carjacking, kidnaping, and \n     assault with a deadly weapon.\n       By expanding the definition of gang membership, more gang \n     members--who commit state crimes--will be subjected to the \n     higher penalties if they subsequently commit a federal crime.\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\n       Current federal law also requires that there must be five \n     members to meet the requirements of being a gang. Prosecutors \n     and law enforcement officials indicate this number is \n     arbitrary and that some dangerous street gangs consist of \n     fewer members. For that reason, this legislation also lowers \n     the number of participants--from five members to three \n     members--required to meet the definition of a gang.\n     Section 4. Interstate and foreign travel of transportation in \n         aid of criminal street gangs\n       Doubles penalties for inter-state, gang-related crimes. \n     Also expands Travel Act, passed in 1961 with Mafia-related \n     criminal activity in mind, to respond more effectively to the \n     growing problem of highly sophisticated, mobile and organized \n     street gangs.\n       The Travel Act now makes it a federal crime to travel in \n     interstate commerce, or use the mail or other facilities of \n     interstate commerce, to commit or help establish, promote, \n     manage, or carry out extortion, bribery, arson, or any \n     business enterprise involving narcotics, controlled \n     substances, prostitution, gambling, or liquor on which the \n     excise taxes were not paid.\n       While the Travel Act allows prosecutors to target some gang \n     activities--such as drug trafficking--the list is not \n     complete. Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors have \n     indicated that the Act needs to be ``modernized'' to better \n     reflect current crimes by gang members.\n       Under this legislation, the list of unlawful activities in \n     the Travel Act will be expanded to include crimes that are \n     most committed by gang members. The expanded list will \n     include: drive-by shooting, robbery, burglary, assault with a \n     deadly weapon, intimidation of witnesses, victims, jurors or \n     informants, assault resulting in bodily injury, possession \n     and/or trafficking in stolen property, alien smuggling, \n     firearms trafficking, kidnaping, and insurance fraud.\n       In addition, under this legislation, the maximum penalties \n     are doubled from 5 to 10 years for those who violate these \n     provisions without intending to commit violent crimes \n     themselves.\n       A conspiracy provision is also added to this statute to \n     make it easier to prosecute all the gang members who help to \n     commit these crimes.\n       This Act also doubles the base offense levels for:\n       Traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a \n     street gang, from 6 to 12, which increases the base \n     sentencing rage from a low of zero to six months and a high \n     of twelve to eighteen months, to a new low of ten to sixteen \n     months and a new high of thirty to thirty-seven months; and\n       Committing violent crimes in aid of street gang or \n     racketeering activity from 12 to 24, which increases the base \n     sentencing range from a low of ten to sixteen months and a \n     high of thirty to thirty-seven months, to a new low of 51-63 \n     months and a new high of 100-125 months.\n     Section 5. Solicitation or recruitment of persons in gang \n         activity\n       Current federal law contains no penalty for recruiting \n     minors to participate in gang activity. Law enforcement \n     officials indicate that sophisticated crime syndicates will \n     recruit minors to do the ``dirty work'' so that the \n     organizers of the criminal activity cannot be convicted of a \n     crime.\n       This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of \n     persons to participate in gang activity subject to a one-year \n     minimum and 10-year maximum penalty, or a fine of up to \n     $250,000. If a minor is recruited or solicited, the minimum \n     penalty is increased to four years. In addition, the person \n     convicted of this crime would have to pay the costs of \n     housing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the \n     juvenile reaches the age of 18 years.\n     Section 6. Crimes involving the use of minors as RICO \n         predicates\n       To identify a racketeering influenced corrupt organization \n     (RICO), the organization must have engaged in at least two of \n     the more than 25 criminal activities listed under the RICO \n     statute.\n       This bill makes the use of a minor in the commission of a \n     federal crime a RICO predicate.\n     Section 7. Transfer of firearms to minors for use in crime\n       It is now a crime under federal law to knowingly transfer a \n     firearm to be used to commit a violent crime or a drug \n     trafficking crime.\n       This legislation adds a mandatory minimum penalty of three \n     years imprisonment if the gun to be used in crime is \n     transferred to a minor.\n     Section 8. Penalties\n       Increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors.\n       The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of \n     the 1994 Crime Bill, does not contain sufficient penalties. \n     In fact, one provision of the current Youth Handgun Safety \n     Act requires mandatory probation for a first-time juvenile \n     offender who possesses a handgun. Such a weak penalty meant \n     few prosecutors would utilize the Youth Handgun Safety Act to \n     target gang members. In addition, current law sets different \n     penalties for juveniles and adults who transfer a weapon to a \n     minor.\n       The Federal Gang Violence Act toughens the penalties \n     against juveniles and adult who transfer a handgun to a \n     minor--and subjects juveniles and adults to the same \n     penalties for violating this law.\n       This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by:\n       (A) Setting a one-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult \n     or juvenile--who provides a minor with a handgun.\n       (B) Holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give \n     another minor a handgun by applying the same five-year \n     maximum sentence now given to adults.\n       (C) Setting a one-year minimum sentence and applying the \n     same 10-year maximum sentence to adults and juveniles who \n     give a handgun to a minor and should have known the gun would \n     be used in a crime of violence. Currently, the 10-year \n     maximum sentence only applies to adults.\n     Section 9. The James Guelff Body Armor Act\n       Many police officers around the country are confronting \n     heavily-armed gang members who are wearing bullet-proof \n     vests. This legislation creates a two-year mandatory, \n     consecutive sentence for anyone who wears body armor in the \n     commission of a federal offense.\n     Section 10. Serious juvenile drug offense as Armed Career \n         Criminal Act predicates\n       The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has \n     three or more prior convictions of certain crimes (is a \n     career criminal), and he possess, ships, transports or \n     receives a gun or ammunition (is armed), he will be subject \n     to a mandatory minimum 15 year penalty and fine of up to \n     $25,000. Serious drug offenses are already in the list of \n     crimes which count toward the three-conviction minimum; this \n     bill would allow juvenile convictions for serious drug \n     offenses to also count toward that three-conviction minimum.\n     Section 11. Increase in time limits for juvenile proceedings\n       Expands the time limit for bringing juvenile proceedings to \n     trial.\n       Presently, a 30-day time limit exists. With crimes being \n     committed by juveniles becoming increasingly violent and \n     complex, prosecutors need additional time to adequately \n     develop cases. This legislation increases the time limit to \n     70 days.\n     Section 12. Applying racketeering offenses to firearms \n         offenses\n       Adds firearms violations, such as trafficking, to the list \n     of crimes that can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO.\n       Currently, firearms violations are not RICO predicate acts. \n     Prosecutors and law enforcement officials indicate an \n     increasing use of firearms by criminal street gangs to commit \n     home robberies, business invasions, and attacks on rival \n     gangs. Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate \n     commerce--and because firearms are such an integral part of \n     the gang's activity--law enforcement officials have suggested \n     that firearms violations become predicate acts under RICO. \n     Since two criminal activities must be proven before RICO \n     organizations can be identified, firearms violations alone \n     would not lead a group to be pursued under the RICO laws.\n       This legislation would amend the list of RICO predicate \n     acts to include firearms violations.\n       Identifying an organization dedicated to criminal activity \n     in accordance with the RICO statute results in asset \n     forfeiture and a maximum of 20 years in prison. In addition, \n     the RICO Statute allows federal prosecutors to charge such an \n     organization with state crimes they may have committed as \n     well as federal crimes.\n     Section 13. Use of linguists\n       Promotes the use of State Department linguists to assist in \n     translating and monitoring wiretaps in gang investigations. \n     Federal law enforcement and courts are experiencing \n     difficulty and high costs in locating and employing certified \n     translators for southeastern Asian languages and Chinese \n     dialects used by some gangs.\n     Section 14. Additional prosecutors\n       The Federal Gang Violence Act authorize appropriations of \n     $100 million over the next five years for hiring additional \n     federal prosecutors to prosecute violent youth gangs.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators, \nHatch, Kerry, Harkin, Reid, and D'Amato  to introduce the Federal Gang \nViolence Act of 1996--legislation that makes the Federal Government a \nmore active partner in the war against violent and deadly organized \ngangs.\n  Mr. President, today's gangs are not the bands of loosely organized \nstreet kids glamorized in West Side Story. Today's gangs are very \ndifferent. Consider this:\n  Just last week, the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco made \narrests in a major alien smuggling operation run by organized gangs \nbased in New York and San Francisco. Operation Sea Dragon netted 23 \npeople in connection with a large-scale plan to smuggle two boatloads \nof more than 270 aliens from China into the United States in 1993.\n  According to the U.S. attorney's office, a number of powerful New \nYork-based gangs, including the White Tigers, Fuk Ching, and the Broom \nStreet Boys joined forces with two bay area gangs to off load the \nsmuggled aliens. A San Francisco-based Vietnamese gang was responsible \nfor furnishing the\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\nfishing boats to ferry the smuggled aliens ashore, where a Chinese gang \nout of Oakland had provided land transportation and drop houses to \nfacilitate the aliens travel to New York. Presumably, once in New York, \nthese illegal aliens were to live in indentured servitude while they \npaid off the up to $30,000 in crossing debts that the gangs typically \ncharge each passenger.\n  Alien smuggling is a very lucrative international business--law \nenforcement estimates it brings in $3 billion a year for smugglers.\n  But alien smuggling is just one example of the kinds of dangerous \ncriminal activities modern gangs are engaged in. Today's gangs are \norganized and sophisticated traveling crime syndicates--much like the \nMafia--that regularly cross State lines to recruit new members, \ntraffick in drugs, weapons, and illegal aliens, and steal and murder.\n  In just one city, Los Angeles, nearly 7,300 of its citizens were \nmurdered in the last 16 years from gang warfare. This is more people \nthan have been killed in all the terrorist fighting in northern \nIreland.\n  Gangs were responsible for: 43 percent of all homicides in Los \nAngeles in 1994; 41 percent of homicides in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995; \nand more than half of all violent crimes in Buffalo, NY, in 1994.\n  In Phoenix, AZ, gang-related homicides jumped 800 percent between \n1990 and 1994; and\n  In Wichita, KS, drive-by shootings jumped from 8 in 1991 to 267 in \n1993--a 3000-percent increase in just 2 years. This in a small city of \n300,000.\n  These are just a few examples of the alarming rise in gang violence \ngripping our streets. We are becoming numb to the violence.\n  In Los Angeles in February, City Councilwoman Laura Chick, chair of \nthe LA Public Safety Committee, received a faxed report that six people \nhad been murdered over the weekend in LA--and it was not even reported \nin the press.\n  Criminal gangs are now engaged in million dollar heists, home and \nbusiness invasions, major narcotics and weapons trafficking, and yes, \nillegal alien smuggling.\n  And they are crossing State lines to establish criminal operations in \nother States looking for untapped markets.\n  Sgt. Jerry Flowers with the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City captured \nthe migration instinct of these gangs when he said: ``the gang leaders \nrealized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for $300 in Los \nAngeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City''.\n\n\n                            BLOODS and CRIPS\n\n  The Bloods and the Crips, gangs that originated in Los Angeles in the \nlate 1960's, are the Nation's two largest street gangs. And they are \nexpanding.\n  Local police and the FBI have traced factions of these gangs to more \nthan 119 cities in the West and Midwest with more than 60,000 members. \nAccording to the FBI, narcotics trafficking is their principle source \nof income.\n\n\n                           gangster disciples\n\n  The Gangster Disciples, according to local authorities, is a Chicago-\nbased 30,000 member multimillion dollar gang operation spanning 35 \nStates.\n  They traffic in narcotics and weapons, and are said to operate much \nlike a ``Fortune 500 Company'' with two boards of directors--one in \nprison and one outside--a layer of Governors and regents, a tax \ncollector and some 6,000 salespersons. Their income is estimated at \n$300,000 daily.\n\n\n                          russian crime gangs\n\n  Russian organized crime activity in the United States has been \nexpanding for the past 20 years, but its most significant growth has \noccurred during the past 5 years. Twenty-nine States now report \nactivities by Russian crime groups.\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh stated that more than 200 of Russia's 6,000 \ncrime gangs operate with American counterparts in the United States.\n  Russian gangs tend to be more loosely organized than other gangs, but \nthey have formed networks that operate and shift alliances to meet \nparticular needs.\n  The California Attorney General indicates that the most common \ncriminal activities by Russian organized crime gangs are fraud schemes \ninvolving fuel tax, insurance, and credit card fraud. But they also \nengage in more common organized crime activities-extortion, loan \nsharking, drug trafficking, auto theft, and prostitution.\n\n\n                              asian gangs\n\n  The Department of Justice indicates that, among ethnic gangs, \nJamaican and Asian gangs are considered by many law enforcement \nofficials to pose the largest threat. Asian gangs have been identified \nas major threats in more than 17 cities.\n  In Los Angeles alone there are more than 100 Asian gangs with 10,000 \nmembers.\n  Illegal activities include: alien smuggling, murder, kidnapping, \nextortion, home invasion robberies, high-technology heists, and \nfirearms trafficking.\n  Vietnamese gangs, in particular, have become a serious threat in many \ncities. They tend to be very violent, are more sophisticated \norganizationally, and have specialized in stealing multimillion dollar \nquantities of computer chips.\n  At least 400 Silicon Valley businesses that deal in computer chips \nhave been hit in the last year and a half, losing tens of millions of \ndollars. Computer firms lose as much as $1 million a week in thefts.\n\n\n                        current laws not enough\n\n  Mr. President, Federal laws now on the books were designed to fight \none type of organized crime--the Mafia. And I believe today's laws just \nare not enough to take on these modern gangs.\n  For the past 7 months, my staff has met with prosecutors, law \nenforcement officers, and community leaders to search for solutions to \nthe problem of gang violence. The legislation I am introducing today, \nThe Federal Gang Violence Act of 1996, is the result of our work.\n  This legislation strengthens Federal law by attacking gang violence \non three fronts:\n  It doubles the sentence for any member of an organized criminal gang \nwho commits a Federal crime;\n  Expands the scope of gang-related criminal acts to include such \nactivities as carjacking and drive-by shootings, and significantly \nincreases penalties for those crimes; and\n  Checks the growth of gangs by making the recruitment of minors into \ncriminal gangs a Federal offense with stiff penalties.\n  Specifically, this legislation:\n  First, doubles the actual sentence for any member of an organized \ncriminal street gang who commits a Federal crime.\n  Current Federal law increases the penalties for organizers, leaders, \nmanagers, and supervisors of criminal activity--including gang \nleaders--who commit a federal crime. However, members of known criminal \nstreet gangs currently are not subjected to higher penalties when a \nFederal crime is committed.\n  Many prosecutors and law enforcement leaders indicate that gang \nmembers--in addition to the leaders and supervisors of gangs--should \nsee their penalties increased to provide a stronger deterrent for \nchildren to stay away from gangs.\n  This legislation amends the sentencing guidelines so that individual \ngang members convicted of felonies would have their sentencing level \napproximately doubled. For example: Now if a first-time offender who is \na member of a gang is convicted of gun trafficking, he would get a \nminimum of 4\\3/4\\-6 years in jail. Under this legislation, the sentence \nwould be increased to 9-11\\1/4\\ years.\n  Second, expands the definition of criminal street gangs in Federal \nlaw to better reflect modern-day gang activity.\n  The bill broadens the definition of criminal street gang activity in \ntitle 18 of the Criminal Code to include many types of State crimes, \nsuch as drive-by shootings, rape, torture, carjacking, kidnaping, and \nassault with a deadly weapon.\n  This legislation also lowers the number of participants--from five \nmembers to three members--required to meet the definition of a gang.\n  Third, doubles penalties for interstate, gang-related crimes and \nexpands the Travel Act to respond more effectively to the growing \nproblem of highly sophisticated, mobile, and organized street gangs.\n  The Travel Act was originally written in 1961 with Mafia-style \nactivity in mind. While the Travel Act as it is now written allows \nprosecutors to target\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nsome gang activities--such as drug trafficking--the list is not \ncomplete. Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors have indicated that \nthe act needs to be modernized to better reflect current crimes by gang \nmembers.\n  Under this legislation, the list of unlawful activities in the Travel \nAct will be expanded to include the following crimes: Drive-by \nshooting; robbery; burglary; assault with a deadly weapon; intimidation \nof witnesses, victims, jurors, or informants; assault resulting in \nbodily injury; possession and/or trafficking of stolen property; alien \nsmuggling; firearms trafficking; kidnaping; and insurance fraud.\n  In addition, under this legislation, the maximum penalties are \ndoubled from 5 to 10 years for those who violate these provisions \nwithout intending to commit violent crimes themselves.\n  A conspiracy provision is also added to this statute to make it \neasier to prosecute all the gang members who help to commit these \ncrimes.\n  This act also doubles the base offense levels under the sentencing \nguidelines for: Traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a \nstreet gang, from 6 to 12, which increases the base sentencing range \nfrom a low of zero to 6 months and a high of 12 to 18 months, to a new \nlow of 10 to 16 months and a new high of 30 to 37 months; and \ncommitting violent crimes in aid of street gang or racketeering \nactivity from 12 to 24, which increases the base sentencing range from \na low of 10 to 16 months and a high of 30 to 37 months, to a new low of \n51 to 63 months and a new high of 100 to 125 months.\n\n  Fourth, solicitation or recruitment of persons into gang activity: \nCurrent Federal law contains no penalty for recruiting minors to \nparticipate in gang activity. Law enforcement officials indicate that \nsophisticated organized crime syndicates will recruit minors to do the \ndirty work so that the organizers of the criminal activity cannot be \nconvicted of a crime.\n  This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of persons to \nparticipate in gang activity subject to a 1-year minimum and 10-year \nmaximum penalty, or a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is recruited \nor solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to 4 years. In addition, \nthe person convicted of this crime would have to pay the costs of \nhousing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the juvenile \nreaches the age of 18 years.\n  Fifth, this bill makes the use of a minor in the commission of a \nFederal crime a RICO predicate.\n  Identifying an organization dedicated to criminal activity in \naccordance with the RICO Statute results in asset forfeiture and a \nmaximum of 20 years in prison.\n  Sixth, transfer of firearms to minors for use in crime.\n  It is now a crime under Federal law to knowingly transfer a firearm \nto be used to commit a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime.\n  This legislation adds a mandatory minimum penalty of 3 years \nimprisonment if the gun to be used in crime is transferred to a minor.\n  Seventh, this legislation increases penalties for transferring \nhandguns to minors.\n  The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of the 1994 \ncrime bill, does not contain sufficient penalties against juveniles who \npossess handguns.\n  In fact, one provision of the current Youth Handgun Safety Act \nrequires only mandatory probation for a first-time juvenile offender \nwho possesses a handgun. Such a weak penalty has meant few prosecutors \nwould utilize the Youth Handgun Safety Act to target gang members. In \naddition, current law sets different penalties for juveniles and adults \nwho transfer a weapon to a minor.\n\n  The Federal Gang Violence Act toughens the penalties against \njuveniles and adults who transfer a firearm to a minor--and subjects \njuveniles and adults to the same penalties for violating this law.\n  This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by:\n  Setting a 1-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult or juvenile--who \nprovides a minor with a handgun.\n  Holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give another minor \na firearm by applying the same 5-year maximum sentence now given to \nadults.\n  Setting a 1-year minimum sentence and applying the same 10-year \nmaximum sentence to adults and juveniles who give a firearm to a minor \nand should have known the gun would be used in a crime of violence. \nCurrently, the 10-year maximum sentence only applies to adults.\n  Juveniles under 13 years old, however, would not be subject to these \nmandatory minimum sentences.\n  Eighth, the James Guelff Body Armor Act: Many police officers around \nthe country are confronting heavily armed gang members who are wearing \nbullet-proof vests. This legislation makes it a separate crime to wear \nbody armor in the commission of a Federal offense, which would be \npunished by automatically adding 2 years to the sentence for the \noriginal crime.\n  Ninth, serious juvenile drug offenses as Armed Career Criminal Act \npredicates:\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has three or \nmore prior convictions for certain crimes--is a career criminal--and he \npossesses, ships, transports, or receives a gun or ammunition, is \narmed, he will be subject to a mandatory minimum 15-year penalty and \nfine of up to $25,000.\n  Serious drug offenses are already in the list of crimes which count \ntoward the three-conviction minimum; this bill would allow juvenile \nconvictions for serious drug offenses to also count toward that three-\nconviction minimum. This would not apply to nickel-and-dime possession \noffenses, but to drug dealing which is punishable by ten or more years \nin prison.\n  Tenth, expands the time limit for bringing juvenile proceedings to \ntrial.\n  Presently, a 30-day time limit exists. With crimes being committed by \njuveniles becoming increasingly violent and complex, prosecutors need \nadditional time to adequately develop cases. This legislation increases \nthe time limit to 70 days.\n\n  Eleventh, adds firearms violations, such as trafficking, to the list \nof crimes that can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO.\n  Currently, firearms violations are not RICO predicate acts. \nProsecutors and law enforcement officials indicate an increasing use of \nfirearms by criminal street gangs to commit home robberies, business \ninvasions, and attacks on rival gangs.\n  Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate commerce--and \nbecause firearms are such an integral part of the gang's activity--law \nenforcement officials have suggested that firearms violations become \npredicate acts under RICO.\n  Twelfth, this legislation promotes the use of State Department \nlinguists to assist in translating and monitoring wiretaps in gang \ninvestigations. Federal law enforcement and courts report that they are \nexperiencing difficulty and high costs in locating and employing \ncertified translators for Southeastern Asian languages and Chinese \ndialects used by some gangs.\n  Thirteenth, this legislation provides $100 million over the next 5 \nyears for hiring additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute violent \nyouth gangs.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I have laid out for you today is a \nstarting point, and I think it is long overdue. I know there is no \nsilver bullet to cure our Nation of the ills wrought by street gangs. \nBut this legislation takes an important step forward by adding the \nFederal Government's weight to what has thus far been largely State and \nlocal war on gangs by significantly strengthening the Federal laws that \ndeal with gang crime.\n  It is my belief that the only real long-term solution lies in \ncombining forces at the Federal, State, and local level.\n  And I am pleased to say that thus far, this legislation has received \nnearly 80 endorsements from local California law enforcement, including \nLos Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, Los Angeles County \nSheriff Sherman Block, and Police Chiefs in Fresno, Oakland, and \nSacramento.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I welcome their \ninput as this bill moves forward.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Federal Gang \nViolence Act which we are introducing to combat the growing problem of \ngang violence. According to the FBI, juvenile gang killings rose by 371 \npercent from 1980 to 1992, the fastest growing of\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nall the homicide categories. But, Mr. President, this problem is not \njust a series of statistics.\n  Less than a year ago in Massachusetts, a young prosecutor, Assistant \nAttorney General Paul McLauglin, was gunned down by a hooded youth in a \ndisplay of gang violence and brutality unprecedented in my State. It \nwas a brutal assassination of a public servant doing his job--the kind \nof violence we see in other nations, but thankfully, only rarely in \nAmerica.\n  Earlier this year, I met with law enforcement officials, local \nelected officials, and Justice Department officials in western \nMassachusetts where gang activity has grown dramatically. The officials \ntold me that in the Route 91 corridor, gangs operate from Connecticut \nthrough Massachusetts and up into Vermont. In fact, last year a major \nincident involving gangs from western Massachusetts occurred in \nRutland, VT.\n  Because of this and similar meetings with law enforcement officials \nacross Massachusetts, I went to Senators Feinstein and Hatch to offer \nmy assistance in developing this antigang legislation. Although \nofficials in western Massachusetts told me that the area is already \nbenefiting from the COPS Program, we must do more. I am proud of the \nrole I played in getting the COPS Program expanded in the crime bill, \nso that we will put 100,000 police officers on the beat to fight crime. \nThe COPS Program is beneficial but not a sufficient Federal response to \nyouth gangs.\n  Nationally, juvenile arrests for violent crime increased by 75 \npercent during the past decade. According to a Department of Justice \nsurvey of law enforcement officials in 35 cities with organized \nantigang programs, there are almost 1,500 gangs and over 120,000 gang \nmembers across the country.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would crack down on violent \ngangs by toughening Federal penalties against criminal street gangs and \norganized crime syndicates. Gang members who commit Federal crimes or \nrecruit other youths--and especially gangs who cross State lines to \ncommit crimes--would receive stricter penalties.\n  Of course, the overwhelming majority of America's 27 million youths \nbetween the ages of 10 and 17 never commit violent crimes or enter the \njuvenile or criminal justice systems. Overall, children remain far more \nlikely to be the victims of violent crime than offenders. According to \nthe most recent data from the Department of Justice, one in nine \nchildren ages 12 to 19 was a victim of violent crime in 1993, while \nfewer than one in 200 youths was arrested for a violent offense.\n\n  But ultimately, Mr. President, the solution to youth violence must \naddress the fact that too many young people live in poverty, which puts \nchildren at particular risk for violent behavior by reducing the \nquality of their community supports such as housing and schools, \nlimiting their opportunities for education and employment, and dimming \ntheir sense of hope about the future. We can pass tougher and tougher \nlaws but without at least an ounce of prevention we will not solve the \nproblem.\n  We also must deal with the fact that handguns are too accessible. \nHandguns pose an ever-increasing danger to the safety and welfare of \nthe American public. Nearly one-third of children ages 10 to 17 \nsurveyed in 1993 said they knew how to get a gun. The source is often \ntheir own home. School security and law enforcement officials estimate \nthat 80 percent of the firearms that students bring to school come from \nhome. And according to the most recent figures, over 25 Americans are \nkilled each day by handguns. If it's true that ``people kill people,'' \nit's also true that they most frequently do so with handguns.\n  But we must also learn more about gang violence. Despite continuing \nresearch on the nature and extent of gang problems, data on youth gangs \nremain spotty. The Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP] recently reported that ``because \nresearch has been limited and because researchers have no real \nconsensus on the definition of a gang or gang incident, the scope and \nseriousness of the youth gang problem are not reliably known.'' Better \ninformation is clearly needed.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Feinstein and Hatch to making \nfurther refinements to the bill to ensure the delicate balance between \nbringing criminals to justice and protecting civil liberties. In \nparticular, I'm interested in examining the provision which requires \nserious drug offenses committed as a juvenile to count toward the \nprovision which imposes a mandatory minimum 15 year sentence for \njuveniles or adults who have a record of three serious drug offense \nconvictions and commit a gun offense. We must be careful not to \neliminate the juvenile justice system as the ``second chance'' it is \nintended to provide.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the leadership of Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Hatch for their efforts to combat gang violence through this \nlegislation. I also want to express my admiration for the Senator from \nCalifornia for her leadership on the assault weapons ban, both in her \ncourageous efforts to pass it through Congress and her tenacity in \nstopping efforts to repeal it.\n  Too many children in the United States go to sleep to the sounds of \ngunfire and accept as normal the violent deaths of siblings, friends, \nand schoolmates. Working together, we can combat gang violence, \npoverty, and handguns to ensure we no longer have to live under the \nconstant threat of violence.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Federal Gang Violence Act. The provisions of this bill \nare greatly needed in order to reduce the growing threat of gang \nviolence.\n  The Department of Justice released a report last month stating that \n79 of our largest cities have over 3,800 youth gangs, with a total of \n200,000 gang members. The gangs are taking over our cities and towns. \nWith an increase in the presence of gangs comes an increase in their \ncriminal activities.\n  The Justice Department reports that while gang presence seems to be \nincreasing, these gangs are also establishing an organizational \nsophistication that they did not possess before. With an expected surge \nin juvenile violent crimes, loopholes in the law must be corrected. And \nnow.\n  Let me clarify one thing first. Gangs are not an urban problem; gangs \nare located in every geographical location--cities, suburbs, and rural \nareas. There is not one common gang activity; each gang performs \ndifferent illegal activities. Gang activities are not restricted to \ncertain areas of cities; the gangs' reach extends to our schools. It is \nclear that the response must be as varied as the problem. This bill \ntakes the diversity into account and responds to those different \nactivities by taking the most effective action--increasing the \nsentences. The penalty is doubled for any interstate gang-related \ncrimes. Doubles the penalty for gang members that extort, bribe, deal \nin drugs, intimidate a witness or participate in a drive-by shooting. \nAny violent crime committed as part of gang activity gets an increased \nsentencing offense level.\n  Stiffer punishment is essential if we are to combat gang violence. A \nDepartment of Justice report states that 68 percent of male inmates in \njuvenile correctional facilities admit that their gang had regularly \nbought and sold guns and over 60 percent described driving around \nshooting at people regularly.\n  Because recruitment is so important to perpetuate the criminal gang \nactivities, whether the person recruited is a minor or an adult, a new \noffense must be created. And this bill will do just that. It is \nimperative to stop the recruitment. Gangs can only continue to wreak \nhavoc if they have the members to carry out their misdeeds.\n  A provision of the Federal Gang Violence Act treats alien smuggling \nas a predicate act under the RICO--racketeering. It will also make \nalien smuggling a money laundering crime. This is especially timely \nafter the indictment last February of 64 violent organized crime gang \nmembers of the Flying Dragons in Chinatown. These smugglers brought in \nhundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants and then proceeded to kidnap, \ntorture, and extort money. These provisions could only add to their \nsentences if convicted. These people should be in prison for decades \nfor the acts alleged.\n  These provisions are a commonsense approach. For instance, any \ncriminal\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\nwho wears body armor during the commission of a felony certainly \ndeserves to get an additional 2 years mandatory minimum. The intent is \nclear; the gang member committing a felony wearing body armor knows the \ndangers involved.\n  The potential gang members have much to fear themselves. A special \nreport completed by the National Gang Crime Research Center found that \ntwo-thirds of gang members have had friends or family members killed \nbecause of the gang violence. These victims may never have chosen the \nroute of gang violence but were swept in by the activities of the gang \nmembers.\n  The violence committed by gangs affects our entire country. The wreak \nhavoc on business owners, individuals, family members, and themselves. \nIt is time to do something about it. I thank my colleagues for working \nto enhance the penalties of the crimes committed by gang members and am \npleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PELL:\n  S. 1701. A bill to end the use of steel jaw leghold traps on animals \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                       steel jaw trap legislation\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprohibit the use of steel jaw leghold traps in the United States.\n  While this bill does not prohibit trapping, it does outlaw a \nparticularly savage method of trapping. Anything--wild animals, family \npets, children--that comes in contact with a leghold trap is subjected \nto its bone-crushing force. Other, more discriminating trapping methods \nexist and should be used.\n  I think it is also instructive to note that well over 60 nations \naround the globe including all the nations of the European Community \nhave already outlawed the use of this device and have also prohibited \nthe sale of fur caught by leghold traps.\n  I should make it clear to my colleagues that I oppose the cruel \ntreatment of any animal and support efforts to curb the unnecessary use \nof animals for purposes such as medical testing, especially when \nalternative testing procedures are available or when the tests are \nconducted for nonvital reasons and result in inhumane animal treatment. \nI do, however, support the humane use of animals which may provide \ncrucial information for life-saving technologies when no other \nalternative testing mechanism exists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4063-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4072-S4073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 301\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm] was added as a cosponsor of S. 301, a bill to provide for the \nnegotiation of bilateral prisoner transfer treaties with foreign \ncountries and to provide for the training in the United States of \nborder patrol and customs service personnel from foreign countries.\n\n\n                                 S. 358\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n358, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for \nan excise tax exemption for certain emergency medical transportation by \nair ambulance.\n\n\n                                 S. 553\n\n  At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the name of the Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 553, a bill to \namend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to reinstate an \nexemption for certain bona fide hiring and retirement plans applicable \nto State and local firefighters and law enforcement officers, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1183\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1183, a bill \nto amend the act of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act), to \nrevise the standards for coverage under the act, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1483\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1483, a bill to control crime, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1512\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. \nDeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1512, a bill to amend title 23, \nUnited States Code, to improve safety at public railway-highway \ncrossings, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1521\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1521, a bill to establish \nthe Nicodemus National Historic Site in Kansas, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1578\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1578, a bill to amend the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act to authorize appropriations \nfor fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1610\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1610, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the standards used \nfor determining whether individuals are not employees.\n\n\n                                S. 1623\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the names of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] and the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1623, a bill to establish a National Tourism Board \nand a National Tourism Organization, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1669, a bill to name the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs medical center in Jackson, MS, as the \n``G.V.

which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 56\n\n       Whereas April 26, 1996, marks the tenth anniversary of the \n     Chornobyl nuclear disaster;\n       Whereas United Nations General Assembly resolution 50/134 \n     declares April 26, 1996, as the International Day \n     Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Chornobyl Nuclear \n     Power Plant Accident and encourages member states to \n     commemorate this tragic event;\n       Whereas serious radiological, health, and socioeconomic \n     consequences for the populations of Ukraine, Belarus, and \n     Russia, as well as for the populations of other affected \n     areas, have been identified since the disaster;\n       Whereas over 3,500,000 inhabitants of the affected areas, \n     including over 1,000,000 children, were exposed to \n     dangerously high levels of radiation;\n       Whereas the populations of the affected areas, especially \n     children, have experienced significant increases in thyroid \n     cancer, immune deficiency diseases, birth defects, and other \n     conditions, and these trends have accelerated over the 10 \n     years since the disaster;\n       Whereas the lives and health of people in the affected \n     areas continue to be heavily burdened by the ongoing effects \n     of the Chornobyl accident;\n       Whereas numerous charitable, humanitarian, and \n     environmental organizations from the United States and the \n     international community have committed to overcome the \n     extensive consequences of the Chornobyl disaster;\n       Whereas the United States has sought to help the people of \n     Ukraine through various forms of assistance;\n       Whereas humanitarian assistance and public health research \n     into Chornobyl's consequences will be needed in the coming \n     decades when the greatest number of latent health effects is \n     expected to emerge;\n       Whereas on December 20, 1995, the Ukrainian Government, the \n     governments of the G-7 countries, and the Commission of the \n     European Communities signed a memorandum of understanding to \n     support the decision of Ukraine to close the Chornobyl \n     nuclear power plant by the year 2000 with adequate support \n     from the G-7 countries and international financial \n     institutions;\n       Whereas the United States strongly supports the closing of \n     the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and improving nuclear \n     safety in Ukraine; and\n       Whereas representatives of Ukraine, the G-7 countries, and \n     international financial institutions will meet at least \n     annually to monitor implementation of the program to close \n     Chornobyl: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes April 26, 1996, as the tenth anniversary of \n     the Chornobyl nuclear power plant disaster;\n       (2) urges the Government of Ukraine to continue its \n     negotiations with the G-7 countries to implement the December \n     20, 1995, memorandum of understanding which calls for all \n     nuclear reactors at Chornobyl to be shut down in a safe and \n     expeditious manner; and\n       (3) calls upon the President--\n       (A) to support continued and enhanced United States \n     assistance to provide medical relief, humanitarian \n     assistance, social impact planning, and hospital development \n     for Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and other nations most heavily \n     afflicted by Chornobyl aftermath;\n       (B) to encourage national and international health \n     organizations to expand the scope of research into the public \n     health consequences of Chornobyl, so that the global \n     community can benefit from the findings of such research;\n       (C) to support the process of closing the Chornobyl nuclear \n     power plant in an expeditious manner as envisioned by the \n     December 20, 1995, memorandum of understanding; and\n       (D) to support the broadening of Ukraine's regional energy \n     sources which will reduce its dependence on any individual \n     country.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution to \ncommemorate the 10th anniversary of one of the most tragic, devastating \nevents in the history of nuclear power--the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. \nThe resolution also expresses Congress' unequivocal support for the \nclosing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. I am pleased that \nSenators Dole, Helms, Pell, and Levin are joining me in submitting this \nresolution.\n  Friday, April 26, 1996, marks the 10th anniversary of the world's \nworst nuclear accident. Ten years ago, nuclear reactor No. 4 at \nUkraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant malfunctioned. The ensuing \nexplosion and fire spewed a cloud of radiation across Europe, releasing \n200 times more radioactivity than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and \nNagasaki combined.\n  The results were devastating. Millions of people were exposed to \ndangerously high levels of radiation.\n  Chernobyl's legacy is much more than the worst technological disaster \nin the history of nuclear power. It is a continuing humanitarian \ntragedy that will always be remembered the world over. The inhabitants \nof Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia continue to be heavily burdened by the \nsocial, economic, and health effects of the accident, and the entire \ninternational community continues to be threatened by the specter of \nanother Chernobyl.\n  Ten years ago, millions of Ukrainians, Belarussians, and Russians, \nincluding over one million children and thousands of people who cleaned \nup after the explosion, were exposed to dangerously high levels of \nradiation. A 30-kilometer radius around Chernobyl was rendered \nuninhabitable. Families were forced from their homes. Most have never \nreturned.\n  The tragic effects of this disaster have devastated millions. A 200-\nfold increase in thyroid cancer among children has ensued. Immune \ndeficiency disorders, respiratory problems, and birth defects have \nincreased at alarming rates since the disaster. The region's soil and \nwater supplies have remained contaminated. Ukraine's economy has been \noverwhelmed by the costs of rebuilding.\n  Mr. President, the people of Chernobyl and Ukraine have not been \nalone in their efforts to overcome the tremendous loss. Numerous \ncharitable and humanitarian organizations have assiduously worked to \nameliorate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Americans for \nHuman Rights in Ukraine and the Children of Chernobyl Relief Fund, from \nmy State of New Jersey, have lent considerable support to that effort \nalong with many others in the Ukrainian-American community. These and \nmillions of other Americans in New Jersey and elsewhere continue to \nprovide valuable assistance to the victims of the Chernobyl \ndisaster. All private organizations who have been at the forefront to \nhelp Ukraine deserve commendation for their tireless efforts to assist \nCherbobyl's victims.\n\n  Unfortunately, more work needs to be done. Cherbobyl's two working \nreactors continue to churn out electricity. The protective concrete \ncovering over the obliterated reactor No. 4, the sarcophagus, has \ndeveloped cracks which dangerously weaken its structure. Corrosion of \nthis structure threatens to release even more radioactivity into the \nregion. Experts warn that another accident is imminent.\n  Just yesterday, a fire started within 10 kilometers of Cherbobyl. \nWhile initial assessments by specialists conclude that the abundant \nsmoke produced by the fire may not pose further contamination dangers, \nall bets are off in the future. The region's inhabitants cannot be \nassured that radioactive particles which settled in the areas \nsurrounding Cherbobyl after the accident will not be carried into their \nvillages or water supplies. They cannot be assured that future fires or \neven floods will not release dangerous levels of contamination.\n  This event underscores the ongoing threat Cherbobyl poses to safety \nand the urgent need to close Cherbobyl forever.\n  On December 20, 1995, the Ukrainian Government, the governments of \nthe G-7 countries, and the Commission of the European Communities \nsigned a memorandum of understanding supporting Ukraine's decision to \nclose Cherbobyl by the year 2000 and the international community has \npledged financial support to facilitate the closure. Last week, \nPresident Clinton met in Moscow with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma \nand leaders of other G-7 nations, and Ukraine reaffirmed its commitment \nto close Cherbobyl.\n  Support from the international community is vital to help Ukraine \nmove forward and close Cherbobyl. Ukraine is working hard to implement \nopen economic and social reforms, and its economy is strapped. At this \nvery delicate time in Ukraine's history, the United States should \nsupport Ukraine's efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and to secure \nthe alternative energy sources it needs to close Cherbobyl in a safe \nand expeditious manner.\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\n   Mr. President, the devastating health effects, social distress, and \neconomic hardship remains in the hearts and minds of the people of \nUkraine who lived through the Cherbobyl explosion. They cannot forget \nthe radioactive blanket of despair that covered their homes and forced \nthem from their villages. They cannot forget that their livelihoods \nhave been destroyed. For their sake and for the sake of future \ngenerations, we should commemorate this event on April 26, 1996, and \nredouble our efforts to ensure that the devastation of 10 years ago \nwill not be repeated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4074-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 250--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n      TACTILE CURRENCY FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. \nShelby) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                              S.

In the latest horrific \n     attacks, scores have been killed: Israelis young and old; \n     Jews and non-Jews; citizens and visitors, including two young \n     Americans.\n       We stand as one in our condemnation of those who commit and \n     assist such heinous acts. The murderers and their supporters \n     serve no agenda other than blind, fanatical hatred. Israelis, \n     Palestinians, the international community must act to stop \n     these killers now. Through every practical means, the \n     promoters of terror must be defeated, their pipelines of \n     financial and logistical support choked off.\n       We stand as one with the people of Israel and Jews the \n     world over in mourning the victims of terrorist murder--as we \n     have stood with Israel in other times of peril, and in times \n     of accomplishment and hope. We stand with Israel in its age-\n     old quest for peace and security.\n       This is a time of sorrow and reflection for the people of \n     Israel, and for all who seek peace. It is a time of challenge \n     for a country that has maintained its commitment to peace and \n     freedom under relentless attack. We stand with Israel--in \n     grief, in solidarity, and in our resolve to fight terrorists \n     committed to the death of innocents and the death of hope.\n\n       Rep.

Mr. President, there is a great deal of talk about \nwhat we will\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\ndo long term to protect Social Security.\n  One relatively simple method of buttressing that fund and also \nputting the Federal Government in better financial shape is to follow \nthe advice of former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.\n  He had an op-ed piece recently in the Los Angeles Times that really \nmakes sense, which I ask to be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The difficulty rests with our system of campaign financing. Those who \nbenefit by the present system of not taxing incomes above $62,700 are \nthe big contributors to our campaigns. Even if you do not buy the idea \nof lowering the Social Security tax, revising the exemption certainly \nmakes our tax system a much more just system.\n  Mike Dukakis is right.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, March 15, 1996]\n\n                    A Fair Flat Tax to Rally Behind\n\n                          (By Michael Dukakis)\n\n       Steve Forbes hoped to ride into the White House on a flat \n     income tax with a low-earner exemption. He apparently had a \n     lot of company, at least on the Republican side of the \n     street.\n       Of course, when you look at it closely, the flat tax is \n     nothing more than another attempt to give a huge tax break to \n     wealthy taxpayers like Forbes. But it sounded good at least \n     when he first proposed it, and it transformed him, at lest \n     temporarily, into a serious challenger for the Republican \n     nomination.\n       Suppose, however, that a candidate for the presidency ran \n     on a plan for a flat tax with a high-earner exemption. We'd \n     think he was out of his mind.\n       Yet that's exactly how the Social Security tax works. We \n     pay a flat tax of 6.2% on every dollar we make, up to \n     $62,700. All wages above that are tax exempt.\n       The high-earner exemption is as regressive as it sounds. \n     And it's taking a huge chunk out of the wages of average \n     working Americans. A worker making $60,000 a year pays eight \n     times the rate paid by someone pulling in a half-million a \n     year and 80 times the rate paid by someone making 5 million a \n     year. To put it another way: A $60,000 earner pays 6.2% on \n     all her earnings; a $500,000 earner pays the 6.2% on the \n     first $62,700, which is 0.78% of all his earnings, and the \n     earner of $5 million pays the same, which is 0.078% of his \n     earnings.\n       It's bad enough that working middle class Americans are \n     feeling less and less secure. For those lucky enough to still \n     have a job in these days of massive corporate downsizing, the \n     Social Security tax is the unkindest cut of all.\n       In fact, more than half the people in this country pay more \n     in Social Security taxes than they do in income taxes. And \n     you can bet they aren't among the wealthiest 20% to whom \n     virtually all income growth has gone since 1980.\n       What can we do about it? It's a simple as it is common \n     sense. Get rid of the high-earner exemption, cut the Social \n     Security tax rate and apply it to all earned income--just \n     what the flat-taxers say they want to do to the income tax.\n       If we made this one move, the Social Security flat tax rate \n     would decrease by 12%. Everyone earnings less than $82,000--\n     that's more than 97% of American workers--would get a tax \n     break. It wouldn't increase the federal deficit one dime. But \n     it would eliminate the necessity for the kind of tax cut that \n     budget negotiators are wrestling with, which would add \n     billions to the deficit.\n       Lower taxes for the overwhelming majority of working \n     Americans. Heightened fairness. A fiscally responsible tax \n     cut for the middle class. These are the goals that all fair-\n     minded Republicans and Democrats should be able to support.\n       Of course, people like Steve Forbes would have to pay the \n     same rate as the rest of us. But wasn't that the principle \n     behind the flat tax in the first place?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4082-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TERM LIMITS\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate failed to \ninvoke cloture on the resolution that would have allowed the States to \ndecide whether the Constitution should be amended to impose term limits \non Congress. I supported invoking cloture and I want to express my \ndisappointment that we were not able to limit debate on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, 63 percent of Alaskans who voted cast their \nballot in favor of congressional term limits. I want to explain why I \nsupport the resolution and also cite some reservations I have \nconcerning this idea.\n  As a majority of Alaskan voters believe, term limits may indeed \nprovide for the infusion of fresh ideas and new perspectives through \nthe Halls of Congress. Term limits may also make Congress more \nresponsive to its constituents; decrease the possibility of corruption \nthat some see as stemming from longevity in office; and enhance the \nrole of merit, rather than seniority, in the distribution of power.\n  However, term limits unquestionably restrict the ability of voters to \nvote for whom they wish, thereby indiscriminately terminating the \npublic service work of both good legislators and bad legislators, \nalike.\n  Term limits would remove many of the most competent and experienced \nMembers from office prematurely, thereby destroying the so-called \ninstitutional memory. The only individuals who would retain an \ninstitutional memory would be professional staff. Term limits may very \nwell enhance their ability to shape legislation and become entrenched \nas the permanent bureaucracy of Capitol Hill.\n\n  Similarly, the professional lobbyists in Washington may also find \ntheir influence with Members of Congress improved, as they are far more \nfamiliar with the details of issues affecting their industries than new \nMembers of Congress.\n  Finally, I would note that term limits could well diminish the \ninfluence of Senators and Congressmen from States with small \npopulations, such as Alaska. I am especially concerned that term limits \nin the House will increase the power of States like California, Texas, \nand New York, which have delegations as large as 52 Members as opposed \nto States such as Alaska and Wyoming, each of which only has one \nRepresentative.\n  Despite my reservations, Mr. President, the people of Alaska have \nclearly indicated their preference for term limits and I abide by that \ndecision. I would support the constitutional term limit amendment \nbecause it would establish a uniform term-limit rule which would apply \nto all 50 States.\n  Uniformity among States is imperative not only because the Supreme \nCourt has ruled that individual States cannot constitutionally limit \nmandated uniformity, but also because States with term limits would be \nplaced at a serious disadvantage in the Congress with States that do \nnot limit Members' terms.\n  A uniform term-limit amendment would place all 50 States on equal \nfooting in representing constituents in Congress and that is why I \nsupport such an amendment. I will therefore vote in favor of the \nconstitutional amendment approach to term limits to ensure that \nAlaskans are guaranteed equal representation in the Congress.\n  I hope the majority leader will be able to bring this measure back \nbefore the Senate this year so that we can bring this issue to a final \nvote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4083-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4083-S4084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RON VAN DE HEY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I would like to honor Ronald \nVan De Hey for his outstanding service to Outagamie County and the \nentire Fox Valley area as he resigns from his position as county \nexecutive. Ron started his career in public service as a school board \nmember in 1972. In 1982 he was elected mayor of Kaukauna, where he \nserved for 9 years. His experience as mayor made him an excellent \nchoice for the position of Outagamie County executive, where he has \nserved with distinction since 1991.\n  Ronald Van De Hey has always had a strong commitment to the people of \nhis community. He was active not only in his elected positions but as a \nmember of charitable and professional organizations as well. Foremost \nin Ron's mind was always the desire to improve the lives of his fellow \ncitizens.\n  His colleagues will remember his diplomatic manner. His ability to \nwork with people on all sides of an issue and achieve a compromise \neveryone can feel good about will be sorely missed. While Ron was \nflexible, he also knew when to stick to his guns and rely on the \nstrength of his convictions. In the role of the executive he was \nwilling to make the tough decisions, even when it was not the popular \nthing to do.\n  Ronald Van De Hey is an excellent illustration of the quality people \nwho serve in local government. He has set an example of public service, \nnot only for other county officials, but for everyone who holds elected \noffice at the local, State or Federal level.\n  I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. I am sure he will \ncontinue to be a valuable asset to the Fox Valley area.\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\n\n\n              WOUND, OSTOMY AND CONTINENCE NURSES SOCIETY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome the Wound, \nOstomy and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN] to Seattle, WA, June 15-19, \nfor their 28th annual conference. The theme of the conference, ``The \nFuture Is Ours To Create.'' will focus on future opportunities and \nchallenges relating to the changing and expanding role of enterostomal \ntherapists [ET] nurses and other nurses specializing in wound, ostomy, \nand continence care.\n  Founded in 1968, the WOCN is the only national organization for \nnurses who specialize in the prevention of pressure ulcers and the \nmanagement and rehabilitation of persons with ostomies, wounds, and \nincontinence. WOCN, an association of ET nurses, is a professional \nnursing society which supports its members by promoting educational, \nclinical, and research opportunities, to advance the practice and guide \nthe delivery of expert health care to individuals with wounds, \nostomies, and incontinence.\n  In this age of changing health care services and skyrocketing costs, \nthe WOCN nurse plays an integral role in providing cost-effective care \nfor their patients. This year's Seattle conference will provide a \nunique opportunity for WOCN participants to learn about the most \ncurrent issues and trends related to their practice. I am honored that \nWOCN has chosen Seattle to host its conference and wish them every \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4083-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SEA-LAND CELEBRATES 30 YEARS OF SERVICE IN CHARLESTON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nthe contribution of Sea-Land Services to the city of Charleston over \nthe past 30 years. Not only my hometown, but the entire State of South \nCarolina has benefited from the services of this company.\n  Sea Land's founder, Malcolm McLean, is the father of modern \ncontainerization. It was his idea to use standardized boxes for \nshipping goods internationally by sea. By limiting the handling of a \ncontainer's contents, this technique afforded rapid, safe, and \ninexpensive transportation of goods all over the world, thus having a \nprofound impact on world trade and economic development. It is a simple \nconcept, containerization of goods to be handled only at their origin \nand their destination, but it is one of the more important innovations \nin recent history.\n  Since its arrival in 1966, Sea-Land has enjoyed a prosperous \nrelationship with the city of Charleston. It has expanded to meet the \ngrowing trade needs of South Carolinians, and now moves cargo to and \nfrom more than 35 countries. In 1966, Sea-Land's containership, Gateway \nCity, first sailed into Charleston harbor; 30 years later, Charleston's \ncontainer cargo has grown from 80,000 tons to over 8.2 million tons, \nwith the value growing from $512 million to more than $20 billion.\n  Charleston's efficient inland links and close access to the open sea \nled other steamship companies to follow Sea-Land's lead and make the \ncity their south Atlantic base of operations. The trading potential \noffered by these ocean carriers has opened markets around the world for \nU.S. products. Cargo ships provide many opportunities for economic \ndevelopment in the regions they serve.\n  Due to the relatively transparent movement of goods these days, few \npeople realize that 95 percent of our international trade moves by \nship. This is a tribute to the success of containerization and the \ntransportation industry. The effects of Sea-Land's contribution to the \nshipping industry go beyond Charleston to the entire State and the \nSoutheast. Manufacturers in 26 States use the extensive shipping \nservices in Charleston. The trade relationships that Sea-Land makes \npossible bring countries together across the world.\n  The State of South Carolina has enjoyed tremendous economic growth \nrecently, attracting interest and investments from all over the globe. \nWithout the capital commitments of our ports and ocean carriers like \nSea-Land, this would not be possible. We appreciate the continued \ncommitment Sea-Land has made to our area and look forward to another 30 \nprosperous years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4084-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO DR. MAHMOUD FAHMY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my warm \ncongratulations to Dr. Mahmoud H. Fahmy of Dallas, PA who will be \nhonored by his colleagues, friends, and family at a testimonial dinner \nthis evening. Dr. Fahmy has recently retired from Wilkes University in \nWilkes-Barre, PA where he spent 30 years of his professional life. \nAlthough formally retired from Wilkes University, Dr. Fahmy is \ncurrently the President of his own business, serves as chairman of the \nLuzerne County Community College Board of Trustees, and is a member of \ncountless community service organizations.\n  I have had the pleasure of personally knowing Dr. Fahmy and \nappreciating his dedication, not only to domestic educational \nendeavors, but to international projects as well. Dr. Fahmy's exemplary \nduty and service to the community at large has earned him the great \nrespect of his colleagues, friends, and family. I would like to join \nthem in commending him for his dedication to his community and to his \nprofession. Dedicating one's career to education is something very \nspecial and should be recognized by all of us who enjoy the fruits of \nthis great country.\n  The State of Pennsylvania is very lucky to have Dr. Fahmy amongst its \ncitizens, and should be very proud of his accomplishments. I would like \nto conclude by extending to him my best wishes for a happy retirement \nand much success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4084-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4084-S4085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN VICTIMS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues again this \nyear in remembering today the 1.5 million Armenians who died in 1915 in \nthe hands of the Ottoman Empire. These Armenians were victims of a \npolicy explicitly intended to isolate, exile, and even extinguish the \nArmenian population. As we look at world events today--in Bosnia, \nRwanda, and elsewhere--we must remember the events of 1915, with the \nhope that with history as a guide, humanity will not engage in such \nbrutality again.\n  We will also learn from history that America served as a haven for \nthose Armenians fleeing persecution. At the time of the atrocities, \nAmerica spoke out in defense of a defenseless people, and provided \nmassive amounts of humanitarian assistance to the Armenian people. \nToday, America still leads the world in championing human rights, and \nour shores offer refuge to those fleeing persecution throughout the \nworld. On days like today, we must remember what we stand for, and \nensure that the U.S. continues to be a beacon of strength and hope for \nthe heroes that stand up and survive such atrocities.\n  I compliment President Clinton on his commitment to the Armenian \ncause, and I am proud to join him and my colleagues today in \ncommemorating this import ant occasion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the city of Washington, DC, is blessed this \nweek with the presence of some of the most dedicated people in \nAmerica--its teachers. Each state's Teacher of the Year is visiting \nWashington to be honored for their top notch work in educating our \nchildren.\n  As a husband of a teacher, I know how some people view the teaching \nprofession. I have heard all of the jokes. And, I have read the \narticles--including some recent ones--deriding the Nation's teaching \nforce and claiming that teachers are the root of our educational \nproblems.\n  Well, Mr. President, the Teachers of the Year that are here this week \nshould dispel those myths. These teachers are simply among the best and \nthe brightest our Nation has to offer.\n  For most of us, there was at least one teacher along the way who \ntouched us, who motivated us, who inspired us. A teacher who was more \nthan just a body at the blackboard. For students in the Indian River \nSchool District in my State of Delaware, one of those teachers is \nDarryl Hudson. He is Delaware's Teacher of the Year, and I want to \ncongratulate him and take just few minutes to honor him.\n  Mr. Hudson--named the top teacher among over 6,000 public school \nteachers\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nin Delaware--teaches seventh grade science at Sussex Central Middle \nSchool in Millsboro, DE. And, although I have never experienced his \nteaching first hand, I think the biggest testament about what he does \nin the classroom comes from what his fellow teachers say about him. \nThey talk admiringly of the energy he brings to school each day, of his \ndedication to educating all children, and of the uplifting inspiration \nhe provides to staff, parents, and most importantly, the students.\n  But, as is the case with many teachers, Mr. Hudson's involvement in \nand dedication to education go beyond the classroom. He is a \ncooperative teacher for Salisbury State University students, a member \nof the New Directions Educator Corps, and a Mentor for a Wilmington \nCollege student.\n  I should also note that we in Delaware are proud that Mr. Hudson is a \nproduct of our own higher education system. In fact, he and I are both \nFightin' Blue Hens. For my colleagues who do not know, that means we \nare both graduates of the University of Delaware. He received his \nmasters degree from Wilmington College. And, at the same time he is \nteaching seventh graders--a daunting task in and of itself, in my \nview--he continues to pursue his own education at Salisbury State \nUniversity just across the Delaware border in Maryland.\n  Mr. President, a moment ago, I mentioned the way in which a teacher \nhas inspired almost every one of us. And, to give you a perfect \nillustration of the power of a teacher to mold a mind and build a \ncitizen, Mr. Hudson--a teacher--was himself inspired by a teacher. He \nsays that his sixth grade teacher had more influence on him than anyone \nelse outside his immediate family. And, now, he is having that same \ninfluence on countless others.\n  Again, I want to congratulate Darryl Hudson on his selection as \nDelaware Teacher of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4084-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4085-S4086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE COMING CENTURY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, every study that is made suggests \nthat the United States has to do a better job in the field of \neducation.\n  No one disputes it.\n  And yet at the congressional level and candidly also at the State \nlevel we are going along blissfully ignoring this reality, mouthing \npious statements about education, but not really doing much.\n  One of many economists who has been telling us that we have to do \nbetter in the field of education is Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology and probably the most widely read economist in \nthe country.\n  He is also one of the most thoughtful.\n  Recently in the Washington Post he had an article titled ``Preparing \nStudents for the Coming Century,'' which I asked to be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks.\n  I am sure some of my colleagues read it, but since it was in the \nEducation Section of the Sunday edition of the Washington Post, some of \nyou may not have read it.\n  It is worth reading for Senators, for House Members, for staffers, \nand for anyone who may pick up a Congressional Record and go through \nit. The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 7, 1996]\n\n               Preparing Students for the Coming Century\n\n                         (By Lester C. Thurow)\n\n       Consider an alphabetical list of the 12 largest companies \n     in America at the turn of the 20th century: the American \n     Cotton Oil Company, American Steel, American Sugar Refining \n     Company, Continental Tobacco, Federal Steel, General \n     Electric, National Lead, Pacific Mail, People's Gas, \n     Tennessee Coal and Iron, U.S. Leather and U.S. Rubber. Ten of \n     the 12 were natural resource companies. The economy then was \n     a natural resource economy, and wherever the most highly \n     needed resources were to be found, employment opportunities \n     would follow.\n       In contrast consider the list made 90 years later by the \n     Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, \n     enumerating what it projected to be the most rapidly growing \n     industries of the 1990s: microelectronics, biotech, the new \n     material-science industries, telecommunications, civilian \n     aircraft manufacturing, machine tools and robots, and \n     computers (hardware and software). All are brainpower \n     industries that could be located anywhere on the face of the \n     earth. Where they will take root and flourish depends upon \n     who organizes the brainpower to capture them. And who \n     organizes the power most efficiently will depend on who \n     educates toward that objective best.\n       But back to the industries for the moment: Think of the \n     video camera and recorder (invented by Americans), the fax \n     (invented by Americans), and the CD player (invented by the \n     Dutch). When it comes to sales, employment and profits, all \n     have become Japanese products despite the fact that the \n     Japanese did not invent any of them. Product invention, if \n     one is also not the world's low-cost producer, gives a \n     country very little economic advantage. Being the low-cost \n     producer is partly a matter of wages, but to a much greater \n     extent it is a matter of having the skills necessary to put \n     new things together.\n       Wages don't depend on an individual's skill and \n     productivity alone. To a great extent they reflect team \n     skills and team productivities. The value of any single \n     person's knowledge depends upon the smartness with which that \n     knowledge is used in the overall economic system--the \n     abilities of buyers and suppliers to absorb that individual's \n     skills.\n       In an era of brainpower industries, however, the picture is \n     even more complicated: The economy is a dynamic economy \n     always in transition--the companies that do best are those \n     able to move from product to product within technological \n     families so quickly that they can always keep one generation \n     ahead. Keeping one jump ahead in software, for instance, Bill \n     Gates's Microsoft had a net income running at 24 percent of \n     sales in 1995.\n       If a country wants to stay at the leading edge of \n     technology and continue to generate high wages and profits, \n     it must be a participant in the evolutionary progress of \n     brainpower industries so that it is in a position to take \n     advantage of the technical and economic revolutions that \n     occasionally arise. Knowledge has become the only source of \n     long-run sustainable competitive advantage. Recent studies \n     show that rates of return for industries that invest in \n     knowledge and skill are more than twice those of industries \n     that concentrate on plant and equipment. In the past, First \n     World citizens with Third World skills could earn premium \n     wages simply because they lived in the First World. They had \n     more equipment, better technology and more skilled co-workers \n     than those who lived in the Third World. But that premium is \n     gone. Today's transportation and communications technologies \n     have become so sophisticated that high-wage skilled workers \n     in the First World can work together effectively with low-\n     wage unskilled workers in the Third World. America's \n     unskilled now get paid based on their own abilities and not \n     on those of their better-trained co-workers.\n       Industrial components that require highly skilled \n     manufacturers can be made in the First World and then shipped \n     to the Third World to be assembled with ``low skill'' \n     components. Research and design skills can be electronically \n     brought in from the First World. Sales results can be quickly \n     communicated to the Third World factory, and retailers know \n     that the speed of delivery won't be significantly affected by \n     where production occurs. Instant communications and rapid \n     transportation allow markets to be served effectively from \n     production points on the other side of the globe.\n       Multinational companies are central in this process: Where \n     they develop and keep technological leadership will determine \n     where most of the high-level jobs will be located. If these \n     firms decide to locate their top-wage leadership skills in \n     the United States, it will not be because they happen to be \n     American firms but because America offers them the lowest \n     cost of developing these skills. The decisions will be purely \n     economic. If America is not competitive in this regard, the \n     market will move on. The countries that offer companies the \n     lowest costs of developing technological leadership will be \n     the countries that invest the most in research and \n     development, education and infrastructure (telecommunications \n     systems, etc.).\n       If the person on a loading dock runs a computerized \n     inventory-control system in which he logs delivered materials \n     right into his hand-held computer and the computer instantly \n     prints out a check that is given to the truck driver to be \n     taken back to his firm (eliminating the need for large white-\n     collar accounting offices that process purchases), the person \n     on the loading dock ceases to be someone who just moves \n     boxes. He or she has to have a very different skill set.\n       Factory operatives and laborers used to be high school \n     graduates or even high school dropouts. Today 16 percent of \n     them have some college education and 5 percent have graduated \n     from college. Among precision production and craft workers, \n     32 percent have been to or graduated from college. Among new \n     hires those percentages are much higher. In the last two \n     decades, the linkage between math abilities and wages has \n     tripled for men and doubled for women.\n       The skill sets required in the economy of the future will \n     be radically different from those required in the past. And \n     the people who acquire those skill sets may not be the \n     unskilled workers who currently live in the first world. With \n     the ability to make anything anywhere in the world and sell \n     it anywhere else in the world, business firms can ``cherry \n     pick'' the skilled or those easy (i.e., cheap) to teach \n     wherever they live. American firms don't have to hire an \n     American high school graduate if that graduate is not world-\n     class. His or her educational defects are not their problem. \n     Investing to give the necessary market skills to a well-\n     educated Chinese high school graduate may well end\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n     up being a much more attractive (i.e., less costly) \n     investment than having to retrain an American high school \n     dropout or a poorly trained high school graduate.\n       Take Korea for example. In a global economy, what \n     economists know as ``the theory of factor price \n     equalization'' holds that an American worker will have to \n     work for wages commensurate with a Korean's wages unless he \n     works with more natural resources than a Korean (and no \n     American can, since there is now a world market for raw \n     material to which everyone has equal access); unless he has \n     access to more capital than a Korean (and no American can \n     since there is a global capital market where everyone borrows \n     in New York, London and Tokyo); unless he has more skilled \n     co-workers than a Korean (and no American can claim to \n     since multi-national companies can send needed knowledge \n     and skills anywhere in the world); and unless he has \n     access to better technology than a Korean (and few \n     Americans have, since reverse engineering--tearing a \n     product apart to learn how it is made--has become an \n     international art form, highly refined in Korea). Adjusted \n     for skills, Korean wages will rise and American wages will \n     fall until they equal each other. At that point, factor \n     price equalization will have occurred.\n       The implications for the future are simple. If America \n     wants to generate a high standard of living for all of its \n     citizens, skill and knowledge development are central. New \n     brainpower industries have to be invented and captured. \n     Organizing brainpower means not just building a research and \n     development system that will put us on the leading edge of \n     technology, but organizing a top-to-bottom work force that \n     has the brainpower necessary to make us masters of the new \n     production and distribution technologies that will allow us \n     to be the world's low-cost producers.\n       To do this will require a very different American \n     educational system. And building such a system is the new \n     American challenge.\n       Progress has to start by ratcheting up the intensity of the \n     American high school. The performance of the average American \n     high school graduate simply lags far behind that found in the \n     rest of the industrial world. Those Americans who complete a \n     college course of study end up catching up (the rest of the \n     industrial world doesn't work very hard in the first couple \n     of years of university education), but three quarters of the \n     American work force doesn't ever catch up.\n       The skill gap doesn't end there. Non-college-bound high \n     school graduates elsewhere in the industrial world go on to \n     some form of post-graduate skill training. Germany has its \n     famous apprenticeship system; in France every business firm \n     by law has to spend one percent of its sales revenue on \n     training its work force; and with lifetime employment as a \n     fact of life, Japanese companies invest heavily in the work \n     force's skills since they know that it is impossible to hire \n     skilled workers from the outside. In America, government-\n     funded programs are very limited in nature, and, with high \n     labor-force turnover rates, American companies quite \n     rationally don't want to make skill investments in people who \n     will leave and take their skills elsewhere. The net result is \n     a compounded skill gap for those Americans who do not \n     graduate from college. Closing this gap and giving the \n     country a competitive edge should be America's number one \n     educational priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4085-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nanniversary of a most tragic chapter in history--the genocide of the \nArmenian people. Eighty-one years ago today, the Ottoman Empire began \nthe systematic elimination of the people of Armenia. It is of paramount \nimportance that we recall this horrible time so that it will never be \nrepeated.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began arresting hundreds of \npolitical, religious, and intellectual leaders throughout Anatolia. In \nthe following 2 years, the Ottoman regime carried out a systematic, \npremeditated, centrally planned genocide, taking the lives of \napproximately 1.5 million people.\n  The Armenian genocide remains one of the most horrifying events in \nhuman history. Armenians perished from execution, starvation, disease, \nphysical abuse, and exposure to a harsh environment. More than 500,000 \npeople were forced from their homes, and within a few years, the entire \nArmenian population had been either killed or exiled.\n  On May 28, 1918, the Armenians were able to defeat a Turkish attack, \nwith the help of volunteers from abroad. They gained freedom for a \nbrief period, but in 1920 the Soviet Union joined the Ottoman Empire \nand subjugated the Armenians once again. It was not until 1991, after \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union, that independence was restored and the \nRepublic of Armenia was born.\n  I salute the Armenian people for their strength and courage. Yet even \nthough they have gained independence, their struggle still continues. \nTo this day, many people continue to refute the facts of the Armenian \nGenocide. We cannot let the suffering inflicted upon the armenian \npeople be forgotten or denied. Only through remembrance can we prevent \nourselves from repeating the horrors of the past.\n  The Armenian tragedy is the world's tragedy, and we must work \ntogether to discourage prejudice, to end discrimination, and to prevent \ngenocide at all costs. In a country where we so often take our liberty \nfor granted, we must renew our commitment to preserving the freedom of \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4086-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4086-S4087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL PARK\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in December 1994, Congress \nreceived the National Cave and Karst Research Institute study from the \nNational Park Service. The report studied the feasibility of creating a \nNational Cave and Karst Research Institute in the vicinity of Carlsbad \nCaverns National Park, NM, as directed by Public Law 101-578. Today, I \nam here to introduce a bill which follows the guidelines of that report \nand which will establish the National Cave and Karst Research Institute \nin Carlsbad, NM.\n  While other Nations have recognized the importance of cave resource \nmanagement information and have sponsored cave and karst research, the \nUnited States has failed, until recently, to appreciate or work to \nunderstand cave and karst systems and their importance. As we approach \nthe 21st century, the protection and management of our water resources \nhas been identified as one of the major issues facing the world. In \nAmerica, the majority of the Nation's fresh water is ground water--of \nwhich 25 percent is located in cave and karst regions.\n  Recent studies have also indicated that caves contain valuable \ninformation related to global climate change, waste disposal, ground \nwater supply and contamination, petroleum recovery, and biomedical \ninvestigations. Caves provide a unique understanding of the historic \nevents of humankind. Further they are considered sacred and have \nreligious significance for American Indians and other Native Americans.\n  According to the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act, karst is \ndefined as a landform characterized by sinkholes, caves, dry valleys, \nfluted rocks, enclosed depressions, underground streamways and spring \nresurgences. As a whole, 20 percent of the United States is karst. In \nfact, east of central Oklahoma, 40 percent of the country is karst. Our \nNational Park System manages 58 units with caves and karst features, \nyet academic programs on these systems are virtually nonexistent. Most \nresearch is conducted with little or no funding and the resulting data \nis scattered and often hard to locate. The few cave and karst \norganizations and programs which do exist, have substantially different \nmissions, locations and funding sources and there is no centralized \nprogram to analyze data or determine future research needs.\n  In 1988 Congress directed the Secretaries of the Interior and \nAgriculture to provide an inventory of caves on Federal lands and to \nprovide for the management and dissemination of information about the \ncaves. That directive has served only to make Federal land management \nagencies more aware of the need for a cave research program and a \nrepository for cave and karst resources. In 1990, Congress further \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the \nNational Park Service, to establish and administer a Cave Research \nProgram and prepare a proposal for Congress on the feasibility of a \ncentralized National Cave and Karst Research Institute.\n  The National Cave and Karst Research Institute Study Report to \nCongress was released in December 1994 and not only supports \nestablishing the Institute, but lists several serious threats to \ncontinued uninformed management practices.\n  Threats such as: alterations in the surface water flow patterns in \nkarst regions, alterations in or pollution of water infiltration \nroutes, inappropriately placed toxic waste repositories and poorly \nmanaged or designed sewage systems and landfiles. The findings of the \nreport conclude that it is only through a better understanding of cave\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nresources that we can prevent detrimental impacts to America's natural \nresources and cave ecosystems.\n  The goals of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute, as \noutlined in the report, would be to further the science of speleology, \nto centralize speleological information, to further interdisciplinary \ncooperation in cave and karst research programs, and to promote \nenvironmentally sound, sustainable resource management practices. These \ngoals would work hand in hand with the proposed objectives of the \nInstitute to establish a comprehensive cave and karst library and \ninformation data base, to sponsor national and international cave and \nkarst symposiums, to develop long term research studies, to produce \ncave-related educational publications and to develop cooperative \nagreements with all Federal agencies having cave management \nresponsibilities.\n  The vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park is ideal due to the \ncommunity support which already exists for the establishment of the \ninstitute and the diverse cave and karst resources which are found \nthroughout the region.\n  Carlsbad, NM, has grown from a small railroad stop on what is now the \nSanta Fe Railroad to a growing city with a population of over 170,000 \nin the tri-county area. It continues to attract new businesses, small \nmanufacturers, retirees and research facilities, including the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's Carlsbad area office. In addition, Carlsbad \nCaverns National Park attracts over 700,000 visitors per year.\n  The National Cave and Karst Research Institute would be jointly \nadministered by the National Park Service and another public or private \nagency, organization, or institution as determined by the Secretary. \nThe Carlsbad Department of Development [CDOD], after reviewing the \nNational Cave and Karst Research Institute study report, has developed \nproposals to obtain financial support from available and supportive \norganizational resources, including personnel, facilities, equipment \nand volunteers. They further believe that they can obtain serious \nfinancial support from the private sector and would seek a matching \ngrant from the State of New Mexico equal to the available Federal \nfunds.\n  Carlsbad already has in place many of the needed cooperative \ninstitutions, facilities and volunteers that will work toward the \nsuccess of the National Cave and Karst Institute. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to increase our understanding of \ncave and karst systems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4086-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' \nattention to the solemn anniversary of the Armenian genocide. In 1915, \nthe Ottoman Turkish Government launched an extermination campaign \nagainst all Armenians on its territory. The result of that gruesome \npolicy was the death of about 1.5 million people, the destruction of a \nonce flourishing community, and the scattering of the survivors around \nthe globe.\n  Many Armenians came to America, where they have rebuilt their \ncommunities, prospered and become a vital part of the American body \npolitic. They have nurtured our democracy, while maintaining their \ntraditions and always remembering the circumstances that forced them \nfrom their homeland. Meanwhile, their brothers and sisters in Armenia \nendured communism and Joseph Stalin, but despite the different fates of \nthese two communities, they remained stubbornly and proudly Armenian, \neven when contact between them was difficult.\n  In 1991, Armenia became an independent country and has worked hard to \nconsolidate its independence since then. Today Armenia is a respected \nmember of the international community, its progress toward \ndemocratization and economic well-being promoted by the worldwide \nArmenian Diaspora and by supportive governments, especially the United \nStates.\n  Independence confers freedom, but not necessarily freedom from \nhardship. Apart from the devastating December 1988 earthquake, Armenia \nhas also endured the consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and \nthe adversities caused by blockades imposed by neighboring Azerbaijan \nand Turkey. Happily, the Nagorno-Karabakh cease-fire has held since May \n1994, offering grounds to hope that the conflict will be peacefully \nresolved in the foreseeable future. All the parties to this dispute \nmust pursue its peaceful resolution through the OSCE process, and with \nactive American involvement, bring about a lasting, stable peace.\n  In the spirit of reconciliation and looking ahead to Armenia's \nfuture, President Ter-Petrossyan said in Washington last year that \n``Armenia has no enemies.'' All of us who are friends of Armenia are \nworking for precisely that future, for an Armenia without enemies, \nwhile remembering the victims of the Armenian Genocide.\n  Mr. President, in light of the fact that, for the first time since \nWorld War II, there are international tribunals investigating two \ncurrent genocides, one in Bosnia and one in Rwanda, it is very \nimportant that all of us remember the first genocide of the 20th \ncentury, and dedicate ourselves to the proposition that there will be \nno new genocides in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4087-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr President, 81 years ago today one of the most \nhorrific events of our century began. On this day in 1915, hundreds of \nArmenian political and religious leaders were arrested, taken to the \nTurkish interior, and executed. This began a terrible chapter of \nhistory--the Armenian genocide.\n  In the 8 years that followed, over a million Armenians were killed at \nthe hands of the Ottoman authorities. Men, women, and children were \nbrutally taken from their homes to be abused and killed in mass \nslayings. Others were rounded-up and marched for weeks through the \nSyrian desert where many more perished. Symbols of culture--churches, \nlibraries, and towns--were razed.\n  On this, the 81st anniversary of the Armenian genocide, we must \nremember and we must speak out.\n  Many call this tragedy ``the forgotten genocide''. In our world of \nterror and continued upheaval it is essential that we never forget. We \nmust remember our history and the lesson of the Armenian genocide. As \nAmericans blessed with security and freedom, we must never let \noppression and persecution pass without loud condemnation. By \nremembering the Armenian genocide, we renew our ongoing commitment to \nfight for human dignity and freedom throughout the world.\n  We must also honor the Armenians throughout the world who left their \nhomes in tragedy. They have maintained their proud culture and \ntraditions throughout the world. Their strength and perseverance is a \ntriumph of the human spirit. We should specifically recognize those \nArmenians who fled from their homes and into our communities. Today we \nthank them for their invaluable contributions to our society.\n  Even today, the Armenian people are living under a unfair and unjust \nblockade preventing needed humanitarian aid. Last year, the Congress \nenacted the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act that would prohibit U.S. aid \nto countries that prevent our humanitarian aid from reaching places in \nneed. I was proud to support this act and see it signed into law.\n  Despite a long history of pain, persecution, and tragedy, the \nArmenian people have shown remarkable strength, pride, and resilience. \nWe as Americans are proud of their contributions to our society. We \nwill always remember their tragedy and we salute their achievements. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4087-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4087-S4088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE VOLUNTEERS OF HOSPICE CARE, INC.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe volunteers of Hospice Care, Inc. in southwestern Fairfield County, \nCT. For 15 years Hospice Care has provided care and comfort to people \nwith terminal illnesses. But beyond providing palliative care, Hospice \nis a program for individuals who are dealing with the emotional and \nspiritual changes that follow the diagnosis of a life-ending illness.\n  Hospice could not offer its many meaningful services without its \nvolunteers; they are an integral part of Hospice. Together with \nprofessional staff,\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nvolunteers work to relieve the physical, emotional and spiritual pain \nexperienced by the patient and family. Volunteers provide direct \npatient and family services, including companionship and support, \ntransportation, assistance with chores and errands, and pastoral and \nbereavement care. Volunteers visit patients and families in their homes \nand hospitals, nursing homes, homeless shelters, and residences for \npeople with AIDS. These volunteers offer a listening ear and a shoulder \nto lean on during a family's most challenging times.\n  Other volunteers work behind the scenes, serving on the Board of \nDirectors, assisting in fundraising and public education efforts, and \nwith administrative tasks. In 1994, 100 active volunteers donated more \nthan 12,000 hours of public service, valued at over $250,000. But one \ncannot put a price tag on this dedicated service--these efforts are \npriceless, and Hospice could not operate as successfully as it does \nwithout its volunteers.\n  It is with great pride and pleasure that I commend the volunteers of \nHospice Care for their many hours of difficult and dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4087-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the 81 years since the tragedy of the Armenian genocide \nunfolded. Today we pause to remember the victims of this great tragedy \nand to pay our respects to the survivors.\n  Indeed it is important that we take this occasion to educate \nourselves about the events that constituted the Armenian genocide, and \nto resolve never to remain indifferent in the face of such assaults on \nhumanity. Respect for the memories of the Armenians who were martyred \nin this great tragedy demands that humanity never forget this day. It \nalso represents an opportunity for people of goodwill to honestly \nconfront the past and move to genuine reconciliation.\n  We are also pleased that after centuries of oppression, the Armenian \npeople are again now free and independent. The Republic of Armenia is \nproof that the Armenian spirit is alive and vibrant and, despite \nenormous outside pressures, is making progress and flourishing. As \nArmenia struggles to reenter the society of nations, it is instructive \nfor us to recognize the sacrifices of the victims of the genocide.\n  The anniversary of this tragedy holds special meaning to Armenians \neverywhere and, in spite of a history of many hardships, difficulties \nand adversity faced by the Armenian people, the community has \nstrengthened its resolve to survive and prosper. Armenian-Americans are \none of the best examples of an indomitable human spirit. The \ncontribution of the Armenian community to the cultural, social, \neconomic, and political landscape of America is a source of great \nstrength and vitality in our Nation. Americans of Armenian origin have \nkept alive, and not let tragedy shatter, the rich faith and traditions \nof Armenian civilization.\n  As we recall the Armenian genocide, it is important to recognize that \nit was the culmination of an abhorrent pattern of persecution against \nthe Armenian community living in the Ottoman Empire. During the period \n1894-1896, and again in 1909, tens of thousands of Armenians lost their \nlives. On April 24, 1915, 300 Armenian intellectuals, religious and \npolitical leaders, and professionals were rounded up by Ottoman \nauthorities and taken to remote parts of Anatolia from where they never \nreturned. At least 250,000 Armenians who loyally served in the Ottoman \narmy were expelled and forced into labor battalions where executions \nand starvation were common. Men, women, and children were deported from \ntheir villages and obliged to march for weeks in the Syrian desert \nwhere a majority of them lost their lives.\n  The unfortunate campaign against this community earlier in this \ncentury resulted in widespread deportations and death. More than 1.5 \nmillion innocent men, women, and children, out of a total of 2.5 \nmillion Armenians living within the Ottoman Empire, lost their lives. \nEntire families were destroyed, and thousands of survivors were \nscattered around the world. In fact, contemporaneous newspaper accounts \nin the United States describing these atrocities inspired Americans to \ncontribute $113 million in humanitarian assistance from 1915 to 1930 to \nhelp the survivors. Americans eventually adopted 132,000 Armenian \norphans into this country.\n  One of the most prominent and reliable accounts of the Armenian \ngenocide is provided by the distinguished United States ambassador to \nthe Ottoman Empire at the time, Henry Morgenthau. In an article \npublished in the Red Cross magazine in 1918, Morgenthau described the \nwide-scale and systematic attempts by the Ottomans to crush the \nArmenian community as, ``the Greatest Horror in History.'' Abram Elkus, \nMorgenthau's successor, also cabled the State Department that the Young \nTurks policy against the Armenians was an ``unchecked policy of \nextermination through starvation, exhaustion, and brutality of \ntreatment hardly surpassed even in Turkish history.''\n  Both the German and Austrian ambassadors, apprehensive about the \nattacks against the Armenians, conveyed their concerns directly to the \nOttoman leadership. In July of 1915, Hans Von Wangenheim, the German \nAmbassador to the Ottomans, advised his own government to distance \nitself from the Ottoman leadership for what he viewed as a campaign to \nrid ``the Armenian race in the Turkish empire.''\n  Extensive evidence, documentation, and first hand accounts have been \ncollected over the years regarding this dark period, much of which is \nheld in our own National Archives. In 1987, it was fitting that the \nHolocaust Council expressed its support for making the Armenian \ngenocide part of the permanent exhibits at the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Museum. In its statement, the council declared that ``the fate \nof the Armenians should be included in any discussion of genocide in \nthe twentieth century.''\n  Several years ago, Elie Wiesel spoke at a Holocaust memorial service \nhere in the Congress and expressed the importance of recognizing the \nArmenian genocide. He stated, ``Before the planning of the final \nsolution, Hitler asked, ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' He was right. \nNo one remembered them, as no one remembered the Jews. Rejected by \neveryone, they felt expelled from history.''\n  Mr. President, we must never forget the moral lesson of the Armenian \ngenocide and honor it by renewing our commitment to human rights and \ndemocratic principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4088-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4088-S4089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, each year on this day, we solemnly \njoin Armenians worldwide in observing the anniversary of the genocide \nperpetrated against the Armenian people between 1915 and 1923.\n  Eighty-one years ago today, Ottoman leaders launched a systematic \ncampaign to eradicate the Armenian people from Ottoman Empire \nterritory. In that year, hundreds of Armenian religious, political, and \nintellectual leaders were rounded up and exiled, or murdered. During \nthe next 8 years, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were executed. \nMany were raped, tortured, or enslaved. In addition to those killed, an \nestimated 500,000 Armenians were exiled from the Ottoman Empire. Many \nof those exiles found their way to freedom in the United States where \nthey and their descendants have made--and are continuing to make--a \nsignificant contribution to the cultural, political, and commercial \nlife of this country.\n  Despite the many challenges they have faced over the years, the \nArmenian people have demonstrated a high degree of independence, \nresilience, and national pride. I believe the anniversary of the \ngenocide offers an opportunity to reflect upon the challenges Armenia \nis facing today. In particular, Armenia continues to struggle under \nblockades by its neighbors, and as a result, it continues to depend \nheavily on humanitarian assistance. I would note that the United States \nhas responded to Armenia's plight. Armenia receives more assistance per \ncapita than any other Newly Independent State. I know we all look \nforward to the day when Armenia--a country of great human resources--\nwill be a donor, rather than a recipient of assistance.\n  In fact, despite the blockades, Armenia has made significant economic\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nprogress during the past year. Its currency has stabilized, inflation \nhas decreased, and the economy showed a positive growth rate. Armenia \nis also working hard to enact the necessary legal and regulatory \nframework for true reform to take root.\n  Regrettably, a lasting diplomatic settlement to the Nagorno-Karabagh \ncrisis also remains elusive. I hope that the memory of the Armenian \ngenocide, as well as the continuing of the suffering of the Armenian \nand Azeri peoples, will spur a peaceful resolution to the dispute.\n  There are, in fact, some hopeful signs. For the past 2-years, a \ncease-fire has held in Nagorno-Karabagh. Over the weekend, President \nTer Petrosian of Armenia and President Aliyev of Azerbaijan issued a \njoint communique agreeing that direct dialog between the parties must \nbe intensified to facilitate an end to the conflict.\n  Armenia is continuing to talk with its neighbors not only about how \nto resolve the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict, but about the importance of \neconomic development of the region. In fact, just this week in \nLuxembourg, the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia each signed \nbilateral cooperation agreements with the European Union.\n  I would note that Armenia is also engaging in a dialog with Turkey \nabout a range of bilateral and regional issues. This is a courageous, \nand very practical, decision. Both countries acknowledge that it is in \ntheir interest to talk, and I believe that we should do what we can to \nencourage such discussions between Yerevan and Ankara.\n  Sadly, the legacy of the Armenian genocide has not succeeded in \ndeterring subsequent acts of genocide in other parts of the world nor \ndid it represent an end to the suffering of the Armenian people. \nHowever, it is only by continuing to remember and discuss the horrors \nwhich befell the Armenian and other peoples that we can hope to achieve \na world where genocide is finally relegated to the realm of history \nbooks, rather the newspaper headlines.\n  I hope my colleagues and leaders throughout the world will join me in \ncommemorating the anniversary today, and thus ensure that the tragedy \nof the Armenian genocide will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4088-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, April 24, marks the 81st \nanniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. I rise today to \nacknowledge and commemorate this terrible chapter in our history, to \nhelp ensure that it will never be forgotten.\n  Eighty-one years ago today, one of the darkest chapters in human \nhistory began. On that day, Ottoman authorities began arresting \nArmenian political and religious leaders throughout Anatolia. Over the \nensuing months and years, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed at the \nhands of the Ottoman authorities, and hundreds of thousands more were \nexiled from their homes.\n  On this 81st anniversary of the Armenian genocide, let us renew our \ncommitment never to forget the horror and barbarism of this event. We \nmust remember, we must speak out, and we must teach the next generation \nabout the systematic persecution and murder of millions of Armenians by \nthe Ottoman Government. I know that I am joined by every one of my \ncolleagues, by the Armenian American community, and by people across \nthe United States in commemorating the genocide and paying tribute to \nthe victims of this crime against humanity.\n  As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that \nblessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never \nallow oppression and persecution to pass without condemnation. By \ncommemorating the Armenian genocide, we renew our commitment always to \nfight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the \nworld can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. Out of the ashes of their history, Armenians all across the \nworld have clung to their identity and have prospered in new \ncommunities. My State of California is fortunate to be home to a \ncommunity of Armenian-Americans a half a million strong. They are a \nstrong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect \nof civic life, and California is the richer for their presence.\n  The strength and perseverance of the Armenian people is a triumph of \nthe human spirit, which refuses to cede victory to evil. The best \nretort to the perpetrators of oppression and destruction is rebirth, \nrenewal, and rebuilding. Armenians throughout the world have done just \nthat, and today they do it in their homeland as well. A free and \nindependent Armenia stands today as a living monument to the resilience \nof a people. I am proud that the United States, through our friendship \nand assistance, is contributing to the rebuilding and renewal of \nArmenia.\n  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian genocide; let their \ndeaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that \nsuch crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark \npast, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is \nbright with possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4089-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4089-S4090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GENOCIDE REMEMBERED\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 81st \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide that took place during the final \nyears of the Ottoman Empire. From 1915 to 1923, some 1,500,000 persons \nof Armenian ancestry are reported to have died at the hands of their \nOttoman rulers, through a deliberate policy of deportation, \nconfiscation of property, slave labor, and murder.\n  Although we now recognize this policy as genocide, no such word \nexisted at the time of its commission. The American Ambassador to the \nSublime Porte, New Yorker Henry Morgenthau, described the Ottoman \natrocities as a ``campaign of race extermination.'' A chilling \nprologue, if you will, to the twentieth century.\n  The word ``genocide'' comes from the Greek genos (clan or breed) and \nthe Latin caedere (to kill). It was coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin, a \nPolish Jew who emigrated to the United States in 1941.\n  In the early 1930's, after studying the slaughter of the Armenians, \nLemkin began a campaign to outlaw the crime now known as genocide. He \ntook his case before the Legal Council of the League of Nations in 1933 \nbut the learned jurists would not heed him. Finally--after the Nazi \nHolocaust shook the conscience of the world--the United Nations adopted \nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide on December 9, 1948. The first human rights treaty of the new \nworld body was finally ratified by the United States in 1988. Raphael \nLemkin's legacy.\n  During the Days of Remembrance Commemoration in 1981, Elie Wiesel \nstated:\n\n       Before the planning of the Final Solution, Hitler asked, \n     ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' He was right. No one \n     remembered them, as no one remembered the Jews. Rejected by \n     everyone, they felt expelled from history.\n\n  Mr. President, today the United States Senate pauses to remember the \nArmenian victims of genocide. But remembrance alone is not enough. \nRemembrance must be the first step toward justice and, ultimately, \ntoward prevention of future atrocities.\n  On December 13, 1995, the Senate adopted Senate Joint Resolution 44, \nconcerning the deployment of United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. The resolution affirmed that the population of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina had ``suffered egregious violations of the international \nlaw of war including * * * the Convention on the Prevention and \nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide.'' To redress and punish these \ncrimes, the United Nations established the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The United States must continue to \nsupport the work of the Tribunal and insist on cooperation with the \nTribunal as mandated by the Dayton Accords.\n  The horrors of this century--beginning with the Armenian genocide--\ngave birth to a new vocabulary of inhumanity. As this genocidal century \ndraws to a close, let us remember these events, mourn the victims, and \nstrengthen our resolve that such outrages never again be perpetrated \nagainst the human race.\n  I thank the Chair and I ask that the text of Ambassador Henry\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nMorgenthau's telegram of July 16, 1915, and the 'genocide' entry in the \nFontana Dictionary of Modern Thought be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n         [Telegram received from Constantinople, July 16, 1915]\n\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington.\n       Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is \n     increasing and from harrowing reports of eye witnesses it \n     appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress \n     under a pretext of reprisal against rebellion.\n       Protests as well as threats are unavailing and probably \n     incite the Ottoman government to more drastic measures as \n     they are determined to disclaim responsibility for their \n     absolute disregard of capitulations and I believe nothing \n     short of actual force which obviously United States are not \n     in a position to exert would adequately meet the situation. \n     Suggest you inform belligerent nations and mission boards of \n     this.\n     American Ambassador, Constantinople.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought\n\n            [Edited by Alan Bullock and Oliver Stallybrass]\n\n[New and revised edition by Alan Bullock and Stephen Trombley assisted \n                            by Bruce Eadie]\n\n\n                               genocide.\n\n       Term coined by American jurist Raphael Lemkin in 1944 to \n     denote the physical destruction of a national, racial or \n     ethnic population. The term was included in the indictment at \n     Nuremberg of German war criminals accused of involvement in \n     Nazi attempts to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. \n     It acquired still wider currency in a United Nations \n     Resolution of 11 December 1946 and UN Convention of 9 \n     December 1948 which sought to make genocide a crime under \n     international law. Details of the UN definition of the term \n     are contested, for example by radical critics of colonialism \n     who view as genocide the destruction of the social fabric of \n     a colonized people, but it remains the most widely accepted \n     definition.\n       Bibl: L.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of \nthe country of Lebanon. As you know, Mr. President, Lebanon has again \nbeen the most recent victim of the fighting in the Middle East. The \nhostilities of last week which continue today have caused a great loss \nof Lebanese lives.\n  The United States has always supported the independence and \nterritorial integrity of Lebanon. However, in the most recent \nnegotiations to end the fighting in the region, the U.S. administration \nhas been focusing its efforts on Syria and Israel.\n  I believe that the State Department is sincere in upholding it \nsupport for the sovereignty of Lebanon. But I am afraid that the United \nStates views a resolution to the Israel-Syria conflict as the only \npriority--and the consequence is the plight of the civilian population \nin Lebanon is ignored. It is Lebanon that is suffering the most in this \nconflict, and it is with that country which the United States should \nfocus its immediate attention.\n  The influence and support of the United States is critical to giving \nLebanon the help it needs to move forward and rebuild after two decades \nof civil war.\n  As its stands, the presence of all foreign forces in Lebanon \nirritates the situation, making it difficult for the Lebanese to find a \npeaceful solution to their quest for independence and sovereignty. Only \nuntil there is the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, \ncombined with a diplomatic solution, will peace in the Middle East be \nachievable.\n  I believe that Lebanon will than be on its way to returning to the \nindependent, sovereign and unoccupied land that it once was--free of \nall non-Lebanese forces. Not only will this advance the case of Middle \nEast peace in the region, but it will also be in America's best \ninterest to have its friend, Lebanon, stable once more.\n  Today, President Clinton is meeting with President Elias Hrawi of \nLebanon. It is my hope that the territorial integrity, sovereignty and \nindependence of Lebanon is the subject of much discussion. President \nClinton will also be announcing a humanitarian aid package for Lebanon, \nand I was pleased to lead the efforts in the Senate to insist upon this \nassistance for the innocent civilians of Lebanon.\n  But the humanitarian assistance is only one part of the equation. I, \nonce again, urge the administration to persist in trying to negotiate a \ncease fire in this region and to bring an end to the hostility \nimmediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4090-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, once again I rise to join my \ncolleagues, and Armenian Americans in Ohio and across the Nation, to \nremember the Armenian genocide of 1915-1923. Over this period the \nArmenian population of the Ottoman Empire was systematically destroyed. \nSome were killed, others left to die of deprivation, still others \nuprooted and expelled from their homeland. In the end, some 1.5 million \nArmenians perished and another 0.5 million were displaced.\n  Evidence of the Armenian genocide is available from a number of \nsources, among the most compelling is the reporting of our own United \nStates Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau. In a cable \nto the Secretary of State, Ambassador Morgenthau wrote: ``Deportation \nof and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from \nharrowing reports of eye witnesses it appears that a campaign of race \nextermination is in process under a pretext of reprisal against \nrebellion.''\n  Some may ask why it is important to take time each year to \ncommemorate an event which occurred over half a century ago. In reply I \nwould recall the reported observation of Adolph Hitler as he \ncontemplated the ``final solution''--``Who remembers the Armenians?''\n  Today we remember the 1\\1/2\\-million victims of the Armenian \ngenocide. Undeniably it is not comfortable to repeatedly revisit this \ntragedy, or to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum, or to have \ncontemporary atrocities played out nightly on our television screens, \nas in Bosnia or Rwanda. But we remember today, we did last year and the \nyear before, so that we will not become complacent about or indifferent \nto any example of man's inhumanity to man, wherever and whenever it may \noccur. For in the words of Edmund Burke, ``the only thing necessary for \nthe triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4090-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4090-S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JAMES I. WILLIAMSON, MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is sometimes argued these days \nthat we Americans place too high a premium on the value of individual, \nyet our experience over more than 200 years as a Nation has taught us \nthat it's almost impossible to overestimate the value of some \nindividual citizens to our community and our country. James I. \nWilliamson of Harrington, DE, who died on Monday of this week at the \nage of 66, was one of those invaluable individuals without whom the \ncharacter and history of America would be very different.\n  During his distinguished 21-year career in the U.S. Army, from which \nhe retired in 1969 as a staff sergeant, James Williamson won many \ndecorations, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star and the Silver \nStar. In 1968, during the last of his three tours of duty in Vietnam, \nhe won the rarely awarded Congressional Medal of Honor for \nextraordinary, individual valor in combat.\n  Of the millions of men and women who have served in our military \nsince the award was first conferred during the Civil War, Mr. \nPresident, fewer than 3,500 have received the Congressional Medal for \nvoluntary action above and beyond the call of duty, at the risk of the \nrecipient's own life--and the high standard of admission to that elite \ngroup of heroes is indicated by the fact that the majority of \nCongressional Medals have been awarded posthumously.\n  Sergeant Williamson survived the action that earned him our highest \nmilitary decoration, but it was his willingness to risk his own life \nthat saved the lives of comrades in arms engaged in that action with \nhim. Alone and armed with a machinegun, he rescued the crew of a \nmechanized weapons carrier that had taken a disabling direct hit. \nRemaining exposed to enemy fire, he attached a towing cable so the \nvehicle and its crew could be pulled to safety.\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n  Despite the controversy that surrounded our involvement in the \nVietnamese war, Mr. President, it was a proud nation which presented \nMr. Williamson with the Congressional Medal of Honor, because of his \nenormous personal courage, because of his willingness to risk \nsacrificing his own life in the service of others, and because neither \nour military nor our Nation can afford to allow such outstanding \nindividual contributions to go unrecognized.\n  James I. Williamson was not ``the one-in-a-million'' exception we \nsometimes refer to; he was the truly exceptional ``one-in-fewer-than-\n3,500'' who displayed the American character at its best and whose \nactions made clear why our most precious decoration is dedicated to \nhonor--his own and his country's. His family, his community of \nHarrington, and his State of Delaware will remember him with pride for \nhis extraordinary individual achievement and with humility in the face \nof his unselfish bravery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4090-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DAVID L. FORD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \nremarkable individuals we lost on April 3, 1996, in the plane crash in \nCroatia which took the life of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and many \nother fine Americans. David L. Ford, CEO of InterGuard Corp., a \nsubsidiary of Guardian Industries, headquartered in Auburn Hills, MI, \nwas on that flight to donate 23 metric tons of flat glass to Sarajevo, \nenough to produce 8,000 windows for the reconstruction of a hospital \nthat was damaged in the war.\n  When David was first given the opportunity to travel to Bosnia, he \nthought of how he could best help the city of Sarajevo. He decided that \nhe would help the city recover from the constant shelling of the past 3 \nyears. David was very excited about being able to help the people of \nSarajevo. Though he was unable to see his plan fulfilled, his wish was \nhonored when the glass was later delivered by the U.S. Embassy. A \nplaque commemorating the efforts of David Ford to rebuild Bosnia will \nbe displayed in front of the hospital in Sarajevo.\n  David worked for Guardian for over 25 years. He was the driving force \nin opening the European market for the company, which now operates four \nplants across Europe. He was a diligent and dedicated worker. He was \nalso a deep thinker who was a student of foreign cultures. He traveled \nextensively in European countries and studied their cultures.\n  David was a dedicated family man. His wife, Debra Ann Ford, and their \nchildren, Kathryn and Douglas, will remember him as a person who \nbrought much happiness into their lives. He was an involved parent who \nwould often accompany his children to school. He recently took a class \non a trip to Israel, imparting his knowledge of the world to the \nchildren.\n  David was a man who was very committed to his faith. David was a \nborn-again Christian and a member of Christian Community Church. He was \nvery involved in his community and was the leader of the youth group \nTeen Section. David has said that, ``to be born again means a new \nbeginning, it means change--a new direction.'' David had this faith in \na new direction for Bosnia and the world.\n  David's own words best show how he viewed his life. ``Yes, I had to \nchange. That meant I had to sacrifice some things--the changes are not \na list of things to do or not to do. The changes are in your heart. We \ncannot make these changes alone, by ourselves. God sends us a helper to \nbe with us.'' The people of Sarajevo were indeed sent such a helper in \nDavid Ford.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring the life of \nDavid L. Ford. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4091-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 205TH ANNIVERSARY OF POLAND'S CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President. I rise today in support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 51, a resolution to commemorate the 205th anniversary \nof Poland's constitution. This resolution was introduced by my good \nfriend, the distinguished Republican leader and senior Senator from \nKansas, Bob Dole. The purpose of the resolution is to salute and \ncongratulate Polish people around the world, including Americans of \nPolish descent, as on May 3, 1996 they commemorate the 205th \nanniversary of the first Polish constitution, to recognize the rebirth \nof Poland as a free and independent nation in the spirt of the 1791 \nconstitution, and to urge the people and state and local governments of \nthe United States to observe this anniversary with appropriate \nceremonies and activities.\n  The Polish constitution of 1791 is closely related to our own \nconstitution, because it was heavily influenced by a Polish hero of the \nAmerican Revolution, General Thaddeus Kosciuszko, who returned to his \nnative land after the war, carrying with him the concepts we fought to \nestablish and preserve in the revolution. While Poland enjoyed this new \nconstitution for less than 2 years, it established principles and \nideals that still live in modern Poland.\n  Polish people have made major contributions to the United States in \nall fields of endeavor. The first manufacturing facility in America was \nestablished by a Pole in Jamestown, VA. The first institution of higher \nlearning in New Amsterdam was established by Dr. Alexander Kurcyusz. In \naddition to General Kosciuszko, another famous Pole, Count Casimir \nPulaski, aided our fight for independence from Great Britain. He is \nknown as the ``Father of the American Cavalry'' because General \nWashington put him in charge of developing and leading that arm in the \nwar. He had a brilliant career in the Continental Army. Unfortunately, \nhe was mortally wounded in the siege of Savannah and later buried at \nsea.\n  More modern Polish-Americans who made notable contributions range \nfrom Arthur Rubenstein to Stan Musial and Leon Jawarski. In every \nfield, Polish-Americans worked hard to make America what it is today.\n  New York is home to a great many Americans of Polish descent. Almost \n1.2 million New Yorkers claim a Polish heritage. According to the \nCensus Bureau, about 17 percent of all U.S. residents who speak Polish \nat home live in New York.\n  I am confident that our adoption of this resolution will be met with \nappreciation and that May 3 will be a date that will be met with \nappropriate celebration in the Polish-American community. I again \nexpress my strong support for this resolution and I urge my colleagues \nto vote for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4091-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4091-S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, George Santayana wrote that ``those \nwho cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' We have an \nobligation, just as our forebears had, to teach following generations \nwhat occurred in the world before they were born. It is this passing of \ninformation from generation to generation that weaves the fabric of our \ncollective history and serves as a guide for the future. We can never \nchange the facts of history, but we can work to make sure that \ninjustices are not repeated out of ignorance of those facts. It is only \nthrough the constant and vigilant education of our children and each \nother that we can hope to end man's inhumanity to man.\n  When Adolf Hitler was planning the Jewish Holocaust he said, ``Who \ntoday remembers the extermination of the Armenians?'' I am here today \nto bear witness to the fact that we do remember the Armenians who fell \nprey to genocide and we will continue to work to spread that knowledge \nso that similar events never again occur.\n  Today, April 24, 1996, we commemorate the 81st anniversary of the \n1915-1923 genocide of the Armenian people. In a world that sometimes \nseems to have gone mad with random violent acts, we must remember the \nvictims of a government organized terror, the genocide perpetrated by \nthe Turkish Ottoman Empire against the Armenian people.\n  Eighty-one years ago this week, the 8-year-long savagery against the \nArmenian people began. Each year we remember and honor the victims and \npay respect to the survivors we still are blessed to have in our midst. \nWe vow to remember, to always remember, the attempt to eliminate the \nArmenian people from the face of the Earth, not for what they had done \nas individuals, but because of who they were.\n  For the most part, nations did not learn from history--the world \nlooked\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\naway during the Armenian genocide and those horrors later revisited the \nplanet. As Elie Wiesel said, the Armenians ``felt expelled from \nhistory.'' So the genocide we remember each April, the century's first \ngenocide--is the genocide the world forgot, to its shame, and for which \nit paid dearly.\n  Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people will not be in vain. We make this solemn vow because we \nbelieve that it is within our power to confront evil in the world, and \nto prevent genocidal attacks on people because of who they are. That is \nsurely the highest tribute we can pay to the Armenian victims and how \nthe horror and brutality of their deaths can be given redeeming \nmeaning. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4091-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE WALTMANS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. The data is undeniable: individuals from strong families \ncontribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples \nmarried today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it \nis both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the \ncommitment of ``til death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating \nsuccessfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. \nThese characteristics make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Lelslie and \nIsabella Waltman of West Plains, MO, who on March 28, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. They understand the meaning of the word \n``covenant.'' My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can \ncelebrate a similar milestone. The Waltmans' commitment to the \nprinciples and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized. I wish them and their family \nall the best as they celebrate this \nsubstantial marker on their journey \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/24/senate-section/article/S4092-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2937\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.
