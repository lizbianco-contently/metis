Mr. President, over the past number of weeks, we have \nwitnessed a great deal of saber-rattling and speculation over the \nquestion of whether Congress and the President can avoid a Government \nshutdown, called, metaphorically, a train wreck, on October 1. That is \nthe first day of fiscal year 1996, and is also the date by which all 13 \nof the 1996 appropriations bills are supposed to be enacted.\n  Failure to achieve enactment of any of the 13 appropriations bills by \nOctober 1 will cause a funding lapse for the departments and agencies \ncovered by any such bill. The only way to avoid a funding lapse, and an \naccompanying shutdown of the affected departments and agencies, is for \nCongress and the President to enact a short-term extension of funding \nauthority, which is commonly known as a continuing resolution.\n  It is never easy to enact all 13 annual appropriations bills by the \nbeginning of a fiscal year. In fact, only once in over 20 years have \nall 13 appropriations bills been signed into law prior to the beginning \nof the fiscal year. That year was fiscal year 1995. For every other \nyear in the last several decades it has been necessary to enact a \ncontinuing resolution in order to enable the departments and agencies \nof the Federal Government to continue to carry out their \nresponsibilities in the absence of appropriations acts. In most \ninstances, those continuing resolutions have been of short duration and \nwere enacted with little or no controversy.\n  Mr. President, given that history, I see no earthly reason for a so-\ncalled train wreck. There is certainly nothing to be gained politically \nby either side of the aisle or by the administration by such a \ncatastrophe. In fact, it is far more likely that the American people \nwill see such a train wreck as merely a game of high stakes poker \nplayed by politicians using public money to make their bets. The \nAmerican people will rightly see through the political ``blame game'' \nthat will accompany the so-called train wreck. They will ask themselves \nwhy they should have to pay the tab for the game of chicken being \nplayed by their elected officials--who, by the way, will continue to be \npaid their full salaries were there to be a Government shutdown.\n  Furloughed Federal workers by the hundreds of thousands will not be \npaid, nor will those who do contract work for the Federal Government. \nBut, the President, and Senators, and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, will still receive their full paychecks, no matter how \nlong the shutdown lasts. Be assured, Senators, that that situation will \nnot make any of us dearly beloved by our constituents.\n  Mr. President, we are told by the General Accounting Office, in its \nJune 1991 report entitled ``Government Shutdown'' that there were nine \noccasions over the period from October 1981 through October 1990 when \nthere were funding gaps of 1 to 3 days. In other words, we had nine \nshort periods, usually over weekends when there were lapses of \nappropriations. This same GAO report analyzes the effects of the last \nof these nine funding lapses; namely, Columbus Day weekend of 1990, or \nOctober 6-8, 1990. The report points out \n\n[[Page S 13556]]\nthat on October 5, 1990, Federal agencies were directed by the Office \nof Management and Budget to implement plans to close down operations \nover the Columbus Day weekend (October 6-8, 1990). This action was the \nresult of President Bush's veto of a continuing resolution that would \nhave provided funding through October 12, 1990, and was a reflection of \nthe President's dissatisfaction with progress on the fiscal year 1991 \nbudget.\n  According to GAO, on page 2 of the report: ``The shutdown of some \ngovernment agencies over the Columbus Day weekend was financially \ncounterproductive.'' Overall, the shutdown costs of seven affected \nagencies totaled $3.4 million. However, these costs would have been \nmuch higher if a 3-day shutdown had occurred during a normal workweek. \nGAO states that ``the total cost of such a 3-day workweek shutdown \nwould range from about $244.6 million to $607.3 million, depending upon \nwhether revenues estimated to be lost by the IRS could be recovered.'' \nThat is a lot of money that will be wasted--at least $250 million every \n3 workdays if we cause a Government shutdown on October 1. This is a \nvery expensive way to prove once and for all to the American people \nthat the Government cannot perform even its basic responsibilities. No \nwonder one hears so much talk about throwing the whole lot of us out of \noffice!\n  There is of course still time to complete action on all 13 \nappropriations bills by the end of the month. We have already passed 7 \nof the 13 bills and all of the remaining bills will be ready for Senate \nconsideration this week, or certainly by the end of the week.\n  There are a number of these bills which the President has threatened \nto veto unless substantial changes are made to them. There are \nlegitimate differences, which, after reasonable debate, should, in my \nopinion, be resolved one way or the other. We need to vote these \namendments up or down and get these remaining bills to conference, and \nto the President's desk. If he chooses to veto some of them, as I \nbelieve he will, then it is all the more important for Congress to get \nits work done on time so as to allow for further negotiations on any \nbills which are vetoed and not overridden.\n  If Congress cannot complete action on all 13 appropriation \nconferences by October 1, there is still no excuse for a train wreck. \nSurely the American people have a right to expect Congress and the \nChief Executive to be able to work out a continuing resolution which \nwill prevent a Government shutdown while negotiations take place as \nnecessary to achieve the enactment of all 13 fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills. I believe we can avoid a Government shutdown. All \nit really will take to do so is for both political parties to decide \nthat they wish to avoid it. We are not on some preordained collision \ncourse. We are not controlled by some automatic pilot device which has \nthe two political parties careening down intersecting tracks destined \nto collide. Those of us charged with carrying out the responsibilities \nof elective office have the will and the wit to avoid such nightmarish \nscenarios if we simply choose to do so. All it takes is for all the \nplayers on both ends of the avenue to stop the gamesmanship and go \nreread their oath of office.\n  This is not some partisan polo match we are engaged in. We are \ngambling with the financial fortunes of a lot of real honest to \ngoodness people who will suffer hardships if we remain intransigent and \nclose down this Government. And, as I have already mentioned, there are \nvery high, very real permanent costs to the U.S. Treasury if we choose \nsuch a course. I can think of no more irresponsible act by elected \nofficials than to deliberately plot such a devastating scenario and \nthen to actually carry it out. What will we be proving? Who can \npossibly win if such a mess comes to pass? No one will applaud our \nstatesmanship or patriotism, that is for sure. And, we will have earned \nthe wrath of the voters in 1996, who would be well justified in their \nbelief that nothing has changed in Washington where it is gridlock and \npower plays as usual.\n  But, as if this is not enough, there is another far more serious \ntrain wreck that may be imminent--and that is the train wreck which \ncould occur if Congress insists on putting the debt limit increase into \nthe reconciliation bill. According to recent testimony by the Treasury \nDepartment before the Finance Committee, Treasury's current estimates \nshow that the permanent debt ceiling of $4.9 trillion will be reached \nby late October or early November.\n  As Senators are aware, once that debt limit is reached, the Treasury \nDepartment has no authority to spend any cash that would cause the debt \nlimit to be exceeded. A failure by Congress and the President to raise \nthe debt limit would bring about, in a matter of days, one of the \ngreatest financial crises the country has ever seen--probably the \ngreatest in some ways. The Government would not be able to continue any \nof its operations. It could not honor Social Security checks or pay \nemployees to issue them. The same applies to military and civilian and \nveterans' pensions. They would not be honored. Interest on U.S. \nGovernment securities could not be paid. All of this is coming up this \nfall unless we enact an increase in the debt limit, as called for in \nthe Budget Resolution, and which the Treasury Department has told us \nwill be necessary no later than mid-November.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, in its August 1995 \nreport entitled ``The Economic and Budget Outlook,'' the debt limit has \nhad to be raised 19 times over the last decade. That report also points \nout the obvious; namely, that raising the debt limit is considered \n``must pass'' legislation. Paradoxically, because of its critical \nimportance, passage of the debt limit is frequently viewed by some very \nmisguided forces as a device to use to mandate action on some other \nlegislative partisan goal. The debt limit is, therefore, the ultimate \ntool in the hands of the legislative blackmailers, the ultimate tool.\n  CBO gives the example of 1990, when Congress voted seven times on the \ndebt limit between August 9 and November 5 in connection with the \nbudget summit negotiations. In that instance, as I recall--I was \nthere--the Congress and President Bush enacted a series of debt limit \nincreases as progress was being made on the overall budget at the \nBudget Summit. Those debt limit increases were supported on a \nbipartisan basis in both Houses, and by President Bush, as we all \nworked day and night, and on Saturdays and Sundays, to resolve our \ndifferences on a 5-year deficit reduction package. That package \nultimately was enacted into law in what is known as the Budget \nEnforcement Act.\n  Despite the fact that President Bush later expressed regret for his \ninvolvement in that Budget Summit Agreement, I believe that it made a \nnumber of very important improvements in the Budget Act, and it also \ncut the deficit projections at that time by almost $500 billion. But \nwhatever one's view may be of the 1990 budget experience, one thing was \nclear. No one seriously talked about deliberately causing a default on \nour national debt in order to gain some political advantage by blaming \nthe other political party for the calamity.\n  Yet, Mr. President, we are now facing a situation where, I \nunderstand, the majority party in Congress may choose to include the \ndebt limit increase in the upcoming reconciliation bill. They see it as \nan opportunity to force the President to sign the reconciliation bill. \nThey see it as a way of slamming several crazy, at least in my \njudgment, legislative ``losers'' into law--no matter how unwise or how \nuntested those proposals may be. They view this devious and \nirresponsible tactic as a sure way to enact massive tax cuts, which \nmainly benefit high-income ``fat cats.''\n  Reports say the majority may be planning to put the debt limit \nincrease into the reconciliation bill and then to ram that whole \npackage through Congress without serious negotiations with the minority \nin Congress or with the President.\n  They are riding high in the saddle, Mr. President, but the worm is \ngoing to turn. It is just a matter of when. They are riding high in the \nsaddle, but the worm is going to turn. That is exactly what will \nhappen, if the majority can muster the votes in both Houses of Congress \nfor their reconciliation bill. They have chosen the reconciliation bill \nbecause reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered. Neither can \nreconciliation conference reports. Reconciliation bills are intended to \nreduce the \n\n[[Page S 13557]]\ndeficit, and so they are privileged matters with exceedingly tight time \nlimits. Therefore, what we may be facing in regards to reconciliation \nis a take-it-or-leave-it bill--one that largely contains everything the \nmajority party espouses, and with little consideration, if any, of the \nviews of either the President or the Democratic minority in Congress. \nThat would mean huge cuts in Medicare--around $270 billion--huge tax \ncuts for the wealthy--$245 billion--folly on folly--and huge cuts in \ndiscretionary investments in our physical infrastructure, as well as \ncuts in such programs as education, job training, and medical research. \nThe attitude is do it our way. Take our highly partisan agenda, just as \nwe wrote it in that great so-called ``Contract With America'' or we \nwill wreck the national economy, close down the Government, and \nthreaten global financial disruption.\n  If the Republican majority can round up a majority of the House and \nSenate to vote for such a reconciliation bill, and if it also includes \na debt limit increase, then the President, it would seem, would be in \nthe impossible position of having to either swallow a bill that he has \nsaid he will veto and will deserve to be vetoed, or shooting down a \n``must pass'' increase in the debt limit. This is just a deplorable way \nto govern. It is putting politics first. Politics is important. I have \nnever considered it to be first, above everything else, and I do not so \nconsider it now. It is irresponsible. It makes a mockery of our \nconstitutional system and encourages chaos to reign.\n  If you think that Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' presented chaos, as \nSatan and his angels fell from Heaven, just wait and see what this will \nlook like.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate, in the House, and \nin the administration not to go down this road. Despite the political \nenticement of being able to blackmail the President into signing a \nhighly partisan version of a reconciliation bill, I submit that in \nreality there is absolutely no political advantage.\n  The people are going to say, a plague on both of our Houses.\n  Go back and read Chaucer's tale by the Pardoner, wherein all three of \nthe young men destroyed themselves. Because of their greed for gain, \ntwo knifed the one while the one poisoned the two. And they all fell in \nexcruciating pain on top of the pile of gold and died.\n  So there can be no winners in this game. The Democrats, the \nRepublicans, and the President will all destroy ourselves because of \nour political greed for gain.\n  The American people will clearly understand what is going on. We \ncannot bamboozle them. They are onto our childish games. And they and \nthe press will quickly be able to determine that the debt limit can \neasily be increased as a free-standing bill and that the majority party \nin Congress need not and should not try to gain advantage in the budget \nbattles by risking a world class financial crisis.\n  Am I exaggerating? Am I engaging in hyperbole? Just what would be the \nconsequences of not raising the debt limit? I predict that such a \ndefault on paying interest due on Government securities, for example, \nwould cause an earthquake on Wall Street, one that would rattle your \neye teeth and curl your hair, as someone has said upon one occasion.\n  A failure to raise the debt limit in a timely manner would have \ndevastating effects on the standing of the United States in the \ninternational economy. Investor confidence in the dollar and in U.S. \nGovernment securities would plummet--plummet, sharply affecting \ndomestic and international stock and bond markets. U.S. bonds and bills \nwould never be ``risk free'' again. They would become ``government \ninsecurities,'' not ``government securities.'' Uncle Sam would no \nlonger be a pillar of financial rectitude, but would become a shady \njunk bond dealer on the international market. International investors, \nwho hold billions and billions of U.S. dollars, would understandably \nlook for safer havens--safer havens for their investments. Interest \nrates would increase--interest rates would be offered and would again \nentice these investors to buy U.S. Government securities. This would \ncost the United States more, and still might not ensure stability in \nour financial markets.\n  The United States would be the big loser, big loser, in the long \nterm, facing permanently increased borrowing costs when the time came \nto roll over our debt. Interest rates on those loans, which are secured \nwith Government bonds, would be raised, increasing, in turn, the costs \nto the taxpayer. The added costs of an increased interest rate on \nborrowing to finance the debt would have to be offset by reduced \nGovernment investments in people and in infrastructure programs which \nalready feel the crunch of budget constraints designed to bring the \nbudget into balance. This foolhardy posturing on raising the debt limit \nis being played out on a knife edge that is poised to cut the throat of \nthe American taxpayer, who will suffer from increased costs and reduced \nGovernment services for years to come.\n  On the international security scene, a U.S. failure to increase the \ndebt limit could also adversely affect U.S. military preparedness. If \nthe men and women in our military are worried about their paychecks \nbeing honored, about paying their bills and feeding their families, how \ncredible a deterrent can they be? This has very unsettling \nramifications for U.S. military operations possibly in Iraq and North \nKorea. Should we stop firing Tomahawk cruise missiles--at a cost of \n$1.3 million per missile--at Bosnian air defense sites because we are \nnot sure that we can afford to replace them in the inventory? Do we not \nsend in costly reinforcements if Iraq makes threatening moves toward \nJordan or Kuwait? Will defense contractors make timely deliveries of \nnew weapons after the first payment check is not honored? Will the \nUnited States be able to honor its security agreements with other \nnations, when it cannot credibly be counted upon to follow through on, \nand to pay for, its own commitments? These are just a few of the \npossible effects of our failure to increase the debt limit and maintain \nfaith in the security of U.S. Government financial commitments.\n  Now, whether my predictions will be correct will be known in November \nif we have not enacted a debt limit increase by then. This is so \nbecause in November, we are told by CBO, cash interest payments are due \non Treasury instruments totaling around $25 billion. Treasury tells us \nthat they will not have room under the present $4.9 trillion debt limit \nto pay that interest. We indeed, therefore, must pass a debt limit \nincrease, or risk a real default on the payment of interest on Treasury \ninstruments for the first time in our history.\n  That is what is at stake here along with the lack of cash to honor \nSocial Security checks, or Government pensions, or veterans' pensions, \nor the paychecks of Government workers. Surely sane men and women will \nnot choose to play a game of chicken of this horrific magnitude. We \nwould be risking the entire economy. Where would the panic stop? Once \nit started, how could one turn off the total loss of faith in the \nability of this Congress to responsibly carry out its work? Once that \ngenie is out of the bottle, who can say where or when the damage will \nend? We are not talking about a mere metaphorical train wreck under \nthis set of circumstances. We are talking about a nuclear explosion--a \nfinancial doomsday scenario that could make the Great Depression, in \nsome respects at least, look more like a picnic in the park by \ncomparison. And, thank God, I lived in that depression. I was 12 years \nold when the October 29 stock market crash took place. I remember what \nit was. And yet, we hear daily the trumpets of our leaders at both \nends, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue preparing us for the \ncatastrophe, as though it was inevitable due to some unavoidable, \nlocked-in, preprogrammed self-destruct device.\n  That will not wash, Mr. President. We are not dealing with a bomb \nwhich we cannot disarm. There is nothing inevitable or uncontrollable \nabout it. We have every authority and power that we need to avoid a \nfunding lapse at the beginning of this fiscal year and a debt limit \ncrisis. We have always solved our political and policy differences in \nthe past without risking serious permanent damage to our economy and to \nour very system of Government. All it takes is for us once, just once, \nto put the good of the country ahead of the partisan political \nadvantage and the \n\n[[Page S 13558]]\ngood of political parties. All it takes is for us to stop wallowing in \nthe intoxicating sweet smoke of rhetoric--in the intoxicating aura of \npower, and start trying to be what we all loudly claim to be: \nstatesmen! All it takes is for us to sober up, put the cards down, and \nfold up this drunken poker game that has already progressed far too \nlate into the evening. We need to pass the coffee, get the red out of \nour eyes, and try to remember why the people sent us here in the first \nplace.\n  If the people have lost respect for public officials, spectacles such \nas the one now being touted as a train wreck are surely the reason why. \nIf confidence in the Federal Government is failing, this type of power-\ninduced insanity that views flirting with an economic collapse as good \npolitical strategy is certainly one reason why. If we try to publicly \npretend that we cannot avoid such a fiscal crisis, we need never again \nscratch our heads and wonder why people do not trust and do not believe \npoliticians. There need be no crisis unless irresponsible partisan-\ncrazed politicians create one, and we all know it.\n  I am encouraged by the press accounts of the meeting that occurred \nearlier this week between President Clinton and congressional leaders, \nat which they apparently agreed to negotiate a short-term spending plan \nthat would avoid an October 1 Government shutdown. That would address \nat least part of the problem. And if cooler heads prevail, surely we \ncan, and surely we must, find a way to settle our very real and very \nserious budgetary and appropriations differences in the coming weeks, \nas we were elected to do, without fashioning deliberate train wrecks \nthat would be devastating to this great country of ours. If we fail to \ndo so, if November brings such unimaginable devastation to our country, \nI fear not for our sorry lot, for we politicians will get exactly what \nwe deserve. I fear only for the American people who so wrongly invested \ntheir trust in us in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, on this, the likely final day of the \ndebate on the welfare reform measure before us, it is worth noting that \nin the lead story of the New York Times this morning, a story by Robin \nToner, we read that ``the White House, exceedingly eager to support a \nlaw that promises to change the welfare system, was sending \nincreasingly friendly signals about the bill.''\n  That is a bill that would repeal title IV-A of the Social Security \nAct of 1935 that provides aid to dependent children. It will be the \nfirst time in the history of the Nation that we have repealed a section \nof the Social Security Act. That the White House should be eager to \nsupport such a law is beyond my understanding, and certainly in 34 \nyear's service in Washington, beyond my experience.\n  I regret it. I can only wish some who are involved in the White House \nor those in the administration, would know that they might well resign \nif they agree with the proposal that violates every principle they have \nasserted in their careers, honorable careers in public service.\n  I will state once again, we, yesterday, read Mr. Rahm Emanuel, a \nWhite House spokesman, saying the measure was coming along ``nicely.'' \nToday, we get the same message in a lead story in the Times. If this \nadministration wishes to go down in history as one that abandoned, \neagerly abandoned, the national commitment to dependent children, so be \nit.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there being some spare time in our \nschedule just now, I would like to take the occasion, and exercise the \nprivilege, as I see it, of reading to the Senate the lead editorial in \nthe Washington Post this morning. It is entitled ``Welfare Theories.'' \nThis is an editorial page which has been dealing thoughtfully, \nsupportively, with welfare problems for 35 years.\n\n       On the opposite page, columnist George Will musters a most \n     powerful argument against the welfare bill now on the Senate \n     floor. The bill purports to be a way of sending strong \n     messages to welfare recipients that it is time for them to \n     mend their ways. But as Mr. Will notes, ``no child is going \n     to be spiritually improved by being collateral damage in a \n     bombardment of severities targeted at adults who may or may \n     not deserve more severe treatment from the welfare system.''\n       The bill is reckless because it could endanger the well-\n     being of the poorest children in society in the name of a \n     series of untested theories about how people may respond to \n     some new incentives. Surely a Congress whose majority proudly \n     carries the mantle ``conservative'' should be wary of risking \n     human suffering on behalf of some ideological driven \n     preconceptions. Isn't that what conservatives always accused \n     liberals of doing?\n       The best thing that can be said of this bill is that it is \n     not as bad as it might have been. Some of the most obviously \n     flawed proposals--mandating that States end welfare \n     assistance to children born to mothers while they are on \n     welfare and that they cut off assistance to teen mothers--\n     have been voted down. There will be at least some \n     requirements that States continue to invest resources in \n     programs for the poor in exchange for their current Federal \n     budget allocations. But they are still not strong enough, and \n     are potentially loophole-ridden. Some new money for child \n     care may also be sprinkled onto this confection.\n\n  May I repeat a powerful image, Mr. President:\n\n       Some new money for child care may also be sprinkled onto \n     this confection. \n\n[[Page S 13559]]\n\n       But the structure of the bill is wrong, and a fundamental \n     untruth lies at its heart. Congress wants to claim that it is \n     (1) doing something about a whole series of social and \n     economic pathologies, while at the same time (2) cutting \n     spending. But a welfare reform that is serious about both \n     promoting work and helping children in single-parent homes \n     will cost more than writing checks,\n      especially given the extremely modest sums now spent by so \n     many States on the poor.\n       Going to a block grant formula would destroy one of the few \n     obvious merits of the current system, which is its ability to \n     respond flexibly to regional economic upturns or downturns. \n     On top of this, the bill's provisions on food stamps and its \n     reductions in assistance to disabled children under the \n     Supplementary Security Income Program go beyond what might \n     constitute reasonable reforms. And its provisions cutting aid \n     to legal immigrants would backfire on states with large \n     immigrant populations.\n       Many Senators will be tempted to vote for this bill anyway, \n     arguing that it has been ``improved'' and fearing the \n     political consequences of voting against anything labeled \n     welfare reform. But many of the ``improvements'' will \n     disappear once the bill goes to a conference with the House, \n     which has passed an even more objectionable bill. In any \n     event, voting this bill down would be exactly the opposite of \n     a negative act. It would be an affirmation that real welfare \n     reform is both necessary and possible. To get to that point, \n     a dangerous bill posing as the genuine article must be \n     defeated first.\n\n  That is the end of the editorial.\n  Mr. President, what I cannot comprehend is why this is so difficult \nfor the administration to understand. The administration has abandoned \nus, those of us who oppose this legislation.\n  Why do we not see the endless parade of petitioners as when health \ncare reform was before us in the last Congress, the lobbyists, the \npretend citizen groups, the real citizen groups? None are here.\n  I can recall, Mr. President, the extraordinary energy that went into \nany change in the welfare system 30 years ago, 25 years ago. Fifteen \nyears ago, if there was a proposal to take $40 out of some \ndemonstration project here on the Senate floor, there would be 40 \nrepresentatives of various advocacy groups outside.\n  There are very few advocacy groups outside. You can stand where I \nstand, Mr. President, and look straight out at the Supreme Court--not a \nperson in between that view. Not one of those flaunted, vaunted \nadvocacy groups forever protecting the interests of the children and \nthe helpless and the homeless and the what-you-will. Are they \nincreasingly subsidized and therefore increasingly co-opted?\n  Are they are silent because the White House is silent? They should be \nashamed. History will shame them.\n  One group was in Washington yesterday and I can speak with some \nspirit on that. This was a group of Catholic bishops and members from \nCatholic Charities. They were here. They were in Washington. Nobody \nelse. None of the great marchers, the great chanters, the nonnegotiable \ndemanders.\n  There is one police officer that has just appeared, but otherwise the \nlobby by the elevators is as empty this morning as it was when I left \nthe Chamber last night about 10 o'clock.\n  I read in the New York Times this morning, the front page, lead \narticle:\n\n       And the White House, exceedingly eager to support a law \n     that promises to change the welfare system, was sending \n     increasingly friendly signals about the bill.\n\n  I see my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, is on the floor. I know \nhis view will be different from mine on the bill. But I recall that \nextraordinary address he gave yesterday on civil society, citing such \nas Nathan Glazer and James Q. Wilson, I, in response, quoted some of \ntheir observations that we know we have to do these things, but we do \nnot know how to do them. We are just at the beginning of recognizing \nhow profound a question it is, as the Senator so brilliantly set forth. \nBut first, do no harm. Do not pretend that you know what you do not \nknow. Look at the beginnings of research and evaluation that say, \n``Very hard, not clear.'' Do not hurt children on the basis of an \nunproven theory and untested hypothesis.\n  That is what the Senator was citing, persons yesterday who said just \nthat. This morning, the Washington Post, in its lead editorial, speaks \nof the structure of the bill being wrong, that a fundamental untruth \nlies at its heart.\n\n       Congress wants to claim that it is (1) doing something \n     about a whole series of social and economic pathologies, \n     while at the same time (2) cutting spending. The nostrums, \n     the unsupported beliefs, the unsupported assertions, are \n     quite astounding.\n\n  White House spokesman Rahm Emanuel yesterday told us things are going \nwell. I say once again there is such a thing as resigning in \nGovernment, and there comes a time when, if principle matters at all, \nyou resign. People who resign on principle come back; people whose real \nviews are less important than their temporary position, ``their brief \nauthority,'' as Shakespeare once put it, disappear.\n  If that brief authority is more important than the enduring \nprinciples of protecting children and childhood, then what is to be \nsaid of those who prefer the one to the other? What is to be said of a \nWhite House that was almost on the edge of excess in its claims of \nempathy and concern in the last Congress but is now prepared to see \nthings like this happen in the present Congress?\n  All they want is, and I quote the Washington Post, ``some new money \nfor child care that may be sprinkled onto this confection.''\n  It will shame this Congress. It will spoil the conservative \nrevolution. The Washington Post makes this clear. If conservative means \nanything, it means be careful, be thoughtful, and anticipate the \nunanticipated or understand that things will happen that you do not \nexpect. And be very careful with the lives of children.\n  I had no idea, Mr. President, how profoundly what used to be known as \nliberalism was shaken by the last election. No President, Republican or \nDemocrat, in history, or 60 years' history, would dream of agreeing to \nthe repeal of title IV A of Social Security, the provision for National \nGovernment for children. Clearly, this administration is contemplating \njust that.\n  I cannot understand how this could be happening. It has never \nhappened before.\n  I make no claim to access. Hardly a soul in the White House has \ntalked to me about this subject since it arose. They know what I think \nand they know what I would say; not about the particulars, but about \nthe principle--the principle. Does the Federal Government maintain a \ncommitment to State programs providing aid to dependent children?\n  It is not as if we had just a few. Ten million is a round number, at \nany moment.\n  As George Will observes in his column, and the Washington Post \neditorial refers to his column--the numbers are so extraordinary:\n\n       Here are the percentages of children on AFDC at some point \n     during 1993 in five cities: Detroit (67), Philadelphia (57), \n     Chicago (46), New York (39), Los Angeles (38).\n\n  Then he cites this Senator:\n\n       ``There are * * * not enough social workers, not enough \n     nuns, not enough Salvation Army workers'' to care for \n     children who would be purged from the welfare rolls were \n     Congress to decree [and then Mr. Will says] ``(as candidate \n     Bill Clinton proposed) a two-year limit for welfare \n     eligibility.''\n\n  The citation of Nicholas Eberstadt--I have the honor to have been a \ncolleague of Mr. Eberstadt in a course entitled, ``The Social Science \nand Social Policy,'' which was taught in the core curriculum at Harvard \nUniversity. Nicholas Eberstadt, of Harvard and the American Enterprise \nInstitute, says:\n\n       Supposing today's welfare policy incentives to illegitimacy \n     were transported back in time to Salem, MA in, say, 1660. How \n     many additional illegitimate births would have occurred in \n     Puritan Salem? Few. Because the people of Salem in 1660 \n     believed in hell and believed that what today are called \n     disorganized lifestyles led to hell. Congress cannot \n     legislate useful attitudes.\n\n  I can say of my friend Mr. Eberstadt, I do not know where his \npolitics would be, save they would be moderate, sensible, based on \nresearch. He is a thoughtful man; a demographer. He has studied these \nthings with great care. And he, too, cannot comprehend national policy \nat this point.\n  Scholars have been working at these issues for years now, and the \nmore capable they are, the more tentative and incremental their \nfindings. I cited yesterday a research evaluation of a program, now in \nits fifth year, of very intensive counseling and training with respect \nto the issue of teen births--with no results. No results. It is a very \ncommon encounter, when things as profound in human character and \nbehavior are dealt with. The capacity of external influences to change \nit is so very small.\n  And that we should think otherwise? That men and women have stood in \n\n[[Page S 13560]]\n  this Chamber and talked about a genuine crisis--and there is that. And \nI have said, if nothing else comes out of this awful process, at least \nwe will have addressed the central subject. But if it is that serious, \nhow can we suppose it will be changed by marginal measures? It will \nnot.\n  Are there no serious persons in the administration who can say, \n``Stop, stop right now? No. We won't have this. We agree with the \nWashington Post that, `It would be an affirmation that real welfare \nreform is both necessary and possible. To get to that point, a \ndangerous bill posing as the genuine article must be defeated first.' \n'' If not, profoundly serious questions are raised about the year to \ncome?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Will's column \nprinted in the Record and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Women and Children First?\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       As the welfare reform debate begins to boil, the place to \n     begin is with an elemental fact: No child in America asked to \n     be here.\n       Each was summoned into existence by the acts of adults. And \n     no child is going to be spiritually improved by being \n     collateral damage in a bombardment of severities targeted at \n     adults who may or may not deserve more severe treatment from \n     the welfare system.\n       Phil Gramm says welfare recipients are people ``in the \n     wagon'' who ought to get out and ``help the rest of us \n     pull.'' Well. Of the 14 million people receiving Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children, 9 million are children. \n     Even if we get all these free riders into wee harnesses, the \n     wagon will not move much faster.\n       Furthermore, there is hardly an individual or industry in \n     America that is not in some sense ``in the wagon,'' receiving \n     some federal subvention. If everyone gets out, the wagon may \n     rocket along. But no one is proposing that. Instead, welfare \n     reform may give a whole new meaning to the phrase ``women and \n     children first.''\n       Marx said that history's great events appear twice, first \n     as tragedy, then as farce. Pat Moynihan worries that a \n     tragedy visited upon a vulnerable population three decades \n     ago may now recur, not as farce but again as tragedy.\n       Moynihan was there on Oct. 31, 1963, when President \n     Kennedy, in his last signing ceremony, signed legislation to \n     further the ``deinstitutionalization'' of the mentally ill. \n     Advances in psychotropic drugs, combined with ``community-\n     based programs,'' supposedly would make possible substantial \n     reductions of the populations of mental institutions.\n       But the drugs were not as effective as had been hoped, and \n     community-based programs never materialized in sufficient \n     numbers and sophistication. What materialized instead were \n     mentally ill homeless people. Moynihan warns that welfare \n     reform could produce a similar unanticipated increase in \n     children sleeping on, and freezing to death on, grates.\n       Actually, cities will have to build more grates. Here are \n     the percentages of children on AFDC at some point during 1993 \n     in five cities: Detroit (67), Philadelphia (57), Chicago \n     (46), New York (39), Los Angeles (38). ``There are,'' says \n     Moynihan, ``not enough social workers, not enough\n      nuns, not enough Salvation Army workers'' to care for \n     children who would be purged from the welfare rolls were \n     Congress to decree (as candidate Bill Clinton proposed) a \n     two-year limit for welfare eligibility.\n       Don't worry, say the designers of a brave new world, \n     welfare recipients will soon be working. However, 60 percent \n     of welfare families--usually families without fathers--have \n     children under 6 years old. Who will care for those children \n     in the year 2000 if Congress decrees that 50 percent of \n     welfare recipients must by then be in work programs? And \n     whence springs this conservative Congress's faith in work \n     programs?\n       Much of the welfare population has no family memory of \n     regular work, and little of the social capital of habits and \n     disciplines that come with work. Life in, say, Chicago's \n     Robert Taylor housing project produces what sociologist Emil \n     Durkheim called ``a dust of individuals,'' not an employable \n     population. A 1994 Columbia University study concluded that \n     most welfare mothers are negligibly educated and emotionally \n     disturbed, and 40 percent are serious drug abusers. Small \n     wonder a Congressional Budget Office study estimated an \n     annual cost of $3,000 just for monitoring each workfare \n     enrollee--in addition to the bill for training to give such \n     people elemental skills.\n       Moynihan says that a two-year limit for welfare \n     eligibility, and work requirements, might have worked 30 \n     years ago, when the nation's illegitimacy rate was 5 percent, \n     but today it is 33 percent. Don't worry, say reformers, we'll \n     take care of that by tinkering with the incentives: There \n     will be no payments for additional children born while the \n     mother is on welfare.\n       But Nicholas Eberstadt of Harvard and the American \n     Enterprise Institute says: Suppose today's welfare policy \n     incentives to illegitimacy were transported back in time to \n     Salem, Mass., in 1660. How many additional illegitimate \n     births would have occurred in Puritan Salem? Few, because the \n     people of Salem in 1660 believed in hell and believed that \n     what today are called ``disorganized lifestyles'' led to \n     hell. Congress cannot legislate useful attitudes.\n       Moynihan, who spent August writing his annual book at his \n     farm in Delaware County, N.Y., notes that in 1963 that \n     county's illegitimacy rate was 3.8 percent and today is 32 \n     percent--amost exactly the national average. And no one knows \n     why the county (which is rural and 98.8 percent white) or the \n     nation has so changed.\n       Hence no one really knows what to do about it. \n     Conservatives say, well, nothing could be worse than the \n     current system. They are underestimating their ingenuity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank my \ncolleague from New York. For me, personally, having an opportunity to \nbe on the floor while Senator Moynihan speaks is a real honor. We \nactually go back a ways--not that we knew each other personally, but I \nassigned many of his books in my classes, ranging from ``Maximum \nFeasible Misunderstanding'' to ``The Politics of the Guaranteed \nIncome.''\n  It is interesting, once upon a time, back in 1970 or thereabouts, we \nwere not on the same side. We had disagreements. He was the one who was \nnationally renowned then. I was a college teacher and I always \nrespected Professor Moynihan, and Senator Moynihan, for his views. But \nat this point in time, having just listened to what he said, I cannot \neven begin to tell him how much respect I have. His voice is a very \npowerful and eloquent voice.\n  I must say, I think the silence from the White House on this question \nis deafening. Let me just repeat that one more time: The silence from \nthe White House on this question is just deafening. You just cannot \nhave it both ways, Mr. President. You cannot keep talking about \nchildren and you cannot keep talking about how you are for children and \nturn your gaze away from this process and what we are about to do here \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  Colleagues are coming in. It may be difficult to take a lot more \ntime. I do not want to delay this process. But as we have gone forward \nin this debate, I think the thing that saddens me and also angers me--\nsometimes I am more saddened than angered, sometimes I am more angered \nthan saddened--is not just the question that Senator Moynihan has \nraised, which is, we do not know, we are about to make policy without \nunderstanding, coming anywhere close to understanding the effects of \nwhat we are doing. That is, I think, what George Will was trying to say \ntoday. But I also feel, and I will be a little bit more, not harsh, but \ncritical of some of my colleagues, I also feel that all too often \nSenators have come to the floor and have repeated essentially the same \nstereotypes.\n  It is not just what we do not know. In fact, we do know some things. \nIt is as if people do not, kind of, want to face up to this at all. All \nthis discussion about out-of-wedlock births and what I consider to be \nand what I think every colleague considers to be a fundamental problem, \na challenge to be dealt with, or question, why children have children, \nthat is a complicated question. That is a complicated question. That is \nwhat my colleague from New York is trying to say.\n  But from a lot of the statistics that have been recited out on the \nfloor and a lot of the discussion, you would think that we are talking \nabout exclusively a problem with AFDC. It is societal wide, yet it gets \nmixed up, apples and oranges, all the time.\n  I have heard figures spelled out on the cost of welfare where I think \neverything was lumped in. You would think it was the aid to families \nwith dependent children that built up $5 trillion of debt and was \nresponsible for the annual budget deficits and all the rest. This is \nnot true.\n  You would think from this discussion that these enormously high \nbenefits--when not one State has welfare benefits combined with food \nstamps, even up to the official definition of poverty--were causing \nwomen to plan to have more children. But there is no evidence for that \nat all.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. None.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In fact, yesterday I asked my colleague, I said, let \nus take a look at some correlations State by State. I asked, ``Is there \nany correlation?'' We learned, in fact, there is an inverse \ncorrelation. Those States \n\n[[Page S 13561]]\nwith the lowest benefits tend to have families with more children.\n The lowest benefit States have the highest rates of illegitimate \nchildren.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think that we are being very reckless with the \nlives of children. I think what the Senate is about to do over the next \ncouple of days, barring major changes for the better, is very reckless \nwith the lives of children. And in many ways I think it is amounting to \nnothing more than just bashing because, as I have said before, these \nmothers do not have the resources to get on NBC, CBS, and ABC and fight \nsome of these stereotypes.\n  We want reform. But I have heard precious little discussion about the \nwhole issue of job training, jobs, affordable child care, and moving \nforward on health care reform, not just for welfare mothers but other \nfamilies as well. I have heard precious little of that.\n  So, Mr. President, for me the bottom line is--and I understand the \nclimate. It has been just a one-sided flow of information. I said, \nearlier, I say to my colleague, I was at the Minnesota State Fair. I \nlove to be at the State fair. Almost half of the State's population is \nthere in 12 days. I like interacting with people. It is my nature to \nlike people. I had lots of people come up to me and talk about welfare. \nAnd people really do believe we have to drive all these cheaters off \nthe rolls and slackers back to work. People do not necessarily realize \nthat 9 million of those 15 million on welfare are children. But I think \nwhen you talk to people they will say to you we are for the reform but \nwe do not want you to punish children.\n  The direction we are going in is going to punish children. It will--\nand I do not exaggerate--end up taking food out of the mouths of hungry \nchildren. It is not what we should be about. And if there ever was a \nmoment for the President to show leadership, it is now. If there ever \nwas a moment for the President of the United States of America to show \nleadership--and leadership to me is calling on people to be their own \nbest selves, not appeal to the fears and to the frustrations of \npeople--and spell out for people the facts and provide an education for \npeople in the United States of America about what real reform would be \nwhich would benefit children as opposed to hurting children, it is now. \nThe silence of the White House on this question is deafening.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I feel that I owe a lot to the Senator \nfrom New York for his courage, his wisdom, his eloquence, and his \npower.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do not want to keep the floor further \nthan to say no one has given more of his career to this subject than \nthe Senator from Minnesota. He has been at the barricades and in the \nlecture halls and the State fairs on the subject. He is an authority on \nthis subject. He speaks with profound conviction.\n  I thank him for his courtesy to me, and I plead. There is no one in \nthe White House to hear what he has said. Before the day is ending, we \nwill perhaps know more. But we began the day on the right track.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Pennsylvania has arrived. I do \nbelieve our procedures can commence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, not to disappoint the Senator from New \nYork, but I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2584, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2584), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following new \n     title:\n\n              TITLE   --PROTECTION OF BATTERED INDIVIDUALS\n\n     SEC.   01. EXEMPTION OF BATTERED INDIVIDUALS FROM CERTAIN \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of, or \n     amendment made by, this Act, the applicable administering \n     authority of any specified provision may exempt from (or \n     modify) the application of such provision to any individual \n     who was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty if the \n     physical, mental, or emotional well-being of the individual \n     would be endangered by the application of such provision to \n     such individual. The applicable administering authority may \n     take into consideration the family circumstances and the \n     counseling and other supportive service needs of the \n     individual.\n       (b) Specified Provisions.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``specified provision'' means any requirement, \n     limitation, or penalty under any of the following:\n       (1) Sections 404, 405 (a) and (b), 406 (b), (c), and (d), \n     414(d), 453(c), 469A, and 1614(a)(1) of the Social Security \n     Act.\n       (2) Sections 5(i) and 6 (d), (j), and (n) of the Food Stamp \n     Act of 1977.\n       (3) Sections 501(a) and 502 of this Act.\n       (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this \n     section--\n       (1) Battered or subjected to extreme cruelty.--The term \n     ``battered or subjected to extreme cruelty'' includes, but is \n     not limited to--\n       (A) physical acts resulting in, or threatening to result \n     in, physical injury;\n       (B) sexual abuse, sexual activity involving a dependent \n     child, forcing the caretaker relative of a dependent child to \n     engage in nonconsensual sexual acts or activities, or threats \n     of or attempts at physical or sexual abuse;\n       (C) mental abuse; and\n       (D) neglect or deprivation of medical care.\n       (2) Calculation of participation rates.--An individual \n     exempted from the work requirements under section 404 of the \n     Social Security Act by reason of subsection (a) shall not be \n     included for purposes of calculating the State's \n     participation rate under such section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be now 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Wellstone amendment, as \nmodified, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I shall be brief because I believe we have now worked \nthis out and that this amendment will be accepted. I am in fact very \npleased about it.\n  Mr. President, let me just for a moment kind of spell out for my \ncolleagues what this amendment does. Every 15 seconds a woman is beaten \nby a husband or a boyfriend in the United States of America. That is a \nhorrible statistic. But unfortunately, it is a fact. Over 4,000 women \nare killed every year by their abuser and every 6 minutes a woman is \nforcibly raped.\n  My concern, when I introduced this amendment last night with Senator \nMurray, was that with our various requirements we would not unwittingly \nput States in a position where they essentially end up forcing women \nback into very dangerous homes.\n  In other words, the way to summarize it, it took Monica Seles 2 years \nto get back on the tennis court. Imagine what it would be like if you \nwere beaten over and over and over again. When would you be able to get \ninto a job program? When would you be able to get back on your own two \nfeet? Quite often children are also severely affected by this.\n  My amendment allows States to exempt people who have been battered or \nsubjected to extreme cruelty from some of these rules that we now have \nwithin the welfare system without being penalized for not meeting their \nparticipation rate. In other words, if States want to make an exemption \nfor a woman, or sometimes a man, who has come from a very violent home \nand has been battered, a State will be able to do so and a State will \nbe penalized in no way.\n  Mr. President, this is extremely important because I believe that in \norder for us to make sure that we do not send battered women back into \nviolent homes, States absolutely have to be able to do this without \nbeing penalized in any way, shape, or form.\n  I also believe this amendment being passed will enable our States to \nput a focus on this question for not only battered women shelters and \nthe advocates, but I think increasingly the larger number of citizens.\n  So I thank my colleagues for accepting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  Does the Senator wish to urge adoption?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of \nhis time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do. \n\n[[Page S 13562]]\n\n  I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to say we accept the amendment, \nas modified, and allow the Senator to continue with the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2584, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2584), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2609\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Faircloth amendment, No. 2609, \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, my pending amendment modifies a \nprovision in the Dole bill which allows Federal funds to be used for \ncash aid to unmarried teenage mothers.\n  The sole purpose of this amendment is designed to disrupt the pattern \nof out-of-wedlock childbearing that is passing from one generation to \nthe next. My amendment seeks to stop giving cash aid that rewards \nmultigenerational welfare dependency.\n  Let us be clear what the Dole bill currently does. The bill says you \ncan use Federal funds to give vouchers or inkind benefits to an \nunmarried teenage mother or you can use funds to put the mother in a \nsupervised group home. That is fine, and we have all agreed upon that.\n  The Dole bill then goes on to say that you can use Federal funds to \ngive cash benefits to unmarried teenage mothers if that mother resides \nwith her parent.\n  We need to be very clear what type of household we are putting cash \ninto. In this household, there will be three people. First, the newborn \nchild; second, the unmarried teenage mother of that child; and third, \nthe mother of the teenager who has the child, or the grandmother, the \nadult, in other words, in charge of the household.\n  The problem with this scenario is that the adult woman, the mother of \nthe teenager, the grandmother of the new child, the person in charge of \nthe operation, the one we are depending upon for supervision of the \nunmarried teenage mother is very likely either to be or have been an \nunmarried welfare mother herself. It is very likely that this adult \nmother gave birth to the teenager out of wedlock some 15 to 16 years \nago and raised her at least partly on welfare. The young teenager \ngiving birth out of wedlock is simply repeating the pattern and model \nwhich her mother laid down.\n  Let me remind you of a few public statistics to confirm what I am \nsaying. A girl who is raised in a single-parent home on welfare is five \ntimes more likely to have a child out of wedlock herself than is a girl \nraised in a two-parent home without welfare. Roughly two-thirds of all \nthe unwed teenage mothers were raised in broken or single-parent homes.\n  The amendment I am offering is intended to break up the lethal \ngrowing pattern of multigenerational illegitimacy and welfare \ndependency. That is the purpose, to try to break the cycle. The current \namendment follows the same basic rule on teenage mothers as the Dole \nbill, which says you cannot use Federal funds to give cash aid, a check \nin the mail to a teenage mother unless that teenage mother resides with \nher parents or another adult relative.\n  My amendment maintains that same rule but adds only the one \nlimitation, and the limitation states that an unmarried teenage mother \ncannot receive Federal aid, that is a check in the mail, if the parent \nor adult relative the teenager is living with herself had a child out \nof wedlock and has recently received aid to families with dependent \nchildren.\n  The teenage mother cannot get cash aid, cannot get a check in the \nmail if she is residing with a parent who herself has had a child out \nof wedlock and was a welfare mother and has recently received aid to \nfamilies with dependent children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Carolina \nhas expired. The Senator from North Carolina had 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The teenager in those circumstances could receive a \nvoucher or federally funded inkind aid, but she could not get a Federal \nwelfare check in the mail.\n  I want to stress that this does not prevent teenage mothers from \nliving at home or from receiving noncash benefits. Of course, this \nrestriction applies only to Federal funds. A State can use its money to \nsend a check in the mail to anyone it wants.\n  If you vote against this amendment, you are voting to give cash aid \nto multigenerational welfare households. If you vote against this \namendment, you are voting to subsidize and promote multigeneration \nillegitimacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nFaircloth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \nFaircloth amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be able to \ntemporarily set aside the Conrad-Lieberman amendment because we have a \nrequest from the other side that we do that so that we perhaps have a \nchance to work things out before a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? \n\n[[Page S 13563]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2581\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Jeffords amendment No. 2581, \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Simpson, Senator Snowe and, I believe, Senator Chafee. \nI have not had time to gather others who, I am sure, want to cosponsor \nit.\n  This is an important amendment. I hope that my colleagues will listen \ncarefully to what this does. It is an amendment with all the good \nintentions in the world and something that we all believe in--that we \nshould reduce the out-of-wedlock births. It hopes to do this by giving \nan incentive to States to do things to try and reduce it and be \nrewarded if they are successful. What it does is says we shall \ncarefully--keep track of what I say--set as a baseline the year 1995, \nand we will draw the baseline for each State on the number of abortions \nwhich were performed in that State and also the number of out-of-\nwedlock births that occur during that period of time. That might be \nwell, but I would have to point out that such statistics do not exist \nin any valid form. So we will be establishing a baseline, first of all, \nthat really we do not have any idea whether it is valid or not.\n  Then it says that if you reduce your out-of-wedlock births by 1 \npercent and you do not increase your abortions, then you will be \nrewarded with a 5-percent increase in the amount of money you receive \nacross the board for welfare. If you do it by 2 percent, you will get a \n10 percent. That may sound good, too, but remember, to start with we do \nnot have any baseline that we have any accuracy with.\n  What it does is also create an incentive for the States to find all \nsorts of things to do in order to try and get below that. CBO scores it \nat a cost of $75 million over 7 years. In their view, nothing will \nhappen, basically, because if it is successful, the cost will be $1.6 \nbillion a year--$1.6 billion a year for which there is no \nappropriation; so it will come out of something else because it is an \nentitlement.\n  I point out that both the pro-life groups, if not all of them, but \nalso pro-choice groups are opposed to this amendment for many different \nreasons. First of all, since we have no baseline, it is going to be \ndifficult to know as to whether or not anything happened. Second, since \nit refers only to in-State abortions and in-State out-of-wedlock \nbirths, that does not include those that go across the border. So you \nopen up serious problems with respect to manipulation of statistics.\n  There is no reporting process now for abortion. There is no \ndefinition of what an abortion is in the bill.\n  What is an abortion? Is it an IUD? Is it a D and C? What is it? We do \nnot know. The statistics are all over the place.\n  The States will see that goal out there--and keep in mind that if it \nis totally successful, it will cost $1.6 billion a year and we will \nonly reduce the out-of-wedlock births by 2 percent over the whole \nperiod of time.\n  If you are successful the first year and you stay at that level below \nthe baseline, you pick up this thing for the whole 7 years, the 5 years \nof the bill and accomplish nothing more.\n  And, I point out, you have letters given to you from the Catholic \nCharities, who are very much against this. They think it will increase \nthe number of abortions. The pro-choice have looked at this as an \nintervention into privacy.\n  Also, it includes not just welfare individuals; it includes all of \nyour population. This means you will have to report out-of-wedlock \nbirths from every family that has that occur.\n  These things are really disruptive. I hope that we will defeat this \nprovision of the bill. I ask for support of my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. President, if this \namendment succeeds, we will have nothing left in this bill geared to \nthe problem of illegitimacy that virtually every Member of this Senate \nhas talked about and described is a problem in their State.\n  This portion of the bill creates incentives for States to attack this \nissue head on. I believe the criticisms, although well intentioned, do \nnot justify turning our backs on this problem. The fact that it may \ncost more if States across America, every single State brings down its \nillegitimacy rate, it may cost $1 billion more in bonuses, does not \nreflect the total price tag and the success we would have if this were \nto be achieved.\n  The fact is this is a priority issue. It deserves, in terms of our \nfunding priorities, to be placed high on the priority list. If we \nsucceed, I think we will save more in dollars and lives than any \nbonuses we will pay to the States.\n  Further, I think some of the concerns that have been raised as to \ndefinitions are addressed in the legislation as it has been brought to \nthe floor. The Secretary has given quite a bit of latitude to determine \ndefinitions as well as to determine whether or not the numbers have \nbeen in any way gained in order to allow States to capture advantage of \nthe bonus undeservedly.\n  Finally, I just would say if we strip this provision from the bill, \nwe will have to go back and explain to our constituents why we did not \ndo one significant thing to address the No. 1 social problem in America \ntoday. Arguments in favor of this amendment do not, in my judgment, \njustify turning our backs on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President. We are now debating a \nprovision of the Dole bill that addresses illegitimacy but is not at \nall directive or proscriptive. The provision which the amendment by \nSenator Jeffords seeks to strike is a simple provision that rewards a \nState for reducing its illegitimacy ratio, the percentage of total \nbirths which are out of wedlock.\n  This provision taken from the House welfare reform bill says if a \nState decreases its illegitimacy ratio without increasing its abortion \nrate, we will increase the AFDC block grant by up to 10 percent.\n  That is what we all agree that we want. We want a reduction in out-\nof-wedlock births as long as it is not accomplished by an increase in \nabortions.\n  We do not tell the States how to reduce illegitimacy. We simply say, \n``You come up with a successful way to reduce it, and we will give you \nmore money.''\n  The provision has three elements. We set a goal: reducing \nillegitimacy. We give the States maximum flexibility in meeting that \ngoal. Third, we provide a financial reward for meeting the goal.\n  If the Jeffords amendment succeeds, the illegitimacy reduction bonus \nmechanism is struck, the Dole bill will have no provision to reduce \nillegitimacy at all. We will not have real welfare reform.\n  We do not address the crisis of out-of-wedlock births. I thought that \nis what we came to address and to do something about, was illegitimacy, \nand everything that comes up to reduce it we vote down.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it was argued yesterday that no one could \nestablish a relationship between giving people money to do something \nand then seeing them do it.\n  In fact, the proponent of this argument stated that if you believe \nthat people do more of something when you pay them to do it, then you \nmust also believe in the tooth fairy. No more nonsensical statement was \never made on the floor of the U.S. Senate than that.\n  One-third of all the babies born in America today are born out of \nwedlock. The largest single explanation of why that is the case is that \nwe give larger and larger cash payments to people who have more and \nmore babies on welfare. \n\n[[Page S 13564]]\n\n  Yesterday, we lost on our effort to stop that suicidal national \npolicy. Now we have an effort to strike the last remaining provision in \nthis bill, a provision that says simply that if States are able, \nthrough their own reforms, to deal with the greatest welfare crisis we \nface, illegitimacy, that we will give them a bonus for their success.\n  Now we have an amendment that says strike that bonus and eliminate \nthe last remaining effort to deal with illegitimacy. It is very \nimportant that this amendment be defeated.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nintroduced by my colleague from Vermont. This amendment would strike \nthe so-called ``illegitimacy ratio'' from the welfare bill. Let me just \nsay obviously it is a difficult amendment, obviously a difficult area, \na laudable pursuit, but I represent a state that values confidentiality \nand privacy and am greatly concerned about the inaccuracy of the data \ncollection.\n  I do agree with the Senator from Vermont when he says that ``federal \nstrings often do not produce the desired behavior modifications and can \neven produce unintended negative results.'' I think this ratio is a \nclear example of just that.\n  We all agree that the intentions of such a provision are in every way \nlaudable, however, the implementation of such a ratio is what concerns \nme. We all want to reduce the number of out-of-wedlock births in this \ncountry. Every one of us. This issue is of major concern and needs to \nbe addressed at all levels of government. I want to commend my \ncolleagues for bringing this important issue to our attention.\n  However, as a legislator who is pro-choice, I remain concerned that \nthis ratio will actually hinder women from receiving abortions if and \nwhen they choose to do so. States possibly could actually restrict \naccess to abortions in order to ensure that their abortion rate does \nnot increase. Making abortions more difficult to obtain would obviously \nhelp to lower the abortion rate and that is the part that greatly \nconcerns me.\n  In addition, coming from a state that so greatly values \nconfidentiality and privacy--the right to be alone. I am greatly \nconcerned about the inaccuracy of the data collection. We do not have \nreporting requirements on abortions in my State for physicians or \npublic health officials. The physicians in Wyoming fiercely value their \nanonymity in this matter. The State does not seek more accurate \nreporting from them for fear of violence.\n  Wyoming has four abortion providers and access is very much a huge \nproblem. In fact, most women in Wyoming travel to Colorado or Montana \nif they choose to have an abortion. Privacy is such an overwhelming \nconcern in Wyoming, especially in our small towns. This ``ratio'' \nsimply would not be an accurate indicator of abortions in any State for \nthis very reason. Colorado and Montana's ratios would be skewed since \nthey would have to account for the women who do travel to their States \nto have abortions. This is not a problem isolated to the Rocky Mountain \nStates--this occurs across the country in every single rural and \nfrontier area.\n  So I remain deeply concerned about the lack of reporting procedures \nthat currently exist, and this amendment will only aggravate this \nproblem. It does not provide for any additional funding for States to \nset up the extensive reporting procedures that will be needed in order \nto calculate this ratio. If we pass this ratio provision, we will in \nfact be passing on another unfunded mandate to the States.\n   We should all deal honestly with the issues of teenage pregnancy and \nillegitimacy, but there are so many other ways to address these matters \nincluding appropriate sex education in the schools, if I might add.\n  For these reasons, I urge passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me say there is always an excuse not to deal with \nthis issue. If we do not adopt this amendment, there will be nothing on \nillegitimacy in this.\n  We have heard great speeches, what an important problem this is. If \nwe do not reject the Jeffords amendment, there will be nothing in this \nbill to deal with what everybody thinks is the most pressing problem \nthat we have to face.\n  We should quit finding excuses to do nothing.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I may use 2 minutes of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me speak to my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  I think there is a tendency for amendments offered by Democrats being \nvoted for by Democrats, and maybe the other way, too.\n  This amendment makes a great deal of sense, not the amendment of the \nSenator from Vermont but the amendment in the bill. It was worked out \nvery carefully after a lot of consultation by a lot of people to make \ncertain that we were not doing some of the things that have been stated \nhere.\n  It is up to the States; it is up to the Governors. We have talked \nabout returning power to the Governors, power to the States. Democrat \nor Republican Governors--we have not made any distinction.\n  Everybody has railed about illegitimacy. Mr. President, one out of \nthree births is out of wedlock.\n  This is a very important amendment. It is in the House bill. We do \nnot see any reason it should not be in this bill. That is why we put it \nin the Dole amendment to start with.\n  I would hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would take a \nlook at what we are trying to do. Why not reward a State? Why not \nreward a Governor, Governor Edgar from Illinois or Governor Thompson or \nGovernor Romer, whoever it may be, if they can devise a plan to reduce \nthe illegitimacy rate?\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is straightforward.\n  I do not see any pitfalls described by the Senator from Wyoming or \nthe Senator from Vermont. I hope we could defeat the amendment of the \nSenator from Vermont and keep this provision in the bill.\n  I can tell you, I will be a conferee when we ever go to conference on \nthis. This is going to be very important. If we are serious about \nillegitimacy, this is an opportunity to demonstrate it. It is not \npartisan; not Democrat, not Republican, not conservative, not anything, \nas far as I know, except an honest effort to deal with a very serious \nproblem.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Kansas yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Kansas yields for a question? As I read \nthe amendment that is in the bill, it provides a bonus of 5 percent of \nyour State grant if you reduce illegitimacy by 1 percent, and 10 \npercent if you reduce it by 2 percent. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does that mean that, for instance in the District of \nColumbia, they would get 11 times as much actual money for the \nreduction of illegitimacy as would, for instance, the State of \nMississippi, since they get 11 times as much block grant per poor child \nin the District of Columbia than in the State?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would have to check that. I am talking about principle. \nYou are talking about formula.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The principle? If the goal is to accomplish the \nobjective, why could it not have been stated in an absolute amount as \nopposed to a percentage of a block grant, which is very different from \nState to State?\n  Mr. DOLE. We might entertain a modification if the Senator has one.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is there a policy reason why the State has a percent of a \nblock grant as opposed to an absolute number?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think it is going to be more difficult to administer, \ntoo, if you make it absolute. But I want to stick to the principle. \nMaybe the Senator has an idea. He can offer an amendment later on. But \nin my view, this is a very simple straightforward amendment. It is in \nthe bill. \n\n[[Page S 13565]]\n\n  I do not have an answer to the Senator from Florida without checking, \nwhether it might be a good idea or might not be a good idea. But let us \nvote on the amendment and then, if the Senator has some change he would \nlike to make, I will be happy to entertain it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. No, I am ready to vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Dorgan amendment, numbered \n2535, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair very much.\n  This is amendment No. 2535. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-\nof-the-Senate, modeled after the requirement in the new unfunded \nmandate law that we passed earlier this year. The Congressional Budget \nOffice under this amendment that I offer on behalf of myself, Senator \nGlenn, and Senator Graham is asked to report to the Senate prior to a \nvote on the conference report on the cost to the States of complying \nwith the work requirements and any other mandate compared to the amount \nof money provided in the bill for complying with the requirements, and \nas well they are asked to give us an estimate of the number of States \nwhich would opt to pay the penalty rather than raise the additional \nrevenue necessary to meet these requirements.\n  Mr. President, the reason this is necessary is the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has estimated that the cost to the States of \nmeeting the work requirement in this bill will exceed the funds \nprovided in the Dole plan by about $17 billion over 7 years. So the \nStates will be forced to either raise some taxes or cut some spending \nin other areas by $17 billion in order to comply with the requirements \nin the Dole bill.\n  Alternatively, they could simply abandon the work requirement. They \ncould abandon the effort to meet these work requirement goals and they \ncould instead pay a modest penalty--modest as compared to the $17 \nbillion. The penalty would be about $6 billion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that most States will \nopt to pay the penalty. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated that probably only 10 to 15 States will meet the work \nrequirements, meaning 35 to 40 States will pay the penalty.\n  What does that mean? It means that we will not accomplish the central \nfunction of one of the things we want to do in this bill, and that is \nmove people from the welfare rolls to work. This is in my judgment \neither then an unfunded mandate of significant quantity or it will fail \nin the primary objective of moving people off welfare and to a job.\n  The law we passed a few short months ago indicated we ought not do \nany of these things unless we understand what we are asking others to \ndo in terms of unfunded mandates. This amendment is very simple. Before \nwe vote on the conference report, let us have a report by the CBO of \nwhat kind of an unfunded mandate exists here, how many States will \ncomply with the work requirement and what we can expect from this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Glenn from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleague. I am glad to be a cosponsor of this \namendment. What the Senator has said is that early this year we passed \nthe unfunded mandates bill. We said no longer were we going to just \nthrow things back on the States and say you take care of it; we are \nputting the requirement out there with no money. And yet that is \nexactly what we are doing right now in this bill.\n  I know the unfunded mandates bill does not kick in with all of its \nrequirements until January 1 next year. With this bill, we are \nrequiring States to place 50 percent of welfare recipients on the work \nrolls by 2002. We are requiring job training, placement, education. \nWork requirement will be another $1.9 billion on State governments per \nyear, 3.3 to cover child care costs, and so on, required for the Dole \nbill.\n  I do not know how the balance comes out, where increased flexibility \nlets them save some money and how this balances out, but this could \nwind up as a giant, giant unfunded mandate on the States, and so I am \nvery glad to support my colleague's proposal. If we are in keeping with \nthe philosophy and principles of S. 1, the first bill that we passed \nthis year, we should not be saddling State and local governments with \nthese new welfare requirements without knowing exactly what we are \ndoing.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I happen to agree with the Senator from Ohio \nand the Senator from North Dakota. We ought to find out what it costs, \nwhatever impact it may have.\n  I am prepared to accept the amendment. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am satisfied with that. I appreciate the \ncooperation of the majority leader.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \n2535.\n  The amendment (No. 2535) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2589\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be a 10-\nminute debate equally divided on the McCain amendment No. 2589 to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment. That will be a \n10-minute vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are on the McCain \namendment which I believe is acceptable on both sides. So I yield back \nthe time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could we have a description of the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. I have been advised the purpose of the amendment is to \nprovide for child support enforcement agreements between the States and \nIndian tribes or tribal organizations.\n  It provides for child support enforcement agreements between the \nStates and Indian tribes and tribal organizations. I think the same \nthing that applies to States now applies to tribal organizations. As I \nunderstand, there is no problem with the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators \n\n[[Page S 13566]]\n  McCain and Inouye as a cosponsor of an amendment that would further the \ngoals of strengthening child support enforcement activities by \nencouraging State governments with Indian tribes within their borders \nto enter into cooperative agreements for the delivery of child support \nenforcement services in Indian country.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would give the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, in specific instances, the \nauthority to provide direct Federal funding to Indian tribes operating \nan approved child support enforcement plan. This approach is consistent \nwith the government-to-government relationship between tribal \ngovernments and the Federal Government. Further, this approach to child \nsupport enforcement in Indian country is supported by the National \nCouncil of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators.\n  Mr. President, title IV-D of the Social Security Act was enacted to \nassist all children in obtaining support and moving out of poverty. Yet \nit has been of little assistance to Indian children residing in Indian \ncountry because under title IV-D, only States are eligible to receive \nFederal funds to operate title IV-D programs. The regulations \nimplementing this act restrict States from providing services to Indian \nchildren on reservations.\n  State child support program administrators have attempted to meet the \ngoals of child support enforcement by extending their efforts to Indian \ncountry, but the administrative and jurisdictional hurdles have made it \nall but impossible to get these services to need Indian children.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in 1992, the Interstate Commission of Child \nSupport Enforcement recommended that the Congress address this problem \nthrough Federal legislation. It is time for America's neediest children \nto receive child support enforcement services.\n                           amendment no. 2589\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Inouye, \nWellstone, Domenici, and Daschle, for joining me in offering this \nimportant amendment. The amendment that I and my colleagues are \noffering today would further the goals of enforcing child support \nenforcement activities by encouraging, not mandating, State \ngovernments, with Indian lands within their borders, to enter into \ncooperative agreements with Indian tribal governments for the delivery \nof child support enforcement services in Indian country. The amendment \nprovides funding to achieve these purposes within the overall spending \nallocated to this effort. It gives the Secretary the authority, in \nspecific instances, to provide direct Federal funding to Indian tribes \noperating an approved child support enforcement plan. This approach is \nconsistent with the government-to-government relationship between \ntribal governments and the Federal Government, and the other provisions \ncontained in the Dole substitute bill.\n  Mr. President, title IV-D of the Social Security Act was enacted to \nassist all children in obtaining support and moving out of poverty. \nUnder this title, State child support offices are required to provide \nbasic services to parents who apply for these services, including those \nthat receive welfare assistance. These services include collecting and \ndistributing child support payments from dead beat dads. Yet this \nprogram has been of little assistance to Indian children residing in \nIndian Country because under title IV-D, only States are eligible to \nreceive Federal funds to operate IV-D programs under Federal \nregulations which, as a practical matter, all but prohibit them from \nproviding services to Indian children on reservations. Because of this, \nIndian children have lost, and will continue to lose necessary \nservices.\n  Mr. President, there is a great need for child support enforcement \nfunding and services in Indian country. There are approximately 554 \nfederally recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent Bureau of the Census data, \nchildren under the age of 18 make up the largest age group of Indians. \nApproximately 20.5 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives are \nunder the age of 10 compared to 14 percent for the Nation's total \npopulation. In addition, one out of every five Indian households are \nheaded by single females. This data reveals that the need for \ncoordinated child support enforcement and service delivery in Indian \ncountry exceeds the need in the rest of America.\n  There are also jurisdictional barriers to effective service delivery \nunder IV-D programs on reservations. Federal courts have held that \nIndian tribes, not States, have authority over Indian child support \nenforcement issues and paternity establishment of tribal members \nresiding and working on the\n reservation. These jurisdictional safeguards, although necessary, have \nhampered State child support agencies in their efforts to negotiate \nagreements for the provision of services or funding to Indian tribal \ngovernments. The types of services provided under title IV-D include \npaternity establishment, including genetic blood testing, the \nestablishment of support obligations and the enforcement of support \nobligations through wage withholdings and tax intercepts. These \nactivities fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian tribes. \nYet there is no mechanism to enable tribes to receive Federal funding \nand assistance to conduct these activities.\n\n  This amendment in no way forces or compels an Indian tribe or State \nto act, nor does it affect well-established State or tribal \njurisdiction to establish paternity or support orders. It merely \nrecognizes the problems of child support collection and distribution \nbetween States and tribes as they exist under the current system. \nSimply put, this amendment encourages cooperative agreements between \ntwo governments to satisfy the goals and purposes of uniform child \nsupport enforcement. Let me just point out that some of these \nagreements are already in place in States like Washington and Arizona.\n  State administrators, such as in my own State, have attempted to meet \nthe goals of uniform child support enforcement by extending their \nefforts to Indian Country, but the administrative and jurisdictional \nhurdles make it all but impossible to get these services out to the \nchildren in need.\n  These obstacles have led to costly litigation. For example, the 8th \nand 9th circuit courts have issued inconsistent rulings in addressing \nthe ability of Indian children to access title IV-D services. A 1991 \nFederal court ruling summed up the problem by holding--\n\n       . . . the State must give children of absent Indian parents \n     the same degree of child support enforcement services as \n     other children, when there is reasonable access to the tribal \n     courts.\n\nYet, that court's ruling is inconsistent with the Department of Health \nand Human Services interpretation of title IV-D in which the Department \nsignificantly restricts the States. Let me remind my colleagues that \nStates are trying to be fair in providing child support enforcement \nservices and funding to Indians. Their ability to provide these \nservices is quite limited because Indian tribes are not mentioned in \ntitle IV-D. This amendment would clarify that Indian children are \nentitled to the same protections from deadbeat dads as all other \nchildren in our country.\n  Mr. President, this problem is not new to those involved in State \nchild support enforcement agencies or national organizations concerned \nwith these issues. For instance, in 1992, the American Bar Association \nand the Interstate Commission of Child Support recognized the problems \ncreated by the omission of Indian tribes from IV-D legislation. In \nfact, the American Bar Association issued a handbook for States and \ntribes to use in attempting to negotiate State/Tribal cooperative \nagreements for child support enforcement. Also in an elaborate report \nissued in 1992, the Interstate Commission on Child Support Enforcement \nrecommended that the Congress address this problem in Federal \nlegislation. Until the amendment under consideration was offered, no \nlegislative initiative to include Indian tribes has occurred.\n  More recently, I received a copy of a letter, dated May 15, 1995, \nfrom the president of the National Council of State Child Support \nEnforcement Administrators. The letter advises the Department of Health \nand Human Services that a resolution was passed by the IV-D directors \nthat favors direct Federal funding to Indian tribes for child support \nservices. Let me quote from a passage of the letter ``The states that \nare concerned about this \n\n[[Page S 13567]]\nissue believe that the most effective way to provide comprehensive \nservices to Native American children is for the federal government to \ndeal directly with sovereign tribal governments.'' The amendment that I \nam offering will do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, if all time is yielded \nback, the question is on agreeing to the amendment 2589.\n  The amendment (No. 2589) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2525\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be a \n10-minute debate equally divided on the Exon amendment 2525, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska is on his way. \nHe is expected to be here soon. I wonder if I could place a quorum \ncall----\n  Mr. DOLE. Maybe better yet, as I understand, the Nickles amendment \nnumbered 2556, I was advised by Senator Nickles that had been worked \nout to the satisfaction of both sides.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. To my knowledge, I do not know of any objection.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, Senator Nickles has spoken to me about \nthis amendment and as I understand he has modified his amendment. At \nthis moment, I do not know if he has modified it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Maybe we will put in a quorum call and we will find Senator \nNickles. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2556, as modified\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I now ask unanimous consent we move to consideration of \n2556, the Nickles amendment, and I send a modification to the desk \nwhich has been cleared by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2556), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Section 913, page 602 of the amendment, strike line 22 \n     through page 603 line 5 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Civil Money Penalties on Noncomplying Employers.--The \n     State shall have the option to set a State civil money \n     penalty which shall be less than--\n       ``(1) $25; or\n       ``(2) $500 if, under State law, the failure is the result \n     of a conspiracy between the employer and the employee to not \n     supply the required report or to supply a false or incomplete \n     report.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment 2556, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2556), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Exon amendment \n2525.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2525\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I apologize to the managers of the bill. I \ndid not mean to delay them. I stepped off the floor for the first time \nfor 10 minutes assuming there were other measures ahead of mine. But I \nam now prepared to offer my amendment.\n  I offered this amendment last week. I made a concise statement at \nthat time. I believe that I have 5 minutes under the unanimous-consent \nagreement.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is allowed 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2525, As Modified\n\n  Mr. EXON. After introducing the amendment last week, I have a very \nminor addition to the amendment that was suggested by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Simpson from Wyoming, with whom I have worked on \nthis matter for a long, long time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this minor addition be announced and \nconsidered, and the amendment itself be considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 302, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 506. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT OF FEDERAL BENEFITS TO \n                   CERTAIN PERSONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and except as provided in subsection (b), Federal benefits \n     shall not be paid or provided to any person who is not a \n     person lawfully present within the United States.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to the following benefits:\n       (1) Emergency medical services under title XIX of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       (2) Short-term emergency disaster relief.\n       (3) Assistance or benefits under the National School Lunch \n     Act.\n       (4) Assistance or benefits under the Child Nutrition Act of \n     1966.\n       (5) Public health assistance for immunizations and, if the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that it is \n     necessary to prevent the spread of a serious communicable \n     disease, for testing and treatment of such disease.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Federal benefit.--The term ``Federal benefit'' means--\n       (A) the issuance of any grant, contract, loan, professional \n     license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the \n     United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) any retirement, welfare, Social Security, health, \n     disability, public housing, post-secondary education, food \n     stamps, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit \n     for which payments or assistance are provided by an agency of \n     the United States or by appropriated funds of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Person lawfully present within the united states.--The \n     term ``person lawfully present within the United States'' \n     means a person who, at the time the person applies for, \n     receives, or attempts to receive a Federal benefit, is a \n     United States citizen, a permanent resident alien, an alien \n     whose deportation has been withheld under section 243(h) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1253(h)), an \n     asylee, a refugee, a parolee who has been paroled for a \n     period of at least 1 year, a national, or a national of the \n     United States for purposes of the immigration laws of the \n     United States (as defined in section 101(a)(17) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)).\n       (d) State Obligation.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, a State that administers a program that provides a \n     Federal benefit (described in section 506(c)(1)) or provides \n     State benefits pursuant to such a program shall not be \n     required to provide such benefits to a person who is not a \n     person lawfully present within the United States (as defined \n     in section 506(c)(2)) through a State agency or with \n     appropriated funds of such State.\n       (e) Verification of Eligibility.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General of the United \n     States, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, shall promulgate regulations requiring \n     verification that a person applying for a Federal benefit, \n     including a benefit described in section 506(b), is a person \n     lawfully present within the United States and is eligible to \n     receive such benefit.

Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 13568]]\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will make some brief remarks on this. I \nbelieve there is strong support on this. I will be asking for the yeas \nand nays. And I would agree to have the yeas and nays ordered at any \ntime that the managers of the bill think are in order.\n  Mr. President, last Friday I offered an amendment to the welfare \nreform bill which states that Federal benefits shall not be paid or \nprovided to any person who is not lawfully present within the United \nStates. I have introduced measures to address this problem in the past \nand the Senate accepted a very similar amendment in 1993 by a vote of \n85 for and only 2 against, and only to see it unfortunately dropped in \nconference.\n  My amendment specifically defines who is a person lawfully present \nwithin our country. Previous prohibitions on the payment of benefits to \nillegal aliens have been weakened by expansive agency regulations and \ncourt decision. My amendment also provides for a number of exceptions. \nIllegal aliens would still be eligible for elementary and secondary \neducation, emergency medical services, disaster relief, school lunches, \nchild nutrition, and immunization.\n  Also, States would not be obligated to provide benefits to those not \nlawfully present in our country, and funds would be provided for States \nto set up systems to verify the status of the applicants. As we \ncontinue to debate welfare reform, I believe it is evidence that we \nmust not pass up this opportunity to stop, once and for all, providing \nscarce Federal benefits to illegal aliens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would first, if I could, ask the Senator \nfrom Nebraska if he would yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator, I was \nparticularly concerned about the issue of elementary and secondary \neducation. The Senator stated that his amendment would not deny the \nchild of a person who was in the country illegally access to elementary \nand secondary education?\n  Mr. EXON. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Could the Senator tell me where in the amendment that was \nmentioned?\n  Mr. EXON. It may well be that the Senator from Florida did not \nunderstand. That was incorporated in the amendment and was suggested as \nan exception by the Senator from Wyoming. And I think it satisfies the \nconcerns of the Senator from Florida. It is in the amendment on which \nwe are now discussing and on which we will vote. If you are talking \nabout the amendment that I offered last Friday, it is not in there. But \nit is in the amendment that we will be voting on.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the answer to that question allayed one of \nmy principal concerns about this amendment, because in the original \nform, the form that was at the desk, there was no recognition of the \nchildren of persons who were in the country illegally in terms of their \nparticipation in elementary and secondary education.\n  In fact, there was a provision which would have allowed the States to \nhave terminated educational assistance to those children as well as the \nFederal Government terminating whatever assistance it provides. With \nthat modification, I will reserve final judgment as to how I will vote \non this amendment. But I would like to raise the fundamental issue, the \nFederal Government has the total constitutional responsibility for the \nenforcement of our borders, and for our immigration and naturalization \nlaw. It is written almost in those terms in article 1 of the U.S. \nConstitution. The States have no authority in either of those two \nareas.\n  Second, when the Federal Government fails to carry out its \nresponsibility and to enforce the borders, it is the States and the \nlocal communities who have the principal obligations and consequences \nof that failure.\n  Third, those consequences are heavily focused in about six States. \nSix States have over 80 percent of those persons who are in the country \nillegally living within their borders.\n  So, fourth, the consequence of this legislation is to say the Federal \nGovernment failed to carry out its exclusive constitutional \nresponsibility: To protect the borders and enforce the immigration \nlaws, allow large numbers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the manager for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes 57 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. May I inquire whether I may receive 30 seconds from the \nSenator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I do not want to interrupt the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming when he gets the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield an additional minute to the \nSenator from Florida and 1 minute to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to conclude, we are about to set up what I \nthink is a very unsafe situation: The Government fails to carry out its \nconstitutional responsibility, and for the people who are illegally in \ncommunities across America, we are saying the Federal Government is \ngoing to deny any benefits to those people, which means those \ncommunities already the most heavily impacted now, out of their \nresources, have to pick up those responsibilities.\n  As a humanitarian society, we are still going to face providing \nhealth care, delivering babies to pregnant women, and the negative \naspects of operating a criminal justice system and the other \nrequirements when that illegal population acts in ways that are \nantithetical to the society in which they are living.\n  Reserving the right to review the amendment in its final form, I \nraise for my colleagues the potential consequences of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, too, want to express that Senator \nExon's amendment does not include the elementary and secondary \neducation. Under the initial amendment, there is about $225 million \nthat goes into States, into local communities to respond to Supreme \nCourt holdings with regard to their requirements to educate these \nchildren. But this has eliminated that.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with the Senator. We have, for \nexample, 11,000 temporary nurses that come here to work in many of our \nurban area hospitals. Under this requirement, their residency \nrequirements are such that they would not be able to get nursing \nlicenses the way this is being interpreted, which would put a severe \npressure on many of the inner-city hospitals in underserved areas.\n  I know that is not the intention of the Senator. I welcome the \nopportunity as this legislative process moves forward in some of these \nareas that we can work through to try to not have unintended \nconsequences that would provide a hardship rather than to achieve the \nobjectives of the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, my colleague. \nSenator Exon came to the Senate when I did. His consistency on this has \nbeen clear through the years, and we have taken care of the problems \nbrought up by Senator Graham and by Senator Kennedy.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator on these issues, as with \nSenator Kennedy, the ranking member of the subcommittee, which I chair.\n  We have also taken care of in this amendment veterans issues. There \nwill be no diminution of veterans benefits, no denial of veterans \nbenefits to someone who may have been illegal but \n\n[[Page S 13569]]\nserved the country. So it takes care of that and takes care of the \neducation issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. EXON. I am prepared to yield back my time to move things ahead.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, is there remaining time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in opposition has been yielded back.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator's \namendment because I think this is a very important part of the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility to control our borders.\n  I am one of the States that is affected by the illegal aliens that \ncome across the border, and they do take not only from our State and \nlocal coffers, but from the Federal coffers as well. This is something \nthat we must stop. I think the Senator from Nebraska has a very good \namendment, and I think it should be part of an overall illegal \nimmigration reform measure that the Senator from Wyoming and the \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein, are working on. But until \nthat time, it is very important that we speak in this welfare reform \nbill to the cost of illegal aliens.\n  So I appreciate what the Senator from Nebraska has done, and I \nsupport his amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas very much for \nthe kind statement and support. Since no one is seeking time, I yield \nback the remainder of my time, and the yeas and nays have already been \ngranted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nExon amendment No. 2525, as modified. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 6, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 424 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--6\n\n     Brown\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Murkowski\n     Simon\n     Thompson\n  So the amendment (No. 2525), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Democratic leader asked me to institute \na quorum call, which I did, but I think we have an amendment of the \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein, which can be accepted. We \nwill be prepared to do that.\n  Then the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota was set aside. \nApparently he is prepared to proceed on that. It is part of our list, \nso I think it will be appropriate to do that. So I will work to clear \nit with Senator Daschle.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2470\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2470.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2470.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. What the amendment does is require procedures \nfor a child support order for the child of minor parents, where the \nmother is receiving assistance for the child, to be enforceable against \nthe paternal grandparents of the child.\n  For just a moment--what the Dole bill does is require a minor mother \nand her child to live at home with her parents, so the maternal parents \nare responsible. What my amendment would do is say, where it is \npossible, a child support order should be obtained against the parents \nof the male involved. It takes two to tango in this instance, and the \nresponsibility for the care of the child should not only belong to the \nmaternal grandparents but the paternal as well.\n  So this solves the other half of the problem.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have no problem with the amendment. It \nhas been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It has been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2470) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Are there any other amendments that have been cleared? I \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts has one or two minor amendments \nthat I do not see any problem with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I had amendment No. 2483, which I \nthought might have been cleared by now. I will be prepared to offer \nthat if it has been cleared.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, if he will let me \ncheck that--what is the number?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Amendment No. 2483. I believe that is going to be \nacceptable. If it is, I am ready to offer it at any time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me check and I will be right back with the Senator.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts has two amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n\n                 En Bloc Amendments Nos. 2662 and 2664\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. We are just ascertaining the numbers. \nMr. President, I ask amendment No. 2662 and amendment No. 2664 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], proposes \n     amendments numbered 2662 and 2664, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The texts of the amendments are printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n\n[[Page S 13570]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, these are two amendments which I thank the \ndistinguished manager and majority leader and the Senator from New York \nfor accepting.\n  Mr. President, as we trudge toward the rhetorical goal of ending \nwelfare as we know it, we as a country must do better; we must embrace \nwhole new ideas of how to accomplish this--if not now, at least in the \nfuture--primarily by investing in impoverished children and secondarily \nby providing a safety net for their parents. The guiding principle of \nour new system should be to summon the very best effort this country \ncan mount to enable children who are victims of poverty to become self-\nsufficient adults capable of contributing to our society in a positive \nway and leading happy, fulfilling lives.\n  Dependency--whether it be on the foster care system when a person is \na child, or on Government institutions such as the welfare or criminal \njustice systems if a person is an adult, or on drugs at any age--is a \ntragic waste of human potential and imposes costs we as a nation need \nnot suffer and cannot afford to pay.\n  In many ways, welfare works--it is perhaps the cheapest means of \ngetting the bare minimum of resources to the neediest slice of the \nAmerican public; but in critical ways, it does not--it can perpetuate \ndependency rather than inculcate self-sufficiency. At the very least, \nby itself, it does not promote movement toward self-sufficiency.\n  The way to make the most of the current welfare reform movement is--\nwithout ignoring the good welfare may have done over the years--to \ndesign our priorities and construct a better system able to meet the \nminimal needs of today's recipients while doing everything possible to \nensure that children on welfare don't become adults on welfare and that \nadults on welfare move whenever possible toward self-sufficiency.\n  The focal points for any effort to replace welfare with an \nintervention program which targets children must be our Nation's \nschools. There is a vital role that schools must play that they can't \nplay without greater resources, voluntarism, and attention.\n  In cities beset by crime and violence, and in rural areas with little \nto inspire or occupy children, the neighborhood public school must \nbecome a beacon--a warm, safe haven of learning, of values, of \nfriendship, of intellectual growth.\n  No school in such areas should shut its doors at 3 p.m. and stop its \ncontribution to children's and parents' lives.\n  Case in point is teenage mothers, especially those who fail to avoid \nhaving children because they see no worthwhile future that awaits them \nif they avoid having children.\n  We must invest in efforts to educate these children about the costs \nand realities of parenthood, and we must invest in education programs \nthat provide real futures for school-age pregnant girls and new mothers \nand, where they can be identified, new fathers.\n  We must think in the longterm, and understand that money dedicated to \nending welfare dependency by investing in children will not only save \nmoney in the long run, it will\n help save this country.\n\n  We are throwing away our future by ignoring the children of this \ncountry. One day all who can read this article will be senior citizens, \nfully dependent on the babies we neglect today. So will be our Nation \nand its future.\n  If we fail to meet the needs of these children, not only will we fail \nto maintain this country's status as leader of the democratic world to \nwhich we have contributed so much, but we will devolve into a country \nconsumed by crime and poverty the likes of which this Nation cannot \nimagine.\n  We have already fallen deeper into crime than our parents would have \never dreamed. It will not matter that parents have raised their own \nchildren well if they raise them so they are alone in that distinction. \nWithout concerted, collective effort, even children raised with love \nand concern--whether in low income or high income families--will not be \nsafe and secure.\n  We have already lost a frightening number of a complete generation of \nchildren to unambitious welfare programs, inadequate schooling, and \nsocietal neglect. Nothing less than the survival of our Nation depends \non our collective assumption of our responsibility of this Nation's \nyoung.\n  Parents, schools, communities, and the Government need to become \nimmersed in the development and enculturalization of children.\n  I believe we need to face the reality that this welfare debate is \npart of a much larger debate that we will be forced to have in this \ncountry in the not-too-distant future. It is a debate that speaks to \nthe soul of America, and ultimately will have to come from our hearts \nas well as from our heads. It is a debate about not only solving our \nfiscal deficit, but also about addressing the cultural and spiritual \ndeficits that seem to be tearing at the fabric of our society.\n  It is about a welfare mother who can't read and a system that doesn't \ncare. It is about a teenager with a child she cannot care for and a \ncommunity that will not help. It is about what we ultimately decide is \nthe legitimate cost of failing to care, and about what we are willing \nto invest in the effort to manifest the care we claim.\n  We need to address the basic philosophical issue of responsibility to \neach other as a community of people.\n  The battle is over how we do this. How do we stop children from \nhaving children? How do we solve the problem of mothers who cannot work \nbecause they have no daycare for their children and no extended family \nable to help them? What do we do about young teenagers growing up in \nincreasingly violent neighborhoods--kids with diminished valves and an \nincreasingly diminished sense of right and wrong? We are seeing the \nrise of a generation of Americans who think there's more power in the \nbarrel of a gun than in the memory of a computer.\n  The true question is how do we prepare for a better future in this \nNation? The answer, I believe, is to invest in people and to seek long-\nterm solutions to welfare problems to improve our collective future \nrather than succumb to simple-sounding, quick fixes that carry \ntremendous unseen burdens for our future.\n  But, Mr. President, the bill we have before us simply does not do \nwhat needs to be done.\n  I offer two amendments today that invest in children, education, and \nfamilies, reaching toward the objective that no one will be isolated \nfrom the mainstream of productive society.\n  Mr. President, it is well-established that some children of welfare \ndependent parents are subjected to inadequate care, supervision, and \nparental love and attention, to unsafe environments and undesirable \ninfluences. It should come as no surprise that many of these children \nfail to develop into responsible, self-sufficient adults who are \ncontributing members of society. Too often welfare becomes a repetitive \ncycle extending over multiple generations rather than a temporary \nsituation.\n  Part of the answer to breaking this pathological cycle is to require \nparents seeking welfare to take an active role in the supervision, \neducation, and care of their children. Another part is to make better \nand more efficient use of existing public resources and investments for \nthe benefit of at-risk children. Notable among those resources and \ninvestments are our public school facilities.\n  While I do not believe it is possible for our Nation to successfully \nand acceptably resolve our current welfare problems wholly without \nfurther public investment, neither of these two partial answer to those \nproblems entails significant additional cost.\n  We cannot afford to neglect children when we know full well that \nimproving their surroundings helps prevent their long-term dependence \non government aid. All the nations with which we are competing in the \nnew global marketplace are acting in recognition of that fact--except \nus. We must boldly pursue the long-term benefits promised by concerted \nefforts to make maximum use of our schools and educational facilities, \nand by insisting that all welfare recipient parents accept basic \nparental responsibilities--that many of them routinely perform \nadmirably under difficult circumstances but some appear to ignore.\n  My amendments would move in these directions.\n  My first amendment would provide funds for demonstration projects so \nkeep schools that serve at-risk children open for more hours and to \ninitiate \n\n[[Page S 13571]]\nnew programs so that schools can offer an alternative to the street for \nour Nation's unsupervised youth. This companion program would \ncomplement the Community Schools Program.\n  My second amendment would require parents to sign a parental \nresponsibility contract that would demand, in exchange for benefits, \nthat parents take an active role in the supervision and education of \ntheir children.\n  Mr. President, these two amendments are only first steps. But they \nare steps in the right direction: toward the brighter future of this \nNation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have no objection to the amendments.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is no objection on this side. To the contrary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the en bloc amendments.\n  The en bloc amendments (Nos. 2662 and 2664) were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the majority leader and thank the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand it, the Senator from California has a \ndemonstration amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2479\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2479.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2479.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, what this amendment does is \nessentially assures that, in those large counties or groups of counties \nwith a population greater than 500,000, that there be provision, with \npermission of the State--this is the modification in the amendment--\nthat the money, the block grant, go directly to the county. So we have \nmodified the amendment from its original presentation. My understanding \nis that it is agreeable to both sides.\n  The purpose of the amendment is, really, so many of the innovative \ndemonstration projects that are initiated by counties, which I pointed \nout in my opening remarks on this amendment, can go ahead without an \nadditional element of bureaucracy.\n  Again, the State would have to approve this, but for those counties \nthat do their own administration, this would continue to be the case.\n  Mr. DOLE. Has the modification been sent to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reports the modification does not \nappear to be at the desk.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment of \nthe Senator from California be temporarily laid aside so I can make a \nunanimous-consent request and have my amendment considered. It has been \ncleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                    Amendment No. 2486, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that a \nmodification to my amendment, No. 2486, be sent to the desk and be in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2486), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       (G) Community Service.--Not later than 3 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, consistent with the \n     exception provided in section 404(d), require participation \n     by, and offer to, unless the State opts out of this provision \n     by notifying the Secretary, a parent or caretaker receiving \n     assistance under the program, after receiving such assistance \n     for 6 months--\n       (i) is not exempt from work requirements; and\n       (ii) is not engaged in work as determined under section \n     404(c),\n\n     in community service employment, with minimum hours per week \n     and tasks to be determined by the State.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, the amendment, as modified, is acceptable \non this side.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It most assuredly is on our side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could spend 30 seconds, I have long \nbelieved that work requirements should be clear, strong, and applied \npromptly. For too long we have permitted welfare dependency to \nundermine the potential productivity of too many able-bodied Americans. \nWe have allowed too many able-bodied welfare recipients not to work. \nThat is wrong.\n  The amendment which I am offering would add a requirement that \nwelfare recipients be in job training and school or working in private \nsector jobs within 6 months of receipt of benefits, and if private \nsector jobs could not be found they be required to perform some type of \ncommunity service employment. The requirement would be phased in over 3 \nyears to allow States the chance to adjust administratively. We have \nadded in this modification a opt-out provision for States by \nnotification of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and also to \nmake clear the intent to conform to the modifications which Senator \nDole made to his amendment No. 2280 last week.\n  The bill before us requires recipients to work within no more than 2 \nyears of receipt of benefits. Why wait that long? Why wait 2 years? \nUnless an able-bodied person is in school or job training, why wait \nlonger than 6 months to require that a person have a private job or be \nperforming community service?\n  My amendment says 6 months instead of 2 years.\n  There is no doubt that there is a great need in local communities \nacross the country for community service workers. Last year, the demand \nfor community service workers from the President's AmeriCorps Program \nwas far greater than the ability to fund them. According to AmeriCorps, \nof the 538 project applications requesting approximately 60,000 \nworkers, only applications for about 20,000 workers could be funded. \nProjects ranged from environmental cleanup, to assisting in day care \ncenters, to home health care aides. It is clear that there is no \nshortage of need for workers in community service.\n  The Daschle amendment which was narrowly defeated last week contained \na similar provision which was added as a modification at my request. It \nwould require that recipients work in community service employment if \nnot employed in the private sector, engaged in job training or in \nschool, and it would require that States offer the community service \noption to such recipients.\n   Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the cycle of \ndependency and the need to return welfare recipients to work. As long \nas 14 years ago, in 1981, I was the author, along with Senator Dole, of \nlegislation which was enacted into law that put some welfare recipients \nback to work as home health care aides, thereby decreasing the welfare \nrolls and increasing the local tax base.\n  This demonstration project called for the training and placement of \nAFDC recipients as home care aides to Medicaid recipients as a long-\nterm care alternative to institutional care, and was subject to \nrigorous evaluation in both the demonstration and post-demonstration \nperiods.\n  The independently conducted program evaluation found that during six \nof the seven demonstration projects, trainees' total monthly earnings \nincreased by 56 percent to more than 130 percent. Evaluations in \nfollowing years indicated similarly positive and significant income \neffects. Consistent with the increase in employment, trainees also \nreceived reduced public benefits. All seven States moved a significant \nproportion of trainees off of AFDC. In \n\n[[Page S 13572]]\nfour of the States, a significant proportion of the trainees also were \nmoved off of the Food Stamp Program or received significantly reduced \nbenefit amounts.\n  Additionally, the program evaluation indicated that it significantly \nincreased the amount of formal in-home care received by Medicaid \nclients and had significant beneficial effects on client health and \nfunctioning. The evaluation also indicated that clients benefited from \nmarginally reduced costs for the services they received.\n  As the 1986 evaluation shows, this type of demonstration had great \npotential in allowing local governments to respond to priority needs \nand assist members of their community in obtaining the training \nnecessary to obtain practical, meaningful private sector employment and \nbecome productive, self-sufficient members of their community.\n   Mr. President, I want to highlight a particularly wise provision in \nSenator Dole's bill. It is a provision which states that any recipient \nmay be treated as participating in community service employment if that \nperson provides child care services to other individuals participating \nin the community service program. This is a good idea. It opens a way \nfor many able-bodied persons currently on welfare, to provide a service \nto others, meet work requirements, and, at the same time, free others \nto work who may otherwise have difficulty locating affordable child \ncare. I hope that many States will vigorously exercise this provision \nand that recipients will heed the encouragement to provide child care \nservices as a way of engaging in community service employment.\n   Mr. President, I am hopeful that in the 104th Congress, we will take \nthe necessary steps to get people off welfare and working, in the \nprivate sector, if possible, but in community service, if necessary. \nExperience has shown we must be more aggressive in requiring recipients \nto work. I believe my amendment is a firm step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Moynihan and Senator Dole and their \nstaff for working with us on this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2486), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           amendment no. 2507\n\n         certain liheap expenses should be excluded from income\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is \ndesigned to address a potentially serious oversight in the majority \nleader's version of the welfare reform bill which must be clarified. \nThe Dole substitute would repeal the longstanding provision in the \ncurrent Federal food stamp law which excludes from income measurements \nany regular Low-Income Energy Assistance Program benefits provided by \nState and Federal energy assistance programs, such as monthly utility \npayments. LIHEAP is the major Federal fuel subsidy program, which has \nin my State been a cold-weather lifeline for vulnerable unemployed \npeople, the elderly, and children for many years.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Minnesota is often called the icebox \nof the Nation, where bitterly cold weather is the norm. In fact, \nMinnesota is the third coldest State, in terms of heating degree days, \nin the country, after Alaska and North Dakota. Especially in cold-\nweather States like Minnesota, funding for LIHEAP is critical to \nfamilies with children and vulnerable low-income elderly persons, who \nwithout it could be forced to choose between food and heat. The LIHEAP \nprogram assists approximately 110,000 households in Minnesota, and \nprovides an average energy assistance benefit of about $360 per heating \nseason.\n  In the frenzy of getting this bill modified in the final days before \nit hit the floor, as was often the case with many of these so-called \nreforms, the net may have unintentionally been cast too widely. That is \nwhy some have urged that this repeal be corrected and clarified to \nensure that it would only apply to regular energy assistance payments \nfor heating and cooling, such as monthly utility payments, and not to \nthe types of emergency furnace repair or replacement payments, or \nweatherization, or other similar payments, that are provided to many \nlow-income Americans through State and Federal energy assistance \nprograms.\n  My amendment will do just that. It explicitly excludes energy \nassistance payments for things like emergency furnace repairs and \nreplacement, and weatherization expenses, from being counted as income \nfor purposes of calculating eligibility for food stamp benefits. Unsafe \nand inoperative heating systems can pose serious problems, including \nfires, monoxide poisoning, and other life-threatening hazards. This \namendment is designed in part to prevent people in my State, and across \nthe country, from being forced to choose between eating, and heating, \nwhen their furnace breaks down or their home needs to be weatherized to \nprotect them from severe cold. It is designed to allow them to make \ntheir homes safe and habitable, and protect their families from the \ncold, when faced with these immediate and urgent needs. Of necessity, \nmy State has a strong and vital weatherization program, though efforts \nto slash LIHEAP funding over the years have required them to scale back \nsubstantially the services they can provide and the numbers of \nMinnesotans they can serve. Vastly more people in my State are eligible \nfor LIHEAP than can be served in any given year. And these are very \nlow-income people, including many seniors on fixed incomes. More than \ntwo-thirds of LIHEAP households have annual incomes less than $8,000; \nmore than one-half have incomes below $6,000. Further, the average \nLIHEAP recipients spend 18.4 percent of their income on energy, \ncompared with 6.7 percent for all households.\n  While there are other provisions of the Food Stamp Act which could be \nconstrued to exclude lump sum payments for things like emergency \nfurnace repairs and replacement, and weatherization, I wanted to make \ncertain that an explicit exclusion was contained in this bill for these \nkinds of expenses, to avoid any potential confusion or ambiguity on \nthis matter down the road. I appreciate the support of Senator \nFeingold, and his work on this amendment, and I am grateful that my \ncolleagues from Indiana and Vermont are willing to accept the \namendment.\n  Very simply, then, my amendment makes explicit an exclusion for \ncertain State and Federal energy assistance payments, including those \nmade to repair or replace broken furnaces, or to \n\n[[Page S 13574]]\nweatherize homes by weatherstripping leaky windows and doors, by \ninstalling insulation, or by taking other steps as necessary to protect \nfamilies from the cold. By excluding from income measurement all such \none-time repair or weatherization payments, as distinguished from \nregular, ongoing LIHEAP utility payments, from\n the calculation of eligibility for food stamp benefits, of course I do \nnot intend to have counted as income assistance payments made in \nsituations where a family's furnace may need repair more than once in a \nwinter, or may need certain types of weatherization more than once in a \nyear. It is basically to exclude from income calculation energy \nassistance payments or allowances that are occasional and urgent, like \na furnace repair, not those which are regular and ongoing, like a \nregular LIHEAP subsidy.\n\n  It is very simple, and will ensure that families are not, by a quirk \nof the bureaucratic rules, forced off the food stamp rolls because \ntheir furnace explodes, or goes off in the middle of a dark, cold \nnight, and they replace it with help from LIHEAP. This amendment will \nprevent this bizarre result. When it is 30 degrees below zero, Mr. \nPresident--not uncommon in my State--that is a real emergency. And it \nmust be dealt with immediately. We should make sure we do not build \ninto the system disincentives for people to get furnaces fixed in a \ncrisis, or incentives for elderly people or parents to risk themselves \nand their families in dangerous situations with unventilated space \nheaters or other hazards, simply because they are unable to afford, for \nexample, modest furnace repairs.\n  As my colleagues from cold-weather States know, furnace repair and \nreplacement can be very expensive, often costing several thousand \ndollars. This large and unexpected expense should not knock otherwise \neligible families off the food stamp rolls simply because they need \nhelp for LIHEAP. We do not want to have people heating their kitchens \nwith their stoves, or with leaky and dangerous kerosene space heaters, \nor with charcoal grills--all of which is done--because they could not \nafford to get their heat turned back on, or their furnace repaired or \nreplaced, in the face of bitter cold weather. Each winter we read in \nthe papers of people who die in such tragic situations. We must do all \nwe can to ensure that does not happen, and this amendment takes another \nstep in that direction.\n  Finally, let me say that I am still very concerned about the impact \nof the general provision in this bill, which repeals altogether the \nexclusion for ongoing, regular LIHEAP fuel subsidies for food stamp \ncalculations, on thousands of people in my State. In Minnesota, LIHEAP \ndoes not even come close to paying the average $1,800-$2,000 costs of \nheating a home in the winter; people are still carrying most of these \ncosts. But this particular amendment is crafted more narrowly, to meet \nthe objections of those who insist that the general LIHEAP exclusion \nfor food stamps be repealed outright. It is designed to make explicit \nan exclusion for that narrow category of energy assistance payments \nthat are for the purposes I have described. I believe it is a real \nimprovement to the bill, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that this amendment offered \nby my colleague from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] is being accepted, and \nam proud to join him as an original co-sponsor. I believe that this \namendment clarifies the bill to specifically exclude one-time capital \nimprovement payments for home weatherization or repair or replacement \nof unsafe and inoperative heating and cooling equipment from counting \nas income when figuring food stamp benefits.\n  Under the Dole proposal as originally drafted there may have been \nambiguity as to whether LIHEAP moneys received by individuals for one-\ntime capital improvements count as income when figuring food stamp \nbenefits. With this amendment, it is clear that this bill does not \nintend to affect such payments. LIHEAP is perhaps best known as the \nprogram that assists eligible individuals by subsidizing a portion of \nthe costs of their home utility bills. However, as many in this body \nwhose States have active LIHEAP programs are aware, LIHEAP moneys are \nalso used by States, such as my home State of Wisconsin, in emergency \nsituations to purchase new home heating and cooling devices and to \nweatherize homes.\n  My State is involved in two capital improvement programs funded by \nLIHEAP. Participants in these two programs would have been dramatically \naffected by the underlying bill if it were not amended. About $5.9 \nmillion of the LIHEAP grant funds received by my State of Wisconsin, \nabout 15 percent of the total received, are combined with State funds \nand other Federal funds from the Department of Energy's weatherization \nprogram into a pool to conduct audits of eligible homes for one-time \nweatherization improvements, such as window replacement and weather \nstripping. At the same time these home weatherization audits are being \nundertaken, the State might also act to replace or repair a furnace \nwhich is found to be in disrepair. In fiscal year 1994, the last full \nyear for which data are available, 5,800 homes were audited in \nWisconsin, and of those 1,600 had their heating systems replaced.\n  In addition, the LIHEAP program in my State keeps $1 million in \nreserve, which it matches with oil overcharge funds, to conduct \nemergency activities in homes that it has not audited under its more \nroutine audit program. In fiscal year 1994, 1,440 dangerous or \ninoperative furnaces were repaired or replaced on an emergency basis. \nThis past summer, Mr. President, it was this program that responded to \nthe blistering heat in the upper Midwest that claimed the lives of so \nmany this summer.\n  This amendment is very simple, and I believe it makes a substantive \nimprovement in the underlying proposal. Someone should not become \nineligible for food stamps in a given program year, Mr. President, \nbecause their furnace breaks and the price of a new furnace, paid for \nby the LIHEAP program, would push them out of the eligible income \nbracket. Furnaces are extremely costly purchases for anyone, Mr. \nPresident. Even an average middle class Wisconsin family would have to \nbudget in order to afford to replace one. Last year, the average cost \nof a new furnace provided by the LIHEAP program was $2,000. This \nexpense could bump people on the margins out of the program, while \ntheir living standard, except for the fact that they may have averted \nboth a house fire and personal injury by replacing their furnace, does \nnot change at all.\n  I joined with my colleague from Minnesota because I am concerned that \nthe counting of one-time LIHEAP payments as income may create a \ndisincentive among food stamp recipients to undertake needed emergency \nrepair activities. Some have argued throughout the debate on welfare \nreform that individuals receiving food stamp, AFDC, and other benefits \nmake behavioral decisions that affect their benefit level. By their \nnature, Mr. President, these capital improvements are often unplanned \nand unpredictable. Every Senator in this body should be sensitive to \nthe fact that sometimes the furnace just stops working, and these \nfamilies, as hard as they might be working and trying to comply with \nthe program as proposed, simply would not have the extra funds on hand \nto cover the repair. We should be very mindful of that fact that as \nindividuals begin to move from welfare to work, as proposed by the \nmeasure before us, they are generating the primary support for them and \ntheir families--not savings. Without LIHEAP support there may be no \nother source of funds to act in these emergency situations.\n  While I am concerned about including LIHEAP utility bill subsidies as \nadditions to income, I understand that excluding these rate subsidy \npayments would be a very controversial proposal. In my State, as in \nmany others, LIHEAP never pays the whole heating bill. The amount of \nthe bill paid ranges from 18.5 to 72 percent of the total, the \nindividual always has the responsibility to pay a portion of the bill. \nBecause they pay a portion, recipients are encouraged to conserve and \nto maintain a responsible payment schedule. As it is, Mr. President, in \nmy home State of Wisconsin, the average LIHEAP household heating fuel \ncost is 10.6 percent of the recipient's total income, and after \nreceiving assistance it is 5.7 percent of income; the average Wisconsin \ncitizen's household heating fuel cost is 2.6 percent of their income. \n\n[[Page S 13575]]\n\n  To address the concerns that some have about the LIHEAP utility bill \nsubsidy, however, this amendment is narrowly crafted to just address \nthe issue of one-time LIHEAP payments. I believe that for safety \nreasons this amendment is also justified. As my colleagues know, old \nfurnaces are extremely dangerous, as are the alternatives, such as \nspace heaters. In crisis situations, my State LIHEAP program informs \nme, individuals resort to a whole host of heating techniques, including \nusing charcoal grills indoors and relying on an electric or gas stove \nas a primary heat source. Despite the fact that this is 1995, Mr. \nPresident, 4 percent of Wisconsin LIHEAP program homes, or 5,720 \nhouseholds, are still wood heated, and 10 percent are trailer housing \ndependent upon propane tanks for their heat, another 14,300 households. \nAdditionally, there is the concern of in-home carbon monoxide poisoning \nwhich, according to an article in the New York Times on May 14, 1995, \nsends 5,000 people each year to the emergency room with nonfatal \nillnesses and claims the lives of 250 people annually.\n  I think, Mr. President, that just as some in this body believe it \nwould be a failed reform of the welfare system to continue to encourage \npeople on the margins to engage in certain behaviors to increase their \nbenefits, it would also be a failed reform if we were to encourage \nunsafe behavior by individuals for fear of losing benefits. This \namendment avoids the classic heat or eat dilemma by clarifying that the \nSenate does not intend for one-time energy improvement payments to \ncount as income, and I am pleased that it will be added to the \nunderlying measure.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have made a lot of progress in \nthe last hour, hour and a half. We have taken a lot of amendments, and \nI think right now I understand some of our colleagues are negotiating \ncertain aspects of the bill. It is my understanding the Democratic \nleader would like to have us at this point have a quorum call so we \nwould not be engaged in any--unless somebody wished to speak. We do not \nwant any rollcall votes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent that the two amendments that \nwere laid aside yesterday, the Faircloth amendment No. 2608 and the \nDaschle amendment No. 2672, be considered in order postcloture under \nthe same restraints as previously agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and \nmyself and some others held a press conference this morning to talk \nabout Medicare and the plan that is to be unveiled by Speaker Gingrich, \nSenator Dole, and others to cut spending on Medicare. It was \ninteresting, at the press conference the first question that was asked \nafter a presentation was by a reporter, who said to Congressman \nGephardt: ``Speaker Gingrich just indicated today in his remarks that \nyou lied; he, on three occasions, said you, Congressman Gephardt, lied \nabout a portion of the Medicare debate.''\n  I thought to myself when the reporter asked that question, it is an \ninteresting technique, again, to see if maybe the story for the next \nday will be about someone calling someone else a liar in their \nresponse, as opposed to the issue of what is going to happen with \nrespect to Medicare. That is what most of us are concerned about. These \ndebates should never be about the question of lying; the debate ought \nto be about truth. And the issue of truth and the question of Medicare \nis a very simple proposition.\n  I am going to offer on the next bill that comes to the floor of the \nSenate, which will be the appropriations bill on Commerce, State, \nJustice, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is going to be very \nsimple. I do not happen to think, by the way, we ought to have a tax \ncut proposal on the floor of the Senate at this point because I think \nuntil we get the budget balanced in this country, we ought not to be \ntalking about tax cuts. But it is going to say if the majority party \nbrings a tax cut to the floor of the Senate, that they limit that tax \ncut to those earning $100,000 or less, and use the savings from that--\nas opposed to the current proposal, which will give the bulk of the \nbenefits to the most affluent in America--use the savings from that to \nreduce the proposed cuts in Medicare.\n  I want to ask people to vote on that because I think the question is, \nis it not a fact, no matter how much you try to tiptoe, dance, dodge, \nor weave, that the $270 billion proposed cuts in Medicare are designed \nin order to try to accommodate and accomplish a $245 billion tax cut, \nthe bulk of which will go to the wealthiest Americans? The answer to \nthat is clearly yes.\n  We were told earlier this year by the majority party, who advanced \nthe $270 billion proposal to reduce Medicare funding, that they would \nprovide details later. Today was the day to provide the details, and we \nhave discovered that there really are not details that they want to \ndisclose because those details will be enormously troublesome.\n  I indicated this morning that it is very hard for elephants to walk \non their tiptoes. It is very hard to tiptoe around the details of a \nMedicare reduction of $270 billion and what it means to senior \ncitizens, many of whom live on very, very modest incomes and who will, \nas a result of this, receive less health care and pay more for it. Why? \nSo that some of the wealthiest Americans can enjoy a tax cut.\n  I think we ought to start over. I do not think we ought to have \nleadership calling anybody else liars. We ought to start over and talk \nabout truth. The truth is this country is deep in debt. We ought to \nbalance the budget before anybody talks about big tax cuts. It may well \nbe very popular to be for tax cuts. But it seems to me that it is the \nright thing to be for balancing the budget. We had a debate about \nwhether we should put that in the Constitution. We do not have to put \nthat in the Constitution. All you have to do is balance the budget by \nchanging revenue and expenditure approaches to provide a balance.\n  So I hope we will start over and decide no tax cut until the budget \nis balanced. When we deal with Medicare, as we must in order to make \nthe adjustments necessary to keep it solvent for the long term, let us \ndo that outside of the issue of whether the savings from Medicare \nshould finance tax cuts. The answer to that is obvious. Of course, it \nshould not finance a tax cut. Whatever we do to Medicare ought to be \ndone to make it financially solvent for the long term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13575-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13575-S13576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me attend to one other item as long as \nthe Senate is waiting on the welfare reform bill.\n  I would like to comment on the issue of the farm bill. We had some \ncomments yesterday by the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nin which the chairman indicated that it was very difficult, if not \nimpossible, to get a majority on the Senate Agriculture Committee to \nvote for some kind of a farm bill.\n  What is happening is that it is becoming evident to everyone that \nsome have painted themselves into a corner on this question of \nagriculture. The proposed $14 billion cut in agriculture is way beyond \nwhat agriculture should bear in cuts. I have supported budget \n\n[[Page S 13576]]\ncuts in agriculture and will support them again this year. But a $14 \nbillion cut has now put the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee in a \nposition where they cannot write a decent farm bill, and they know it. \nThe chairman of the House Agriculture Committee now comes out with a \nproposal he calls the Freedom of the Farm Act. It is a white flag of \nsurrender saying we understand we cannot finance a farm program, so let \nus forget it.\n  There is a much better way to do this. You can provide a better \nsupport price, a decent safety net for family-sized farms, and you can \ndo it at the same time that you save the taxpayers $5 billion in the \ncoming 7 years by targeting farm program support prices or that safety \nnet for the family farmers, targeting it to family-sized farms. A \nnumber of us have been working on that. We have developed some plans \nwhich we will be announcing.\n  But our point is to say to family farmers, at least if there are \nthose who are surrendering on the issue of whether or not they think \nfamily farms are important to their country's future, that many of us \nwill not surrender on that. It seems to us that this country is best \nserved by nurturing and protecting a network of family-sized farms in \nour country to produce Americans' foodstuffs.\n  We have for many, many years understood that the development and the \nmaintenance of family farms nurture a lot of what is good in this \ncountry. Where do you find better family values than on family farms \nthat nurture our small towns and, through migration, nurture our \ncities? It seems to me that the genesis of all of that starts out on \nthe farm in our country, and we ought to decide that it is worth \nkeeping.\n  It is worth keeping a farm program that provides some safety net for \nthe only people left in this country who, first of all, do not know \nwhen they plant a seed whether they will get a crop. So they risk all \nthat money at the front end. And then they do not know, if they get a \ncrop, whether they will get a price. So you have twin risks which \nfamily-size farms simply cannot overcome unless we have some basic \nsupport price or some kind of a safety net.\n  In the coming days, I hope others will become aware as well that you \ncannot write a farm program that helps and nurtures a future for family \nfarmers with the $14 billion that is now proposed in reductions. You \ncan do it in a thoughtful way with even better price supports than now \nexist for the first increment of production and saving the taxpayers \nsomewhere around $5 billion.

Mr. President, I have become increasingly concerned \nabout the direction that our drug policy is taking. Not only has the \npresent administration largely retreated on doing something meaningful \nto deal with illegal drug use, increasingly some in Congress seem to be \ncatching this indifference. The result has been a steady erosion in our \nefforts to stop the flow of illegal drugs to the United States. Along \nwith the cuts there seems to be an attitude that nothing works. Not \nonly is this belief wrong, it has serious consequences.\n  According to Justice Department figures, there has been a steep \ndecline in our interdiction of cocaine shipments in the past several \nyears. This has resulted in an increase of at least 70 metric tons of \nadditional cocaine on our streets. We have seen a drop in cocaine \nprices while purity has gone up. And now, we are seeing a disturbing \nincrease in heroin imports and a rise in addiction. More seriously, we \nhave seen attitude toward drug use shift among the most at-risk \npopulation--the Nation's young people. In just the last 3 years, \nsurveys of attitudes of high school kids show a shift away from \nregarding drug use as bad, reversing a decade of decline in favorable \nattitudes. Moreover, recent polls indicate that high schoolers \nincreasingly see drug availability and use among their peers as one of \nthe most serious problems that they face.\n  And now we see yet more disturbing news that confirms the trend. The \nrecent Household Survey released by Health and Human Services shows \nthat drug use is on the rise, especially the use of marijuana, after a \ndecade of decline. This is the consequence of President Clinton's drug \nstrategy, which is to replace ``Just Say No'' with ``Just Say \nNothing.'' What is even more disturbing is that the biggest increases \ncoming among junior high and high school aged children. In those aged \n12 to 17, the rate of illegal drug use increased from 6.6 to 9.5 \npercent. Coupled with reported changes in youth attitudes toward drug \nuse, the trend is a sad reflection of what has happened in just a few \nshort years. This age group is the most vulnerable population for \npotential drug use, and this has become the forgotten generation in our \nretreat from the drug issue.\n  Despite what many critics have argued, our counter-drug efforts were \na success. Between 1985 and 1992, overall drug use declined by 50 \npercent, cocaine use by more than 70 percent. These are dramatic \nchanges that reflect a major shift in public attitudes and patterns of \nbehavior. Similar shifts in other areas of public concern--a 50 percent \nreduction in crime, for example--would hardly be regarded as failure. \nYet, this is the way our efforts are commonly portrayed. This \nmisinformation is then used to support decreases in the efforts that\n contributed to this progress. The results of the erosion of our \nefforts can be seen in increased drug use among the young and \ndisturbing changes in attitudes that bode ill for the future.\n\n  This is not a fact lost on the public. While we in Washington seem to \nhave forgotten the issue, the American public has not. A recent poll \nindicates that more than 80 percent of the public regard stopping the \nflow of illegal drugs to the United States as the number one foreign \npolicy concern. In addition, more than 70 percent of the public \nconsistently opposes legalization of illegal drugs. We make a great \nmistake in ignoring our past successes or our present failure to live \nup to our continuing responsibility that we have to do everything in \nour power to combat illegal drug trafficking and use.\n  I have recently become the chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control. I have accepted this responsibility \nbecause I am concerned about the direction, or rather the \ndirectionlessness, of our present efforts. We lack both the practical \nand moral leadership on this issue that are essential to maintaining \nour past successes. We in Congress have a substantial responsibility to \nrepresent the public interest on this issue. We need to insist on \naccountability. I plan to work with other Members of Congress to \noversee the administration's efforts and to insist on consistent, well-\nconceived programs. I intend to work for adequate funding and \nattention, and to remind my colleagues of the continuing need to \nsustain effective counterdrug efforts.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I wish to call the attention of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to a very dramatic episode that just occurred \nwithin the past hour and a half in the Dirksen Building.\n  Just outside my office, a gentleman, a guest--not of mine but a guest \nto the building--had a heart attack, collapsed on the floor, and while \nfalling severely cut his head. And the young women in our office rushed \nout. One of them, a member of my office, is a Girl Scout leader, and \nknows CPR. Loosening the gentleman's necktie, she started CPR, and the \nother member of my staff--my personal secretary, Donna Davis--had the \nforethought to run down the corridor and get Senator Frist, Dr. Frist.\n  Dr. Frist responded immediately--immediately--and went to work on \nthis gentleman, who oddly enough was from Tennessee.\n  (Laughter in the Galleries)\n  Dr. Frist did not check in advance.\n  I discussed this with members of my office, all of whom were out \nthere watching trying to be helpful. They were unanimous in their \npraise and admiration for the manner in which Dr. Frist responded, and \nhe really knew what he was doing. He took complete charge, applied CPR, \nand this gentleman who was out--I mean his heart truly had stopped--to \nthe best of their knowledge was revived because Dr. Frist, Senator \nFrist, responded so quickly. Then the emergency people came, and he was \ntaken over to the hospital where hopefully he will survive.\n  But this was a very, very dramatic occurrence. And I think all of us \nshould have great admiration, respect, and affection for what Dr. Frist \ndid. I am sorry that he is not here to hear these remarks. But we are \nvery, very fortunate to have him in the U.S. Senate--not as the \nSenate's physician, which I am sure we would be glad to have--but there \nis somebody who really knows his business, and responded in a \ntremendous fashion. So I want to praise our colleague, Dr. Frist.\n  I want to praise everybody in my office who called and responded, and \nPatty Parmer and the Girl Scouts. She is a Girl Scout leader. I have \nalways been a fan of the Girl Scouts. And this gives me added respect \nfor that organization because she is a leader. They learn CPR, and it \nundoubtedly contributed to saving this gentleman's life.\n  So there we are, Mr. President. Sometimes we get deeply involved with \n$1 billion here, $1 billion there, and what we are going to do about \nchild care and about maintenance of effort. But there are other things \nthat are very, very important around here. And certainly Dr. Frist, \nSenator Frist, proved his mettle this afternoon.\n  I want to thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, very soon the Senate Labor Committee will \nconvene to consider how to meet the reconciliation instructions \ncontained in the budget resolution approved earlier this year. It will \nmark the seventh set of reconciliation instructions sent to the Labor \nCommittee since 1981.\n  The major entitlement program within the jurisdiction of the Labor \nCommittee is the Stafford Student Loan Program. As a result, it has \nbeen the primary target in each and every reconciliation. Over the \ncourse of the past 14 years, in reconciliation and related deficit \ncontrol measures, we have made almost 50 major changes in the loan \nprogram. Some are prudent and defensible; others were not.\n  While I have played an active role in meeting each of these \ninstructions, I have done so with deep reservations. The primary motive \nin reconciliation is to save money. Unfortunately, determining whether \nor not the change has merit and constitutes good public policy has all \ntoo often been lost.\n  As I have indicated, some of the changes we have made under the \npressures of reconciliation have been good; some have not. In 1981, for \nexample, we imposed a 5-percent origination fee on all loans. Thus, a \nstudent who applied for a $2,000 loan would get only $1,900 but would \nhave to repay the loan as if he or she had received the full $2,000. \nThis was intended to be a temporary measure to save money; it became \npermanent and deserving students were the losers.\n  In 1987, we required State guarantee agencies to return to the \nFederal Government some $250 million in so-called excess reserves. The \nprovision did not produce the expected savings, and it had the very \nadverse effect of endangering the stability and the very existence of \nmany agencies. It proved to be an unwise and unfortunate move.\n  In 1993, in a dramatic departure from the previous reconciliation \nefforts, we took action that actually helped students. In particular, \nthe competition between the new direct student loan program and the \nStafford Loan Program already in place had given students improved \nservices, better rates, lower fees and greater benefits. It would, in \nmy judgment, be a shame to disturb that balance.\n  Earlier this year, we considered the budget resolution that would \nhave required almost $14 billion in student loan cuts over the next 7 \nyears. We brought that down to $4.4 billion, with the passage of the \nSnowe-Simon amendment, which I supported. On final passage, however, I \nvoted against the resolution. I did so because one of my concerns was \nthat it would produce dramatic reductions in a series of very important \nFederal programs, not the least of which was the loan program.\n  When the budget resolution came back to the Senate after conference \nwith the House, most of the gains we made with respect to the Stafford \nLoan Program were lost. We were confronted with having to come up with \nmore than $10 billion in savings in the loan program. As a result, I \nknow that I for one voted against the conference report. I did so \nbecause I believed its passage meant we would make a series of unwise \nand unreasonable cuts in the loan program.\n  Over the past six reconciliations, everyone has been hit. Lenders, \nguarantors, secondary markets, and students--particularly students--\nhave felt the budgetary knife. No one has been immune. All have \nsacrificed.\n  And soon, the loan program will go back to the operating table once \nagain to require cuts so large that everyone will be subject to the \nknife.\n  I have already gone on record opposing any cuts that will affect \nstudents. In particular, I oppose any change in the in-school interest \nsubsidy and any change that might be passed on to students. Students \nare already hard pressed to make ends meet as they pay for a college \neducation. We should not make that situation worse, either while they \nare in school or as they repay their loans after graduation.\n  At the same time, I am also concerned that additional cuts among \n\n[[Page S 13578]]\n  lenders, guarantors, secondary markets, and other program participants \ncould threaten the very stability and the very viability of the entire \nloan program. Adverse changes could well threaten student access to the \nloans they need and must have.\n  Further, I believe we should keep the agreement we reached in \nconference 2 years ago with respect to the direct student loan program. \nMore than anything else, that agreement has worked to the benefit of \nstudents, and it is aid to students that should be our main concern.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make it as clear as I can that enough is \nenough. It is time we left the loan program alone. It is time we \nconsidered changes solely on their merits and not because they appear \nto save sufficient money to meet our meticulous reconciliation \ninstructions. It is time we understood, once and for all, that the best \nway to reduce the deficit which hangs over us is through a strong \neconomy supported by a well educated and well trained work force.\n  I favor bringing the deficit down. We all do. But I do not favor \ndoing that on the backs of those who need our help the most--the \nelderly, the poor, the middle-income wage earner, and I think, most \nimportantly, the students upon whom we must all eventually depend to \nkeep our Nation strong and vibrant. In particular, I do not favor \nmaking cuts in the loan program or other valuable programs just to pay \nfor a tax cut.\n  To my mind, the time has come for us to say no to the instructions \ngiven the Labor Committee. It is time to say no to cuts in the student \nloan program. It is time we took students out of harm's way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we contemplate the compromise by \nwhich we can agree to end the entitlement under the Social Security \nAct, title IV-A for States to receive a share of the costs for \nproviding for dependent children, I would like to share simply for the \nRecord a portion of a letter from Irwin Garfinkel, Alfred Kahn, and \nSheila Kamerman of the Columbia University School of Social Work who \nare so concerned with what we may be doing here, and they write:\n\n       As we are sure you know, a similar madness pervaded the \n     nation at the close of the 19th century. Then, of course, \n     relief policy was--aside from Civil War veterans and their \n     survivors--strictly a state, and in practice, mostly a local \n     responsibility. As a consequence of the severe cutback in \n     relief--\n\n  And here I interpolate that the Charity Organization Society managed \nto get hold of the effective control of local private agencies in many \nparts of the country.\n\n     as a consequence of the severe cutback in relief, we began \n     sending large numbers of children of single mothers to \n     orphanages. The children were referred to as half-orphans. In \n     reaction, 40 states established mothers pensions, the \n     forerunner of ADC. Though we take some comfort from the \n     reaction, our hope--that 100 years later the Nation might be \n     spared another such misbegotten and shameful era before \n     regaining its senses--grow dim.\n\n  I will just repeat that:\n\n       . . . our hope--that 100 years later the Nation might be \n     spared another such misbegotten and shameful era before \n     regaining its senses--grow dim.\n\n  I will say, Mr. President, that what happened in 1935 was that the \nState mothers' pensions were increasingly difficult for the State \ngovernments to maintain, and so they were taken over under the title \nIV-A, Aid to Dependent Children, which was just children at that time.\n  In 1939, the mother was entitled to a benefit, and it became aid to \nfamilies with dependent children, the program we are evidently intent \nupon abolishing and repeating ``a misbegotten and shameful era.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I think earlier today we missed an \nopportunity. It seemingly went by unnoticed when an amendment was \noffered that addressed a very sensitive area and an essential element \nof welfare reform, and that is a recognition that it has become a \nsnowballing effect that a family that has welfare problems, or is on \nthe welfare rolls, quite often the next generation comes down and is \nalso inflicted with this same problem.\n  This was in the amendment offered by Senator Faircloth, No. 2609. I \nregret that it only received 17 votes on the floor of the Senate, and \nyet, I do recognize it is a very sensitive issue to deal with.\n  We have become and found ourselves in a situation in this country \nwhere it is a welfare trap and snares not only current recipients, but \ntheir children as well. Young women who grow up in welfare families are \nmore than twice as likely to receive welfare themselves as their \ncounterparts whose parents received no welfare.\n  I have three very short cases I will identify. These happen to come \nfrom the State of Oklahoma. They will only be identified by the \nindividual's first names.\n  There is Marie, a 43-year-old, has nine kids by five different \nfathers. The mother was on welfare for 30 years. Marie's own daughters \nare unwed teen mothers on welfare.\n  Denise, 29 years old, had her first child at 16. She now has an \nadditional four daughters, all born under the welfare system. Both her \nsisters are unwed welfare mothers with eight children.\n  Jacqueline, 37 years old, a mother at 15. She was born to a welfare \nfamily of 12 children. Her unwed daughter had four illegitimate \nchildren by the time she was 20.\n  Out-of-wedlock births and single parenthood are quickly becoming a \nnormal lifestyle in this country. I am not sure that the Faircloth \namendment was worded quite properly, but at least it did address a very \nserious problem that we are going to have to, sooner or later, address \nin this body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13578-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13578-S13579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ABANDONING A COMMITMENT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, early today--well, at 10 o'clock this \nmorning--we were to have commenced a series of votes that had been \nagreed on yesterday. There was, necessarily, a delay as Members on the \nother side were at a meeting with their House counterparts on, I \nbelieve, Medicare. We had a half an hour in which to talk about \nwhatever came to mind.\n  I took the occasion to read a passage from the first page of the New \nYork \n\n[[Page S 13579]]\nTimes which described the White House as ``exceedingly eager to support \na law that promises to change the welfare system,'' which is to say \nabolish title IV-A, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.\n  It went on to say the White House was ``sending increasingly friendly \nsignals about the bill.''\n  This is a bill which three professors at the Columbia School of \nSocial Work, including the revered Alfred Kahn, said would recreate the \nturn-of-the-century era in which the children of single mothers were \nreferred to as ``half orphans'' and sent to orphanages.\n  In reaction, 40 States established mothers' pensions, the forerunner \nof aid to dependent children. The 1935 legislation created aid to \ndependent children. In 1939 the mother was entitled to a benefit, hence \nfamily with dependent children.\n  They said, ``It is our hope that 100 years later the Nation might be \nspared another such misbegotten and shameful era.''\n  Mr. President, I spoke this morning not only about the New York Times \nthis morning but rather of yesterday's statement, a statement by Rahm \nEmanuel, a White House spokesman, who said as the bill headed toward a \nvote on final passage, Rahm Emanuel, a White House spokesman said it \nwas ``moving in the right direction.'' ``Moving in the right \ndirection,'' is moving in the direction of the misbegotten and shameful \nera which took place at the turn of the century from which we gradually \nrecovered our senses.\n  I have since been in touch with the White House. I have talked to \npersons there and asked, can it be that this is the disposition of the \nWhite House? I am told that, yes, Mr. Emanuel, who I believe was the \nfundraiser for the 1992 Presidential campaign of Mr. Clinton and then \nwas political director in the White House, that he is in charge of this \nmatter now and that it is his view that the Democratic Party should \nabandon its commitment 60 years in place--a commitment Republican \nPresidents have been just as firm in--to a Federal provision of aid to \ndependent children.\n  Mr. President, Rahm Emanuel is of that view, and obviously he is, he \ndoes not disguise it. I wonder about what other political advice he is \ngiving in the White House.\n  I will not speculate. I will state my alarm. No one can foresee the \nfuture. I do not. Yet we have seen something like this happen before. I \ncan say again, when Irwin Garfinkel, Alfred Kahn, and Sheila Kamerman \nrefer to the possibility that ``100 years later the Nation might be \nspared another such misbegotten and shameful era before regaining \nsenses,'' they say that hope grows dim.\n  If this is the advice the President is getting, that hope is dim, \nindeed. I say this with great reluctance, Mr. President, but something \nof great importance, in my view, is at stake. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13578-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Madam President, I will take advantage of this time while \nwe are waiting here. Let me explain. People are wondering what is going \non--I have a podium in front of me and papers in front of me. I am \nprepared at some point to offer an amendment on child care. We had one \nvote already several days ago and made an effort here to try to come to \nsome accommodation, a compromise position on child care. That may still \nhappen. I was hopeful that the arrangement put together would work--and \nit may still work.\n  I am prepared to offer the amendment. I have been here on the floor \nnow for virtually the last 2\\1/2\\, 3 days, trying to find a compromise. \nI am trying hard to find a welfare reform package I can vote for. I \nmean that very sincerely and deeply. I think the President would like \nto have a bill he could sign. And largely what happens, I suppose, in \nthe next couple of hours might determine whether or not we will have a \nbipartisan bill.\n  My own view, Madam President--I will not take a lot of time here \nbecause people have heard this debate on numerous occasions in days \npast, weeks past, months past. Senator Hatch of Utah and I offered, \nback some 6 or 7 years ago, the child care and development block grant \nbill, which became the law of the land in 1990. Five years ago, we \nprovided child care assistance to people in the country, particularly \nto the working poor families to keep them off welfare and allow them to \nwork. It allowed them to get some child care assistance--it does not \ntake care of everybody--it provides some help to some people. There are \nlong waiting lists in many States for this assistance. In fact, I \nrecall now--having recited these statistics so many times, I can almost \ncall them State by State.\n  As the presiding officer is from the great State of Texas, I think \nthe waiting list in Texas is about 20,000 people. In the State of \nGeorgia, it is 41,000 people. The numbers are in that range. And the 36 \nStates that keep data on child care slots--not every State keeps \nwaiting lists--but 36 States tell us that they have long lists. There \nis a tremendous need and demand out there.\n  Again, I think the central point of the Dole welfare reform bill is, \nof course, to get people from welfare to work. And again I think most \npeople accept the fact that 60 percent of the people on welfare have \nchildren under the age of 5. Of the 14 million people on welfare, 5 \nmillion are adults, 9 million or 10 million are children. So what we \nare talking about here is a simple enough notion; that is, to provide \nsome sort of a safe setting for children as we move their parent or \nparents into the work force.\n  To do that requires resources. We are told by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services that to fill the 165-percent increase in \ndemand that would occur as a result of the bill that the majority \nleader has presented to us, it would require some $6 billion over 5 \nyears to accommodate that demand.\n  I offered an amendment in that amount a few days ago. It failed by a \nsingle vote here. Then, over the last 2\\1/2\\ days, in consultations \nwith interested parties here--and I will not go into names of people--\nwe were able to work out a compromise, a bipartisan compromise, on the \nissue. The compromise \n\n[[Page S 13580]]\nreduced the $6 billion by several billions of dollars, which would mean \nthat we would not meet the full demand, based on the assessments that \nhad been made, but would provide a pool of money for States. This would \nmean that Connecticut, Texas, New York, and other States would have a \npool of resources to assist in the very legitimate issue of how you \nmove people from welfare to work.\n  Now, the bill requires that we move 25 percent of all welfare \nrecipients to work in the first 2 years, and 50 percent by the year \n2000. That will place great demands on States to make that transition. \nIf they cannot meet the demands, of course, they face penalties in the \nbill. It probably would be less expensive for most States to pay the \npenalty than actually to comply with the law. I made that rough \ncalculation. I think it is a common interest of ours to achieve \ncompliance with the requirements.\n  To achieve compliance, you need to have some training for these \npeople. But most people would agree, if you had to pick one issue, one \nissue that is critical for moving welfare recipients to work, it is \nchild care. Every survey of people on public assistance, that asks what \nare the greatest obstacles to moving from welfare to work, cite as the \nnumber one obstacle the lack of child care. In every survey that I have \nseen in the last decade or more, that is the single most important \nissue, and I think with complete justification. You need not have ever \nbeen on public assistance or even have had family members on assistance \nto understand this issue. Anyone with young children, regardless of \ntheir economic status, who works or desires to work, understands \ncompletely the anxiety that another person would feel when going to \nwork without some safe, adequate place to leave their children. It is \njust unrealistic to assume that you can reasonably move someone from \nwelfare to work without accommodating that need.\n  Now, it can be accommodated in a variety of ways. No one is arguing \nthat if there are grandparents or aunts or uncles or older children--\nthere may be a variety of ways to reach that need. I think most would \nagree that those arrangements will not work in every case. You are \ngoing to have to have some other system in place. If it were not true, \nthen you would not have the waiting lists I described already with \nliterally thousands of children on those waiting lists to find an \nadequate child-care place.\n  So, Madam President, I will, at an appropriate time, offer, or try to \noffer, an amendment on this issue. It may be defeated. I hope it will \nnot. I made an honest and sincere effort to compromise, as I believe \nthe very rationale for this institution is to bring people of different \npoints of view together and try to find some common ground on issues.\n  I really know of no one arguing, no one saying we should not do \nanything about child care. Most people agree we should do something \nabout it. It is how we do it and what means we use. I have tried to \ncome up with an answer here that would accommodate the Governors, the \nneeds of the States, and obviously the very people that we are going to \nbe asking to make that transition in the law.\n  So, I will offer the amendment at an appropriate time. If it is \ndefeated, we will move on, I guess, to other amendments. I hope that \nwill be the case, that we will not be talking about pulling down the \nbill or other suggestions that may be made. It is a difficult issue. \nThe Senator from New York knows better than all of us put together, as \nhe has talked about so eloquently on numerous occasions,\n dismantling 60 years of social policy in a matter of hours.\n\n  So the fact that this is taking a little longer may be troublesome to \nsome people. Frankly, were it to be done in haste, it would even be, I \nthink, more dangerous. I am hopeful that we can adopt an amendment in \nthis area. I would like to be a part of an agreement. That is my \ndesire. That has been my intention. There is no other purpose behind \nthis.\n  I have been involved in the issue of child care for more than 10 \nyears. Going back to the 1980's, I felt it was a legitimate issue that \nneeded to be raised for a whole host of reasons. In the midst of this \ndebate, it is a critical issue. In the absence of it, it is impossible \nto call this reform in any way. We should not literally turn our back \non the needs of these 10 million children out there.\n  As I said a moment ago, of the 14 million people in this country on \nwelfare, with all of the rhetoric and language we use in the most \nvirulent terms to describe them, we should remind ourselves that 10 \nmillion of the 14 million we are talking about are infants and \nchildren, who in most cases, through no fault of their own, as the \nSenator from New York pointed out, are in this world.\n  The question becomes, if no one else will help try and take care of \nthem, shouldn't someone? And if that someone has to be us, I do not \nknow any reason why we should shrink from that responsibility as we try \nto break this cycle.\n  I see my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I simply endorse everything the \nSenator has said, and add a further point. We have a choice in this \nlegislation. We can have child care or we can have orphanages. I think \nchild care is the least expensive option, but you do not know how bad \nan orphanage might be.\n  We are not just at the end of 60 years of social policy. A century \nago, in response to the matter of sending half-orphans, as they were \nknown, to orphanages that some 40 States, beginning in Wisconsin, began \nmothers' pensions. The States found it difficult to maintain them in \nthe midst of the Depression, and they were incorporated into the Social \nSecurity Act as aid to dependent children.\n  That is the issue before us, as best one can tell, although one can \nnever tell the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I see the distinguished \nRepublican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime, first of all, to commend my friend and colleague for the efforts \nthat have been made over the period of the past 2 days. I welcome the \nopportunity to cosponsor the amendment; I welcome the chance to join \nwith others in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  When you look over the record and realize that this initial \namendment, which was the $11 billion over 5 years, just failed by two \nvotes, the efforts by Senator Dodd to cut that back by several billions \nof dollars in an attempt to try and reach out and make this a \nbipartisan effort is really in the tradition of this body.\n  It is troublesome to many who recognize that under the Dole proposal \nthere is not a single cent dedicated to child care, not a single cent \nthat is actually dedicated.\n  So we have seen a significant reduction in the proposal and a very \nextended effort to try and incorporate many of our friends and \ncolleagues on the other side who, over a long period of their own \ncareers, have been absolutely committed to child care and who are \ncommitted to child care at this time.\n  I want to indicate to our friends and colleagues, really on both \nsides, that his efforts to try and ensure this was going to be a \nbipartisan effort and consistent with the exigencies of the budget \nconsideration has been absolutely an honorable effort and in the best \ntraditions of the Senate.\n  Let me just say, I look forward to supporting that proposal because I \ndo think that upon reflection, in spite of what is talked about in the \nback rooms about whether I will vote or whether I will not, that when \npeople are faced with this issue of trying to take a small but \nmeaningful step forward on child care will recognize the importance of \ntheir vote in a very significant piece of legislation and will \nultimately support the Dodd proposal. That would certainly be my hope, \nso that we could move on to some of the other issues.\n  Finally, Madam President, I do not think there is any Member of this \nbody who has children--and so many of us are blessed to have them--who \nwould possibly think of starting a day without knowing their \nwhereabouts and knowing about their safety and knowing about their \nsecurity, knowing about their well-being. \n\n[[Page S 13581]]\n\n  I think all of us in this body are fortunate enough to have a day-\ncare center that was developed in a bipartisan way in the Congress. We \nhave the kind of day care available for employees of the Senate that we \nare denying to so many others who are attempting to work for a great \ndeal less than we are receiving, in terms of salaries, trying to make \nends meet.\n  We hear a great deal, as we did in the early part of the year, \nWashington does not get it because the laws we pass we do not apply to \nourselves. Remember that? We went through a whole discussion and debate \nabout that. And we should apply the laws that we pass for others to \nourselves.\n  But the other shoe fits, too, and that is what we do for ourselves we \nmight think about doing for others. What we have done is afforded the \nchild care program, and now we are being asked to try and move people \noff welfare and basically avoid the fundamental commitment of trying to \nprovide some child care to those individuals.\n  As Senator Dodd and Senator Moynihan understand very completely, that \nprogram just will not work. That just will not work. The idea that you \nare going to be able to take these resources, which is flat funding \nover a period of time, when about 85 percent of those resources are \nbeing used for benefits, and think that you are going to be able to \nscrape some funding out for child care, I think, does not hold water.\n  We have seen very little indication, given what has happened in the \nStates, as the Senators from Connecticut and New York have pointed out, \nthat is happening today and why we ought to expect it to happen in the \nfuture.\n  So, Mr. President, this is really about the priority of children. \nEvery day so many speeches are made about children and about the most \nvulnerable. We have an opportunity to address those needs with the Dodd \namendment. I think all of us should be impressed by the seriousness of \nthe redressing of this issue.\n  It has been as a result of a long, painstaking, tireless effort by \nthe sponsor of this amendment to try and broaden out and to work this \nprocess in a way that would have bipartisan support and would make a \nvery important and significant improvement in the legislation. I am \nhopeful that when it is offered, that it will succeed. I think this \nwill certainly be one of the most important votes that we will have in \nthis session.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have heard some speeches on the floor \nof the Senate and this ranks right up there. I do not know how you \nsay--when the leader here is negotiating, in good faith, to in fact add \nmore money into the child care fund--that somehow or another we are \ndenying the fact that we need child care, and have Members on the other \nside who insist on having their name sketched next to the child care \nmoney, to throw out an agreement to do just that. I think that is not \ncooperation by any stretch of the imagination.\n  To also suggest that somehow we provide day care for workers here in \nthe U.S. Congress and that we are not willing to do so in the welfare \nbill--maybe the Senator does not know it, but the people who have \nchildren in day care pay for that with the hard-earned dollars that \nthey work for.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I will not yield. They work for it with their hard-\nearned dollars. What you are suggesting is to give money to people to \ngo to work, to give them child care to go to work.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I will not yield. The fact of the matter is that \nwhat the Senator from Connecticut is doing is trying to block an \nagreement from happening by insisting on an amendment on day care, \nwhich we are willing to sit--and have been for hours--and try to put \ntogether.\n  I am hopeful that we can get through the partisanship on this and \nmove forward in a bipartisan way. And I know there are many Members on \nthe other side of the aisle that want to work in a bipartisan fashion \nto get this bill through, to get day care money funded, because it is a \nsincere interest, I know, of the leader and of other Members on our \nside to get this legislation through with additional day care funds.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We will and have been working. I object to the fact \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts stands up and says we are giving \nfree day care here in the Congress, and we are providing it for our \nfolks when, in fact, they pay for that day care, and that we are \nunwilling to give it to people on welfare, when, in fact, we are going \nto be giving day care to people on welfare.\n  I just think you are mixing who is paying for what. The fact of the \nmatter is, people working here paying for their day care are paying \ntaxes to subsidize the people that we want to provide day care for \nunder the welfare bill. Let us get it straight.\n  I am willing, as other Members on this side are, to put some more \nmoney in for day care so that people can get off of welfare. But do not \ntry to suggest that somehow we are providing perks to Members here that \nwe are unwilling to give on welfare. Exactly the opposite is the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13579-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13581-S13617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest as soon as it has been cleared by the Democratic leader. I \nintend to finish this bill today one way or the other, even if there is \nnot going to be a welfare bill. We have been at this for several hours \nin good faith. In the offer we made, which was rejected by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, there is, over 5 years, $3 billion. I think his \namendment was 5----\n  Mr. DODD. That was not the offer.\n  Mr. DOLE. We just changed it. He had $5.7 billion over 5 years. We \nsaid, OK, we will go more than halfway, to $3 billion over 5 years.\n  Mr. DODD. That is the first time this Senator heard that offer.\n  Mr. DOLE. My view is that is what the Senator wanted.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to look at that. We can put in a quorum \ncall. I say that with all due respect to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. We changed it about an hour ago. As I understand it, it is \nmore than halfway to where the Senator was with his amendment the other \nday. We checked it with some others, and they think this is a very \ngenerous, responsible offer. That would be $8 billion over 5 years set \naside for child care\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield. We know each other very well, \nand I just say that offer was not presented to me. I would not say that \nif it were not the case.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then I will present it to you now.\n  Mr. DODD. Let us put in a quorum call and see if we can get the \ndetails.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not think we have a problem here.\n  Mr. DODD. We may not.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have taken care of maintenance of effort and the job \ntraining. We are going to make it freestanding, under a time agreement. \nAnd contingency grant funds, which we did not have in our bill, was \nsponsored by the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine. He thought about \n$530 million was appropriate. We made it $1 billion. So if some State \nhas a calamity, they do not have to pay it back. We kept the loan funds \nof $1.7 billion, and we have accepted some of the triggers suggested. \nThe work bonus program, that has been done.\n  On the vouchers, we have not reached an agreement, but we have \nincreased the hardship exemption in the bill from 15 to 20 percent. We \nhave added $75 per year for abstinence education, which has broad \nsupport. And program evaluation, of interest to the Senator from New \nYork, and others, $20 million to evaluate the program. If that is not \nenough, we can raise it to $25 million.\n  I talked to Dick Nathan, who suggested that amendment; he is a well-\nrespected academic. Food stamps, which we have discussed with the \nDemocratic leader, has certain escape hatches. We do not think it \npunishes anybody.\n  We think it is a good package, and we think we can complete this \nwhole bill in a couple of hours.\n  Mr. DODD. If the majority leader will yield--and I say this with \ngreat respect \n\n[[Page S 13582]]\nand friendship, because that is the case--the offer presented to me was \n$3 billion over 7 years, along with a check on the financing schemes. I \nsay, in fairness, that in my conversation with the Senator from Utah we \ntalked about this, and I counteroffered with the proposal of $3 billion \nover 5 years. I was told it was rejected.\n  Under the circumstances, let us find out about where we are. If that \nis the case, I am prepared to sit down and take a good hard look at it. \nI was told something different, and that can happen around here as \nthese offers go back and forth. I urge that maybe those involved look \nat the child care piece. I am not as familiar with the other pieces the \nmajority leader described.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will say that the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \ngave me a list of six or seven items yesterday, and we have been able \nto accommodate part of each of those, with the exception of one where \nthere was a time limit. Even there, we increased the percentage on \nexemption, hardship exemption, from 15 to 20 percent, which would cover \nthat concern.\n  If the Democratic leader wishes to speak, I am happy to go over this \nwith the Senator from Connecticut. We believe it is a responsible, \nreasonable effort. I might point out that we only save $5 billion in \nAFDC over 5 years and only $9 billion over 7 years. Total savings in \nthe Senate bill, which are going to be reduced because of some of the \nthings we have agreed to do, over 5 years, is $44 billion; the House \nbill is $75 billion. Over 7 years, ours is $71 billion; the House is \n$122 billion. So there is a vast difference between this and the House \nbill, as far as savings are concerned. We would like to complete action \non this bill and go to conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wonder if we might suggest a quorum \ncall for a brief period of time for us to be able to see if we can \nfinalize some of the understandings as it relates to this agreement.\n  I think there are some misunderstandings here that may be clarified \nthat could accommodate this agreement, even now.\n  I thought we had exhausted all possibilities, but maybe not. If that \nis the case, I think it is worth one more quorum call to see if we can \nresolve it.\n  Mr. HATCH. If leaders would withhold for a second, I think that the \nsettlement on child care is utterly reasonable, something that can \nbring us together.\n  I commend both leaders for trying to bring this about. It is my \nunderstanding that the Hatch language on child care will also be part \nof that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is what we will find out.\n  Mr. DOLE. The fencing will be but I am not sure about anything else.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been in discussion with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader and other colleagues on both sides. I \nthink we have the framework of an agreement. We do not have it drafted. \nNobody has signed off on it finally. But I think in the interest of \ntime it has occurred to me and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nthat maybe those who have outstanding amendments could come to the \nfloor now and offer those amendments, hopefully in a very short period \nof time because we hope to go and will go to third reading hopefully by \nmidnight tonight. But we are going to go to third reading on welfare \nreform between now and sometime, and we would rather do it by midnight \nif we could. I know there are a number of amendments we have looked at \npeople can accept. We will try to be as accommodating as we can with \nour colleagues.\n  But I think that is the view of the distinguished Democratic leader; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur entirely. I think we have gotten \nto the point now where it may just be a matter of a period of time \nbefore we can submit the agreement and have a vote. But this is \nvaluable time we are losing, and I know a lot of Members have come to \nme throughout the day expressing an interest in offering their \namendments. I do not want to preclude them from doing so. I think they \nought to come to the floor.\n  I have agreed that we can go at some point tonight to third reading. \nSo we will finish this bill tonight at some point.\n  So to accommodate Senators who still have amendments, to ensure that \nwe maximize what time we have left, whatever time it is going to take \nbefore we go to third reading, I encourage all of our colleagues to \ncome over if they have amendments.\n  As the distinguished majority leader said, working with our ranking \nmember, who has done a remarkable job--he deserves an award for sitting \nin the Chamber as long as he has--we are ready to go to work. We would \nlike to finish with those amendments that are not part of this \nagreement, and there are many of them. So come to the floor as quickly \nas you can and see if we can resolve these outstanding issues.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Could I just say one word because the Democratic leader \nreminds me we are talking about amendments that would not impact on \nwhat we hope to have as an agreement here, child care--any amendment in \nthe area we are looking at we hope would not be offered. We do not have \nan agreement yet. We hope there is. It may not be possible. So we hope \nMembers would not offer amendments that would affect the agreement we \nhope to achieve.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for yielding. And I ask maybe our \nleader, both leaders actually. A great deal of work has been done, a \nlot of back and forth, and I think a good compromise has potentially \nbeen reached here. I am concerned, as our leader is, that there are a \nlot of other amendments--I do not know whether we have 30, 40 \namendments that are still posted out there, and I am just concerned, is \nit the intent to finish the bill tonight, I ask both leaders?\n  Mr. DOLE. We hope to go to third reading this evening. We hope it is \nthis evening. It may be tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I believe, if the majority leader will yield, in answer \nto the question, having had the chance to look at the amendments, most \nSenators would agree to relatively short time limits, and I do not \nthink there is any reason why we cannot complete work on the remaining \namendments tonight.\n  So I would again encourage Senators because it is 10 minutes to 6. \nThere is some good time left tonight for us to accommodate Senators who \ncome to the floor. And we will see what the list looks like. I expect \nit is going to be a lot less than 40. A number of these amendments will \nfall if they get this agreement. And we will just work through whatever \nremaining amendments Senators wish to offer, but we cannot do that if \nthey do not come to the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is still possible, I might add--I will certainly consult \nthe Democratic leader. One way to eliminate some of the amendments \nwould be with a cloture vote. Of course, you still have 91 amendments, \nbut I think those would all be--there would not be any amendments to \nexpand this program. They would be amendments to limit the program, so \nthey might be good amendments. But we hope if we get some cooperation \nin the next hour or so that would not be necessary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask the majority leader a \nquestion? I certainly, first of all, know there has been a lot of \ndifficult negotiation. And I respect that process very much.\n  But as I have listened to the majority leader, was he saying that \nbuilt into this unanimous-consent agreement would be an understanding \nthat there could be no amendments in the same areas in which you have \nreached agreement with amendments? And if that is the case, then would \nSenators have an opportunity to at least, as opposed to that being \nhammered out back in our offices, have an opportunity to look at what \nthat means?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know without looking at the areas, it is difficult \nto say whether you would agree or not.\n\n[[Page S 13583]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Child care is one thing we are working on. Maintenance of \neffort has already been taken care of.\n  Job training. We have an agreement, if we have an overall agreement, \nto take the job training provisions out of this bill and have a \nfreestanding bill. That agreement has already been reached between \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy. We will take that up sometime \nafter the appropriations bills are done.\n  Contingency grant fund. That is in response to a request by Senator \nDaschle and the Governors and Senator DeWine, and certain things that \nmust happen about matching and when it is triggered.\n  Work bonus. That has been done. Some question about vouchers. We have \nnot reached an agreement on that, but we have agreed to expand the \ncurrent hardship exemption from 15 to 20 percent.\n  Abstinence education; $75 million per year earmarked for abstinence \neducation.\n  Program evaluation was, I guess, a concern of the Senator from New \nYork and others. We authorized $20 million. I think that is adequate. \nIf not, it can be, I assume, adjusted.\n  Then we have been working on a savings provision with reference to \nfood stamps. That has not been agreed to yet.\n  So those are the general areas. There are others that I do not--I \nknow Senator Cohen and Senator Bingaman have an interest in SSI. The \nthing is, we need to find offsets for these. That is what we are trying \nto do this afternoon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could just say to the majority \nleader and the minority leader, if you would be willing to give \nSenators some advance notice as to when you come out with the \nagreement. I would just like to have those areas and just sort of \nunderstand what is in the agreement before agreeing that there would be \nno amendments in this area. I am sure that I would agree to that, but I \nwould just like to know what it is we are talking about since I was not \npart of the actual negotiation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sure we can accommodate the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, pending the arrival of Senators wishing \nto offer amendments, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask the majority leader a \nquestion? I certainly, first of all, know there has been a lot of \ndifficult negotiation. And I respect that process.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Biden of Delaware, I \nask unanimous consent that Peter Jaffe, a detailee on the staff of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, be granted floor privileges for the \nremainder of the 104th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2495, As Modified\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, at this time I call up amendment No. 2495 \nand ask unanimous consent that the amendment be sent to the desk and \nthat it be modified to reflect the language in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 52, lines 4 through 6, strike ``so used, plus 5 \n     percent of such grant (determined without regard to this \n     section).'' and insert ``so used. If the strike does not \n     prove to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such unlawful \n     expenditure was not made by the State in intentional \n     violation of the requirements of this part, then the \n     Secretary shall impose an additional penalty of 5 percent of \n     such grant (determined without regard to this section).''.\n       On page 56, strike lines 11 through 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--The penalties described in paragraphs \n     (2) through (6) of subsection (a) shall apply--\n       ``(A) with respect to periods beginning 6 months after the \n     Secretary issues final rules with respect to such penalties; \n     or\n       ``(B) with respect to fiscal years beginning on or after \n     October 1, 1996;\n     whichever is later.\n       On page 122, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 110A. CORRECTIVE COMPLIANCE PLAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Notification of violation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Federal Government shall, prior to \n     assessing a penalty against a State under any program \n     established or modified under this Act, notify the State of \n     the violation of law for which such penalty would be assessed \n     and allow the State the opportunity to enter into a \n     corrective compliance plan in accordance with this section \n     which outlines how the State will correct any violations for \n     which such penalty would be assessed and how the State will \n     insure continuing compliance with the requirements of such \n     program.\n       (2) 60-day period to propose a corrective compliance \n     plan.--Any State notified under paragraph (1) shall have 60 \n     days in which to submit to the Federal Government a \n     corrective compliance plan to correct any violations \n     described in such paragraph.\n       (3) Acceptance of plan.--The Federal Government shall have \n     60 days to accept or reject the State's corrective compliance \n     plan and may consult with the State during this period to \n     modify the plan. If the Federal Government does not accept or \n     reject the corrective compliance plan during the period, the \n     corrective compliance plan shall be deemed to be accepted.\n       (b) Failure to Correct.--If a corrective compliance plan is \n     accepted by the Federal Government, no penalty shall be \n     imposed with respect to a violation described in subsection \n     (a) if the State corrects the violation pursuant to the plan. \n     If a State has not corrected the violation in a timely manner \n     under the plan, some or all of the penalty shall be assessed.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the amendment does not have to be read, as \nI understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Graham of Florida. This is an amendment that I think \nspeaks to some real need for a common sense approach to the issues of \npenalties that this legislation could burden our States with.\n  This amendment will give some flexibility to the penalty section that \nthe States will be subjected to if they fail to quickly comply with the \nnumerous requirements of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has the support of the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nand the American Public Welfare Association. I would like to take this \nopportunity to publicly thank these fine groups for endorsing and \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Under the bill before us, Mr. President, as the States move to a more \nflexible block grant welfare system--and it appears that that is what \nis going to happen--the States of our Union are going to be subjected \nto harsh, inflexible penalties.\n  These penalties should be designed to encourage States to play by the \nrules, not to injure them for unintentional mistakes made while they \nare trying to recreate their entire welfare systems with very, very \nlimited resources and very little time to do it.\n  This bill states that our States in our Union can be penalized by up \nto 5 percent of their block grant for each of the following violations. \nLet me reiterate, for each of the following violations: If a State, \none, fails to submit a required report--any required report; if a State \nfails to use the income and eligibility verification system; if the \nState fails to comply with the increased paternity establishment and \nchild support enforcement requirements; and if a State fails to meet \nwork participation rates.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that most States will not be \nable to meet these work participation rates in the short time allowed \nby the proposed legislation.\n  These penalties are very, very harsh. They are inflexible, and alone \nthey could add up to 20 percent of a State's block grant.\n  But a State can be penalized an additional 5 percent under this \nproposal for the improper use of funds, even if that misuse is not \nintentional.\n  If I might cite a hypothetical example. If the State of Texas, for \nexample, \n\n[[Page S 13584]]\nunknowingly and by mistake erroneously paid $184 in welfare payments to \na person who has violated his prison parole, the penalties would be as \nfollows, Mr. President: The $184 that was improperly used, that would \nbe a part of the penalty, plus 5 percent of the State's total block \ngrant value which works out to be $25 million in penalties for the \nState of Texas.\n  In addition, the State of Texas would have to use State funds, not \nFederal funds but State funds, to make up this entire penalty. I am \ncertain that this is a classic case of unintended consequences, and I \nfeel very certain, Mr. President, that the authors of the original bill \nhad no intention of penalizing our States in this manner.\n  In short, a State would be penalized in this situation, in this \nhypothetical condition, over $25 million for an unintentional $184 \nviolation, and that is only for one violation, unintentional as it \nmight be.\n  This amendment further solves a problem by applying a penalty of 5 \npercent only--only--if the improper use is judged to be intentional. If \nit is the result of an honest mistake, the State would still have to \nrepay the amount misused, plus an additional amount of State funds to \nmaintain the block grant.\n  An additional part of this amendment gives the State the necessary \ntransition time that the States are going to need to put their welfare \nsystems in place, while not delaying reforms in areas where the State \nis ready to move ahead. It will postpone the penalties of all but \nimproper use of funds until 6 months after Health and Human Services \nissues the final rules. In the absence of final regulations, the States \nthat try to interpret and meet the requirements of a statute in good \nfaith may still be subject to penalties when the details of the law are \nfleshed out by Federal regulations.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the amendment I offer today, once again, in \nbehalf of myself and Senator Graham of Florida, the amendment that we \noffer will allow the States to enter into an agreement with HHS called \na corrective compliance plan which spells out how the State will \nimprove its systems and comply with the requirements of the act.\n  This section of my amendment incorporates many of the ideas that were \nembodied in an earlier amendment by the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. It is similar to a provision in the current law that we now \noperate under. The penalties are suspended as long as the State \ncontinues to follow the plan.\n  If the Secretary of HHS finds that a State is not working to improve \nits system, then the Secretary may impose all or some of the original \npenalties, depending on how much progress that particular State has \nmade.\n  This amendment does not weaken the Federal oversight on States. In \nfact, even with these changes, the penalties on States in this \nlegislation will be far more strict than those penalties in the House \nbill. It is narrowly drawn to be fair. It is drawn to be flexible, and \nit is drawn to meet the test of common sense.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that there are no costs--no \ncosts--associated with this amendment. I am very proud to say that this \namendment has, we believe, bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate. And \nonce again, I wish to thank the American Public Welfare Association, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National \nGovernors' Association for the splendid assistance they have given us \nin preparing this amendment.\n  I also appreciate the understanding shown and hopefully the ultimate \nacceptance of this amendment by not only the majority but also the \nranking manager of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are prepared to accept the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment 2495, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2495), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand, the Senator from Alabama is \nprepared with an amendment, 40 minutes equally divided; the Senator \nfrom Maryland, Senator Mikulski, is prepared to offer her amendment, 20 \nminutes equally divided; the Senator from California would follow the \nSenator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2614\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I think amendment 2614, as drafted, is acceptable.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is acceptable.\n  Mr. DOLE. I send amendment 2614 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 2614 is the pending question. The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment numbered 2614.\n  The amendment (No. 2614) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I need a very short time for \nmy amendment. I believe Senator Simpson would like to speak on the \ndeeming amendment for 10 minutes, and it would be agreeable to have 10 \nminutes on my side on that amendment.\n  On the other amendment, 10 minutes is enough. Senator Kennedy would \nlike to speak on the deeming amendment as well.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, there are two amendments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There are two amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Naturalization and deeming?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Twenty minutes on each amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have Senator Shelby, Senator Mikulski, two amendments by \nSenator Feinstein, and then in our rotation plan it would come back to \nthis side unless we have an agreement we can accept.\n  Once the Senator from North Dakota has his worked out----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Leader, we think we have achieved agreement, so if we \ncould get in the queue, we think we have that all taken care of.\n  Mr. DOLE. Following Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That certainly would be good. We could take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Ten minutes.\n  That will be four amendments by my colleagues on the other side. I \nassume we can have an equal number on this side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2526\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 2526, offered by the Senator from \nAlabama, is now the pending business.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing Senators as original cosponsors of the amendment: Senators \nSantorum, Grams, Helms, Gramm of Texas, Coats, and Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, along with the Senators that I have just \nmentioned as cosponsors, that is, namely, Senators Craig, Lott, \nHatfield, Coats, Santorum, Grams, Helms, and Gramm of Texas, I am \nintroducing an amendment that we believe will help strengthen the role \nof the family in America.\n  The out-of-wedlock birthrate in America is projected to reach 50 \npercent by early next century, and I am concerned that this trend will \nresult in a dramatic increase in the number of children abused and \nneglected. There are now close to 500,000 children in the \n\n[[Page S 13585]]\nfoster care system, but only 50,000 are placed for adoption each year. \nOur amendment would effectively find homes for many children who need \nparents and find children for parents who need families. The objective \nof this amendment is to provide an appropriate incentive to encourage a \npolicy which should be embraced by all Americans.\n  Adoption is a positive event that benefits everyone involved. \nObviously a loving, caring family for a parentless child is the primary \nbenefit of adoption. Studies show the adopted child receives a strong \nself identity, positive psychological health and a tendency for \nfinancial well-being.\n  Parents who adopt children also benefit. They receive the joy and \nresponsibility of raising a child as well as the love and respect only \na child can give. The emotional fulfillment of raising children clearly \ncontributes to the fullness of life.\n  Lastly, we should not forget the advantages to communities as a whole \nin America. Society is unambiguously better off as a result of \nadoption. Statistics show time and again that children with families \nintact are more likely to become productive members of the community \nthan children without both parents.\n  Unfortunately more times than not, a financial barrier stands in the \nway of otherwise qualified parents. The monthly cost of supporting the \nchild is not the hurdle, but instead the initial outlay to pay for the \nadoption. There are many fees and costs involved with adopting a child, \nwhich include maternity home care, normal prenatal and hospital care \nfor the mother and child, preadoption foster care for infant, home \nstudy fees, and legal fees. These costs can range anywhere from about \n$13,000 to $36,000, according to the National Council for Adoption.\n  Like the person who wants to buy a home, but cannot because the \nfinancial hurdle of a down payment stops them, potential parents often \ncannot adopt a child because of the substantial initial fees, fees that \ncould actually exceed the cost of a down payment for a home. As a \nresult, children are denied homes, and parents denied children.\n  Our amendment seeks to address this problem. It would allow a $5,000 \nrefundable tax credit for adoption expenses. This credit would be fully \navailable to any individual with an income up to $60,000 and phased out \nup to an income of $100,000. Other adoption tax credits have been put \nforth, but the key element of our adoption tax credit is its full \nrefundability. This provision will allow many couples who may not have \na tax liability in a given year to be able to afford to open up their \nhome to a parentless child.\n  A fully-refundable adoption tax credit is an essential part of any \nwelfare reform measure like the one we have before us.\n  Our amendment would also provide that employer-provided adoption \nassistance would be excluded from gross income for taxable purposes. \nThose receiving assistance from their employer to cover costs over and \nabove the first $5,000--which would be taken care of by the credit--\nwould not have to count that assistance as income. Finally, the \namendment provides that withdrawals from an IRA can be made penalty-\nfree and excluded from income if used for qualified adoption expenses. \nRepresentative Joseph Kennedy and others are advocating a proposal \nsimilar to this in the House.\n  I believe these changes will go a long way in making adoption a \nreality for many children and helping them find the loving homes they \nso desperately need in America. This amendment has the strong support \nof 14 adoption organizations, which represent more than 1,000 adoption \nagencies and practitioners. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will \njoin us in reaching out to families in order to provide a better, \nbrighter future for our children and a heightened degree of \nappreciation for the potential that adoption holds for our society. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nAlabama [Senator Shelby] in offering this amendment to provide for a \nrefundable tax credit for adoption expenses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, we are under time \ncontrol. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Excuse me, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What is the time situation here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 13 \nminutes and 33 seconds; opponents, 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as I said--and I thank the chairman for \nyielding--I am pleased to join my colleague from Alabama [Senator \nShelby] in offering this amendment to provide for a refundable tax \ncredit for adoption expenses.\n  In short, Mr. President, this amendment will amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide a refundable tax credit for adoption \nexpenses. This provision will exclude from gross income employee and \nmilitary adoption assistance benefits and withdrawals from IRA's for \nuse toward adoption expenses.\n  Some people may ask, ``What does this have to do with welfare?'' It \nhas very little to do with our current welfare system, but a great deal \nto do with a dramatically reformed system similar to that envisioned in \nthe leader's bill.\n  Through the use of block grants and other reforms, we are moving away \nfrom a welfare system that has created dependency, and into a system \nthat encourages independence.\n  As part of that, we also hope to see greater strength in the American \nfamily, reduce out-of-wedlock births, control welfare spending, and \nreduce welfare dependence. It is my concern that as we move in this \ndirection, that the Congress needs to make adoption a more viable \noption for families.\n  We all read the stories, both happy and tragic, of efforts couples \nhave made to adopt a child. It is my hope that our work here will lead \nto more happy stories and fewer heartbreaking reports,\n of the tens of thousands of dollars spent traveling around the world \nby couples in search of children to adopt to make them a part of their \nfamily.\n\n  I know this firsthand. Not that I suffered those hardships, but I am \nan adoptive parent and I adopted the children of my wife and we brought \ntogether a family unit. Even then, when there were no obstacles in \nfront of us, the process was challenging in all of the hoops and \nhurdles that we had to go through to make sure it was done right.\n  This amendment will give adoptive families a fairer shake. I have \nintroduced similar legislation with other colleagues here in the Senate \nand hope that they will support this amendment.\n  Adoption is a viable option that results the best of all worlds: \nUniting a wanted child and a loving family. I think we need to keep \nfocused on that fact, and continue our efforts to improve the adoption \nand foster care approaches that this Senate is so supportive of.\n  Mr. President, before closing, I want to take a moment to discuss \nsomething that was not included in the Republican leadership welfare \nreform bill.\n  There is good reason to highlight this item that was excluded, \nbecause it will have a big impact on our ability, as a nation, to \nensure that there is a safety net to take care of children.\n  The item that was excluded is the creation of a block grant of the \ntitle IV-E foster care and adoption assistance programs.\n  In fact, both the GOP leadership bill, the Work Opportunity Act of \n1995, and the conservative consensus package maintain the title IV-E \nfoster care and adoption assistance programs as entitlements.\n  Mr. President, we need dramatic reform of our welfare system. And of \nall of us who have been engaged in that debate here for the last good \nnumber of days, the current one-size-fits-all approach of a federally \ndesigned and implemented program simply has not served this Nation well \nnor served those who find themselves in poverty and in need of welfare.\n  It has also been unsuccessful in relieving poverty. Instead, it finds \nthat \n\n[[Page S 13586]]\nwe put families in it and somehow they stay there. Here is an \nopportunity, as we move out to independence to assure greater chances \nfor children without families, to find those families and families \nwithout children--to find those children.\n  Instead of a program that reaches out to people and families to give \nthem a hand up, we have a program with a hand out that constantly \npushes people down and keeps them in the welfare cycle.\n  The bill we have before us today will provide some of that needed \ndramatic reform. Changes in programs like aid to families with \ndependent children [AFDC] may have an impact on foster care services. \nThis will be especially prevalent during the implementation and \ntransition into the reformed welfare system.\n  The impact of any changes to our welfare system is somewhat \nunpredictable. Therefore, Republicans here in the Senate have \nacknowledged that fact, and the need to maintain a safety net for \nchildren by maintaining title IV-E as an entitlement.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been a concern of mine for some time. \nIn Idaho, we have a number of excellent facilities that work with \nchildren in group home settings, with an emphasis on reuniting the \nfamily when possible. I have been to these facilities, my staff have \nseen them. The work they do there is nothing short of remarkable.\n  My concern, Mr. President, is that we have a safety net available to \nensure that the children who may be affected will be adequately taken \ncare of through our foster care and adoption assistance programs. If \nthese programs under title IV-E were converted into a block grant with \na limited inflation adjuster, there would be little flexibility for \nStates to meet the kind of unforseen demands that can shift children \ninto these programs.\n  There are also issues outside of welfare reform that affect these \nprograms, such as changes in the economy, demographics and natural \ndisasters. For example, Idaho had a 16-percent increase in the number \nof child abuses cases last year; many of those children ended up in the \nfoster care system. Again, these are things that cannot be planned for, \nbut add to the burden of the system.\n  It is important to note that since the foster care and adoption \nassistance programs were established in 1980, there have been more than \n90,000 children with special needs adopted in the United States.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of references to those who \nare affected by what we do here.\n  I would like to take a moment to share a story about we've been able \nto accomplish in Idaho with these title IV-E moneys. The Idaho youth \nranch runs a family preservation program.\n  Gina was a 7-year-old girl who was removed from her home by child \nprotective services because her parent neglected to care for her. The \ngoal of the referral was to see if the youth ranch could help the \nmother respond to the point that Gina and her two younger sibling could \nreturn home.\n  The youth ranch staff began an assessment of the family situation and \ndeveloped a plan in conjunction with the Child Protective Services \nstaff, mom, and the children.\n  Through the parent training, supportive services, and help the youth \nranch provided, this family is now getting back on track. Mother is now \nworking in a job close to home, has a healthy home environment set up, \nready for the children's return, has the kids enrolled in school, and a \nresponsible day care for her youngest child.\n  The staff at the youth ranch will continue their work after the \nreunification of the children. It is a happy ending for the family, for \nthe State, and most important, for Gina.\n  Mr. President, that was quite a lengthy comment, but I felt it was \nimportant to note in this debate. In closing, I would just add that I \nhope my colleagues will support improving access to adoption, and will \nvote for the Shelby amendment.\n  So I am proud to support and to be a cosponsor of the amendment of my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, and his concerted effort.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the proponent of the \namendment a question.\n  As I understand, this is going to cost $1.4 billion over 5 years. Has \nthe Senator a method of paying for this?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Would the Senator from Rhode Island state the question \nagain?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that this amendment will cost, \nover 5 years, $1.4 billion.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator is correct. The revenue loss is projected to \nbe $1.4 billion over 5 years but the underlying bill will result in \nsavings of over $40 billion over 5 years.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I know we are going to have further discussion because I \nthink there is a point of order that lies that is going to be raised. \nBut I would point out that everything that comes in theory out of \nsavings is something that the Finance Committee has to come up and pay \nfor. We have just concluded a long meeting in connection with Medicare, \nand the difficulty of coming up with savings was made clear to us at \nthat gathering.\n  So, Mr. President, if there is no further discussion, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, and this will be charged equally against both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of time to the Senator \nfrom Texas, [Mr. Gramm].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Shelby \namendment.\n  What the Shelby amendment does is it tries to provide tax equity to \npeople who adopt children and in the process, provide a home and \nenvironment that represents our only sure-fire, guaranteed way to break \nthe poverty cycle--allowing people the opportunity to escape from \npoverty and use their God-given talents.\n  One of the reasons I feel so strongly about not giving people more \nand more money to have more and more children on welfare is that I am \nconvinced if we stopped giving people cash bonuses to have more \nchildren on welfare and adopt the Shelby amendment giving tax equity to \npeople who adopt children on a par with people who are having them, \nthen we have an opportunity to find a home for every child born in \nAmerica. That can solve not only the welfare problem but many other \nproblems in the country.\n  I do not know how our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ngoing to vote on this amendment, but I would simply like to note this \nparadox. In the compromises that have taken place in the last 2 hours \nin an effort to pass this bill, an initial agreement has been made \nwhich will spend $4 billion on programs that in all probability will do \nvirtually nothing to help break the poverty cycle and will do virtually \nnothing to guarantee that people see an improvement in their lives.\n  However, by giving tax equity to people who adopt children--up to \n$5,000 in tax credits to cover the costs they incur in adoption--we can \nguarantee that people will be able to adopt more children, bringing \nthem into their homes, giving them love, and improving the lives of \nthose children. I think this is an important amendment, and I think if \nwe can follow it up someday with an amendment to streamline the \nadoption process, making it easier for people to adopt children, we can \nmake a dramatic difference.\n  One of our colleague's wives was in Bangladesh--I ask for an \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As I look at the Shelby amendment, it reminds me of a \nstatement made by Cindy McCain, Senator McCain's wife. When she was in \nBangladesh, there was this baby girl who had been set aside to die \nbecause she had a cleft palate. Cindy McCain decided that she was going \nto bring that little girl back to the United States of America and \nadopt her. Her point was, I cannot solve the problems of every \n\n[[Page S 13587]]\nchild in the world, but I can solve this child's problem.\n  What the Shelby amendment does is let other people who want to solve \nthis problem one child at a time, do it. So, I think, this is an \nimportant amendment. I hope it will be adopted, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Alabama. This provision \nwas in our original welfare bill that Senator Shelby and other \nconservative Republicans and I put together. I think it is an important \naddition to this bill, and, quite frankly, of all the things we have \ntalked about here, this is clearly welfare reform.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would simply make the point as a member of the \nFinance Committee that we have not considered this measure. It is a new \ncredit that would be created without the means to pay for it. The \nproposal would cost $3 billion in revenues over the next 10 years, and \nthere is no provision to pay for it.\n  There is strong sentiment in favor of it; I can sense it. I \nunderstand that and share it, but it is a doubtful measure to be \nadopted at this point, and yet we have a long conference committee \nprocedure before us and that may be the time to address it. I will \nleave it at that.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, over the past 25 years there has been a \ndramatic increase in the number of children born out of wedlock, \nchildren being raised by single parents, and children entering the \nfoster care system because of abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Family \ndisintegration is widespread.\n  At the same time we have experienced an increase in family \ndisintegration, we have seen a sharp decrease in the number of children \nbeing adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: \nfrom 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the \n1980's into the 1990's. On any given day, 37,000 children in foster \ncare are legally free and waiting--to be adopted.\n  Why are children waiting? Why aren't families adopting? The reason, I \npropose, is not a lack of compassion on the part of families. Many \nthousands of families would be eager to adopt were it not for the costs \ncan be prohibitive for working class families. The average cost of an \nadoption is $14,000 and it is not uncommon for this figure to reach \nupwards of $25,000.\n  Adoption is the compassionate response to children in need of a home. \nYet, there is currently inequity in the tax system. While certain \nmedical expenses related to the conception, delivery, and birth of a \nchild may be deducted as medical expenses, no similar relief is \navailable for adoptive families.\n  Mr. President, I, like many of my colleagues know the sacrifice \nrequired of parents. Children require 100 percent of us, 100 percent of \nthe time. The financial burden can be significant. The time element, \nbalancing the needs of work and family--these are all very significant. \nYet there are thousands who make that sacrifice every day for children \nthey have lovingly adopted into their family, and many thousands more \nwho would--but for the costs. The Shelby amendment will put adoption \nwithin the reach of many families, and make an important public policy \nstatement about the value and respect we have for the institution of \nadoption.\n  I've heard some say adoption tax credits should be limited to \nchildren with special needs. Well, I believe that every child in need \nof adoption is a child with a special need for a loving, and permanent \nhome.\n  Money should never be a barrier to adoption. Adoption should be \nencouraged as a compassionate response to children of parents who find \nthemselves unable or unwilling to care for them. These families deserve \nour support, and deserve to be treated the same as families formed \nbiologically. The Shelby amendment sends a strong message that adoption \nis a valued way of building a family.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not need much time. One minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Three minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend Senator Shelby for the \namendment.\n  Frankly, I believe in this sea of problems with reference to unwed \npregnancies and welfare children of this country, which are growing \nlike a volcano erupting on America, this obviously attempts to address \na very serious problem; that we are in need of more adoptions by good \npeople who will raise children well in a good household. This amendment \nattempts to do that.\n  Frankly, it has a problem, a technical problem. I think that is well \nknown. Senator Moynihan expressed it. This is not a measure in which \nyou can have tax credits and not pay for them. In a very real sense, it \ncould be subject to a point of order. I, for one, believe we ought not \nraise it. We ought to vote on it, if that is what the distinguished \nSenator wants. And then it will take care of itself in terms of the tax \nprovisions whether they will remain in the welfare bill or whether they \nwill be taken care of in reconciliation as part of the tax bill. We can \nfind out. We can wait and see. But essentially I think it is such a \ngood idea that we ought to make sure it is done.\n  Now, if somebody raises the point of order, I would say tonight I \nwould join in trying to waive it with my good friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I do not think we ought to do that. I hope we will \nnot.\n  I compliment the Senator on the amendment and hope it passes here \ntonight one way or the other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished ranking member \nof the Finance Committee made some good points, as has everybody else \nhere today. This is a very commendable amendment. Although it is an \namendment we have not had a chance to consider in the Finance \nCommittee, it is a matter that will come before us when we are dealing \nwith the tax provisions that we are surely going to get to later this \nyear. And so, therefore, I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  All those in favor----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum until \nthere is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nShelby amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on the Shelby amendment be put off until 8 p.m.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. A point of clarification, please, from the Chair.\n  Would the Mikulski amendment be the next amendment in order? Is there \na Mikulski amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. PRYOR. And are we going to, on subsequent amendments--if I might \nask the Chair, is it correct that we are going to basically stack the \nvotes at approximately 8 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no order.\n  There is a unanimous consent request pending that the Shelby \namendment be voted on at 8 p.m.\n  Mr. PRYOR. For the benefit of our colleagues, I have been informed \nthat \n\n[[Page S 13588]]\nis merely the intention. But it is the intention to basically stack \nvotes that are considered between now and 8 p.m., stack those votes at \n8 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request that the \nvote on the Shelby amendment occur at 8?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, we have a list here. And Senator \nMikulski is not here. I notice Senator Feinstein is here.\n  Mr. President, is there any defined order that has previously been \narranged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is a defined \norder. The Mikulski amendment is the next pending business. It would \nrequire a unanimous consent agreement to set it aside to deal with the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] proposes amendment \n     numbered 2669.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, my amendment deals with the role of men and how we can \nbring men back into the family, how we can eliminate marriage penalties \nand begin to really work toward two-parent households once again among \nthe poor.\n  One of the missing discussions in this year's welfare debate is how \nwe involve fathers with their families. We can do that through tougher \nchild support laws and, yes, it is true we need to crack down on \ndeadbeat dads. But you know, Democrats and Republicans all agree that \nwe need to have major child support reform to do that. But, quite \nfrankly, men, fathers are more than a child support check.\n  Our focus needs to be on the issues related to child rearing as much \nas child support. We need to get the men involved in the rearing of \ntheir own children and we do that by promoting two-parent families.\n  Earlier this year, the nonpartisan Casey Foundation, which I am proud \nto say is headquartered in Baltimore, released their 1995 report called \n``Kids Count.'' It focused exclusively on the need to promote fathers \nas part of our Nation's strategy to reform welfare.\n  One of the most compelling things that they outlined was the \ndevastating effect on children when fathers are absent from the home. \nThe Casey Foundation said this:\n\n       Children in father-absent families are five times more \n     likely to be poor and 10 times more likely to be extremely \n     poor.\n       Children of single mothers are twice as likely to become \n     high-school dropouts. These kids are more likely to end up in \n     foster or group care or, even worse, in juvenile justice \n     facilities.\n\n  The Casey Foundation went on to tell us that:\n\n       Girls from single-parent families have three times greater \n     risk of bearing children as unwed teenagers.\n\n  Often in the debate, and I know the Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, has often commented on the problems related to single-parent \nfamilies, we often overlook the role of what happens to girls.\n\n       And boys whose fathers are absent face a much higher \n     probability of growing up unemployed, incarcerated, and \n     uninvolved with their own children.\n\n  During this welfare debate, we have heard about the staggering rise \nin illegitimacy and the households headed by single parents. Much of \nthis rhetoric has focused on solving the problems through punishing the \nmother. They aim for the mother but, in turn, hit the child.\n  The proposed solutions do not get at the heart of why we have fewer \ntwo-parent families, which is simply the decline in jobs that pay a \nfamily wage and the penalties in our public policy that work against \nthe two-parent family.\n  The chart next to me contains data from the ``1995 Kids Count'' \nreport and it makes it graphically. Between 1969 and 1993, the \npercentage of children under 18 living in households headed by women \njumped from 11 percent to 24 percent. During that same 23-year period, \nthe number of men between the ages of 25 and 34 who did not earn enough \nto support a family of four jumped from 14 percent to 32 percent.\n  The link is clear. If employment opportunities do not exist for men \nwho are poor, it is unlikely they will get married. In fact, the ``Kids \nCount'' report points out most women consider a stable income an \nimportant element in choosing someone to marry.\n  The Republican welfare bill is either silent on solutions or it \nfocuses on the mother as the only solution, or actually it attacks the \nmother. In fact, it is what I have called ``the parent trap.'' They say \nthey want women on welfare to get married and require tougher work \nrequirements for people who end up getting married. The Republican bill \nallows States to impose family caps, but it never asks States to \ndevelop programs that will bring families together.\n  Their bill also allows State welfare programs to cut families off if \na father actually works too many hours. So we are going to penalize the \nfather for being in the home, and we are going to penalize him for \nworking too many hours. Hey, that is not the way to reform welfare or \nto move the poor out of poverty.\n  It also allows a father's child support check to go to a State \nbureaucracy instead of directly to the family.\n  We Democrats are serious about welfare reform, and we are serious \nabout strengthening the family in this process. We aim for real reform \nby protecting the child, helping the mother and involving the father.\n  The amendment that the Senator from New Jersey and I have proposed \nseeks to end this ``parent trap'' and instead include real solutions \nthat promote two-parent families. We will do this in our amendment by, \nfirst, job placement for noncustodial fathers. This amendment sets \naside a very small amount of money in the welfare block grant for \nStates to enroll unemployed fathers in job training and placement so \nthey can meet their child support and family obligations. Employing \nthese fathers is the most significant step we can take to promote two-\nparent families. In addition, the cost of this effort will be partially \noffset by increased child support payments as a result of the jobs \nwhich these fathers would have.\n  Second, our amendment prevents States from creating welfare rules \nthat penalize marriage. The amendment prevents States from reenacting \nthe current AFDC man in the house rule at the State level that pushes \nthe man out of the family.\n  Third, it promotes marriage and not punishment.\n  And fourth, we pay child support to mothers, not State bureaucrats. \nWhat do I mean? It means that, first of all, we have a rule called the \nman in the house rule. If you are a father living at home and you work \nover 100 hours a month, regardless of what you earn, your family is cut \noff from assistance.\n  This is unacceptable. We need to promote and require work, and \neligibility for assistance should be based on what you earn, not the \nnumber of hours it takes to earn it.\n  Third, promote marriage. For those States that impose a family cap, \nthe amendment would require them to come up with some incentives that \npromote marriage. If we are serious about strengthening families, let \nus not just cut people off and make no effort to encourage marriage.\n  And fourth, pay child support to mothers not State bureaucrats. In my \nown State of Maryland, I had a roundtable with dads who are meeting \ntheir family obligations, but they told me how frustrating it was when \nthey wrote their child support check it went into some big bureaucracy \nand when they went to visit their child, there had been no linkage \nbetween dad being the \n\n[[Page S 13589]]\nprovider and their family actually experiencing that and the check \nstill coming from the welfare department.\n  As a result, our amendment requires States to pass through the first \n$50 in a monthly child support payment to the family.\n  Mr. President, my amendment has many other components to it. I could \nspeak on many elements in this program. We deal particularly with \nhelping interstate child custody orders and others. But I want to say \nthis. Our amendment is good for fathers and their children. It \nrecognizes that men are not only child support checks, but they must be \ninvolved as fathers. I want them not only paying child support, I want \nthem to be a link within the family itself. The dad is not in the home, \nbut still there is a relationship.\n  Second, where possible, to be able to promote the family and get the \ndad back in the home.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senator from New Jersey wishes to \nspeak on this amendment. How much time do we have left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and twelve seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me say this. We are not going to \nconsume our full 10 minutes. Does the Senator from New Jersey want a \ncouple minutes from us? Three minutes for the Senator from our \nallotment of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nthank the Senator from Maryland for offering it. I think it makes one \nvery clear point, and that is children that grow up in two-parent \nfamilies have a better chance than children who grow up in single-\nparent families. That does not mean that there are not a lot of single \nmothers who do a heroic job out there raising children against the \nodds, who teach them how to work hard and how to advance. It simply \nmeans that two incomes are better than one and that two supervisors are \nbetter than one.\n  It is very interesting, because in the course of this debate, we \ndiscussed the family cap which says if you have an additional child, if \nyou are on welfare, that child does not receive a payment.\n  In my State of New Jersey, that would mean about $64 a month. We have \nthe only family cap experiment in the country in New Jersey, and we \ndeny a benefit to an additional child to a mother who is on welfare. \nBut we also have a provision in the law that rewards marriage. It says \nthat if a woman on welfare is married, her husband's income will not \npush her off of eligibility for welfare, up to about $21,000 in \ncombined income.\n  So what the distinguished Senator from Maryland is stating with this \namendment is that we should have incentives in the welfare system for \nsingle parents to get married. We have that in the experiment in New \nJersey at the moment. It is only a year old, so we do not have any \nconclusive results. I think it is an important amendment. That, then, \nunderlines the deeper point the Senator from Maryland is making, which \nis that it is important in every child's life to have a father as well \nas a mother, a father involved with time and resources. It is very \nimportant.\n  So I salute the Senator, and I cosponsor the amendment and hope that \nit will be adopted.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I \nalso thank the Senator from Rhode Island for yielding him some time. I \nwill ask for the yeas and nays, but I presume the Senator from Rhode \nIsland wants to speak.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, obviously, on my time. I have a couple of questions. \nThis is an interesting amendment and rather a broad one, as I \nunderstand it. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania has some comments \nthat will delve into matters that otherwise I might have covered.\n  I have two questions. One, does the Senator from Maryland know what \nthis would cost?\n  The second question is, Does she have some way of paying for it?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe this will cost $920 million over a 7-year \nperiod. We hope that part of the money will come from, first of all, \nchild support itself. No. 2, by bringing men back into the family, \nwhich will decrease the need for public assistance. I am looking at the \nmemo here on exactly where that comes from. I do not have an offset for \nthis. I believe we were going to accept an adoption amendment which \nwill cost $3 billion--and, by the way, I was a foster care worker and \nalso involved in adoption work many years ago. So I support that \namendment. But, there is not a cost that you can put on bringing a dad \nback into the home. If it is going to cost us a couple of bucks to do \nthat, I think the long-term savings--you might think it is amusing, but \nI do not think it is.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I remind the Senator that she is on my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. You know what? I am.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I know the Senator is being facetious. I do not want to \ntake her up on it too much. But a billion dollars is really what it is. \nShe was being facetious when she used the words ``a couple of bucks,'' \nbut I am not going to dwell on that.\n  But we have a real problem here, Mr. President. Everybody is coming \nforward with amendments--wonderful amendments and good things, \nundoubtedly. But there is no method of paying for them. All that means \nis that those of us on the Finance Committee have to somehow come and \nmake up that money. We are having terrible times coming up with amounts \nthat we are designated to provide anyway. We have to come up with $530 \nbillion, and to load on $1 billion more in this bill--and other moneys \nhave been expended in other measures that come before us.\n  So I am, reluctantly, going to have to oppose the Senator's measure. \nI know the Senator from Pennsylvania has comments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  I just say that in addition to the billion dollars this spends, I \nquestion the rationale behind this. What this amendment says is, if you \nare a noncustodial parent you are eligible to participate in the job \ntraining and employment programs of the State. And you are eligible, if \nyour child is receiving welfare, or if you are a noncustodial parent \nthat owes past child support, even if you are a deadbeat dad. So if you \nare a father who does not support his kids and they are on welfare, or \nyou do not pay child support, we will put you in a job training program \nor give you a job. I question that we are going to spend $650 million \nof new money on providing job training for deadbeat dads.\n  You can say we are going to bring families together. This is a nice \nbenefit for someone who is doing something you do not want them to do. \nI do not think we should be rewarding people who are turning their \nbacks on their children. I think that is questionable.\n  The other portion of the bill--and I know this is a lengthy amendment \nand has many different sections. I know there is one here that has the \n$50 pass-through, which is the first $50 of child support paid by a \nfather, who is in arrears on his child support, goes directly--excuse \nme, the mother is on welfare, goes directly to the mother, not the \nState, to offset the benefits the State is paying the mother. This is \nsomething that is in current practice. Every State child support agency \ntells us that this is not a good provision. It does not help fathers or \nencourage fathers to pay any of this child support. It is simply $50 \nthat the State does not get that they are now paying as an offset for \nAFDC. This is not proven to be incentive. It does not work. It is \nsomething that we, at their suggestion, have dropped in the Dole \namendment, and now they are trying to put it back in, and it costs \nmoney and does not provide incentive to pay back child support or child \nsupport to somebody on welfare.\n  The cost is a billion dollars. We are going to be providing jobs and \njob training to deadbeat dads, fathers who allow their children to go \non welfare. And there is the $50 pass-through. I think this, again, may \nbe well-meaning. We may want to help fathers get back with their \nfamilies and bring families together, but I do not think providing \nmoney to deadbeat dads for job training is the way I would go about \ndoing it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. On whatever time I have remaining, I will do so, sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 7 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator think that simply because a father is \n\n[[Page S 13590]]\n  in arrears on child support, he is a deadbeat and wants to abdicate his \nresponsibility? Because, for whatever reason, earlier in their life, \nmaybe he did not complete school, and he needs job training to get back \ninto the labor market in order to assume his responsibility. That is \nwhat is behind our motivation in that part.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand there may be such cases that you mention. \nBut I think the broader point is whether, when we have people who have \nviolated their responsibilities to their children, we should now create \na separate Government program to train them for jobs or create jobs for \nthem. I understand there may be circumstances where people, well-\nmeaning, could not pay their child support. But at the same time, you \nwant to set up a program because they have done that, apart from \nsomeone else who may be paying their child support and working two and \nthree jobs to make sure they keep up. We do not help them at all, or \ntrain them, or do anything for them. That is a bad precedent. We should \nnot be providing this kind of money for people who are shirking the \nresponsibilities of their children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the opponents has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays and that the \nvote occur in whatever order or whatever time that was in the \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur as indicated.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, subject to changes in the future, that \nvote on the Mikulski amendment would occur after the vote on the Shelby \namendment which is scheduled to occur at 8 o'clock.\n  Next on our list, we have Senator Feinstein who I understand has two \namendments, each with 20 minutes equally divided. If the Senator would \nbe good enough to identify which amendment she is discussing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2478\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, to the managing Senator, the amendment \nI call up is amendment No. 2478.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2478.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the language in \nthe Dole bill which precludes a naturalized citizen from obtaining at \nany time any cash or noncash welfare benefit.\n  The language in this bill, as presently drafted, is the first time in \nthe history of the United States that naturalized citizens would be \ntreated differently than native-born citizens.\n  The Constitution of the United States says that there is only one \ninstance where there is a difference between the two; that is, one who \nseeks the Presidency of the United States.\n  My mother became a naturalized citizen. My mother had very little \nformal education. She had difficulty reading and writing. She had to \ntake the test three times before she became a citizen. I have to say \nthe day she was naturalized she was prouder than any time in her life \nthat I can remember. It meant a great deal because she was as good as \nany American citizen in her eyes. That is a very big thing.\n  The amendment I am proposing is supported by the Department of \nJustice. I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Kennedy from \nJustice, pointing out serious concerns about section 204's \nconstitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens, be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is supported by the National Governors' \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Bar \nAssociation and the Governors' Association be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is supported by the National Association of \nCounties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Catholic Conference, \nand the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as well as several other \norganizations.\n  I believe that we are essentially a nation of immigrants. I sit as a \nnew member of the Immigration Subcommittee and I know there is a \nlegitimate reason that the Government should try to dissuade, in any \nway we can, people from becoming naturalized simply to gain welfare. \nThere is no question about it. I believe the immigration bill that we \nhave marked up in the Immigration Subcommittee deals with that.\n  What this bill does is it says that if you are a naturalized \ncitizen--and let me give some specific examples. Take my mother's case \nand put it in the present day. My mother came to this country at the \nage of 3. Supposing her mother was naturalized, that would make her a \nnaturalized citizen. Then supposing my mother did want to go to \ncollege, which she never had an opportunity to do, she would be \neligible for a loan program. Under this bill, as drafted, my mother \nwould never be eligible as a naturalized citizen for a program. Even \nMedicaid, she would not be eligible for it.\n  Taking my mother again, say my mother came to this country as a \nspouse, never worked, was naturalized, was a naturalized citizen for 20 \nyears. Say my father left her and she was destitute. She would not have \naccess to any aid program, cash or noncash, the way the bill is \npresently drafted. The language before the Senate simply deletes this \nlanguage and keeps a class of ``American citizen'' as one class. If you \nare naturalized, you are as good as someone who is born anywhere in \nthis great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter follows your question to \n     Attorney General Janet Reno regarding the constitutionality \n     of the deeming provisions in pending immigration legislation \n     at the Senate Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on June \n     27.\n       You have asked for our views regarding the ``deeming'' \n     provisions of section 204 of S. 269, Senator Simpson's \n     proposed immigration legislation. Our comment here is limited \n     to the questions raised by application of section 204 to \n     naturalized citizens.\n       We have serious concerns about section 204's \n     constitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens. So \n     applied, the deeming provisions would operate to deny, or \n     reduce eligibility for, a variety of benefits including \n     student financial assistance and welfare benefits to certain \n     United States citizens because they were born outside the \n     country. This appears to be an unprecedented result. Current \n     federal deeming provisions under various benefits programs \n     operate only as against aliens, (see e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 615 \n     (AFDC); 7 U.S.C. 2014(i) (Food Stamps) and we are not aware \n     of any comparable restrictions on citizen eligibility for \n     federal assistance. As a matter of policy, we think it would \n     be a mistake to begin now to relegate naturalized citizens--\n     who have demonstrated their commitment to our country by \n     undergoing the naturalization process--to a kind of second-\n     class status.\n       The provision might be defended legally on the grounds that \n     it is an exercise of Congress' plenary authority to regulate \n     immigration and naturalization, or, more specifically, to set \n     the terms under which persons may enter the United States and \n     become citizens. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976); \n     Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1982). We are not \n     convinced that this defense would prove persuasive. Though \n     Congress undoubtedly has power to impose conditions precedent \n     on entry and naturalization, the provision at issue here \n     would function as a condition subsequent, applying to \n     entrants even after they become citizens. It is not at all \n     clear that Congress' immigration and\n      naturalization power extends this far.\n       While the rights of citizenship of the native born derive \n     from Sec. 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of the \n     naturalized citizen derive from satisfying, free of fraud, \n     the requirements set by Congress, the latter, apart from the \n     exception noted [constitutional eligibility for President], \n     becomes a member of the society, possessing all the \n\n[[Page S 13591]]\n     rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the \n     constitution, on the footing of a native. The constitution \n     does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those \n     rights. The simply power of the national Legislature, is to \n     prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, and the exercise \n     of this power exhausts it, so far as respects the individual.\n       Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 166 (1964) (internal \n     quotations omitted) (statutory restriction on length foreign \n     residence applied to naturalized but not native born citizens \n     violates Fifth Amendment equal protection component).\n       Alternatively, it might be argued in defense of the \n     provision that it classifies not by reference to citizenship \n     at all, but rather on the basis of sponsorship; only those \n     naturalized citizens with sponsors will be affected. Again, \n     we have doubts about whether this characterization of the \n     provision would be accepted. State courts have rejected an \n     analogous position with respect to state deeming provisions, \n     finding that the provisions constitute impermissible \n     discrimination based on alienage despite the fact that they \n     reach only sponsored aliens. See Barannikov v. Town of \n     Greenwich, 643 A.2d 251, 263-64 (Conn. 1994); El Souri v. \n     Dep't of Social Services, 414 N.W. 2d 679, 682-83 (Mich. \n     1987). Because the deeming provision in question here, as \n     applied to citizens, is directed at and reaches only \n     naturalized citizens, the same reasoning would compel the \n     conclusion that it constitutes discrimination against \n     naturalized citizens. Cf. Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 \n     (1977) (``The important points are that [the law] is directed \n     at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact \n     that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it \n     does not discriminate against the class.'') Invalidating \n     state law denying some, but not all, resident aliens \n     financial assistance for higher education.\n       So understood, the deeming provision, as applied to \n     citizens, would contravene the basic equal protection tenet \n     that ``the rights of citizenship of the native born and of \n     the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are \n     coextensive.'' Schneider, 377 U.S. at 165. To the same \n     effect, the provision might be viewed as a classification \n     based on national origin; among citizens otherwise eligible \n     for government assistance, the class excluded by operation of \n     the deeming provision is limited to those born outside the \n     United States. A classification based on national origin, of \n     course, is subject to strict scrutiny under equal protection \n     review, see Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), \n     and it is unlikely that the deeming provision could be \n     justified under this standard. See Barannikova 643 A.2d at \n     265 (invalidating state deeming provision under strict \n     scrutiny); El Souri, 414 N.W.2d at 683 (same).\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                 City of New York,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As the Senate moves to \n     consideration of welfare reform legislation, I want to share \n     my serious concerns with you about the legal immigrant \n     provisions included in this bill. As the Mayor of New York \n     City, a city that has benefited immensely from the economic, \n     cultural, and social contributions of immigrants, I am \n     particularly troubled by unprecedented efforts to limit \n     benefits to legal immigrants and unfairly target them.\n       The Senate welfare reform package, for the first time, \n     would impose extraordinary restrictions on qualified \n     immigrants' access to many federal benefit programs. The \n     Senate proposal would also extend sponsor deeming to a broad \n     range of programs not presently covered by deeming \n     restrictions. This proposal is likely to restrict benefits to \n     some legal immigrants even after they become naturalized \n     citizens, thereby creating a second class of U.S. \n     citizenship. Like yourself, I believe that extending deeming \n     beyond citizenship is unwise public policy and may prove \n     unconstitutional, and I support your efforts to end deeming \n     upon citizenship. In addition, I also support your attempts \n     to limit deeming to cash assistance programs only and not to \n     Medicaid or other non-cash assistance programs.\n       While the denial of benefits to legal immigrants is \n     patently unfair to taxpaying residents, it will also result \n     in considerable cost-shifting to local and state governments. \n     Because the federal government has sole responsibility over \n     immigration policy, it must bear the concomitant \n     responsibility of serving the legal immigrants it permits to \n     enter states and localities. I am deeply concerned that \n     denying benefits to legal immigrants or extending deeming \n     beyond citizenship will not eliminate needs and, \n     subsequently, force state and local governments to bear the \n     financial consequences of unwise policy decisions. The Senate \n     welfare reform package fails to provide states and localities \n     with funding for expected high administrative costs \n     associated with implementing this proposal, and is an \n     unfunded mandate that New York and other cities should not \n     have to bear.\n       Finally, I am concerned about potential efforts to amend \n     the Senate bill and federalize many of the harshest \n     provisions from California's Proposition 187. Such an \n     approach would deny services to illegal immigrants without \n     regard to the dangers it would create for American cities. \n     The problems of illegal immigration in our country is the \n     result of the federal government's inability to patrol its \n     borders and implement an effective deportation strategy. \n     Adoption of a federal Proposition 187 will do nothing to \n     address the overall problem of illegal immigration, but \n     instead will further highlight the federal government's \n     failure to enforce adequately our nation's immigration laws \n     and policies.\n       If California's Proposition 187 becomes the law of the \n     land, the results for cities heavily impacted by illegal \n     immigration, such as New York, would be catastrophic. I urge \n     you to consider these possible scenarios. Faced with the \n     threat of deportation, many families would forego needed \n     medical care, keep their children out of school, and refuse \n     to report crime, or act as a witness in criminal cases. \n     Immigrant children kept out of school would be denied their \n     only chance at assimilation and productive futures, and, as a \n     result, many turn to the streets, and illegal activities. \n     Communicable diseases might well would go untreated if \n     immigrants are denied access to treatment. In addition, many \n     crimes would go unreported by illegal immigrants desperate to \n     avoid contact with the police.\n       As the Senate debates welfare reform legislation over the \n     coming days, I am hopeful that the Senate will approve your \n     amendments and remove the bill's burdensome restrictions \n     placed on legal immigrants, and oppose any efforts to \n     federalize Proposition 187. Thank you for your good work on \n     this bill and for your consideration of New York City's views \n     on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Rudolph W. Giuliani,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Conference of State Legislatures, National \n           Governors' Association, National Association of \n           Counties, National League of Cities,\n                                                September 6, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The National Conference of State Legislatures \n     (NCSL), the National Governors' Association (NGA), the \n     National Association of Counties (NACo) and the National \n     League of Cities (NLC) firmly believe that the federal \n     government is responsible for providing funds to pay for the \n     consequences of its immigration policy decisions. As you \n     consider welfare reform legislation on the Senate floor this \n     week, we urge you to support amendments which will protect \n     states and localities from immigration cost-shifts and \n     unfunded mandates. State and local governments cannot and \n     should not be the safety net for federal policy decisions. \n     The federal government has sole jurisdiction over immigration \n     policy and must bear the responsibility to serve the legal \n     immigrants it allows to enter states and localities.\n       Eliminating benefits to legal immigrants or deeming for \n     unreasonably long periods will not eliminate needs. State and \n     local budgets and taxpayers will bear the burden under either \n     of these options. Denial of services to legal immigrants by \n     states and localities appears to violate both state and \n     federal constitutional provisions. As a result of the 1971 \n     Supreme Court decisions Graham v. Richardson, states and \n     localities may not exclude persons from participating in \n     their welfare programs on the basis of lawful alienage. \n     Although the federal government has the option to drop legal \n     immigrants from its welfare rolls, states and localities may \n     not. We continue to support making affidavits of support \n     legally binding and imposing a limited deeming period.\n       We understand that welfare reform proposals are likely to \n     extend sponsor deeming over a broad range of programs not \n     presently covered by deeming restrictions. These proposals \n     are also likely to restrict benefits to some legal immigrants \n     even after they become naturalized citizens. We believe that \n     sponsor deeming should be used in a more targeted fashion to \n     limit the financial and administrative burdens states and \n     localities will face in implementing an extended deeming \n     policy. First, deeming should end when an immigrant becomes a \n     naturalized citizen. Second, deeming should cover cash \n     assistance programs only and not be extended to Medicaid, \n     child protective services, or other non-cash assistance \n     programs. Lastly, certain groups of immigrants should not \n     face deeming under any circumstances, specifically legal \n     immigrants over the age of 75 and those who are victims of \n     domestic violence.\n           Sincrely,\n     William T.

Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes to speak in \nopposition to the amendment of Senator Feinstein.\n  I admire the Senator greatly. She has contributed so much, so \nvigorously, to my efforts and members of the subcommittee.\n  This is an issue of an honest difference of opinion. I oppose the \namendment for several reasons. I hope that my colleague will hear them \nclearly.\n  To begin, I want to put to rest some serious misconceptions about the \nsponsor alien deeming--the ``deeming'' provisions in this bill.\n  Please know that the bill's immigrants provisions do not affect \nanyone in the United States who is already a naturalized citizen. \nPlease hear that.\n  Similarly, noncitizens within the United States who become citizens \nwill also be wholly unaffected by the bill's immigrants provision.\n  Deeming provisions which the Feinstein amendment seeks to alter \naffect only those who immigrate after enactment. This Nation's policy \non welfare used by immigrants should conform, in my mind, to three \nbasic principle: First, the newcomers should be self-supporting. That \nis our Nation's first general immigration law. That was put on the \nbooks in 1882. It prohibited the entry of individuals likely to become \na public charge. To this day our law prevents the immigration of those \nwho are ``likely at any time'' to become a public charge or to use \nwelfare. That is the language--``likely at any time.''\n  Second, if a friend or a relative has promised to the U.S. Government \nthat the newcomer will not require public assistance as a condition of \nthat person's entry into the United States, and that is the condition, \nthen it is the responsibility of that sponsor, that friend or relative \nwho has promised the support, to provide aid before the newcomer turns \nto the American taxpayers for relief.\n  Third, the welfare system should not induce immigrants to naturalize \nfor the wrong reasons; for example, to obtain access to welfare. We \nshould avoid provisions which would enable a recent immigrant to obtain \na benefit or a sponsor to avoid responsibility solely by naturalizing.\n  If we do not require the sponsored individual to disclose this \nparticular asset in this situation--and that is the sponsor's contract \nto provide financial support and have it considered in the welfare \ndetermination--then we are treating the naturalized citizen better than \nwe do the native-born citizen.\n  I hope my colleague will hear that. When native-born citizens apply \nfor welfare, they have to disclose their assets and their income, \nincluding court-mandated payments such as alimony or child support, or \nany contractual obligation.\n  Under the welfare reform bill, a native-born citizen and a \nnaturalized citizen would be treated exactly the same. There is no \nsecond-class citizen status. Both would be required to disclose all \nassets and income which reduce ``the need'' for public assistance.\n  If naturalization enables both the sponsored individual and the \nwelfare provider to ignore an individual's right to receive support \nfrom the sponsor, then the taxpayers will be much more likely, and, of \ncourse, the sponsors less likely, to provide the needed assistance.\n  Also, immigrants would have a very strong incentive to naturalize for \nall of the wrong reasons, and the wrong reasons are to receive public \nassistance.\n  One of the principal reasons for the general animosity toward \nimmigrants' use of welfare is that many naturalized citizens have \nbrought their elderly parents to the United States where after 3 to 5 \nyears, a period of deeming, the immigrant's parents receive SSI for the \nelderly.\n These elderly parents, who have never contributed to our system in any \nway, then receive a generous pension for the rest of their lives from \nthe American taxpayer. And if deeming is ended, simply by \nnaturalization, then the immigrants could receive the welfare just as \nif the sponsor's legalization, or legal obligation, never existed--and \nas early as 5 years after entry, to boot.\n\n  Immigrants, I think, should naturalize because of a personal \ncommitment to the democratic ideals and constitutional principles that \nAmerica represents, and that, namely, is liberty and democracy and \nequal opportunity--not in order to find access and enter into the \nwelfare system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I ask how many minutes are \nremaining of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 5 minutes and \n46 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from California, which would require that the immigrant deeming \nrequirements of the Dole bill end once the immigrant becomes a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  One of the fundamental principles of our Constitution is the equal \ntreatment of all American citizens, regardless of race, sex, creed, or \nnational origin. It is enshrined in the Bill of Rights and the 14th \namendment. The Supreme Court has held repeatedly that there is only one \narea in which naturalized citizens do not have the same rights and \nprivileges as the native-born--and that is in becoming President.\n  The Dole bill departs from this basic American principle. It says \nthat if you are a naturalized citizen of this country and fall on hard \ntimes, the welfare rules that applied to you as an immigrant could \nstill apply. The income of your sponsor can be deemed as your own \nincome in determining your eligibility for assistance, even though you \nare now an American citizen.\n  This is second-class citizenship. This rule does not apply to native-\nborn citizens--only naturalized Americans. If you native-born mother or \nbrother needs Medicaid, the Government does not consider your income in \ndeciding whether they are eligible. But under this bill, if they are \nnaturalized citizens, and if you sponsored them in coming to the United \nStates--even if you did so years ago--the government could still count \nyour income in determining their eligibility for help.\n  At a Justice Department oversight hearing on June 27, I asked \nAttorney General Janet Reno about this proposal. She responded, ``Our \nOffice of Legal Counsel has examined this provision * * * and it has \nvery serious concerns about its constitutionality as applied to \nnaturalized citizens.''\n  An opinion I received from the Justice Department on July 18 \nelaborates on the Attorney General's statement. It says:\n\n       Because the deeming provision in question here as applied \n     to citizens, is directed at and reaches only naturalized \n     citizens, (this) compels the conclusion that it constitutes \n     discrimination against naturalized citizens.\n\n  The opinion further states that:\n\n       As a matter of policy, we think it would be a mistake to \n     begin now to relegate naturalized citizens--who have \n     demonstrated their commitment to our country by undergoing \n     the naturalization process--to a kind of second-class status.\n\n  The Supreme Court has clearly said that distinctions between native-\nborn and naturalized citizens are unconstitutional. In 1964, in \nSchneider versus Rusk, the Court emphasized that ``the rights of \ncitizenship of the native born and of the naturalized person are of the \nsame dignity and are coextensive.''\n  Some argue that in bringing an immigrant to this country, the sponsor \nenters into a contract, promising to assist the immigrant for a \nspecified period, whether or not the immigrant becomes a citizen in the \nmeantime. They argue that this contractual commitment is like a trust--\nand that a trust is considered in determining eligibility for welfare, \nwhether or not the applicant is a native-born citizen or naturalized.\n  However, the fact remains that this kind of arrangement--the deeming \nof a sponsor's income--is one which would only apply to naturalized \ncitizens. For this reason, the Justice Department regards it as \nnational origins discrimination, since--\n\n       Among citizens otherwise eligible for government \n     assistance, the class excluded by operation of the deeming \n     provision is limited to those born outside the United States.\n\n  Those who naturalize and become citizens have made a substantial \ncommitment to this country. They will have been here for at least 6 or \n7 years--5 years to qualify for citizenship and 1 to 2 years to \ncomplete the naturalization process. They are required under our laws \nto have demonstrated\n \n[[Page S 13593]]\n\ngood moral character for the years preceding their naturalization. Most \nlikely, they have worked and paid taxes throughout this period. And \nthey have chosen America as the place to raise their children and build \ntheir futures.\n  American citizens are American citizens, whether by birth or by \nchoice. We should not undermine this fundamental principle of our \nConstitution. I urge the adoption of the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia to ensure that when American citizens fall on hard times, \ntheir Government will be there to help--whether they were born as \nAmericans or are naturalized Americans.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a very hard argument for me \nbecause I very much respect the Senator from Wyoming. He is my chairman \non the committee. I do not think anyone in this body knows more about \nimmigration. I doubt that he drafted the actual language in this bill.\n  All I can say is our reading, and the reading of others of the bill \nitself, indicates to us that the way it is worded, it would in fact \naffect people in this country at this time. The Bureau of the Census \nhas identified 121,000 spouses and children of U.S. citizens who came \ninto this country between 1990 and 1994 who, for starters, would be \nmost definitely affected by this bill.\n  I mentioned earlier that I do not believe that anyone should come to \nthe oath of being an American citizen and take that oath because they \nwant welfare, whether it is cash or noncash. I would support any \nlegislation to toughen the sponsorship requirements to provide for bona \nfide sponsorship. As a matter of fact, when the immigration bill is on \nthe floor, I will offer an amendment to the bill which will provide \nthat a sponsor must be responsible for health insurance for a person \nthey are sponsoring to this country. So I fully believe that a sponsor \nshould be responsible.\n  Where I have the difficulty is in the creation of two classes of \ncitizens, because once it starts, once the camel's nose is under the \ntent, it will not end. And the fact is that a naturalized citizen is \nentitled to all of the rights of citizenship; that is a clearly \nestablished constitutional principle. I believe it will really \njeopardize the constitutionality of this entire bill. It is a major \npoint, I believe.\n  So I say, toughen sponsorship, toughen the naturalization process, do \nwhat you have to do to prevent somebody from using naturalization as a \nguise for some of these things. But once they get there, it must mean \njust what it means for every other citizen.\n  It has been said that an affidavit of support is an asset like a \nchild support order. I do not believe that is true, because having \nassets means one is ineligible for welfare. A child support order is \nnot an asset when determining eligibility for welfare. The welfare \ncaseload is swollen with mothers who cannot collect on child support \norders. Approximately 25 percent of the existing caseload is comprised \nof mothers who cannot collect on child support orders.\n  It has been said that people are not denied welfare because they have \nthis asset. They are eligible for welfare benefits, the cost of which \nis only recovered if the Government is able to collect from the \ndelinquent parent. If naturalized citizens could receive benefits while \nthe Government attempts to collect from the sponsor, then the situation \nwould be analogous. But that is not what the Dole bill says. And even \nif it did say that, it would still be treating naturalized citizens \ndifferently from native-born citizens. Denying assistance because there \nis an uncollected asset is not equal treatment under the law.\n  So let me repeat: A native-born citizen is denied welfare benefits \nonly if there are assets available to the applicant. Just as a child \nsupport order which is uncollected is not an available asset, an \naffidavit of support on the naturalized citizen which is unable to be \ncollected would not be an available asset. True, the Government could \nattempt to collect later, as with a child support order, but in the \nmeantime, under the Dole bill, the applicant who is now a U.S. citizen \nwould be denied assistance. So I believe that is wrong.\n  Let me speak for a moment to the 40 quarters of work and the \ncontribution to the system. This affects the homemaker who does not \nwork in a two-parent family. If the mother does not work, is supported \nby her husband, and her husband leaves, it is a major problem. \nSimilarly, if you were an infant when your parents immigrated, you \nwould not be eligible for benefits until you reached your 30's. That is \nhardly equal treatment.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have used my time. I thank the Chair and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 25 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I really appreciate the thoughts of my \nfriend from California and will look forward to working with her on the \nissues of the sponsorship. I think that is a key thing. I think we can \nstrengthen that, and I will look forward to working with her on that \nand on things such as insurance or support, releasing those who are not \nable to pay or be sponsors, perhaps setting a poverty level there. We \ncan do those things.\n  But I emphasize, too, we always get into immigration matters. Every \none of us is a child or a grandchild or a great-grandchild of \nimmigrants. That is my history, my heritage, my roots. And it is most \ninteresting to me when I hear the discussion of the second-class \ncitizen. I agree totally with my friend from California; there is no \ndistinction between a naturalized citizen and a native-born citizen \nexcept the Constitution. This certainly does not draw the distinction. \nIf there is a difference here, it is a difference expressed only by the \nsponsor of the amendment, because we are treating them exactly the \nsame. We are treating the naturalized citizen and the native-born \ncitizen exactly the same under this.\n  I agree we should not in any way treat them differently, treat them \nas second-class citizens. Treat them the same. So here, in this case, \nas the bill is drafted, a native-born citizen today must disclose all \nassets when applying for welfare and the naturalized citizen should \nalso, likewise, disclose all assets as well.\n  One of the assets of the person to be naturalized is a contract of \ntheir sponsor that they will take care of them. It is the same as a \ncourt-ordered sponsor agreement. It is the same as any other thing, any \nother obligation of life. The sponsor's contract of support is an asset \nof the naturalized citizen, just as alimony or a child support \nagreement is an asset that must also be considered.\n  We treat the naturalized citizen no differently than we do the native \nborn. Both must present all of their assets while seeking public \nassistance. That is the intent of the legislation in its original form. \nIf the sponsor loses his or her assets and income--please hear this--\nthe deeming period is over. If the sponsor dies, the deeming period is \nover. If the sponsor has too little wherewithal or assets to assist the \nimmigrant, to help with school or whatever, the deeming then will not \nreduce the applicant's ability to receive this assistance.\n It is very critical that we hear these distinctions.\n\n  What is the remainder of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 11 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator \nFeinstein. I welcome these expressions to toughen the sponsor's promise \nthat he or she will ``not at any time''--that is the law--permit the \nsponsored immigrant to become a public charge. That, in my mind, is a \nvery key phrase. To me in this debate it means before naturalization \nand after naturalization.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators Simon, Kohl, and Graham as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays and for \nthe vote to be set in the order of voting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the vote is set for 8 \no'clock in sequence.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that the votes that we originally \nasked \n\n[[Page S 13594]]\nfor to occur starting at 8 be postponed until 8:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, therefore, at that batting order, we will \nhave the Shelby, Mikulski, and Feinstein amendments. And I know the \nSenator from California has another amendment, followed by Senator \nConrad. But I want to work in a Republican. Senator DeWine was \navailable. I do not see him now. So why do we not go with the second \nFeinstein amendment, and then work in a Republican Senator, Senator \nDeWine, and then Senator Conrad, if that is agreeable?\n  I say to everybody that it is not necessary to prove one's \ncredentials by having an amendment. Everybody is a full-fledged \nSenator, and we recognize that. We will continue to recognize that even \nthough they do not come forward with an amendment on this piece of \nlegislation. At the rate we are going, we are going to be here a long, \nlong time. I mean this evening a long time. Every time I turn around \nsomebody comes up with an additional amendment. Usually Senators stand \nhere and say, ``Bring over your amendments. We are waiting to do \nbusiness.'' Well, we have too much business to do here. So we are not \nseeking additional amendments. So everybody just call a halt to the \namendment business so we can get to final passage.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio has arrived. So if the Senator from \nCalifornia will just delay, we will go ahead with Senator DeWine's \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time is he asking for?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask that we have 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am not sure who will speak on this side. But it is \nagreed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not know what the amendment is. Maybe somebody on \nthis side will oppose it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Do I understand from the acting manager that after we \nhave disposed of the DeWine amendment and the final Feinstein \namendment, we would then go to the Conrad-Lieberman amendment and \ndispose of that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe we erred in the description of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island as an acting manager. I think he is very \nmuch a manager.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Titles mean nothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2517, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 2517, and I send the modified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 2517), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 637, line 17, strike the period and insert ``, as \n     provided pursuant to agreements described in subsection \n     (a)(18).\n       On page 712, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 972. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DATA MATCHES.\n\n       Section 466(a) (42 U.S.C. 666(a)), as amended by sections \n     915, 917(a), 923, 965, 969, and 976 is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(18) Procedures under which the State agency shall enter \n     into agreements with financial institutions doing business \n     within the State to develop and operate a data match system, \n     using automated data exchanges to the maximum extent \n     feasible, in which such financial institutions are required \n     to provide for each calendar quarter the name, record \n     address, social security number, and other identifying \n     information for each absent parent identified by the State \n     who maintains an account at such institution and, in response \n     to a notice of lien or levy, to encumber or surrender, as the \n     case may be, assets held by such institution on behalf of any \n     absent parent who is subject to a child support lien pursuant \n     to paragraph (4). For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     `financial institution' means Federal and State commercial \n     savings banks, including savings and loan associations and \n     cooperative banks, Federal and State chartered credit unions, \n     benefit associations, insurance companies, safe deposit \n     companies, money-market mutual funds, and any similar entity \n     authorized to do business in the State, and the term \n     `account' means a demand deposit account, checking or \n     negotiable withdrawal order account, savings account, time \n     deposit account, or money-market mutual fund account.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as we are modifying amendments, I wonder \nif we might also modify an amendment that Senator Gramm submitted \nearlier. That is a modification to amendment No. 2280.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that request. The Senator from Ohio may go \nahead.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one of the reasons that our welfare costs \ntoday are so high is the number of absent deadbeat parents who, in \nspite of a court order, in spite of judicial determination that they \nowe weekly or monthly child support, still flagrantly refuse to pay \nchild support. This amendment goes a long way, I believe, to help deal \nwith this problem.\n  Let me take just a moment, if I could, to congratulate Senator Dole \nand to congratulate everyone else who has been directly involved in \nthis bill because the child support enforcement section is a very good \nsection. It was written after consultation with experts in the field, \npeople who deal with this every day out in the 50 States who have to \nface the problem of trying to track down these deadbeat parents and \nthen after they find them trying to figure out how to get money from \nthem.\n  This particular amendment that I am offering was also based on our \nconsultation with experts in the field, particularly the State of \nMassachusetts, which has some very, very good success. In fact, this \nparticular amendment was modeled after what Massachusetts is doing.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make it easier for States to \ncrack down on deadbeat parents. We, of course, are all aware, Mr. \nPresident, that one of the key causes of our social breakdown is the \nfailure of parents to be responsible for their own children. The family \nought to be the school for citizenship, preparing the children for a \nresponsible and productive life. Too often it is just the opposite, and \nparents do not do that. When they do not pay their child support, it is \ncertainly very difficult for society to step in and fill the gap. We \nneed to reconnect parenthood and responsibility, and making absent \nparents pay is one way that we can do it. We need to help States locate \ndeadbeat parents and help States establish support orders for the \nchildren, and then finally enforce these orders. My amendment attempts \nto address this problem by providing for a more timely sharing of \ninformation with the States.\n  As I said at the beginning, it is good to get the child support \norder. It is good to locate the parent. But if you cannot figure out \nwhere the parent's assets are, it does not do anyone any good. It does \nnot do the children any good. It does not do society any good. So what \nthis amendment is aimed at doing is making it easier to locate the \nassets of the parents.\n  Today, Mr. President, the Federal Parent Locater Service in the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services gives the States banking and \nasset information about potential deadbeats on an annual basis--once a \nyear.\n  Now, if you go out into the States and talk with people who have to \ntrack down these deadbeats, they will tell you how difficult that whole \nprocess is. I first became involved in this a number of years ago, in \nthe early 1970's when I was a county prosecuting attorney. I cannot \ntell you how frustrating it was. You got a support order. You got a \njudge to say the person owed so much money. And then they took off. You \ncould not find them. Then after you found them, you could not figure \nout where their assets were.\n  This amendment will help in that area. If you have to wait, Mr. \nPresident, a whole year to get the information about the bank assets of \nan individual, sometimes a year and a half, obviously many times that \ninformation is stale and many times that information does not give you \nthe true information you really need. The person may have moved. They \nmay have changed banks. They may not have any assets in the bank, et \ncetera.\n  My amendment will allow States to enter into agreements with the \nfinancial community in their States to match financial data with child \nsupport delinquency lists on a more frequent basis. Not only will \nStates get information on an annual basis, this \n\n[[Page S 13595]]\namendment will allow for more timely information on a quarterly basis.\n  This quarterly system has already been implemented in the State of \nMassachusetts and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal, \nwhich this chart indicates. In 1994, Massachusetts child support \nenforcers collected $2.7 million in past due child support. This year, \nMassachusetts began a quarterly reporting system, and collections have \ndramatically increased. At the current rate, their child support \ncollections for 1995 will be at $9.6 million. That, Mr. President, is \nmore than three times what they collected last year. The year before, \n$2.7 million; this year, $9.6 million.\n  Let me congratulate and also thank Marilyn Smith, who is the director \nof the Massachusetts Child Support Enforcement Agency, who worked with \nmy office and with Dwayne Sattler of my office and the rest of my staff \nto really get the language down so that other States would be able to \ndo what Massachusetts has done.\n  So, Mr. President, when you are looking at what works and what does \nnot work, this works. In short, when child support enforcers have \ntimely information, they can make deadbeat parents pay what they owe, \nand that means more parents responsible for their children.\n  We have received the CBO scoring on this amendment, and it will be at \nleast revenue neutral. As someone who has worked in this field and did \nthis for a number of years, let me tell you my guess is it is going to \nbe a lot better than revenue neutral. This is going to be a very \npositive thing for each State. I believe it will save money for the \nFederal Treasury as more and more parents own up to their financial \nresponsibility of having children.\n  This amendment is cost-effective and it is necessary. The child \nsupport enforcers are doing a very tough and difficult job, facing \nhorrible obstacles every single day. I think we should cut by 75 \npercent, which is what this amendment does, the amount of time they \nhave to wait to get this valuable information. Information is power, \nthey say, but in this case information is money. So if you get the \ninformation on time, you take the court order, you go in, slap a lien \non the bank account, you draw the money out, and guess what? That \ndeadbeat parent has now started contributing his or her fair share not \njust to that family, which is the most important thing, but also to \nsociety as well.\n  That is why I believe my amendment will do a great deal of good. I \nurge it be adopted.\n  Mr. President, let me just clarify for the record that the amendment \nthat I am modifying is amendment 2517 and not 2519.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President I would like to ask the sponsor of the \namendment a couple of questions.\n  Under the amendment as I read it, it is an option for the State; it \nis not mandatory. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Second, the amendment says that the State shall enter \ninto agreements with financial institutions to develop and operate a \ndata match system.\n  I understand under this the State would bring a list of those who are \ndelinquent to the bank instead of the bank having to provide the State \nwith the name of everybody who had a deposit in that bank. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct.\n  If the Senator will yield, what we have done with this is to try to \nmodel the Massachusetts program. What Massachusetts has been able to do \nis to work out, it is my understanding, an agreement between the \nprivate banking community and the State to have a system that is not \noverly burdensome on the banking community; it is something that they \ncan live with but something also that gives the information to the \npeople who need it and give it in a very timely fashion.\n  Let me just say that one of the things we did, Mr. President, is we \nchecked with the Ohio banking community, just to try it out. We said, \nwould you be willing to do something like this? And the answer was, we \nare citizens of the State and we want to be good corporate citizens. We \nwant to help out. It is something we can live with. If it is not overly \nburdensome and is directed at dealing with the problem, we are more \nthan happy to comply.\n  What will happen, as the Senator knows, many times people move from \nState to State. With all States doing this, we will have in the law the \nsystem where the States can share information.\n  And so what I would anticipate once this system is fully up is that \nnot only in Ohio would you basically get this information, but if a \nperson took off and went to Connecticut or Rhode Island or Arizona, \nthat information could be shared by cooperating with that State.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As I read the amendment, it is not optional for the bank \nto participate if the State decides that they want the bank to \nparticipate. In other words, as I read the amendment, it says that the \nState shall work out agreements with the banks to develop a data match \nsystem in which such institutions are required to provide every \nquarter, et cetera.\n  So it is not just an encouragement. It is a requirement if the State \nso chooses.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I can see this being extremely burdensome for the bank if \neach quarter they have to come up with everybody who has a deposit in \nthe bank that appears on some list the State submits to them.\n  I presume the banks are permitted to charge something for all this.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Absolutely. What will happen on a practical basis is what \nhas happened in Massachusetts and what I am sure would happen in Ohio, \nand that is, quite frankly, the State officials would enter into an \nagreement with the banking association, whoever represents all the \nbanks in the State, for something that is actually very, very workable.\n  As someone who has dealt with this at the local community level, if \nyou do not have the cooperation of a bank, if they do not want to do \nthis, you are going to have a lot of problems. And so you have to have \nthe good will of the bank. And to get the good bill of the bank, what \nyou simply do is work out something that they clearly can in fact live \nwith.\n  The other point I would make to the Senator is that we are not \ntalking about huge lists being supplied to a bank. We are talking about \nbasically a single shot where you go in with a limited list and that \nwould only be triggered basically once the parent locater, whatever \nthat agency was in the State, had information that that person might be \nin that bank's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, I am not sure it is so simple as all that. It comes \nup every quarter, four times a year. But I am not on the Banking \nCommittee. This is the kind of thing that I really wish had gone \nthrough the Banking Committee and let them have hearings on it, and let \nthem know what the costs are and what the problems are that arise under \nit.\n  I do not know whether anybody else wants to speak on this. Does the \nSenator want a vote on this?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I just could say, we have worked closely with people \nin the banking community. And I do appreciate the Senator's comments \nabout not having a hearing on it. I understand that. But this amendment \nis based on matching computer tapes, basically a computer match with \ntapes, which we are told is not, with today's technology, really much \nof a burden. It is not the creation and not asking for the creation of \na new list. It is a computer match with tapes to get this particular \njob done.\n  I also say that if a person wanted to get a court order in every \ncase, they could go in and get a court order for the bank records \nanyway on a case-by-case basis. That is not the right way to do it. \nThis, we believe, is the right way to do it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I tell you what. We may be in a position to take this \namendment. Why does not the Senator ask for the yeas and nays? And if \nhe would be willing to vitiate those yeas and nays, if we can take it. \nWe have got to check. Why not ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will at this point, Mr. President, ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? \n\n[[Page S 13596]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back the remaining time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I do, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now we will go to the second amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And I thank the bill manager.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2513\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment involves deeming. It is \na complicated issue. Let me try and explain it simply. It only involves \nlegal aliens.\n  Presently, deeming only applies to cash programs, AFDC, SSI, food \nstamps. This amendment would remove the deeming requirements for \nFederal programs not traditionally considered Federal welfare programs. \nIt would retain the deeming for the three principal Federal cash \nwelfare programs: AFDC, SSI, and food stamps.\n  Under the bill, a child of a legal immigrant would not have access to \nHead Start; a legal immigrant would not have access to Medicaid, would \nnot have access to child protective services, would not have access to \nmaternal health services, would not have access to foster care, would \nnot have access to custodial care. All of these programs deemed--excuse \nme, not deemed--but all these programs which are noncash programs would \nnot be available for anyone who was in this country legally.\n  The amendment also provides that no one in this country legally who \nis a battered wife could ever make use of a domestic abuse program, a \nbattered wife shelter. There are actually some 80 programs that provide \nnoncash assistance, and I have named most of them. The most important \none of these is Medicaid.\n  Everyone in this room has heard Governors across this Nation bellow \nthat the Federal Government is not dealing with the costs of immigrants \nto the States. Every one of them says this, that has the program.\n  Essentially, the way the bill is drafted, it is a massive cost-shift \nto States because it says that the county then has to pick up these \ncosts. The county would have to pick up the costs of Head Start if a \nyoungster was going to go into it. The county would have to pick up the \ncosts of Medicaid or the State. The county would have to pick up the \ncosts of child protective services or foster care or any of those \nitems.\n  It is a major item. And I will be candid and frank with you; it falls \nmost heavily on four States. It falls heavily on Texas, it falls \nheavily on Florida, it falls heavily on New York, and it falls heavily \non California. And that is because that is where the largest \npercentages of these legal immigrants are.\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier in the earlier discussion, I believe we \nshould tighten the sponsorship requirements. I believe we should see \nthat they are secure, even verify what they say. And I intend to \nintroduce legislation that would provide that sponsors of immigrants \nmust provide health insurance for those immigrants. But here we are \nwith a situation that exists really creating a massive unfunded \nmandate, particularly in the area of legal immigration.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors' Association, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association \nof Counties, the National League of Cities, the United States Catholic \nConference, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Mayor Giuliani, \nMayor Riordan, and many other people as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe National Governors' Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 13, 1995.\n       Dear Senator, As the Senate considers amendments to the \n     Work Opportunity Act of 1995, the National Governors' \n     Association [NGA] urges you to support increased flexibility \n     that will enable states to build upon the experiences of \n     state welfare reform efforts around the country and to design \n     programs in accord with their particular needs and \n     priorities. We have provided below a partial list of \n     amendments that are supported by the NGA. This list is not \n     meant to be exhaustive, and there may be other amendments \n     Governors support that are not on this list.\n       We urge you to support these amendments based on the \n     recommendations of the nation's Governors, who will have \n     direct responsibility for meeting the challenge of designing \n     successful welfare-to-work and child care systems:\n       State penalties under cash assistance block grant. (Pryor \n     #2495, McCain #2542) Delays the implementation of penalties \n     until October 1, 1996 or six months after the date the \n     Secretary issues the final rule, whichever is later. Provides \n     that the five percent penalty for unlawful use of funds can \n     only be imposed if the Secretary determines the violation was \n     intentional. Permits states with penalties to submit to the \n     federal government a corrective action plan to correct \n     violations in lieu of paying penalties under the cash \n     assistance block grant.\n       Technical amendments. (D'Amato #2577, 2578, 2579) Technical \n     amendments relating to the date for determining FY 1994 \n     expenditures, claims arising before effective dates and \n     efforts to recover funds from previous fiscal years.\n       Equal treatment for naturalized citizens. (Feinstein #2478, \n     Kennedy #2563) Provides for equal treatment for naturalized \n     and native-born citizens so that once an individual becomes a \n     citizen he or she will be eligible for benefits whether or \n     not the deeming period has expired.\n       Sponsor deeming. (Feinstein #2513) Limits deeming of \n     sponsors' income to those programs for which deeming is now \n     required under current law (AFDC, Food Stamps and SSI). \n     Additionally exempts legal immigrants who have been victims \n     of domestic violence from the 1) ban on SSI assistance and 2) \n     deeming requirements for all programs.\n       Prospective application of legal immigrant provisions. \n     (Graham #2569) Provides that any changes with respect to \n     legal immigrants made by this bill will not apply to \n     noncitizens who are lawfully present in the United States and \n     receiving benefits under a program on the date of enactment. \n     (Simon, #2509) Eliminates retroactive deeming requirements \n     for legal immigrants already in the U.S.\n       ``Good cause'' hardship waiver. (Rockefeller #2492) Gives \n     states the option of granting exceptions to the 5-year life-\n     time limit and the participation rate calculation for \n     individuals who are ill, incapacitated, or elderly, as well \n     as for recipients who are providing full-time care for their \n     disabled dependents.\n       High unemployment areas exemption. (Rockefeller #2491) \n     Gives states the option of waiving time limits in area of \n     high unemployment (ten percent or more). Recipients must \n     participate in workfare or community work to continue \n     benefits.\n       Vocational educational training. (Jeffords #2557) Changes \n     the definition of work activities to allow vocational \n     education to count as an eligible activity of up to 24 \n     months.\n       Data reporting requirements. (McCain #2541) Provides that \n     states are not required to comply with excessive data \n     collection and reporting requirements, as determined by GAO, \n     unless the federal government provides sufficient funds to \n     meet the costs.\n       Work supplementation. (McCain #2280) Removes the six month \n     limit for an individual's participation in a work \n     supplementation program under the food stamp program.\n       Cash aid in lieu of food stamps. (Faircloth #2600) Allows a \n     state agency to make cash payments in lieu of food stamps for \n     certain individuals.\n       Hardship waiver. (Kennedy #2623) Permits states to apply \n     for waivers with respect to the 15 percent cap on hardship \n     exemptions from the five-year time limit.\n       Assistance to children. (Kennedy #2624) Permits states to \n     provide non-cash assistance to children ineligible for aid \n     because of the five-year time limit.\n       Modification of participation rate (DeWine #2518) Permits a \n     pro rata reduction in a state's participation rate due to \n     caseload reductions not required by federal law or due to \n     changes in a state's eligibility criteria.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gov. Bob Miller,\n                                                  State of Nevada.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and the \ntime to be equally charged against--\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield time to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. \n\n[[Page S 13597]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I just came to the floor many minutes ago to debate a \ndifferent amendment. But I see apparently there is no one on the other \nside of this, and that should not go untended. If I may then speak in \nopposition to the amendment, that, first of all, this amendment is not \nabout domestic violence and the other tragedies that visit upon our \nNation.\n  I have found--and I share with my colleague from California that on \nthese issues of immigration, filled with emotion, fear, guilt and \nracism, your colleagues during the entire day say, ``Alan, we are very \npleased to assist you in all this work.'' But when it comes time to \nstand on the floor, they are absent in great droves--droves--I have \nfound, because these are not popular issues.\n  How about cash assistance, noncash assistance? The Senate has already \naccepted an amendment from Senator Wellstone which will address all \nconcerns about violence, domestic violence, all that. That is clear. \nThat has already been done somewhere along the line. This amendment \nexempts all noncash programs from all of the immigration-related \nprovisions within this entire welfare bill.\n  The cost of it is $707 million. We are never going to reach the \nreconciliation instructions with this welfare bill. And the Finance \nCommittee has now been charged--there are some on the floor. Senator \nBradley serves on that committee. Of all the savings to be obtained in \nreconciliation, $607 billion are to be saved. And the Finance Committee \nis supposed to find a way to save $503 billion or $530 billion of that.\n  This welfare bill has already taken us over the jumps. Senator \nSantorum will tell you that, the occupant of the chair--yes, yes, the \noccupant of the chair will tell you that we are a little bit over our \nmark. And we have done that out of charity and kindness and caring. And \nthat is fine; those are good motives. But we are way over the target \nwith this bill.\n  Now, this amendment exempts all noncash programs and, as I say, all \nof the immigration-related provisions within this bill.\n  Before a prospective immigrant may enter the United States, that \nperson must guarantee that he or she will not use public assistance, I \nsay to my colleagues. That has been the law of the United States since \n1882. It never worked because the court systems, in their \ninterpretation of it, made it simply a neutered statute.\n  So you could not prove anything. The deeming was overturned and \nsponsoring agencies scoffed at it, relatives scoffed at it. So what was \na very precious thing--and it is still on the books, since 1882, that a \nperson will not become a public charge when they come to the United \nStates of America. That person indicates by oath that they will not, \nand the sponsor is indicating that they will not allow that usually \nprecious relative to become a public charge.\n  So, finally, in the Finance Committee, we corrected this abuse, a \nterrible abuse of the system, the kind of thing that makes people sour \non immigration, sour on our precious heritage. That is what happens \nhere.\n  So, in turn, we have this measure which requires immigrants to look \nfirst to the sponsor, this friend or this relative who guaranteed this \nsupport. They did this. They could not bring them unless they did this.\n  So we were saying in the bill, before receiving any public \nassistance, the sponsor is responsible for you, and his income is \ndeemed to be yours for purposes of this. In the public's interest, the \nDole bill then exempted certain limited programs, such as childhood \nimmunizations and school lunch. I have no problem with that at all.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment would exempt all noncash programs. This \nincludes Medicaid, public housing, job training and any other program \nwhich does not provide cash assistance to the recipient.\n  That is where we are. I have a hunch where this amendment will go. It \nwill be well received, but it is $707 million, and we are going to have \nto go find that somewhere in this process. Guess where it will come \nfrom, very likely? Medicaid. That is where it will come from, unless \nsomeone can tell me another approach to it.\n  So here we are again with an immigration-related issue which has to \ndo with compassion, kindness, tenderness. I know those things. Those \nare emotions not foreign to me, but I also know how this works. It is a \ngreat infertile field to just add and add and add. Sponsors have \ncommitted that the sponsored immigrant will neither require nor use \nassistance from the taxpayers of this country from any Federal welfare \nprogram, and that is the law of the United States of America.\n  To be consistent, all Federal welfare programs should require the \nsponsored immigrant to look to this friend or this relative or this \nsponsoring agency for assistance before turning to the American \ntaxpayer for support.\n  We are not talking about illegal, undocumented persons who we care \nfor with emergency medical assistance and hospital assurance. We are \ntalking about people who are playing on the up and up when they came, \nsponsors who were playing on the up and up when they came, which was a \nvery simple procedure: ``You come, I'll take care of you until you \nbecome self-supporting.'' That is the law of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  You keep making these exemptions, and now we have to go find $707 \nmillion. I wish it were not a money item. It certainly is more than a \nmoney item. It is called responsibility for those you bring to the \nUnited States of America as a sponsor under the law of the United \nStates.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, bottom line, this bill as drafted, without this \namendment, is a massive cost shift. As I said, the costs are shifted \nessentially to four States: Texas, Florida, New York, and California.\n  What this bill says presently is no one in this country legally who \nis not a citizen can send their child to a Head Start Program, can be \non Medicaid. It is not prospective. It affects everybody presently. \nThat is why it is a cost shift. It would be one thing if it were \nprospective and said in the future, but it does not. It says to every \nlegal immigrant's child out there that is in a Head Start class, ``Next \nyear, forget it, you are no longer there.'' That is essentially the \nbottom line. Or somebody in the State has to pay for it, either the \nState or the county.\n  California has a huge deficit. According to the General Accounting \nOffice, California also has 38.2 percent of all legal immigrants, but \n52.4 percent of all immigrants receiving Federal welfare. New York has \n12.6 percent; Florida, 8.9 percent; Texas, 8.6 percent; and other \nStates, 31.7 percent. So you see, there is a huge cost shift in dollars \nfrom the Federal Government to the States.\n  That involves adoption assistance, it involves foster care, it \ninvolves child protective services. Can you believe it? If a child is \nbeing abused, the protective services are not going to be available if \nthey are a legal immigrant? We passed legislation earlier--Senator \nExon's amendment--overwhelmingly for people here illegally, and I agree \nwith that. But these people are here legally and, therefore, I find the \nbill egregious as it stands right now.\n  Again, I am hopeful--and I would say, toughen sponsorship, look at \npeople coming more carefully in this regard. I do not have a problem \nwith that. But this is going to affect large numbers of people who are \nalready in this country.\n  Eighty-three percent of all the immigrants receiving SSI or AFDC \nresided in the four States. AFDC and SSI are not covered by this \namendment. It is only the noncash benefits, and I think I have spelled \nthose out.\n  I do not know if there is anyone who would like to speak on this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The implications of this are extremely significant with \nregard to the urban hospitals, are they not, especially where there are \nmajor \n\n[[Page S 13598]]\ngroupings of urban hospitals that primarily take care of the poor, the \ndisadvantaged and many of the immigrants as well? We find situations \nwhere even though there are relatives and other members of the family \nthat might be able to participate in helping to offset the costs, an \nincreasing number of people are becoming uninsured, through no fault of \ntheir own. Therefore, their relatives do not have the ability to extend \nthe coverage to these individuals. That is taking place among \nimmigrants who are here legally. And in many instances, sponsors have \nabandoned them, even though they have a responsibility toward the \nimmigrants they sponsor, and these immigrants are really left holding \nthe bag. As a result, the urban hospitals and health providers will be \nleft holding the bag as well.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that without the Senator's amendment, \nthere will be extreme additional stress placed on the health care \nproviders, particularly in some of the neediest areas of the country?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I think particularly the public hospitals in the urban \ncenters are going to be whacked in the head unless this amendment is \nadopted, because a large percentage of patients comprise this \npopulation and there would be no reimbursements, no Medicaid.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Who will end up paying for it then?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The county or the State would have to find a way. It \nis a cost shift.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that the vote scheduled for 8:30 be \npostponed until the conclusion of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is my understanding--and I would like \nto ask the Senator from Wyoming this--in the case of domestic violence \ninflicted by the ``deemor,'' that has been taken care of, as I \nunderstand it, by the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Oh, yes, that is true. The Wellstone amendment took care \nof battered women and foster children, without question.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Am I also correct that the suggestion was made by the \nSenator from California that it would be impossible for a legal alien's \nchild to be in a Head Start program? As I understand it, if the \n``deemor's'' assets were not of significant value, the child is not \nprevented from being in a Head Start program, is he or she?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That was taken care of very nicely by Senator Kennedy. \nWe agreed to exempt Head Start and soup kitchens. That has been done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If I might complete my questions. In connection with the \nfoster care problems, the Boxer amendment, I believe, addressed them, \nam I correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as far as I know, that, too, is also \ntrue, yes. But, Mr. President, there is another issue. The bill itself \nprovides that there is a year period--an entire year--if a person is \nabused, if there is no money, if the sponsored individual is not there, \nor whatever may happen, it says that in the absence of assistance \nprovided by the agency, if someone is unable to obtain food and \nshelter, taking into account the individual's own income, plus any \ncash, that is taken care of in this measure for 12 months--without \nquestion, whatever the reason. So this is not a case of some draconian \nbusiness where we delight in taking people and waiting and suddenly see \nthem fall into disarray and then whacking them or hitting them in the \nhead. What will get hit in the head is Medicaid with this one.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Does the Senator from California want a vote on her \namendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we were to vote at 8:30.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF \n                   STATUTORY RAPE LAWS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that States and local \n     jurisdictions should aggressively enforce statutory rape \n     laws.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nPryor, Bradley, and Kerry of Massachusetts appear as original \ncosponsors in addition to Senator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment promotes a comprehensive \nstrategy that prevents teen pregnancy. Mr. President, if there is one \nagreement on both sides of the aisle, it is that teen pregnancy is a \ncrisis in America. One out of three children being born today are born \nout of wedlock. In some cities of America, two out of three children \nbeing born are born out of wedlock. Here in the Nation's capital, this \nyear, more than two out of three children are being born out of \nwedlock.\n  Teen pregnancy is a critical challenge. It is a tragedy for America. \nIt is a tragedy for the children. It is a tragedy for the young women. \nIt is a tragedy for our entire country.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, there were more than a half million births to \nteenagers, and 71 percent of those births were to unmarried parents. \nThe Conrad-Lieberman amendment is designed as a comprehensive strategy \nto take on this challenge.\n  Mr. President, the Conrad-Lieberman amendment does the following:\n  It provides $150 million over 7 years for States to develop adult-\nsupervised living arrangements. I call them ``second-chance homes.'' \nThey are places where young, unmarried mothers can get the structure \nand supervision they need to turn their lives around.\n  It retains the requirement that teen parents live with their parents \nor another responsible adult.\n  It requires that they stay in school.\n  It establishes a national goal to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancy to \nteens by 2 percent a year.\n  It encourages communities to establish their own teen pregnancy \nprevention goals.\n  Finally, it calls for the aggressive prosecution of men who have sex \nwith girls under the age of 18.\n  Mr. President, I think the most compelling testimony before the \nFinance Committee was from Sister Mary Rose McGeady, the head of \nCovenant House. She has been in the trenches, she has fought this \nbattle, and she has been succeeding. They have dealt with hundreds of \nyoung mothers who have come into their facilities and have had the \nstructure, the support, and the discipline, and the help in seeing \nthemselves as having a future, the vision to see that they could do \nsomething more with their lives, if they did not have another child \nbefore they were able to care for it. Sister Mary Rose reported that \nthey have been very successful in preventing those young women from \nhaving another child.\n  Mr. President, I read in the Record yesterday the statement of Elena, \na young woman in New York who was in one of these second-chance homes. \nI will repeat her statement:\n\n       I feel this is a place where I can get my life together. I \n     am getting my education and learning to work. My mother never \n     cared if I went to school, and she never told me about having \n     babies or being a parent. The people here and the programs \n     here are helping me. I am learning to be a teacher's \n     assistant so that I can go to college and start my own \n     business and get off of public assistance.\n      I needed this chance.\n\n  Elena is not alone. There are others like her that need a chance.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a statement of \nBishop John Ricard, Chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee, United \nStates Catholic Conference, a statement of Catholic Charities USA also \nbe printed in the Record, and a National Council of Churches of Christ \nin the USA, a statement in support of the amendment, also be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being on objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of Bishop John H. Ricard, SSJ, Chair, Domestic Policy \n              Committee, United States Catholic Conference\n\n       We are pleased to offer our support and encouragement to \n     the efforts of Senator Conrad and others to provide \n     education, training and adult supervision to teen parents as \n     part of welfare reform in the Senate. We are hopeful that \n     this approach will be adopted rather than the cut-off of all \n     benefits to teen parents which some Senators are proposing. \n     We opposed such measures in the House welfare reform bill.\n       In its March 1995 welfare reform statement, the Catholic \n     Bishops' Conference Administrative Board urged that \n     alternatives be proposed ``which safeguard children but do \n     not reinforce inappropriate or morally destructive \n     behavior.'' The Bishops went on to state that the Catholic \n     Church works every day against sexual irresponsibility and \n     out-of-wedlock births and they do not believe that teenagers \n     should be encouraged to set up their own households. At the \n     same time, however, the statement criticized legislation \n     which would deny benefits to children born to teen parents, \n     especially in states that pay for abortions. We believe that \n     the Conrad Amendment goes a long way towards providing \n     appropriate options for teen parents who \n\n[[Page S 13600]]\n     are eligible for assistance without encouraging them to resort to \n     abortion.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  National Council of the Churches\n\n\n                                         of Christ in the USA,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n  Statement on Provisions Related to Teen Pregnancy in Welfare Reform \n                              Legislation\n\n    (By Mary Anderson Cooper, Associate Director, Washington Office)\n\n       As people of faith and religious commitment, we in the \n     churches are called to stand with and seek justice for people \n     who are poor. We share a conviction, therefore, that welfare \n     reform must not focus on eliminating programs but on \n     eliminating poverty and the damage it inflicts on children \n     (who are \\2/3\\ of all welfare recipients), on their parents, \n     and on the rest of society.\n       We are particularly concerned that children not be \n     victimized by attempts at welfare reform. We reject proposals \n     which would deny benefits to children born to unmarried \n     mothers under the age of 18 in the name of preventing teen \n     pregnancy. Although such proposals are focused on the \n     desirable goal of reducing pregnancy outside of marriage, we \n     believe that they would result in punishing children and \n     their parents. Denying cash benefits for such families will \n     inevitably mean that the children and their mothers will eat \n     less well and live less well than they would have if they had \n     received cash benefits, and that their health will be \n     undermined. Whatever we may feel about the behavior or \n     situation of their parents, as a nation we must not allow \n     children to become the victims of a drive to reduce federal \n     spending or to punish their parents for conduct deemed \n     inappropriate by Congress.\n       While we oppose denial of benefits to children born to \n     unmarried mothers, we do not believe that remaining silent on \n     the issue of teen pregnancy is helpful. The bearing of \n     children outside of marriage has reached nearly epidemic \n     proportions in this country. Both children and their parents \n     suffer as a result of this situation. There is much scholarly \n     evidence to suggest that despair about the future is one of \n     the things that leads young women to give birth before they \n     are able to care for their children in a stable family \n     setting. It is our belief that providing young people with \n     genuine hope for their futures is one key way of discouraging \n     adolescent pregnancies. Education, job training, and creation \n     of employment opportunity are components of that hope, as is \n     having the chance to relate to caring adults.\n       The amendment being proposed by Sen. Conrad and his \n     colleagues goes a long way toward meeting our concern about \n     providing education and a chance at a decent future and \n     discouraging future pregnancies outside of marriage. By \n     providing cash benefits to allow young mothers to stay at \n     home with their parents and finish high school, the amendment \n     removes the incentive for them to set up separate, \n     unsupervised living arrangements. Their is legitimate concern \n     about the safety of young mothers who are in abusive \n     households; but Sen. Conrad's amendment contains thoughtful \n     provisions to allow such individuals to leave inappropriate \n     homes to live in other supervised setting with caring adults. \n     We particularly commend this flexibility.\n       We recognize that the federal deficit must be reduced. \n     Nonetheless, we believe that reducing welfare costs by \n     denying benefits to teenaged mothers and their children is \n     short-sighted and will lead to the creation of a human \n     deficit that will ultimately be more damaging to our country \n     than an unbalanced budget could ever be.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    a statement of shared principles on welfare reform--introduction\n\n       As people of faith and religious commitment, we are called \n     to stand with and seek justice for people who are poor. This \n     is central to our religious traditions, sacred texts, and \n     teachings. We share a conviction, therefore, that welfare \n     must not focus on eliminating programs but on eliminating \n     poverty and the damage it inflicts on children (who are \\2/3\\ \n     of all welfare recipients), on their parents, and on the rest \n     of society.\n       We recognize the benefit to the entire community of helping \n     people move from welfare to work when possible and \n     appropriate. We fear, however, that reform will fail if it \n     ignores labor market issues such as unemployment and an \n     inadequate minimum wage and important family issues such as \n     the affordability of child care and the economic value of \n     care-giving in the home. Successful welfare reform will \n     depend on addressing these concerns as well as a whole range \n     of such related issues as pay equity, affordable housing, and \n     access to health care.\n       We believe that people are more important than the sum of \n     their economic activities. Successful welfare reform demands \n     more than economic incentives and disincentives. It depends \n     on overcoming biased assumptions about race, gender and class \n     that feed hostile social stereotypes about people living in \n     poverty and suspicions that people with perspectives other \n     than our own are either indifferent or insincere. Successful \n     welfare reform will depend ultimately upon finding not only a \n     common ground of policies but a common spirit about the need \n     to pursue them for all.\n       The following principles do not exhaust our concerns or \n     resolve all issues raised. The principles will serve \n     nonetheless as our guide in assessing proposed legislation in \n     the coming national welfare debate. We hope they may also \n     serve as a rallying point for a common effort with others \n     throughout the nation.\n\n\n                               principles\n       An acceptable welfare program must result in lifting people \n     out of poverty, not merely in reducing welfare rolls.\n       The federal government should define minimum benefit levels \n     of programs serving low-income people below which states \n     cannot fall. The benefits must be adequate to provide a \n     decent standard of living.\n       Welfare reform efforts designed to move people into the \n     work force must create jobs that pay a livable wage and do \n     not displace present workers. Programs should eliminate \n     barriers to employment and provide training and education \n     necessary for inexperienced and young workers to get and hold \n     jobs. Such programs must provide child care, transportation, \n     and ancillary services that will make participation both \n     possible and reasonable. If the government becomes the \n     employer of last resort, the jobs provided must pay a family-\n     sustaining wage.\n       Disincentives to work should be removed by allowing welfare \n     recipients to retain a larger portion of wage earnings and \n     assets before losing cash, housing, health, childcare or \n     other benefits.\n       Work-based programs must not impose arbitrary time-limits. \n     If mandated, limits must not be imposed without availability \n     of viable jobs at a family-sustaining wage. Even then, some \n     benefit recipients cannot work or should not be required to \n     work. Exemptions should be offered for people with serious \n     physical or mental illness, disabling conditions, \n     responsibilities as\n      caregivers for incapacitated family members, and for those \n     primary caregivers who have responsibility for young \n     children.\n       Welfare reform should result in a program that brings \n     together and simplifies the many efforts of federal, state \n     and municipal governments to assist persons and families in \n     need. ``One-stop shopping centers'' should provide \n     information, counseling, and legal assistance regarding such \n     issues as child support, job training and placement, medical \n     care, affordable housing, food programs and education.\n       Welfare reform should acknowledge the responsibility of \n     both government and parents in seeking the well-being of \n     children. No child should be excluded from receiving benefits \n     available to other siblings because of having been born while \n     the mother was on welfare. No child should be completely \n     removed from the safety net because of a parent's failure to \n     fulfill agreements with the government. Increased efforts \n     should also be made to collect a proper level of child \n     support assistance from non-custodial parents.\n       Programs designed to replace current welfare programs must \n     be adequately funded. They will cost more in the short-term \n     than the present Aid to Families with Dependent Children; but \n     if welfare reform is successfully implemented, they will cost \n     less as the number of families in need of assistance \n     diminishes over the long-term. Funds for this effort should \n     not be taken from other programs that successfully serve poor \n     people.\n\n\n                    national endorsing organizations\n\n       Adrian Dominican Sisters; American Baptist Churches, USA; \n     American Ethical Union, Inc., National Leaders Council (AEU); \n     American Friends Service Committee; Bread for the World; \n     Church of the Brethren, Washington Office; Church Women \n     United; Columban Fathers Justice and Peace Office; Episcopal \n     Church; General Board of Global Ministries, United Methodist \n     Church, Institutional Ministries; General Board of Church and \n     Society, United Methodist Church; Interfaith IMPACT for \n     Justice and Peace; Jesuit Social Ministries, National Office; \n     Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; Maryknoll Society \n     Justice and Peace Office; Mennonite Central Committee, \n     Washington Office; Committee on Church and Society, Moravian \n     Church, Northern Province; National Council of Churches; \n     National Council of Jewish Women; NETWORK, A National \n     Catholic Social Justice Lobby; Presbyterian Church (USA), \n     Washington Office; Union of American Hebrew Congregations; \n     Unitarian Universalist Service Committee; United Church of \n     Christ, Office for Church in Society.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Catholic Charities USA,\n                                                   August 4, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate takes up welfare reform, we \n     urge you to adopt provisions to strengthen families, protect \n     children, and preserve the nation's commitment to fighting \n     child poverty.\n       Across this country, 1,400 local agencies and institutions \n     in the Catholic Charities network serve more than 10 million \n     people annually. Last year alone, Catholic Charities USA \n     helped more than 138,000 women, teenagers, and their families \n     with crisis pregnancies. Because Catholic agencies run the \n     full spectrum of services, from soup kitchens and shelters to \n     transitional and permanent housing, they see families in all \n     stages of problems as well as those who have escaped poverty \n     and dependency.\n       This broad experience, along with our religious tradition \n     which defends human life and human dignity, compels us to \n     share our strong convictions about welfare reform.\n       The first principle in welfare reform must be, ``Do no \n     harm.'' Along with the U.S. Catholic Conference, the National \n     Right-to-Life Committee, and other pro-life organizations, we \n     have vigorously opposed child-exclusion provisions such as \n     the ``family cap'' \n\n[[Page S 13601]]\n     and denial of cash assistance for children born to teenage mothers or \n     for whom paternity has not yet been legally established.\n       We are also convinced that the idea of rewarding states for \n     reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies is well-intentioned but \n     dangerous in light of the fact that the only state experiment \n     in this regard, the New Jersey family cap, already has \n     increased abortions without any significant reduction in \n     births. The ``illegitimacy ratio'' may well encourage states \n     to engage in similar experiments that would result in more \n     abortions and more suffering.\n       We also support Senator Kent Conrad's amendment, which not \n     only would require teen mothers to live under adult \n     supervision and continue their education, but also would \n     provide resources for ``second-chance homes'' to make that \n     requirement a reality.\n       The second principle should be to protect children. We are \n     very concerned that the new work requirements and time limits \n     for AFDC participation will leave children without adequate \n     adult supervision while their parents are working or looking \n     for work. The key to successful work programs is safe, \n     affordable, quality day care for the children. The bill \n     before the Senate does not guarantee or increase funding for \n     day care to meet the\n      increased need associated with the work requirements and \n     time limits. Please, support amendments by Senators Hatch, \n     and Kennedy to guarantee adequate funding to keep children \n     safe while their mothers try to earn enough to support \n     them.\n       The third principle should be to maintain the national \n     safety net for children. We oppose block granting Food \n     Stamps, even as a state option, because the Food Stamp \n     program is the only national program available to feed poor \n     children of all ages with working parents as well as those on \n     welfare. On the whole, the Food Stamp program works well, \n     ensuring that children in even the poorest families do not \n     suffer from malnutrition.\n       We are encouraged by the fact that Senator Dole's bill does \n     not seek to cut or erode federal support for child protection \n     in the child welfare system. Proposals to block grant these \n     essential protections are ill-advised and dangerous to \n     children who are already abused, neglected, abandoned, and \n     totally at the mercy of state child welfare systems. Federal \n     rules and guarantees are essential to the safety of children.\n       The fourth principle should be fairness to all citizens. \n     Certain proposals before the Senate would create a new \n     category of ``second-class citizenship,'' making immigrants \n     ineligible for most federal programs, even after they become \n     naturalized Americans. We urge you to reject this and other \n     proposals that would leave legal immigrants without the \n     possibility of assistance when they are in genuine need.\n       The fifth principle should be to maintain the national \n     commitment to fighting child poverty. In exchange for federal \n     dollars and broad flexibility, states should be expected to \n     maintain at least their current level of support for poor \n     children and their families. We understand that Senator \n     Breaux will offer such an amendment on the Senate floor. \n     Please give it your support.\n       In our Catholic teaching, all children, but especially poor \n     and unborn children, have a special claim to the protection \n     of society and government. Please vote for proposals that \n     keep the federal government on their side.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Fred Kammer, SJ,\n\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, each year, over 1 million teenagers become \npregnant. For many, the birth of the child signals the beginning of the \ncycle of welfare dependency. In 1993, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services reported at least 296,000 unmarried teen mothers on \nwelfare, 67,000 under the age of 18.\n  The current system of providing cash under AFDC to young teenage \nparents has failed. It has undermined families and provided the \neconomic lifeline for generations of welfare dependency. It was wrong \nfrom the beginning for Government to provide checks to 15-year-old \ngirls on the condition that they leave home and remain unmarried.\n  But as this destructive policy is reconsidered, many young, pregnant \nwomen are still in need, not of cash, but of direction, compassion and \nsupport. Ending AFDC could have the perverse effect of encouraging \nthese women to have abortions, which would compound the tragedy, not \nsolve it. Neither the status quo, nor a total cutoff, are good options. \nCreative ways must be found to give women in crisis pregnancies \ncompassionate help in their own communities.\n  Private and religious maternity homes, also known by some as second \nchance homes, provide that help. They are a one-stop supportive \nenvironment where a young woman can receive counseling, housing, \neducation, medical services, nutrition, and job and parenting training \nthat gives them real opportunity for growth and decision making. \nWhether a pregnant mother makes a decision to parent themselves or to \nplace the child up for adoption, she will receive important care, \ntraining, and life management skills to enable her make effective \nchoices that will place her on the road to self-sufficiency.\n  Studies have shown that the infant mortality rate of babies born to \nresidents of maternity homes is much lower than the national average. \nIn addition, residents are more likely to complete their education and \nreceive better paying jobs than teens who continue in regular schools \nthrough their pregnancies. Those teens who choose to parent are \nprovided intensive parenting courses so that their children are at less \nrisk for abuse and neglect.\n  Maternity homes are proven success stories. St. Elizabeth's Regional \nMaternity Center of New Albany, IN, is a prime example. Their mission \nis to ``address the needs of women and families that are in a crisis \npregnancy by offering physical, emotional and spiritual support to \nensure the physical and emotional health of the mother and the health \nof the baby.'' The results of St. Elizabeth's, like many other \nmaternity homes, is impressive. Seventy percent of the women enrolled \nin their program have moved from welfare to self-sufficiency. Eighty-\nfive percent have earned a diploma or GED.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nConrad teen parent amendment and to take a few minutes to discuss a \nserious social problem that must be addressed--teenage pregnancy.\n  Senator Conrad's amendment allows all States to do what my home State \nof Arkansas is already doing. Currently, Arkansas has a waiver to \noperate two programs for teen parents. The first requires minor parents \nto remain in their parents' or guardian's household in order to receive \nAFDC benefits. If a teenage parent is unable to live at home, the State \nplaces the young woman in an adult-supervised living arrangement. Teens \nshould not be on their own raising a child. They need supervision, \neducation, and support.\n  The second, requires teenage parents who have not finished high \nschool to attend school or another training program to receive \nbenefits, the point being that these teen mothers will never become \nself-sufficient if they drop out of school. However, the benefits are \ntwo-fold. The parent gets the education and skills she needs to become \nself-sufficient, and the children of these teen parents have a better \nchance of completing school themselves.\n  Mr. President, I cannot stress enough the need for programs that will \neducate these mothers and their children. It may be the only way we can \ndecrease the welfare rolls. By teaching young adults about the \nconsequences of teen pregnancies and the importance of an education, we \ncan keep these young people out of welfare lines and focused on \nimproving their future. Our Nation must work together to fight teen \npregnancy. We should involve businesses, schools, religious \ninstitutions, and community organizations in order to bring together \nall facets of society in an organized effort to combat teen pregnancy \nboth now and in the next generation.\n  Although birth rates among all teenagers are lower now than during \nthe 1950's, the birth rate among unmarried teenagers has risen sharply \nover the last 30 years. In 1970, 70 percent of births to teens were to \nmarried teens. Now, 70 percent of births are to unmarried mothers. I \nfind this statistic frightening.\n  My home State of Arkansas runs a close second to Mississippi for \nhighest level of teen pregnancies. Among women ages 15 through 19, 80 \nout of every 1,000 give birth. In fact, in 1992, teenagers gave birth \nto more than 7,000 children in Arkansas. These facts cannot be ignored.\n  Another fact that cannot be ignored: teens from poor and \neducationally disadvantaged families are more likely to become pregnant \nthan those from more affluent and highly educated parents. A recent \nstudy indicated that education is the number one predictor of teen \npregnancy. Teenagers whose mothers have at least a high school \neducation are half as likely to become teen mothers themselves. I am \nconvinced that education is the key to our teen pregnancy problem. I \nrealize that this is not a cheap solution, nor is it a quick \n\n[[Page S 13602]]\none. It could take a generation to reduce teen pregnancies \nsignificantly. The point is, of the limited amount we know about teen \npregnancy prevention, we do know that education works. We should \nrequire young women who get pregnant to stay in school. It is the only \nchance they have to be able to provide a future for themselves or for \ntheir child.\n  Although teenage parents make up only a very small percentage of the \ncurrent AFDC caseload, many older women on welfare had their first \nchild as teenagers. Almost half of all adolescent mothers, both married \nand unmarried, began receiving AFDC within 5 years of giving birth for \nthe first time. For unmarried adolescent mothers, this number increases \nto three-fourths. The fact is that the birth of a child compounds the \ndisadvantages that many young people face and makes it more likely that \nthey will live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, my State requires teen mothers to live with a \nresponsible adult and to stay in school through waivers to the current \nAFDC program. These programs are effective because they say to these \nyoung parents that we, our society, and our Government, are willing to \nhelp them succeed, to help them learn, to allow them to have the \nopportunities that they, as American citizens, deserve. I do not \nbelieve that Arkansas is the only State which would benefit from such \nprograms. This is why I support Senator Conrad's teen parent amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in this support.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been trying to work out the \namendment. I thought if we worked it out on the basis we would accept \nit and not be required to have a rollcall vote. As far as I know it is \nunanimous. I thought that is what part of the package was.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say this to the leader. I was hopeful we could do \nthis without a vote. Others who have been involved in this have \ninsisted on a vote, and I am duty bound to honor their request after \nall.\n  Mr. DOLE. I may not be duty bound to accept it. We will see what \nhappens here. My view was we were trying to speed up the process. It is \nnow 20 minutes of 9 o'clock. We have been working in good faith all \nday. I do not know who requested the vote. I wish they were there. We \nspent an hour on the amendment. We could have had three or four votes. \nWe will reserve judgment on the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the majority leader. I say I was hopeful we could \navoid a vote, and perhaps that could still be done. Maybe we can hear \nfrom Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I say it is a tremendous amendment. Everybody is \nfor it. I do not see why we do not accept it and get it over with.\n  I wonder if the Senator might do this. We have other amendments. If \nhe could check with his cosponsors and see if they drop their \nobjections as we are dealing with the other amendments, then we can at \nleast pick up some time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I hope maybe we could have Senator Lieberman make a brief \nstatement before we resolve it. The idea was to have a whole----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All Senator Lieberman can do is to lose now. Everybody is \nfor the amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, heeding the admonition, growing up in \nConnecticut State politics really always taught me when you got the \nvotes call the roll.\n  I will be very brief and just say this: We have all talked about the \nproblem of teenage pregnancy, of babies born out of wedlock and the \nextent to which that expands the welfare rolls; of the extent to which \nchildren born to poor, unwed mothers are born to a life that has very \nlittle hope in it; of the extent to which babies born to unwed mothers \nwithout a father in the house too often grow up to be the violent young \ncriminals that disrupt, threaten, and hurt so many law-abiding people \nin our society.\n  On this bill I think we are beginning to do something about the \nproblem of teenage pregnancy and illegitimate births. No one can claim \nany certainty about how to deal with, let alone solve, so profound and \ncomplicated a human problem. We have begun to offer some opportunities \nto the States particularly to make a difference.\n  Earlier today we sustained the part of this bill that deals with \nillegitimacy ratios and creates bonuses to States that are doing a good \njob at reducing the rate of illegitimacy.\n  Here in the amendment Senator Conrad and I have crafted, which the \nRepublican leader has worked with us on throughout the day, I think we \nmake another constructive contribution.\n  We set up a national program with national goals. We recognize the \nstartling fact that so many of the babies born to teenage mothers are \nactually fathered by adult men by calling on the States to once again \nenforce statutory rape laws, and we fund these very hopeful second-\nchance homes.\n  I thank all on both sides who have worked to put this amendment \ntogether. It is constructive. It can make a difference.\n  Let me say for the record I am not the one asking for the vote. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I ask for 15 seconds to resolve this matter?\n  Mr. President, we have checked with cosponsors who had made a \ncommitment to ask for a vote on this matter, and we have persuaded them \nthat the better part of valor is to have this accepted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Rockefeller be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that the majority leader also be listed as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The amendment is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2528), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask that the votes we are going to have be set aside \nfor 10 minutes so the Senator from New Jersey can be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2496\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment No. 2496 is pending. The Senator \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n       Mr. BRADLEY.\n        The purpose of this amendment is simply to put back into \nplace the basic elements of a cash assistance program, which were left \nout, I hope inadvertently, from the bill. Without retaining at least \nthe basic core of a system that assists poor families, we would have \nnothing to reform. It simply requires States to set their own rules for \nassistance and then follow those rules.\n\n  What is it we are trying to do here? I think, or I thought, that we \nwere trying to change the welfare system to send clear messages about \nvalues, work, and responsible parenting. But if you wants to send a \nclear message, the rules have to be clear and firm. Parents have to \nknow that if they violate the State rules, they will lose benefits, \nperiod. And if they follow the rules, look for work, take \nresponsibility, they will be helped. Period.\n  Under the bill, States may use the grant in any manner that is \nreasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of this part, and that \npurpose is defined simply as assisting needy families, which can mean \nanything. States could conceivably do no more than to refer needy \nfamilies to a facility where some surplus cheese might be available for \nparents. States could operate a totally chaotic, arbitrary, \ndiscriminatory, or virtually nonexistent welfare system, while still \ncollecting their funds under this block grant.\n  Governors have assured us that they will administer funds fairly and \nresponsibly. I have no doubt that most of them will try to. But we also \nknow that most States will face increasing financial pressure. Only a \nfew States, according to the CBO, can afford to pay for the work \nrequirements in this bill. \n\n[[Page S 13603]]\nSo even if States don't completely ignore whole populations, they might \nprovide minimal assistance in one region of the State or put very needy \napplicants on a waiting list after the Federal funds run out.\n  The result will be the opposite of what is intended. Instead of \nimposing time limits on those who have been on welfare for a long time, \nwe will put people who need help for the first time on a waiting list.\n  Without basic standards, work requirements would become meaningless, \nsince there is no basic definition of who is eligible and therefore who \nshould be in a work program. If a State has trouble meeting the work \nparticipation requirements under this bill, they can simply stop \nserving those who are having the most trouble finding work.\n  This amendment requires States to set basic eligibility standards, \ndefine categorical exceptions--such as time limits--and then follow \nthose rules by assisting everyone eligible under those State rules. \nEverything in this debate suggests that this is what we expect States \nto do, so why not spell it out.\n  My amendment retains every aspect of State flexibility ever asked for \nby any Governor. States would be free to set eligibility standards and \nbenefits, as they do now, and to set rules for income and assets. They \ncould set short-time limits or deny benefits to unwed teen mothers or \nadditional children born to women receiving benefits, as long as they \napply the rules consistently.\n  I have also made clear in this amendment that States could also cut \noff benefits to any family under the terms of an individualized \nagreement with the family. The most innovative States, like Iowa and \nUtah as well as New Jersey, currently establish such contracts setting \nspecific obligations for each family. A parent might agree, for \nexample, to seek substance abuse treatment, and face a cutoff of \nbenefits if he or she does not comply. This amendment makes clear that \nStates can cut off benefits for failure to comply, as long as the rules \nare clear.\n  This amendment does not challenge any specific reasons a State might \nchoose to cut a family off benefits, even though I have doubts about \nthe merits of some of the categorical cutoffs in the House bill. What \nthis amendment goes after is the arbitrary refusal to help a family: \nThe waiting list. The neglected region of a State. The bureaucrat who \nhas not gotten around to looking at the application. The agency that \ndoes not want the hassle of dealing with someone who will require more \ntime to place in a job.\n  States could set any rules they like. But people have to know what \nthe rules are. It's a very simple amendment, but without it, this bill \nis meaningless, empty, and potentially devastating news for families \nwith children.\n  Rebuttal to claim that this amendment recreates entitlement.\n  This amendment does not entitle anyone to anything. It gives States \ntotal freedom to develop any kind of rule under which an individual can \nbe cut off. If a State wants to say, you receive no benefits if you are \nseen jaywalking, they can do it.\n  Rebuttal to claim that this amendment is too prescriptive on States:\n  If Governors are concerned that this would prevent them from \nimplementing some policy that they want to enact, I would like to know \nwhat that is. If Governors want to do something different from writing \nnew rules and implementing them, I think they own us an answer about \nwhat it is they want to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2496) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes between the second, third, fourth, and fifth rollcall votes--\nsecond, third, and fourth rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And that after the first rollcall vote, the votes be 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 2526\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 2526, \noffered by the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] in which the yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have just had a discussion with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and we would like \nanybody here who feels compelled--I underscore the word compelled--to \noffer an amendment tonight or sometime during the night to let us know \nduring this next vote. We would like to wrap up this bill. We are \nworking on a major amendment that we think will be acceptable. And I \nknow some people think they need to offer every amendment, and some of \nthese amendments are not really germane to this bill. But we would like \nto have some idea of how many amendments we have left.\n  So if you would either let me know, if it is a Republican amendment, \nor Senator Daschle know, or the managers know, between now and the time \nthe next couple of votes end, we would appreciate it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business is the Mikulski \namendment 2669, 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This amendment is offered by Senator Bradley and \nmyself. Its purpose is to bring men back into the family: No. 1, to \nhave tough child support; No 2, to promote marriage, and, No. 3, to end \nthe parent trap that is in the GOP welfare reform bill. The GOP welfare \nreform bill does nothing to restore men in families.\n  What this amendment does is provide job placement for noncustodial \nfathers, meaning if a dad wants a job and to go to work, if he does not \nhave work, we work to place him in it.\n  No. 2, we prevent States creating welfare rules that penalize \nmarriage \n\n[[Page S 13604]]\nand push men out of the family, particularly where they work more than \n100 hours a month.\n  We also promote marriage. It says that where there is a family cap, \nthis amendment would require them to come up with incentives that \npromote marriage. The other is we would pay child support to mothers, \nnot to child support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Our amendment is good for fathers, for kids, for \nAmerica. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know the Senator feels very strongly about \nthis amendment.\n  Let me just say, we have tried to accommodate a number of major \namendments--child care. We have lost some savings on this bill, and our \nsavings are not nearly as much as the House side. This amendment would \ncost $920 million over the next 7 years. That is almost $1 billion. \nThere is no offset. It would come right out of the savings. I hope it \nwill be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the time?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in addition to this amendment costing $1 \nbillion, this sets up a job training and job search program for \ndeadbeat dads and for people who let their kids go on welfare.\n  You have a hard-working parent who is trying to help their children, \nwho is working in a job. They do not get any help from the Government. \nBut if you have a deadbeat dad and you let your kids go on welfare, we \nare going to set up a job training and job search program for you. This \nis a misguided amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. This is \na 10-minute rollcall vote. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we must have order as a procedural \nmatter is about to be discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? The Senator from New \nYork wants order. The Chair asks every Senator to pay attention to the \nSenator from Rhode Island who seeks the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2517, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, just to intervene here, we are prepared to \naccept the following amendment after the Feinstein amendment, which is \nthe DeWine amendment. I know the Senator from Mississippi had some \nreservations, and there are some changes that we would make in that \nDeWine amendment before the conference. The other side is prepared to \naccept it, and we are prepared to accept the DeWine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Rhode Island seeking to \nvitiate the yeas and nays on the DeWine amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Correct. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays \nbe vitiated on the DeWine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the DeWine amendment No. 2517, as \nmodified.\n  So, the amendment (No. 2517), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2478\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next issue before the Senate is the \nFeinstein amendment 2478, with 2 minutes evenly divided. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the bill, as presently drafted, would deny cash and \nnoncash welfare benefits to naturalized citizens. The Constitution of \nthe United States provides for one class of citizens, and the only \nplace it diverges is with respect to the President of the United \nStates.\n  In every other case, a naturalized citizen is as good as a native-\nborn citizen. I believe it is extraordinarily important that this \namendment be adopted. It is supported by the American Bar Association, \nby the Governor's conference, by the State legislatures, by Mayor \nGiuliani, by Mayor Riordan of Los Angeles, by virtually a whole host of \norganizations. It would be my hope that in this bill we do not, for the \nfirst time in American history, create two classes of American \ncitizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime? The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as many of you know, through the years, \nwe do immigration reform legislation. It is always materially dressed, \nand then when we come to tough votes, we do not stick. This is one of \nthose. We are not making second-class citizens of anyone. We are saying \nthat whether you are naturalized or whether you are native born, one of \nthe assets that is considered as to whether you are a public charge \nshould be a contract, should be a court-ordered support, and we think \nthat one of the things that should be in there is the affidavit of \nsupport of the sponsor. That is all we are saying.\n  That does not make anyone a second-class citizen. If you do not \ninclude that, then, in my mind, you are going to induce people to \nnaturalize so they can get into the public support system. That is why \nI object to this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. This is \na 10-minute rollcall vote. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is the last vote in this category. We \nhave others coming after this. But the others have not yet been debated \nor rollcalls ordered. This is the last one in this group.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2513\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business before the Senate \nis the Feinstein amendment numbered 2513. There are 2 minutes evenly \ndivided.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, under present law, deeming only \napplies to cash programs, AFDC, SSI and food stamps.\n  Without this amendment, there is a massive cost shift, particularly \nto four States: New York, Texas, Florida and California. That cost \nshift is literally hundreds of millions of dollars because it means \nthat legal immigrants presently in this country today would not have \naccess to Medicaid, to Head Start, to child protective services, to \nfoster care, to any of those noncash programs.\n  Who would have to pick it up? The State or the local jurisdictions. \nIt is a massive cost shift for four major States. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say this is a $700 million reduction in the savings. I \nknow it is a problem.\n  My view is we have already tried to accommodate a number of requests, \nand we believe we ought to protect the savings we have.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we have already agreed to a Wellstone \namendment which had to do with battered women and foster children, the \nexemption there. There was a Kennedy amendment with regard to Head \nStart, soup lines and kitchens. We have agreed to that.\n  This opens up this bill. This includes Medicaid, public housing, job \ntraining and any other program which does not provide cash assistance \nto the recipient.\n  We have a year's gap in the bill to take care of people in extremity \nwho are broke or sponsors that cannot make it, or people who cannot \nmake it and have no food and shelter. That is all in this bill. For a \nwhole year we take care of those people.\n  This opens the gate for $707 million. I do not know where it is \nsupposed to come from--maybe Medicaid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2513. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). May we have order in the Senate? \nThe Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Florida is \nnext in our sequence. May I ask how much time the Senator will require, \nhow little time the Senator will require?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes the distinguished majority \nleader is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I was going to ask the same question, if we \ncould get some agreement on time, or get a voice vote. Some of these \nthings could be disposed of on a voice vote, I think. Like an 80-to-20 \nvote, we could probably determine that by audible vote, if somebody \nwanted that. But if we could get a time agreement, that would be a \nstart.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 20 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. There will be 20 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope Senators will take their cue from the \nmajority leader and have voice votes. If it is any satisfaction to \noffer an amendment at this stage, just to offer it, get a voice vote on \nit. These amendments are not going anywhere. Most of these amendments \nare going to be dead on arrival when they get to conference. We are \njust wasting our time. There are not many Senators listening now. Look \naround these walls. Just look at the people stacked around the walls. \nWe cannot get order in the Chamber. Who wants to speak when Senators \ncannot listen? We are just wasting our time, spinning our wheels.\n  We have had a good run for the bill. We have had a vote on the \nDemocratic substitute. Several amendments have gotten good votes. I \nknow that every person who offers amendments feels that they are good \namendments. But we have reached a point now where the law of \ndiminishing returns has set in.\n  I hope Senators will curb their appetites for rollcall votes and call \nup their amendments, have a voice vote. We are not going anywhere \nanyhow. Not many amendments are even going to carry. \n\n[[Page S 13606]]\n\n  We have been on this bill now for 12 session days. We have all had a \ngood chance at it. We have had our run at it. Let us go home. I have a \nwife waiting on me and my little dog, Billy.\n  [Laughter.]\n  We have reached a point now where we are just looking foolish.\n  I thank the leaders and all Senators who have listened.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, with some temerity making a point and \nbringing attention to the rules and the presence of the Robert C. Byrd, \nmay I say that if they voice vote and it is close, a Senator may ask \nfor a division and get a count. It need not take 20 minutes.\n\n\n                      unanimous-consent agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to say that perhaps we can help \nresolve it, too, if we can get this consent agreement. Let me read it \nfor my colleagues, and everybody can decide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments remaining in order, other than those cleared by the two \nmanagers; that they be debated this evening, and the votes occur on or \nin relation to the amendments tomorrow beginning at 9:30 a.m., with 10 \nminutes between each rollcall vote to be equally divided in the usual \nform:\n  Bingaman, No. 2483; Bingaman, No. 2484; Simon, No. 2468; Wellstone, \nNo. 2503 and 2505; Kennedy, No. 2564; Kohl, No. 2550; Graham of \nFlorida, No. 2509 and 2568; Gramm of Texas, No. 2615, as modified, and \n2617; Levin-Dole modification No. 2486.\n  I further ask that following the votes, beginning at 9:30 a.m. on \nFriday, the two leaders be recognized to offer the compromise \nmodification Dole amendment, with 40 minutes for debate to be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the amendment be so modified.\n  I also ask that following the modification, it be in order for one \namendment to be offered by the majority leader and one amendment to be \noffered by ten minority leader; and that following the disposition of \nthe two leaders' amendments, if offered, the Senate proceed to the \nadoption of the Dole amendment 2280, as amended; and that following the \ndisposition of the Dole amendment, the bill be advanced to third \nreading, and final passage occur at a time and day to be determined by \nthe majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  Let me explain what this would do. This would mean that those who do \nnot have amendments would not have to stay here for debate. Debate \nwould be completed this evening, and we will start to vote tomorrow.\n  That would also give additional time--because we do have a rather \nmajor drafting effort going on--to others to take a look at that \ntomorrow morning to see if it is satisfactory to people on both sides.\n  I think I inadvertently asked for a Bradley amendment, which might \ncreate a new entitlement program. I might need to strike that out. I \ndid not read it carefully enough. I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  So I might do that tomorrow because they are going to score this, and \nI do not want to lose any additional money. We have lost a little \ntoday.\n  But that would be the UC agreement. I think we have protected \neverybody's rights.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. President, I must confess I looked at it--with one exception that \nI believe our staffs have looked at--and I am a little concerned on \nreflection that the 40 minutes may not be an adequate period of time \nfor people to look at the larger compromise amendment. we want to give \neverybody a chance to do that. It could be that less than 40 minutes \nmay be required. If we could just delete any reference to a period of \ntime, that would satisfy us.\n  Second, if we could just have two amendments to be offered by the \nmajority leader and the minority leader, I think that would take care \nof any concern that we have.\n  Mr. DOLE. Two by the majority and two by the minority.\n  I make those modifications.\n  I take out the following words: ``With 40 minutes for debate to be \nequally divided in the usual form.''\n  So the modification reads: To offer the compromise modification to \nthe Dole amendment, and that following the conclusion or yielding back \nof time, the amendment be so modified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I shall not, I wonder \nwhether on the Wellstone amendment 2503, I say to the majority leader, \nchange that to ``modified.'' I think that is OK with everyone.\n  Mr. DOLE. 2503, as modified. No problem. And 2505.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. 2505 is fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. 2503, as modified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As I understand the agreement, the time for vote on \nfinal passage is still left.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me just assure everybody, I think this is a very \nimportant vote. Nobody wants to miss this vote. I know that some people \nare necessarily absent tomorrow. Some are necessarily absent on Monday.\n  I hope we could say, after the Tuesday luncheons, if everybody is in \ntown.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just add not only that concern, but because \nwe have made a lot of changes throughout the day, I think everybody \nought to have plenty of opportunity to look at it prior to the time \nthey are going to be casting their vote.\n  So for both reasons, I think it would be good if we held it over \nuntil next week.\n  Mr. DOLE. We want to get to third reading, have a vote, and we can \nstart on appropriations tomorrow and wrap those up in a few days.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask the majority leader, does \nthe unanimous consent agreement contemplate some time tomorrow for some \nfew minutes to discuss each amendment before the votes occur?\n  Mr. DOLE. Ten minutes. If you do not want to stay tonight, there are \n10 minutes between each vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. It might be better to do it tomorrow.\n  Is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving right to object, Mr. President, could we just \nhave a better understanding as to when the final vote will occur?\n  Mr. DOLE. On the bill itself, final passage?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my hope--I have not consulted with the Democratic \nleader--if all Members are in town, following the luncheons on Tuesday, \nwe would vote following the luncheons on Tuesday.\n  Mr. BYRD. So is that part of the request?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes. That is not part of the agreement in case somebody is \nill or is not able to be here. I think we ought to make every effort to \nhave everybody available.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Reserving the right to object, I understand what the \nmajority leader said about the amendment that I offered. I wanted to \nassure him that the second part of the paragraph that I was reading \nexplaining the amendment would have gotten to that aspect of the \namendment. But the majority leader cut me off and moved to pass the \nbill.\n  So I appreciate what he said, and I look forward to tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will strike out the second part, then.\n  [Laughter.]\n  But we will work it out. We will not have any problem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I \njust say that the Senator mentioned amendment 2564. This was to make it \nagreeable with the Senator from Wyoming because it deals with a narrow \nelement in terms of the refugees. He had agreed to changes on it. I \nwould like to be able to modify that, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. DOLE. Without objection, we would say 2564, as modified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have the agreement.\n  So Senator Bingaman is up now.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I believe Senator Graham was.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senator Graham from Florida, excuse me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2509\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I call up amendment 2509.\n\n[[Page S 13607]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is another amendment that relates to the \nprovisions in the bill having to do with that arcane subject of \ndeeming. Deeming means that in calculating the financial status of an \nindividual you deem to include in that individual's assets and income \nthe assets and income of a third party. In this case, the individual \nwho is affected is a person who----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend?\n  Will the Senate please by in order?\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, under this amendment, we are focused on \none group of people, a finite, fixed number of individuals. Those are \nindividuals who are in the United States lawfully as of the enactment \ndate of this legislation. This is not an open-ended number of people \nwhich could be augmented by persons coming legally to the United States \nin the future.\n  What this amendment says is that for those people who are in the \ncountry legally today, legal aliens, they should be treated under the \nrules that exist today with one very major exception, and that is they \nwould be treated in the legislation the majority leader would provide \nas it relates to supplemental Social Security income.\n  We are dealing in this amendment with a finite group of people, those \nwho came into this country legally, who are in the country today, and \nwho came here under certain rules and expectations. Frankly, one of \nthose rules was that for many of these people they had a sponsor who \nsponsored their entry into the United States. Sadly, the fact is that \nby court ruling the sponsorships of legal aliens are extremely \ndifficult to enforce, difficult to enforce by public agencies, \ndifficult to enforce by private parties including the legal alien him \nor herself.\n  It seems to me extremely unfair, now that these people are in the \ncountry legally--and I underscore the word legally--to change the rules \non them. It is particularly unfair for a specific group within this \nclass that I would like to talk about, and that is those who have come \nhere as relatively young people and are now enrolled in an educational \nprogram.\n  The largest community college in the country is Miami Dade Community \nCollege located in Miami. That one institution has some 20,000 legal \nimmigrants within its student body, and 8,000 of those individuals are \nestimated to be ruled ineligible for student financial aid if an \namendment such as the one that I have offered were not to be adopted.\n  Here are people trying to do exactly what the American dream is all \nabout, to improve themselves by hard work, by education, by increasing \ntheir ability to contribute to the well-being of themselves, their \nfamilies, their communities, and their Nation. With the failure to \nadopt this amendment, we would make it extremely difficult for many of \nthese students to continue their education.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the American Association \nof Community Colleges and a variety of other State and local service \nproviders who understand the implications of changing the rules for \npeople who are in this country legally at the time this legislation \ngoes into effect.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your courtesy. I would like to yield time \nto actually the individual who was the original author of this \nlegislation and who has been kind enough to allow me to join him in \nthat effort, Senator Simon of Illinois.\n  I wish to assure that Senator Simon is fully listed as a sponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is there a time agreement on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes on either side.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. On both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes on each side, 20 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have a question of the Senator from Florida. Is there \nany cost estimate on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Senator from Rhode Island, \nquestions are to be addressed through the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would ask the Chair----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Or if the Senator from Rhode Island wishes \nunanimous consent to engage in colloguy with the Senator from Florida.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The estimate is that over the 5 years the total cost is \n$600 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Florida yield time to \nthe Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 5 minutes and 46 \nseconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I shall use less than 2 minutes.\n  I would like to have the attention of my fellow colleagues who are \nhere. What this amendment does is simply says let us make this \nprospective. Let us apply it in the future. Let us not take people who \nhave agreed to sponsor people for 3 years and all of a sudden we are \ngoing to say sorry, this contract is for 5 years. And to take people \nwho are in a college situation, who are going to become citizens, and \nsay sorry, you are going to have to leave school, I do not think that \nmakes sense.\n  I hope that the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas might consider accepting this \namendment. I think it does make sense to do this prospectively, not \nretroactively.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask if the proponents of the measure--we \nhave gotten the cost of it--if they have an offset, any way of paying \nfor it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We do not have an offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island yield time \nto the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. Such time as he needs.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think 5 minutes would be adequate.\n  Mr. President, again, this is one of those areas of dealing with \nimmigration and welfare and deeming provisions. Let us understand what \ndeeming is. The sponsor brings you here to the United States, and his \nor her income is deemed to be yours. You as a sponsor are responsible \nfor this person coming to the United States, for their assistance, \ntheir welfare. And you cannot come to the United States at any time if \nyou are going to be a public charge. At any time you become a public \ncharge while you are still in this category, you do not come on as a \nnaturalized citizen. You must be self-sustaining. That has been the law \nsince 1882.\n  So, again, we are at one of these impasses where I am surprised some \nof these have been successful. This is an ancient ritual. It is about \npeople who say we want to do something about legal immigration, we want \nto do something about illegal immigration, and we want to do something \nabout people who misuse the systems. But we do not.\n  Now, in the last Congress, we increased the deeming period for SSI to \n5 years. We did that. We already did that. In his proposal--I hope you \nall hear this--President Bill Clinton in his proposed welfare reform \nbill raised the deeming period for AFDC and food stamps to 5 years. \nThis President, President Clinton, has agreed that this is what we \nshould do. That is what the Dole bill quite logically and properly then \ndoes. It sets a deeming period on all welfare programs at 5 years, in \naccordance with the directive and the wishes of the Justice Department \nand the President of the United States.\n  Please remember that the folks that are affected by this amendment \nwere admitted as immigrants only--only--after they and their sponsors \npromised--promised--that they would not become dependent on public \nassistance at any time, period, not just for 5 years, but for any time.\n  Now, under this amendment, they would be permitted to access the \npublic welfare systems of the United States after only as few as 3 \nyears in the United States of America. The sponsor \n\n[[Page S 13608]]\nwould be off the hook, relieved of his promise of support, and the \ntaxpayers would take over.\n  I think that is basically very wrong. I guess to paraphrase the words \nof Gertrude Stein: A sponsor is a sponsor is a sponsor. If you do not \nwant to take care of someone when you bring them to the United States, \ndo not sponsor them. If you bring them in as an immigrant, you have to. \nThat is why people have misused the refugee programs. If you come here \nas a refugee, the Government takes care of all of it. So we have people \ncoming here as refugees who do not qualify in any way as refugees.\n  We have presumptive refugees in certain areas of the world who wait \n1\\1/2\\ years to come here after they have been designated as a \npresumptive refugee. You talk about gimmickry of the system. I have \nbeen at this game for 16 years, and there is plenty of it. And this \namendment would cost $623 million over 7 years.\n  I want to say, too, that the students who the Senator has expressed \nconcern for are sponsored immigrants who have been in the United States \nfor less than 5 years. They are persons now seeking public assistance \nfor college education who have a sponsor who promised, in order to get \nthat immigrant admitted, to provide whatever assistance the immigrant \nmight require in order to avoid becoming a public charge.\n  That is where we are. It is not pleasant in any way to continually \nyear after year stand here and try to present the issues as they really \nare without being described as mean spirited, pinched, riven, uncaring.\n  That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about often \npeople with a grand design of how to gimmick the systems. And if you \nreally are watching, keeping your eye on the rabbit, this is not in any \nway helpful to the welfare system or to the immigration laws of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, the question was asked do we have \nan offset? I answered we do not have an offset. We adopted other \namendments here which create new entitlements, new benefits, new tax \npreferences without requiring an offset. This is the law today. What we \nare attempting to do is to retain the law today for those people who \ncame here with the state of the law as it is. We are not trying to \nchange the rules.\n  We are trying to say, if these people came here with certain \nstatements as to what their obligations would be, if the sponsor has \nentered into commitments with certain expectations as to what their \nobligations would be, we should keep those for those people who are in \nthe country today. We are not proposing to make this an ongoing new \nstandard. If you want to change the rules, we can change the rules and \nmake it applicable to those who come after the rules are changed.\n  Mr. President, this is not a particularly popular issue because, \namong other things, we are dealing with a small group of people. But we \nare dealing with people who embody what we as Americans most applaud--\npeople who desire freedom, independence, who want to be like us. People \nwho are the target of this amendment are trying to improve themselves \nso they can be even better Americans.\n  I think it is both shortsighted and unfair to change the rules on \nthese people and deny them, among other things, the opportunity to get \nthat education that is going to make them a more productive citizen. \nThese people will repay in their lifetime much more than the $600 \nmillion that this amendment calls for to continue to do for the next 5 \nyears for these people what we have provided for them in the past and \nwhat we have considered to be in America's best interest. It was then. \nIt is now. And at least it will be for this current group of legal \naliens who are in our country, particularly those who are utilizing the \nopportunities to extend their education.\n  Let me yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n  Let me tell you what it does. John McCain sponsors an immigrant named \nAlan Simpson. And John McCain agrees he is going to be responsible for \n3 years. All of a sudden we have an amendment here that says, ``Sorry, \nJohn McCain. We have changed the law. You signed up for 3 years. We are \ngoing to make you responsible for 5 years.''\n  Second, it is true, as Senator Simpson says, that if you take these \nyoung people out of college--some maybe are not young--that temporarily \nwe are going to save money. But we know from all the statistics that, \nif you let them stay in college, they are going to be more productive, \npay taxes, and do more for our country and make ours a more productive \ncountry.\n  I think the amendment is a good amendment, and I hope we will have \nthe good sense to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 4 minutes 21 \nseconds. The Senator from Florida has 1 minute 5 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I reserve my 1 minute 5 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have not much time left. I just want to \nsay again that when a sponsor gives an affidavit of support--if we are \ntalking about the things cherished in America, let us talk about \nkeeping a promise. That would be a good place to start.\n  When a sponsor agrees to bring in an immigrant, they agree that that \nperson will not become a public charge. Not just for 5 years or 3 \nyears, but the law says at any time. That is what the law says. I did \nnot invent it. It came on the books in 1882. It says at any time, not \njust 5 years, not just 3. It does not matter what was thought to be \nagreed to, the sponsor is deemed to have their assets considered the \nassets of the immigrant for a period of any time, and that is the law \nof the United States and a contract or an obligation to do that----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If that is the law, why do we need to change it? The \nstatement that you have is that there are set periods of time in which \na sponsor's resources are deemed to be part of the sponsor-legal \nimmigrant's economic status. Those have been the law. If you are saying \nthose were meaningless, in fact the 3-year periods we used to have in \nthe past were inapplicable then, why do we need to change the law now?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, in the last Congress, we increased the \ndeeming period for SSI to 5 years. The President of the United States, \nin his welfare reform package, revised the deeming period for AFDC and \nfood stamps to 5 years. We are trying to follow the President of the \nUnited States and his viewpoint.\n  Then you wonder where the support is coming from. I can tell you \nwhere it is coming from: A small cadre of educational institutions. \nThat is where it is coming from. We are not going to injure them in the \nprocess.\n  We are just saying that a sponsor's promise is a sponsor's promise. I \nhave been in these things for years. I am not the expert in any way. I \nwould not even indicate that. But I do know what interest groups are \nwhen you deal with immigration. They come out of the woodwork. They are \nall out here right now, I suppose. There will be cadres of them. But \none of them here is the group of educational institutions who see this, \nif this can get done, as tuition money, paid for.\n  We have Pell grants, we have all sorts of things. We do take care of \npeople in society. No one should miss the fact we are going to vote on \na debt limit of $5 trillion in a few weeks, and Medicare will be broke \nand Social Security will be broke in the year 2031 and will go broke \nand start its decline, its swan song in 2013, and we will not even deal \nwith that on the floor of the U.S. Senate, either party.\n  Talk about obligations. And then just trot up $623 million and no \nplace to get it. That is my humble viewpoint of this pointed issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 1 minute 5 \nseconds. The Senator from Rhode Island has 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the issue here is fairly simple. \nWe have had rules under which people have guided their lives as it \nrelates to the status of sponsors and legal immigrants, people who are \nin this country \n\n[[Page S 13609]]\nplaying by the rules, trying to prepare themselves to become self-\nsufficient, contributing Americans.\n  They are doing the heinous thing to continue their education: They \nare attending a vocational school; they are attending a community \ncollege. I think that is an activity that we should not say is just a \nmatter of some interest group. Would you say the GI bill was just an \ninterest group of a few college and university administrators? Of \ncourse not. It was a great program, it is a great program that has \nbenefited this country manyfold.\n  That is what the issue is in this amendment. I believe that we ought \nto say to these people, as part of their learning about America, that \nwe play by the rules that were established when the game started. For \nyou, we are going to complete the rules. If you want to change the \nrules for those in the future, that is perfectly permissible. I believe \nwe should adopt this amendment as both an immediate and long-term \ncontribution to a better America. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 24 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, again, the affidavit of support may be \nfor 3 years. But the overriding understanding of the American people is \nthat the immigrant will not become a burden upon the taxpayers or the \npublic. That is the issue. There is no other issue, especially not in \nhis or her first 5 years here. It never would have been allowed to take \nplace if they knew they were going to access the public support systems \nin the first 3 years of their presence here. That is what this is \nabout. That was the real condition of admission. We are forgetting \nsomething here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under a previous \nagreement, the vote will be stacked until tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2468\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not know if we have an agreed-upon \norder, but I have an amendment I will be happy to discuss briefly.\n  I offer this amendment in behalf of Senator Brown, Senator Reid and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SIMON. This is a modification. Let me offer it as a modification \nof amendment No. 2468.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment No. 2468.\n  If I may say to my colleague from Mississippi, what I am doing is \ninstead of having this a setaside--this is the community WPA Program--I \nam making it an authorization so that I think it may be acceptable. We \nhave passed this as an authorization by voice vote. Senator Boren was \nthe sponsor about a year ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I hope not to, Mr. \nPresident, but if I could address this question to the Senator from \nIllinois, has this been discussed or cleared, to his knowledge, with \nthe managers?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have not had a chance. Senator Brown indicated to me--I \nmentioned to him and to Senator Reid that I was going to change it to \nan authorization because, frankly, the word was, as a setaside, it \ncould be opposed on your side, but as an authorization, it might be \napproved. So that is the reason. I, frankly, have not had a chance to \ndiscuss it with the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has this been discussed with and cleared \nwith the Senator's cosponsors, for instance, the Senator from Colorado, \nSenator Brown?\n  Mr. SIMON. I discussed this with the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Colorado, both of whom strongly support it. I might add \nthat we had cosponsors of this, as independent legislation, from your \nside as well, and it was adopted by voice vote here earlier--not this \nsession, but an earlier session--as part of a larger bill which was \nvetoed but had nothing to do with this.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one final question, if I could. We do have a \ncopy of the modified language?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have it at the desk. It just simply changes it from \nbeing a setaside to an authorization. Otherwise, there is no change.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wonder, Mr. President, if I can suggest to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, we have not had a chance to take a look at the \nlegislation. As the Senator knows, some of the staff has already left. \nI wonder if it would be permissible, under the agreement we have, to \nwait and modify this in the morning. I feel like probably there will be \nno problem getting an agreement. As the Senator knows, I am filling in \nhere, too. The Senator from Illinois can discuss the modification in \nthe morning under the time agreement agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is perfectly satisfactory to me.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think what he has done is improved the prospects, and \nprobably there will be no problem. At this time, without the managers \nhere and without the staff directly involved not here, we would like to \nhave a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator's request is to withhold the request to \nmodify?\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. SIMON. OK. I will do that. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2568\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2568. It is one of \nthe amendments under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2568.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not wish to belabor this issue, \nbecause it is really an offshoot issue we debated at some length \nyesterday and the day before yesterday which related to the fact that \nthere are very extreme differences in the amount of Federal resources \nthat the 50 States will receive under this legislation.\n  I introduced two amendments in an attempt to deal with that \ndisparity. One of those amendments has been accepted and will be \nincluded in the managers amendment. That was what I called the \n``embarrassment'' amendment.\n  In this bill, there is a provision which states that there will be a \nperiodic or annual evaluation of how the individual States are \nperforming under this bill, how well they are doing in terms of \nachieving its objectives, particularly in getting people off of welfare \nand into work.\n  I would compare that standard to a series of football teams, some of \nwhom are made up of professionals and others are junior high school \nplayers, because that is about the way in which the 50 States are being \nequipped to carry out these responsibilities.\n  In the case of the assistant majority leader, his State is going to \nhave to spend 88 percent of all of its Federal money just to meet the \nmandates in this bill. There are other States that can meet the \nmandates with less than 40 percent of the Federal money.\n  So the first amendment, which, as I indicated, has been accepted for \ninclusion in a managers' amendment, will simply say that when we go \nthrough this embarrassment test of how well you have done, part of that \nevaluation will be: How many resources did the State have? We are not \ngoing to ask the State that has one-tenth the resources of another to \nnecessarily perform at the same level. We are not going to subject that \nState to the ridicule of its inability to reach the same level of \naccomplishment.\n  This is another amendment in the same spirit. We have in this bill a \nseries of national work participation rates. For instance, for a family \nreceiving assistance under this, where there \n\n[[Page S 13610]]\nis a single adult in the family, we are expecting 25 percent \nparticipation in 1996, up to 50 percent participation by the year 2000.\n  Again, I think it is unrealistic and unfair to expect the same \nstandard of achievement for all States, given the fact that the \nresources available are unequal. So I provide in this amendment that \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, after consultation with the \nStates, shall establish specific work participation rate goals for each \nState, adjusting the national participation rate goals to reflect the \nlevel of Federal funds the State is receiving under this program and \nthe average number of minor children in the families having income \nbelow the poverty line for that particular State.\n  This will mean that we will set the goalposts consistent with how \nmuch money we are prepared to make available to that State. Those \nStates that are going to be richly endowed under this program will have \na long goalpost to meet. Those that are more limited in their \nparticipation will have a less demanding standard. That seems to me to \nbe imminently fair and reasonable in terms of what we are going to be \nproviding to the States to accomplish the objectives of this act.\n  Mr. President, that is the amendment. I urge its adoption. I think it \nwill be an amendment that the Senators who are on the floor today, who \nrepresent some of that diversity, would be very receptive to, and \npossibly even willing to accept.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think this issue has been discussed, as \nthe Senator pointed out, at great length. I do not think there is going \nto be an inclination to just accept it. But this will be resolved \ntomorrow. How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement on the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am prepared to move to close, unless there \nis any other Senator who wishes to speak at this point.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in order to protect our interest, I would \nlike to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, indicating that if \nwe can arrive at an amiable resolution of this, I would be prepared \ntomorrow to ask to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, after months of diligent work, the \nSenate is, at long last, debating the issue of welfare reform. This \ndebate is simultaneously timely and long overdue. It is timely because \nso much attention has been focused on this issue for the last several \nmonths, and, in fact, for many months prior to the start of the 104th \nCongress. Members and staff have spent a vast number of hours reviewing \nconcepts in welfare reform and developing legislation to meet our \ngoals. Their work has lead to many well thought out proposals which are \nonly now ready for full and vigorous debate on the Senate floor. It is \noverdue, however, because we have known for years that the welfare \nsystem in this country was flawed, and yet the status quo was \nmaintained. We must act now to make the necessary changes, because we \ndare not look back on this time and tell our children we failed to take \naction when we had the opportunity.\n  As I was preparing for this debate, I became curious about the \nhistory of the word welfare. Upon looking it up, I was interested to \nnote it comes from the Old English phrase ``wel faran,'' which means, \nquite simply to go, or to fare, well. While it sounds like the word has \nchanged little from its earlier days, in reality the difference between \nthe Old English phrase and the modern word is dramatic. Most notably, \nunder our current public assistance programs, Mr. President, no one is \nfaring well.\n  In our society, three groups of people are more directly impacted by \nwelfare than any others--the beneficiaries, the tax payers, and the \ncase workers. Obviously, the beneficiaries themselves are the most \nimmediately affected by our current system. And what has this system \ndone for them? Generations have grown up without knowing the \nsatisfaction of work and personal improvement. The value of family has \nbeen ignored, aiding the increasing rate of illegitimacy. And possibly \nworst of all, children have been raised without hope in a system that \ndoes more to perpetuate poverty than to break the welfare cycle. \nObviously, some people have been able to get ahead and get off welfare. \nBut for far too many, the system offers no incentives and no promise of \na better future. Can anyone argue that these are positive results? I \nfirmly believe we should avoid the attitude that this Nation owes \npeople something simply because they reside inside our borders. But I \ndo believe we owe those in need the chance to reach above their \nsituations--a chance which the current system denies.\n   The taxpayers certainly should not be ignored in this debate. What \nthe taxpayers of Idaho have been telling me is that they want to help \nthose who truly are in need, but simply giving money away is not an \nanswer. They also do not want a system which is open to fraud and \nabuse. Earlier this year, one of my constituents, Linda Murray-Donahue \nof Boise, cited a particularly glaring example of how the system was \nbeing abused. More significant than the example she sent were her \ncomments. After noting her own difficulties in trying to raise two \nchildren after being laid off, she stated,\n\n       I am disturbed at the prospect of continuing to struggle \n     for my boys and continue to make them sacrifice so that \n     [welfare abusers] do not have to take responsibility for \n     their own lives. . . I and others do not begrudge the truly \n     needy. However, the [welfare abusers] need to be put on \n     notice that we are demanding changes in their welfare way of \n     life.\n\n  I believe this is an accurate representation of an attitude found \nthroughout the Nation. People are not looking at welfare reform as a \nway to attack the unfortunate. Instead, they simply want to ensure that \nthe truly needy are helped while those who can provide for themselves \ndo so. In the process, they also want to know that their tax dollars \nare being used wisely and efficiently.\n  In between the taxpayer and the beneficiary are the case workers and \nsocial workers. They too are frustrated by a system which they see \nthwarting their efforts to truly help people. While they work \ndiligently to move families into work and a lifestyle of self-\nsufficiency, too many of their efforts are focused on verifying \neligibility. Even when they are able to help someone begin the \ntransition from welfare to work, all too often they are stymied by a \nsystem which discourages people from trying to break the cycle of \npoverty. We owe it to the dedicated case workers and social workers to \nlet them work under a system which will help, rather than hinder, as \nthey try to give welfare recipients a chance to improve their \nsituations.\n  In this regard, Idaho has already taken an active approach to welfare \nreform. Earlier this year, several members of the Department of Social \nWork at Boise State University released a report entitled, ``Family \nSelf Sufficiency: Welfare Reform in Idaho.'' I think many of the points \nwhich were made in that report are important to share with my \ncolleagues. With regard to the state of affairs today, the report is \nclear, ``The current strategy of alleviating poverty through \nunconditional grants-in-aid has failed because it fosters dependency, \nweakens self-reliance, lowers attachment to work, and excludes the poor \nfrom the participation in the labor market.'' The report sums up the \nmajor problem with our welfare programs quite simply, ``[T]he system \ndoes not equip recipients with the means to leave poverty.''\n  The introduction to that report, I believe, quite accurately \ndescribes the situation we now face, and the direction in which it may \nbe best addressed. I would like to quote that portion of the report.\n\n       Welfare should be a ``hand up'' and not a ``hand out.'' \n     Programs that do not stress self sufficiency erode the work \n     ethic. Policies that reduce the incentives for the \n     maintenance of families break them up. Programs that do not \n     encourage participation in the economy through training and \n     education go against the fabric of America's belief system. \n     At the same time, punitive programs diminish hope, hurt \n     children, and foster long term poverty.\n       Welfare is not a right or an entitlement, it is an \n     investment. The traditional generosity of the American people \n     toward the poor and those who find themselves in difficult \n     situations is sorely tested when welfare programs make no \n     progress in either lifting clients out \n\n[[Page S 13611]]\n     of poverty or of reinforcing self-reliance. The benefits the public \n     accords the poor, the destitute, the homeless, and the sick \n     grow out of a democratic commitment to social justice, equal \n     opportunity, and a belief that we as Americans are in this \n     together.\n       Any welfare reform effort we undertake must reinforce these \n     principles. Welfare is an investment in people that ideally \n     benefits the recipient and society. In exchange for benefits, \n     able-bodied clients must take steps in partnership with the \n     state to lift themselves to self-support. And despite myths \n     to the contrary, the poor do work hard and welfare recipients \n     want to find jobs.\n\n  In Idaho, Governor Batt has already begun to move ahead with efforts \nto address exactly the kind of reforms mentioned in the report I just \nmentioned. He has assembled a welfare reform advisory council--composed \nof legislators, community leaders, private citizens, and other key \ndecision-makers. In the Executive Order which established the advisory \ncouncil, Governor Batt noted,\n\n       ``the current welfare system fails to foster fundamental \n     values relating to work, family, personal responsibility, and \n     self-sufficiency.'' The order went on to state, ``the current \n     welfare system isolates recipients from the economic and \n     social mainstream and maintains families at below poverty \n     levels with only limited support or incentives to become \n     independent of welfare assistance. . . [it] focuses on \n     writing checks and verifying circumstances rather than \n     helping people move rapidly to work.''\n\n  The Governor's advisory council has now met with Idahoans throughout \nthe state to hear the people's thoughts on welfare reform. In addition, \nit has solicited further public comment in newspaper advertisements all \nacross Idaho. This information will be used to develop a welfare reform \nplan which is specific to Idaho's needs. Mr. President, the State of \nIdaho is prepared to take on the challenge of welfare reform, and has \ndemonstrated the willingness to address the difficult issues which this \nendeavor encompasses. We should give them that opportunity.\n  Idaho has specific concerns which it wants to address, concerns which \nin many cases are the same as those we have been discussing on a \nnational level over the last few months. While these issues may be \nsimilar across the country, ideas for dealing with them are not. That \nis why we must let go of Federal control. As long as we continue the \nFederal strings, states will not have the needed flexibility to truly \naddress their needs. They also will not have the flexibility to try \ninnovative proposals which could serve as examples to other states \nabout what approaches will lead to a truly productive welfare system.\n  Mr. President, in my very first speech here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, I spoke about the need for States to be given the opportunity \nto develop their own solutions to specific problems. At the time, I \nsaid, ``I believe that we need to encourage innovation. The lessons we \nwill learn from these different States, as they undertake these \nsignificant approaches, will be invaluable to us, both in learning what \ndoes work, and also in learning what does not work. . . We need to \nsupport those States that are willing to actively seek solutions.'' \nWhile that speech was in reference to Oregon's request for a Medicaid \nwaiver, I believe it is just as applicable today. True reforms will \ncome from the States, and we must give them the opportunity to prove \nthey are up to the task of changing, for the better, our current system \nof welfare.\n  The bill we are currently considering takes tremendous strides toward \nachieving our goals. First and foremost, it ``block grants'' many \nFederal welfare programs--including Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren, job training programs and child care programs. It also \nprovides states with the option to accept Food Stamp funds as a block \ngrant. This is the basis of real reform. Turning these programs over to \nthe States will provide people with the chance to shape poverty-\nassistance programs to meet local needs. As a former mayor, and as the \nauthor of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, S. 1, which was signed into \nlaw earlier this year, I understand the frustrations and hassles which \naccompany Federal requirements. By eliminating these mandates, we allow \nState and local officials to use their own creativity and their \nintimate knowledge of the people's needs to address their problems. And \nwe do not make them go through a series of bureaucratic hoops in order \nto get a waiver to do so.\n  Some have claimed the States cannot handle this responsibility. They \nclaim State and local officials will, without strict Federal oversight, \neliminate poverty assistance and turn their backs on the poor and \nneedy. Mr. President, I do not understand how anyone could truly \nbelieve that argument. Do the naysayers really believe that State and \nlocal officials are cold, heartless individuals who would gleefully \ndeny food to the hungry and let children suffer? Do they also believe \nthat upon being elected to the Congress we all undergo some miraculous \ntransformation which makes every member of this body more compassionate \nand knowledgeable than our State and local counterparts? The mere idea \nis ridiculous. Local and State officials are the ones who are in the \nbest position to see what their programs do to people. They are the \nones whose friends and neighbors are directly impacted as a result of \ntheir actions. And if they make a mistake, if they do something the \npeople do not like, they are more directly and immediately responsible \nfor that decision than anyone here in Washington. That, I would say to \nmy colleagues, is a better guarantee that local needs will be met than \nany number of Federal rules, requirements or regulations.\n  In contrast, the bill presented by the Democrat leadership, which was \nrejected by this body, would have continued that vaunted tradition of \n``Washington knows best.'' It would not have offered flexibility to the \nStates, thus preventing innovation and creativity at the State and \nlocal level. It would have continued the entitlement status of welfare \nprograms, preventing the States from requiring anything in return for \nwelfare dollars. It would have kept the Federal bureaucracy firmly \nentrenched in the welfare system, a system which, under Federal \ncontrol, has failed those it is alleged to serve. Finally, the bill \nwould have allowed numerous exemptions to the so-called work \nrequirements, in effect nullifying the requirements and making it \neasier to maintain the status quo.\n  Mr. President, I believe the welfare reform debate is about one \nword--freedom. It is the freedom of State and local governments to \ndecide how best to provide assistance to the needy. It is the freedom \nof the various levels of government to create innovative ways to meet \nthe unique needs of the downtrodden in their city, county or State. It \nis the freedom to follow local customs and values rather than Federal \nmandates. I have said for some time that when the Government tries to \nestablish a one-size-fits-all, cookie cutter approach to address a \nperceived need, it ignores the unique circumstances which are so \nimportant in developing the best way to address that need. The \nlegislation presented by the Republican leadership recognizes this \nfact.\n  The difficulties associated with the Federal approach to problem \nsolving are especially evident in rural States, like my home state of \nIdaho. The kind of help which people in rural communities may need \ndiffers dramatically from the kind of assistance an individual in New \nYork, or Miami, or Los Angeles may need. In order to address those \nneeds, States must have flexibility. A program which is designed to \nhelp families who live in our major metropolitan areas, quite simply, \nwill not work in Wallace, Idaho--a community with less than 2,000 \npeople. It may not even work in Boise, which is Idaho's largest city. \nThe reverse is also true. A program which is capable of helping folks \nin a State like Idaho--which has a population density of just over 12 \npeople per square mile--is likely to have little relevance in Detroit \nor Boston. Mr. President, I do not want anyone in this country who is \nstruggling to make something of themselves, whether they are from \nIdaho, or Minnesota, or Arizona, or North Carolina, to be hampered in \ntheir efforts because of rules and regulations which ignore the fact \nthat this Nation is not uniform--that people in all areas of the \ncountry have unique circumstances which simply cannot be addressed in \none prescriptive Federal package.\n  Mr. President, I stated earlier that welfare reform is about freedom \nfor the States. More importantly, it is about freedom for the people. \nFor too long now we have witnessed a vicious cycle of poverty in this \nNation which, once entered, is nearly impossible to escape. We have a \nsystem of welfare which does \n\n[[Page S 13612]]\nnot focus on getting and keeping people off the Federal rolls, but \ninstead appears to be based on the belief that once one has become a \npart of the system, they will never again desire to become self-\nsufficient. I do not believe this is true. I believe most welfare \nrecipients, if given the opportunity, would gladly find a way to end \ntheir dependence on the Government. It is with these people in mind \nthat we must complete our work on welfare reform legislation, so we may \ngive current and future welfare recipeients the freedom to break out of \npoverty.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to many of my colleagues share their \nthoughts on the legislation we are now considering. As could be \nexpected, the bill does not have unanimous support. Some think it has \ntoo many strings on the block grants, other say not enough. Some \nbelieve even more programs should be block granted. Regardless of \nwhether or not any particular amendments were added to the bill, \nhowever, I ask my colleagues to keep in mind the long-term implications \nof what we are trying to do. I would ask them to ask themselves one \nsimple question, ``Does this bill get us closer to our goals then we \nwould be if we did nothing?'' If the answer is yes, and I believe it \nis, I would urge them to support the leadership package. In doing this, \nwe can finally break the cycle of poverty which has gripped too many \nAmericans, and help them get back on their feet. And in so doing, we \nwill help all Americans.\n  In closing, in considering welfare reform I think we would be wise to \nheed the words of one of this nation's greatest leaders, President \nAbraham Lincoln. It was Lincoln who once said,\n\n       The legitimate object of government, is to do for a \n     community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can \n     not do, at all, or can not, so well do, for themselves--in \n     their separate, and individual capacities. In all that the \n     people can individually do as well for themselves, government \n     ought not interfere.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe this applies equally well to the \nrelationship between the States and the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment should not attempt to do for the States what the States are \ncapable of doing for themselves and for their residents. We have tried \nto do so for the last 30 years, and we have not succeeded. It is time \nwe let the States decide how to meet the needs of the less fortunate, \nusing State and local solutions. If we do this, we grant the States a \nlevel of freedom they have not had in years, and we move one step \ncloser toward giving welfare recipients hope that they too may soon be \nfree of a system which has perpetuated poverty and social decline. And \nfreedom, I would say to my colleagues, is what this Government is \nsupposed to be about.\n  I thank the chair and the managers of the bill for their courtesy, \nand I yield the floor.\n    the child abuse prevention and treatment act amendments of 1995\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, child abuse is a critical issue facing our \nNation. Each year, close to one million children are abused or \nneglected and, as a result, in need of assistance and out of home care. \nCAPTA is a small but vital link in the provision of these services.\n  S. 919, which has been included in the Dole welfare reform bill, \nstreamlines CAPTA's State plan and reporting requirements; eliminates \nunnecessary research and technical assistance activities; and \nencourages local innovation through a restructured demonstration \nprogram.\n  Additionally, we have consolidated the Child Abuse Community Based \nPrevention Grants, Family Resource Centers, Family Support Centers into \nthe Community-Based Family Resource and Support Grants.\n  Finally, S. 919 repeals the Temporary Child Care for Children with \nDisabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act, title VII (F) of the McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act, and the Emergency Child Abuse Prevention \nGrants.\n  Mr. President, each day, hundreds of children and families come into \ncontact with, and are affected by, our Nation's child protective \nsystem. For many, it is a frightening experience. For others--for those \non the front lines, it is sometimes an opportunity to rescue children \nfrom horrific circumstances.\n  Unfortunately, the issues facing this overburdened system are seldom \neasily resolved. Too often--overworked, underpaid, untrained, and \nsometimes overzealous caseworkers have a tremendous and devastating \nimpact on families.\n  Decisions are routinely made to remove children and place them in \nfoster care--into situations that are sometimes far worse than from \nwhere they came. Other times, because of mounting paperwork and case \nfiles, a serious case goes uninvestigated--or a decision to return a \nchild to an unsafe home is made because there are no more out-of-home \nplacements available. These are all difficult circumstances that \nrequire balance, training, and resources.\n  Since 1974, CAPTA, though a relatively small program, has assisted \nStates in meeting child protection needs. It is a small, but powerful \nprogram, because its mandates have radically changed how we view child \nprotection.\n  Unfortunately, not all of these changes have been helpful. CAPTA has, \nuntil now, been viewed as a very prescriptive program, with States \njudged, not on how well they protect children, but how close they come \nto mirroring some Federal definition or example of how things ought to \nbe.\n  The 1995 CAPTA amendments are an important first step aimed at \nredressing some of the problems in CAPTA while, at the same time, \nbuilding upon its strengths. Most experts agree that what CAPTA can do \nand do best is provide guidance to States; assist States with training \nand technical assistance; and promote better research and dissemination \nof information while allowing for maximum flexibility in approach and \nresponse.\n  S. 919, as unanimously reported out by the Labor Committee and \nincluded in the Dole bill, builds on those strengths. Specifically, \nthis legislation:\n  Eliminates unnecessary bureaucracy by repealing mandates for a \nNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, the U.S. Advisory Board, \nand the Interagency Task Force on Child Abuse. Instead, the Secretary \nmay use her discretion in deciding whether or not they are an essential \nfunction;\n  Restructures and consolidates various research functions into one \ncoordinated effort;\n  Places a significant emphasis on local experimentation by expanding \nDemonstration Grants to encourage local innovation and experimentation. \nOne of these grants would be available for a triage system approach \nwhich Labor Committee members heard very exciting reports about during \na subcommittee hearing. Others include training for mandatory \nreporters, families, service providers, and communities;\n  And reforms the Basic State Grants by allowing greater flexibility to \nthe States in determining the circumstances and intensity of \nintervention that is required, while encouraging them to look to other \npreventative services that can be provided to families, when intensive \nintervention is not called for.\n  Determining the appropriate level of intervention is a very important \nconsideration. We have studied closely the numbers of abuse and neglect \nreports that have been filed. Of the close to 3 million reports that \nhave been filed, only one-third are eventually substantiated. This \nmeans that over 2 million are either unsubstantiated or even false. And \nwhile I know that these numbers and how they are interpreted are the \nsource of some disagreement, the fact remains that for whatever reason, \nover 2 million investigations at some level, are occurring, and \npossibly resulting in inappropriate interventions--including removal of \nthe child from the home.\n  Members of the Labor Committee may recall the testimony of Jim Wade \nwho spoke of his 3-year ordeal, in which his daughter was wrongfully \nremoved from his home. I have received many such reports and \ncomplaints, and while we should be mindful not to legislate by \nanecdote, these stories involve real people and are chilling.\n  With the State grant, we have worked to find ways to improve \nreporting so that caseworkers are able to assess and effectively \nrespond to cases of abuse and neglect with an appropriate response.\n  We have also ensured that persons who maliciously file reports of \nabuse or \n\n[[Page S 13613]]\nneglect will no longer be protected by CAPTA's immunity for reporting. \nOnly good-faith reports will be protected.\n  Finally, we have clarified the definition of child abuse or neglect \nto provide additional guidance and assistance to States as they \nendeavor to protect children from abuse and neglect.\n  Let me briefly mention the other programs authorized in the 1995 \nCAPTA amendments: the new Community-Based Family Resource and Support \nGrants represent the result of nearly a full year's effort to \nconsolidate the Community Based Prevention Grant, Respite Care Program, \nand Family Resource Programs; the Family Violence Prevention and \nServices Act which provides assistance to States primarily for \nshelters; the Adoption Opportunities Act which supports aggressive \nefforts to strengthen the capacity of States to find permanent homes \nfor children with special needs; the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act \nwhich provides for the needs of children who are abandoned, especially \nthose with AIDS; the Children's Justice Act; the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act and section 214 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the members for their attention. \nThese are important programs and they will affect many children and \nfamilies. I urge the adoption of the 1995 CAPTA amendments.\n\n\n                              student aid\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, with regard to title V of H.R. 4, the Work \nOpportunity Act, I am interested in clarifying an issue regarding the \napplicability of the term ``assistance * * * for which eligibility is \nbased on need'' to various student loan programs. As I understand this \nlegislation, eligibility for needs-based public assistance will either \nbe subject to a deeming period or will be forbidden for a period of \nfive years for most non-citizens. At this time, there seems to be an \nerroneous public perception that all student financial aid programs \nwill be subject to these provisions. This is not the case. In the \ninterests of responsible legislating, I think it is important to \nclarify that unsubsidized student loans are not needs-based and should \ntherefore not be subject to the requirements of title V.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, Senator Mack is correct. Although the \nterm ``assistance * * * for which eligibility is based on need'' in \ntitle V of H.R. 4 would apply to most forms of student financial aid, \nthe unsubsidized student loan program is indeed a financial aid program \nwhich is not based upon need. Therefore, this particular program would \nnot be subject to the deeming period or 5-year ban established in title \nV of this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support of the \ncomments made by Senators Mack and Simpson on this issue.\n                             children's ssi\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have a series of clarifications \nconcerning the children's SSI program that I would like to discuss with \nthe majority leader.\n  But first, let me express my appreciation to Senator Dole for his \nleadership in helping us reach a compromise on this issue. The SSI \nagreement is not everything I had hoped to achieve when Senator Chafee \nand I introduced the Children's SSI Eligibility Reform Act, but it is \nclearly an improvement over the House bill.\n  In addition, I believe the agreement includes a number of extremely \nimportant provisions to both address criticisms that have been leveled \nagainst the Children's SSI program and protect children with severe \ndisabilities. I am extremely pleased we were able to reach a bipartisan \ncompromise on this issue, and thank Senator Dole, Senator Santorum, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Chafee, Senator Simpson, Senator Jeffords, and \nothers who were so deeply involved.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the Record the intent \nsurrounding several of the provisions in the amendment. First, the \namendment deletes the word ``pervasive'' from the definition of child \ndisability that was included in the welfare reform bill reported in May \nby the Finance Committee. This is an important change, and one that I \nfully support. Would the majority leader clarify his understanding of \nthe intent of this change?\n  Mr. DOLE. I want to thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nleadership and hard work on this issue. Children with disabilities are \ncertainly among those most at risk in our society, and we want to make \nsure we are doing the right thing by them. He and Senator Chafee have \nworked extremely hard to bring the Senate to this point.\n  As for the Senator's question, I understand that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota was concerned that the term ``pervasive'' included in the \nearlier definition implied some degree of impairment in almost all \nareas of a child's functioning or body systems. That was not the intent \nof the earlier proposed change to the statute. It is expected that the \nchildren's SSI program will serve children with severe disabilities. \nSometimes children will have multiple impairments; sometimes they will \nnot.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also understand that the amendment is designed to \nfacilitate expert analysis of the SSI program for children by the \nNational Academy of Science, to ensure that program changes, including \ndetermination of disability, are based on the best possible science.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, I think we can all agree that the children's\n   SSI needs a tune up. The provision for a study by the National \nAcademy of Sciences of the disability determination procedures used by \nthe Social Security Administration will help accomplish this goal, and \nhelp us obtain a realistic picture of how an impairment affects each \nchild's abilities.\n\n  No doubt about it, the children's SSI program is extremely important \nfor some children with disabilities. But as the Senator from North \nDakota made mention, there have been widespread allegations that some \nchildren on SSI are not truly disabled, or money is spent in ways that \ndo not benefit the child. I hope this study--in addition to the changes \nwe have made in the law--will help restore confidence in this program.\n  Again, it is my expectation that this program will continue to serve \nchildren with severe disabilities, and that includes properly \nevaluating children too young to test, children with multiple \nimpairments, and children with rare or unlisted impairments which \nnevertheless result in marked and severe functional limitations.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it expected that the Social Security Administration \nand the Congress will rely heavily on the expert advice of the National \nAcademy of Science when engaging in future regulatory activity and \ndeliberations regarding impairments of children in the SSI program?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes. But I also hope we hear from many others as well with \ngood information to offer, including other experts, parents, and \nadvocates.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If I might also ask the majority leader a question. The \nleadership amendment and the Finance Committee proposal are both silent \nabout the purpose of children's SSI. However, unlike the House \nproposal, both retain the cash benefit nature of the program. This is a \nconcept that Senator Conrad and I thought was extremely important when \nwe introduced the Childhood SSI Eligibility Reform Act, and I am \npleased that the majority leader's proposal retains flexibility within \nthe SSI program by retaining the cash nature of the program. It is \nimportant for the SSI program to reflect the impact a disability has on \nfamilies faced with a variety of circumstances. SSI often provides \nimportant assistance to families by replacing a portion of the income \nthat is lost when a parent must care for a disabled child. The flexible \nnature of SSI is indispensable for many parents who are rendered unable \nto work because they must stay at home to provide care and supervision \nto their children with disabilities. Does the majority leader share our \nassessment?\n  Mr. DOLE. No doubt about it, for some families with a severely \ndisabled child, SSI can be a lifesaver. It allows them to care for \ntheir child at home--who might otherwise be institutionalized at much \ngreater cost to the government--or obtain services they could not \notherwise afford. If a small payment can help a disabled child stay \nwith his family, or grow into a productive adult, it is better for the \nchild and better for society. SSI benefits provide the greatest \nflexibility, and the least amount of bureaucratic redtape.\n\n[[Page S 13614]]\n\n  But I think there may be some difference of opinion about the purpose \nof the program. The SSI program was originally started to provide a \nsmall cash income to individuals who cannot work because of age or \ndisability. But the children's SSI program had a somewhat different \npurpose--to help poor families with the extra costs of having a child \nwith a disability. It seems the program has expanded without much \nCongressional attention. In my view, we need to revisit the purpose of \nthe SSI program. The Finance Committee has not tackled this problem \nyet, but it should and I believe it will. But the Senate decision to \nretain the cash benefit is clearly an important difference from the \nHouse.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to join in the comments of both of my \ncolleagues regarding the cash benefit nature of the SSI program. This \nprovision is critically important, and I commend the Majority Leader \nfor including it in the amendment. If I might address one additional \nquestion to the majority leader, it is the intent of this Senator and \nother supporters of this amendment on both sides of the aisle that this \namendment is the position of the Senate, and that it will be vigorously \ndefended in conference with the House of Representatives. Will the \nmajority leader insist on this provision during conference with the \nHouse?\n  Mr. DOLE. This is a bipartisan compromise with broad support, and in \nmy view it should be a position to which the Senate should firmly hold \nin conference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Base on these assurances, I am pleased to support the \ncompromise we have developed on children's SSI. This is not everything \nI had hoped to achieve, but it is critically important that the Senate \nenter conference with a solid, unified position.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as one of the \noriginal cosponsors of the Republican leadership welfare reform bill.\n  We have entered this historic debate because the 30-year War on \nPoverty remains a war, but the nation is losing. According to recent \nanalysis, aggregate government spending on welfare programs over the \nlast 30 years has surpassed $5.4 trillion, an expenditure that exceeds \nour national debt.\n  Despite this spending, America's national poverty rate remains at \nabout the same level as 1965, the year that President Johnson launched \nthe War on Poverty.\n  Despite the best of intentions, we have a welfare system that \n``traps'' children and families in a cycle of dependency, and that \nencourages behavior leading to indefinite reliance on welfare. It \nfosters a lifestyle that is in direct opposition to the motivators that \npropel others to get up and go to work every day.\n  The Republican leadership's bill emphasizes work, families and \ngenuine hope for the future while giving the States greater \nresponsibility--and flexibility--for managing welfare.\n  This measure has been a long time coming, and I do not just mean this \nsummer. Our distinguished colleague from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, \ndid an outstanding job in 1993 and 1994 as chairman of the Republican \nWelfare Reform Task Force. Health Care Reform diverted the Senate, but \nit did not diminish the value of their work. Much of what we are \nconsidering today is built directly on the strong foundation of Senator \nBrown's early proposals.\n  I also think back to the 1986 State of the Union Address of President \nRonald Reagan. That year he proposed Welfare Reform. This was another \nstep. The Reagan welfare reform plan, the Family Security Act of 1988, \nwas guided to enactment by the fine hand of the then Finance Committee \nChairman, Senator Moynihan of New York, who is now serving with such \ndistinction as the co-manager of this bill.\n  The Family Security Act of 1988 served as a laboratory for S. 1120. \nIn 1988, we first dealt with the issues of workfare versus. welfare, \nthe dilemmas of teen pregnancy and illegitimacy, the high costs of work \nrequirements, and the need for broad federal waiver authority. It is \nthe State and local levels of government which administer the American \nwelfare system, not the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I am proud that under the waiver authority established by the Family \nSecurity Act, the Commonwealth of Virginia has been in the vanguard of \nwelfare reform initiatives.\n  While we are struggling to come together in the Senate to pass S. \n1120, my State has already enacted and is now implementing what we call \nthe Virginia Independence Program or ``VIP'' for short.\n  VIP is the visionary welfare reform program brought to the people of \nVirginia under the outstanding leadership of Gov. George Allen. It was \nno easy task to battle a sometimes hostile state legislature, dominated \nby the other political party, as well as the mountain of redtape \nrequired in securing the necessary Federal waivers. He succeeded \nsplendidly, however, in achieving his goals, and now Virginia is in the \ncareful, watchful, early stages of actual reform.\n  Governor Allen, with his great courtesy, personally journeyed to \nWashington on September 13 to deliver a thoughtful and, in my judgment, \nimmensely helpful letter on what he believes the Senate should \naccomplish in welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter from Governor \nAllen be printed in the Record at this point for the benefit of all of \nmy colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                               September 13, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear John, As the United States Senate continues to debate \n     welfare reform this week, I believe that our experiences in \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia can be instructive.\n       I hope you will consider Virginia's plan to be a model for \n     the nation. The comprehensive Virginia plan is based upon the \n     principles of the work ethnic and personal responsibility. \n     Our experiences support the need for an overall block grant \n     approach, that will give States the flexibility to \n     appropriately design programs that address the individual \n     needs of the citizens of their State, return AFDC to a \n     program of temporary assistance for those in need, and \n     require work for all able-bodied recipients.\n       I understand that there will be attempts to amend S. 1120 \n     by attaching new chains on the block grants to the States. As \n     a staunch proponent of federalism and self-determination, I \n     oppose such choke chains, whether they are ``conservative'' \n     or ``liberal'' ones, and respectfully encourage and request \n     that you to do likewise for Virginians.\n       Experience shows that the States are perfectly capable of \n     taking this responsibility and exercising it wisely for our \n     citizens. Virginia's landmark welfare reform legislation is a \n     prime example. Our plan applies to the entire AFDC caseload, \n     with a work requirement for 48,000 of our 74,000 cases. It \n     incorporates common-sense principles into the welfare system \n     by rewarding responsible behavior and providing \n     compassionate, but temporary, assistance for those in need.\n       In addition to providing opportunity and support to \n     recipients, the program is expected to save the taxpayers \n     more than $130 million over the first five years. Already, we \n     have had a significant drop in our caseload. Restrictive \n     maintenance-of-effort requirements rob States of the ability \n     to share in these savings and the incentives to achieve them. \n     They should be opposed.\n       As you know, Virginia received a waiver to begin \n     implementing this landmark welfare reform plan on July 1 of \n     this year. You also should be aware that, before this waiver \n     was granted, we spent the better part of two months fending \n     off efforts by the Clinton Administration to completely \n     rewrite our plan. The administration proposed literally \n     hundreds of changes or conditions in the waiver process. Many \n     of them involved very fundamental things; if agreed to, they \n     would have raised the cost of the program significantly and \n     changed essential provisions.\n       We had a tough fight in our state legislature--with a final \n     bill clearing the General Assembly only in the last hour of \n     the 1995 legislative session. At issue were questions such as \n     whether we would have a real work requirement and a real time \n     limit; whether there would be a child cap and strong \n     requirements for paternity establishment; and whether we \n     would require minor recipients to stay in school and live at \n     home with a parent or guardian.\n       This spirited debate was expected, given the fundamental \n     nature of the changes and reforms we were proposing. We did \n     not expect, however--after the legislative process was \n     completed at the state level and we had decided what state \n     law and state policy were going to be--that we would have to \n     turn around and refight all those battles with the federal \n     bureaucracy through the waiver process. A good example was \n     the time limit. We went to the wall with HHS over the issue \n     of whether we in Virginia would be able to define the \n     circumstances that would allow \n\n[[Page S 13615]]\n     someone a hardship exemption from the time limit. That is, of course, a \n     very fundamental issue.\n       This ordeal leaves me firmly convinced that the whole \n     concept of waivers inherently flawed. The waiver process by \n     definition invites prescriptive micromanagement and nit-\n     picking from federal bureaucrats in Washington.\n      What States need in order to accomplish this fundamental \n     transformation of welfare is not new waiver guidelines, as \n     the President has suggested, but elimination of the need \n     for waivers in the first place through a genuine block \n     grant, with flexibility guaranteed by statute.\n       There are other areas in which the Congress could learn \n     from the experience of States like Virginia. We have \n     implemented a child cap here that places responsibility for \n     additional children upon those who should bear the \n     responsibility--the parents. Our program places a cap on \n     benefits for additional children in an AFDC family, but \n     guarantees that 100% of support funds collected from the \n     father will be turned over to the family. This will encourage \n     responsibility, paternity establishment, and child support.\n       In Virginia, we recognize the important relationship \n     between economic development and welfare reform. We cannot \n     continue to prepare AFDC recipients simply for welfare jobs. \n     Instead, we must train them to compete for existing jobs in \n     our expanding economy. After passage of our welfare \n     initiative, we turned our attention to workforce development. \n     In order to reform the welfare system effectively, we are in \n     the process of restructuring our job-training programs so \n     that they help match workforce training and skills with the \n     needs of our private sector in our local communities. I would \n     encourage you to ensure that workforce development \n     consolidation is included in the overall welfare reform bill, \n     as the two are essential to a State's success.\n       What the debate really boils down to is who does the U.S. \n     Senate trust to make these policy decisions--the federal \n     bureaucracy or the elected representatives of the people at \n     the State level. This is a basic philosophical question. The \n     choices you make will determine whether the bold innovations \n     that are occurring in Virginia and other States can move \n     forward, or whether federal bureaucrats will continue to \n     micromanage and second guess the decisions of the people of \n     the States and their duly elected representatives. I \n     respectfully urge you to place your trust in the States, \n     which are leading the way.\n       Thank you for all your solid leadership for our cause in \n     many ways and congratulations on your selection as Chairman \n     of the Rules Committee.\n       With warm regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     George Allen.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. As you will note, the Governor fully supports the block \ngrant process with as few Federal strings as possible. He desires \nneither conservative nor liberal mandates. In the spirit of true \nfederalism, he is confident that the people of Virginia are fully able \nto design and administer our own welfare reform programs.\n  Here are a few parallels between what we are seeking to do in S. 1120 \nand what the Commonwealth of Virginia has already set into motion.\n  We are seeking to block grant the entire Aid to Families With \nDependent Children [AFDC] Program and have half the eligible population \nparticipating in work requirements by the year 2002. Virginia, on the \nother hand, will implement AFDC reform in 4 years for our entire 74,000 \ncaseload.\n  While we have debated the duration of welfare payments and whether or \nnot to guarantee transitional benefits such as child care, Virginia has \npassed a 2 year time period for welfare recipients, during which \nintensive work experience, education and training will be provided. To \nfacilitate the transition from welfare to work, medical care, child day \ncare, and transportation assistance will be provided. We did not need \nsomeone in Washington dictating what we already knew. Young welfare \nparents have to be freed from domestic burdens if they are to truly \nbenefit from workfare participation.\n  And, we promote and strengthen two parent families by assuring that \nboth are eligible for benefits, that paternity is acknowledged, and \nthat child support is more strictly enforced. Minor custodial parents \nare asked to live with their own parents or legal guardians, as long as \nthe home is not abusive, and they must comply with compulsory school \nattendance laws.\n   These and other commonsense reforms are all on the way in Virginia. \nWe welcome and encourage other States to watch closely what we do and \nto lend us the benefit of your own experiences and expertise in \nreformulating the welfare equation.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to commend the Senate \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, and his key staff members, Sheila Burke \nand Nelson Rockefeller. This has been a collective effort, requiring \naccommodation of broad and diverse views, and it could not have been \ndone without the good efforts and offices of the Senate majority \nleader. They have fine tuned the art of compromise while maintaining a \nstrong and underriding traditional Republican philosophy.\n  In all seriousness, a brighter and more hopeful day for many \ndisadvantaged Americans is almost within our reach. At the end of this \nday, let us not disappoint those who are looking to us now for an \nopportunity to join in the American success story.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since last week, the full Senate has \ndebated the arduous task of reforming a welfare system that has failed \nin its mission to eliminate poverty in America. Throughout our history, \nAmericans have held to the belief that hard work and investment are the \nstaples for family security and economic success. Yet, our Nation's \nwelfare system has turned away from these basic principles. Working \nAmericans complain that the welfare system promotes dependence and \nwaste, while many welfare recipients struggle for the chance to work \ntheir way off the rolls.\n  Since 1965, America has infused $5.4 trillion into a public \nassistance network composed of almost 80 State and Federal programs. At \nbest, the War on Poverty has produced temporary gains for poor \nfamilies. While the national poverty rate dropped from a high of 22 \npercent in 1959 to an historic low of 11 percent in 1973, the poverty \nrate had risen to 15 percent by 1993. Most tragically, our welfare \nsystem has failed to assist our Nation's most vulnerable families. From \n1969 to 1993, the child poverty rate declined by less than 1 percent of \nfamilies headed by single mothers.\n  America's welfare system has lost its focus. In the 1930's, the \nRoosevelt Administration created the Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren Program to help widows, orphans, and families suffering from \nabandonment or unemployment through difficult financial times. Today, \nthose in need must navigate an array of conflicting bureaucratic rules \nand program divisions that discourage work, and many times, family \nunity. Instead of liberating Americans from financial crisis, today's \nAFDC system fosters a detrimental cycle of generational welfare \nreliance.\n  Few dispute that welfare reform is necessary. Without change, single-\nparent families will continue to suffer from poverty, and the \nescalating cost of the status-quo will overwhelm our Nation's financial \nresources. Democrats and Republicans alike are focused on similar \ngoals--State flexibility and the end of unconditional assistance. But \nhow can these goals be attained? The answer is real, commonsense \nreform.\n  First, we must fundamentally restructure the way our welfare system \nworks. Our patchwork system of Federal and State welfare programs has \nproduced a complex and inconsistent means for distributing benefits. In \nincreasing numbers, States are requesting Federal waivers to \nrestructure federally defined welfare programs so they can effectively \ndeliver the services their citizens need. President Clinton recently \npromised the Nation's Governors a waiting period of only 120 days for \nthe processing of their waiver requests. However, states need more than \na fast-track system for bureaucratic review. They need real \nflexibility--the authority to develop public assistance programs that \npromote work, rather than automatic check writing.\n  Americans are increasingly concerned that an unconditional \nentitlement to welfare is displacing the desire for independence with \nthe expectation of permanent dependence. To successfully reduce \npoverty, welfare must focus on employment, not exemptions to work. Over \nthe years, we have tried a variety of complex, federally dominated work \nprograms. Efforts to attain sustainable employment for AFDC recipients \nhave become little more than a paper chase under the current Job \nOpportunities and Basic Skills [JOBS] Program. Despite good intentions, \nthe JOBS Program has failed and must be repealed. To effectively \nrespond to the day-to-day reality of the job market, States should be \nempowered with the authority to develop and adjust their \n\n[[Page S 13616]]\nwork programs according to recipient need and local job resources.\n  Welfare recipients also should know that public assistance is not \nfree money but an investment in their work potential. Welfare must be \ncontingent on real work. While appropriate job training is important, \nwe must not lose sight of the fact that classroom lessons mean nothing \nunless one can actually apply them to the workplace. Real work also \nmeans real responsibility. Those who refuse to work without sound cause \nshould see their actions directly reflected in their welfare benefit. \nJust like every other American employee, an hour's work should equal an \nhour's pay. In addition, a 5-year lifetime limit focuses recipients on \nwelfare's fundamental purpose--support for the attainment of self-\nsufficiency.\n  Second, reform should focus on abolishing abuse. I don't know of one \ntaxpayer that wants Food Stamps used for the purchase of drugs or \nalcohol. I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nshare my concern with fraud in our Nation's largest welfare program. I \nhave dedicated considerable effort to\n legislative proposals that would curtail waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe Food Stamp Program. The welfare reform bill before us meets this \nchallenge and helps ensure that food stamps are used for their intended \npurpose: to help needy Americans buy food to supplement their diet.\n\n  I am also pleased to see that this bill retains child nutrition \nprograms at the Federal level while successfully reducing excessive \nFederal regulation. These programs work and have successfully ensured \nthe health and nutritional well-being of future generations of \nchildren.\n  Third, it is essential that welfare reform uphold a standard of \nresponsibility to our Nation's children and families. Illegitimacy in \nAmerica is becoming the rule rather than the exception. The facts are \nalarming. Today, 1 in 3 children are born out-of-wedlock--by the turn \nof the century, this figure will be 1 in 2. Most disturbing of all is \nthe drastic increase in out-of-wedlock births among our youth. In 1960, \n15 percent of births to women under the age of 20 were out-of-wedlock. \nBy 1992, this figure had increased to 71 percent.\n  Today, the specter of poverty haunts single mothers and their \nchildren like never before. From 1976 to 1992, the proportion of \nsingle, never-married women receiving AFDC more than doubled, from 21 \npercent to almost 52 percent. Yet welfare assistance has failed to \nshepherd these needy families to a better future. The Congressional \nBudget Office found that single women receiving AFDC in 1992 were \npoorer than in 1976, even though they worked in about the same \nproportions.\n  The increasing number of single mother families living in poverty is \nfueled by the ease with which absent fathers ignore their parental \nresponsibilities. To reverse this devastating trend, we must take \nseriously the necessity of paternity identification. Fatherhood is not \na one-time-only event--it is a lifelong responsibility and should be \ntreated as such.\n  Paternity identification is an essential step toward the improved \ncollection of child support. In Kentucky, efforts in paternity \nidentification have head a substantial impact upon the collection of \nchild support for AFDC dependent families. In fiscal year 1994, 7 \ncounties ranked in the top 10 for both paternity identification and \nchild support collection.\n  Without a doubt, dead-beat dads must be held accountable for their \nchild support obligations. In 1991, fathers owed $17.7 billion in child \nsupport payments. Only 67 percent, however, was paid--a shortfall of \n$5.8 billion. If a father refuses to support his child, States have the \nright to make his parental responsibility crystal-clear by suspending \nhis driver's or professional license.\n  Mr. President, real reform means transforming welfare from a dead-end \nstreet to a bridge toward self-sufficiency and family security. Last \nyear in Owensboro, KY, three mothers shared with me their personal \nexperiences in the welfare system. They were deeply concerned about the \nfuture--how they would care for the health and well-being of their \nchildren as they tried to work their way off welfare. As they spoke, it \nwas clear that their success depended on their tenacity to break free \nfrom the confines of a welfare system that promises much but delivers \nlittle. It is for them and each of our Nation's 5 million AFDC families \nthat we must reject the status-quo of an empty entitlement system and \nreturn our welfare system to the basics of fairness, work, and family \nsecurity.\n\n\n                  the maintenance of effort amendment\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, Senator Graham asked a question yesterday \nduring consideration of my amendment on maintenance of effort which I \nam not sure I fully understood, and I wonder if he could ask the \nquestion again.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. The question is does the Chafee \nmodification to the maintenance of effort mean that a State would have \nto continue to maintain its effort at 80 percent if the Federal share \nis reduced.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from Florida for clarifying the \nissue. The answer is no, if the Federal share is reduced for whatever \nreason, the State maintenance of effort would also be reduced. This is \nthe hold-harmless provision that was included in both my amendment and \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for clarifying this \nissue for me.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today's debate is the culmination of a \nlong process of rethinking social programs. Welfare originally was \ndesigned as a transitional program--a safety net. The system is no \nlonger a temporary safety net, but a lifetime security blanket. The \nresult? Millions of Americans now are trapped in a cycle of dependency. \nTo end this cycle we must rethink our concept of welfare. We need a new \napproach.\n  The bill offered by the majority leader, Senator Dole, represents the \nfresh start we desperately need. The Dole bill would bring common sense \nback to welfare. It would restore personal responsibility and self-\nsufficiency. Compassion can no longer be defined in the number of \ndollars spent on welfare. Since the War on Poverty began three decades \nago, welfare spending has increased to more than $137.6 billion. \nDespite this massive infusion of cash, our poverty level remains \nvirtually the same--roughly 13 percent. Today, more than 69,000 South \nDakotans are on welfare. That is more people than the population of \nRapid City. We can no longer throw taxpayer dollars at a so-called \npoverty program that has not worked. We must change the incentives in \nthe current system that encourage dependency on welfare. We must \nrefocus our priorities to emphasize work and family. The Dole bill does \njust that.\n  My liberal friends on the other side of the aisle prefer to continue \nthe status quo. I do not understand why. The current system is cruel \nand unfair--to both welfare recipients and taxpayers. The current \nsystem holds people in a dependent state of poverty. It prevents them \nfrom realizing their personal potential and contributing to their \nfamily and community through work. Last June, I met with a group of \nmothers from South Dakota who are on welfare. Their heartfelt stories \nvaried, but all are working actively for the day when they will leave \nwelfare. They want welfare to be a transitional program. Their goal \nshould be the welfare system's goal as well.\n  We can no longer tolerate blatant gaming of the system. Generations \nof able-bodied families have stayed on welfare rather than work. This \nabuse is an insult to hardworking Americans. South Dakota has many \nworking poor families. The small farmer, the local waitress and \nconvenience store clerk struggle daily to provide for their families \nwithout government assistance. Welfare recipients should not get a free \nride at the expense of hard working taxpayers. Frankly, they should not \nlive easier or better than our working poor, who strive daily to put \nfood on the table without a handout. The loopholes that allow people to \ncheat the system and defraud taxpayers must be closed.\n  The Dole plan would transform welfare to workfare. It would restore \npersonal responsibility by requiring work for benefits after 2 years on \npublic assistance. Work would be required for food stamps as well. It \nwould impose a 5 year lifetime limit on benefits. The bill would end \ndisability assistance payments for alcohol and drug addicts to continue \ntheir habits, which is allowed under current law. It would \n\n[[Page S 13617]]\ntighten eligibility for food stamps. It would toughen child support \nenforcement. The Dole bill also would streamline child care programs, \nchild nutrition programs, and job training programs. Collectively, \nthese steps would move our antipoverty programs from welfare to \nworkfare; dependency to personal responsibility. It is about time.\n  We all agree that we have a responsibility to provide public \nassistance to truly needy children and families. This bill would \ncontinue the necessary transition assistance for those families who \nfind themselves in circumstances beyond their control. It would not cut \nbenefits to needy children. Instead, it would eliminate one-third of \nthe cumbersome bureaucracy at the Department of Health and Human \nServices and scores of needless Federal regulations.\n  The second pillar of personal responsibility is family. Welfare \nreform should remove disincentives to a sound family structure. The \ncurrent system rewards illegitimacy and discourages marriage. An entire \nclass of children are growing up in single parent families, usually \nwithout fathers. South Dakota small towns and cities are no longer \nimmune to these problems. If we expect to restore family values, we \nmust first restore the family structure. We should encourage marriage \nand family values while we encourage work.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Dole bill would give South Dakota and \nother States the ability to craft the solutions that best serve local \nneeds. It has been proven time and again that Washington bureaucrats \ncannot completely understand unique local needs from thousands of miles \naway. Nor can we expect Washington bureaucrats to be the sole source of \ncreative changes. By giving States welfare funds in a block grant, \nSouth Dakota would be free to pursue innovative ways to meet the needs \nof their welfare recipients.\n  Like many other States, South Dakota has been operating under a \nwaiver from the Federal Government since January 1, 1995. This waiver \nhas allowed them to make some of the key reforms called for in the Dole \nbill. South Dakota implemented work for benefits, and incentives to \nmoving off welfare, such as a transition period between AFDC support \nand employment. These changes are working. Case rolls are decreasing \ndramatically. In fiscal year 1994, South Dakota had a monthly average \nof 19,446 people on aid to families with dependent children [AFDC]--the \ncentral welfare cash assistance program. In May 1995, we had 16,737 \npeople on AFDC. This reduction is proof that workfare truly works. We \ncan change the incentives in the system. Further, South Dakota, like \nother States, can do a better job than the Federal Government.\n  I would like to speak for a few moments about the unique welfare \nproblems in South Dakota. A number of the welfare problems in South \nDakota are ours alone--in fact, they differ greatly from even our \nMidwest neighbors. My State has three of the five poorest counties in \nthe entire Nation. Our State has the lowest wages in the country. More \nthan half of our welfare recipients--58 percent--are native Americans--\nthe highest percentage in the country. In some reservation areas, \nunemployment runs more than 80 percent. Long distances between towns \nand a lack of public transportation are further barriers to gainful \nemployment and quality child care. All of these factors create a \nsituation that needs special attention. What is needed to end welfare \ndependency in Oglala, Fort Thompson, or Rapid City, SD, is not what is \nneeded in Los Angeles or Mississippi. With this bill, we recognize that \nwe are a nation with people of vastly different needs. As such, we need \nindividualized solutions.\n  True welfare reform in South Dakota demands welfare reform on our \nreservations. Because of South Dakota's special problems, I have been \nespecially concerned with the treatment of native American tribes in \nthis legislation. Both the tribes and the State of South Dakota agree \nthat the best way to relieve poverty and welfare dependency on \nreservations is give tribes the option to run their own welfare \nprograms. A number of my colleagues--Senators McCain, Hatch, Murkowski, \nand Domenici--and myself, have agreed on a proposal which is included \nin the Dole bill. Our proposal would give tribes the ability to \nallocate their share of a State's AFDC dollars among tribal members. \nMuch like the overall welfare system, handing out unlimited Federal \ndollars in public assistance has not changed the deplorable poverty on \nreservations. Welfare reform for native American tribes also means \nchanging incentives. Workfare must be employed on our native American \ntribes, but done in a manner that recognizes the unique circumstances \nthat exist. By making tribes directly responsible for their members, \ntribes will have an incentive to find solutions to chronic unemployment \nand poverty. This also is consistent with the long-standing Federal \npolicy of tribal self-governance. Under our proposal, for example, \ntribes in high unemployment areas such as Shannon County would be given \nsome flexibility in meeting participation rates. This proposal is fair \nand I thank all my colleagues for their help in taking the first step \nto resolve this important, but difficult issue.\n  I am proud to be part of this effort today. Ultimately, what this \nbill is about is change--positive change. We can change the current \nfailed system to help people become self-sufficient and productive \nmembers of society. We can change incentives to restore personal \nresponsibility and family values. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that workfare becomes a \nreality.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13581-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a problem which \nseverely affects the economic growth of my home state of South Dakota. \nThis problem is an acute shortage of air service within my state \ncoupled with insufficient connecting air service between South Dakota \ncities and hub airports in nearby states. Congressional attention is \nneeded.\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 created significant domestic \ntravel benefits for many Americans. In addition, airline efficiencies \nresulting from deregulation have helped reduce the cost of \ninternational travel. Unfortunately, these benefits have not been \nevenly distributed across the country. Indeed, they have not been \nshared by Americans living in many smaller cities and rural \ncommunities.\n  One need only try to schedule air travel to South Dakota to know that \nmy state, as well as other rural states, have paid a harsh price for \nairline deregulation. For numerous small cities, fares are higher and \nservice less frequent since deregulation. Moreover, I know from \npersonal experience--and statistics from the U.S. Department of \nTransportation (DOT) confirm--that non-stop jet service to many South \nDakota cities has been replaced by connecting turboprop service. The \nresult? Often, it is less desirable service involving circuitous \nrouting on slower and less comfortable aircraft.\n  Mr. President, several months ago I requested the General Accounting \nOffice (GAO) to prepare a study comparing air service for large, medium \nand small cities across the country. That study, which I understand is \nprogressing well, is considering differences between these markets in \nterms of the cost of air travel for consumers, the extent to which jet \nservice is available, \n\n[[Page S 13618]]\nand safety. I am confident this study will be very enlightening.\n  In connection with the GAO study, the DOT already has provided \nstatistics that dramatically illustrate the great burden rural states \nlike South Dakota bear as a result of airline deregulation. For \nexample, for the month of February 1978, prior to deregulation, there \nwere a total of 2,384 scheduled commercial flights departing South \nDakota airports with 186,080 seats available for the traveling public. \nBy comparison, for the month of February 1995, there were 2,421 \ncommercial flights departing my home state but only 94,538 seats were \navailable on these flights. These statistics show that at the same time \nthe number of flights departing South Dakota increased by 1.5 percent, \nthe total number of seats available to the traveling public have \ndramatically decreased--a 49.1 percent reduction in seating capacity.\n  At first glance, these statistics seem inconsistent. How is it \npossible for the number of seats available for departing passengers to \nfall so dramatically at a time the number of departing flights actually \nincreased? The answer is that airlines are substituting small, non-jet \naircraft in small city markets previously served by larger jets. For \nexample, in May 1978, 19 percent of commercial flights departing Rapid \nCity, South Dakota involved non-jet aircraft. In May 1995, that \npercentage has more than doubled to 42 percent. Turboprop aircraft \nsubstitution in many small city markets is a post-deregulation reality.\n  The impact of non-jet aircraft substitution in smaller markets is \nsignificant. It hits my constituents and other small city air travel \nconsumers right in the wallet. Let me explain.\n  Like most goods and services, the price of air travel for consumers \ndepends to a large extent on the supply and demand of seats. Naturally, \ntherefore, air fares increase when demand for seats goes up at a time \nwhen the supply of available seats declines. That is precisely what has \nhappened in my state. As I mentioned, while the demand for air travel \nhas been generally increasing, the supply of seats available to \npassengers departing South Dakota has declined by 49.1 percent. Just \nask my constituents if this ``supply squeeze'' has caused higher air \nfares. It clearly has increased the price of air travel in South \nDakota.\n  At my request, the GAO is examining these air service issues on a \nnational scale. When the GAO report is issued, I plan to hold a hearing \non its findings. The report is expected to be completed in the Spring \nof next year.\n  Mr. President, I cannot stress strongly enough what a problem \ninsufficient and unaffordable air service is in South Dakota as well as \nother rural states. However, there may be hope for improvement. Indeed, \nI am guardedly optimistic about a new development.\n  The development to which I refer is the availability of a new \ngeneration of small commuter jets, so-called ``junior jets.'' These \nsmaller jets will give airlines a service option that previously did \nnot exist. Previously, when airlines' planners assigned aircraft to \nparticular routes, there was a choice only between larger jetliners and \nturboprops. Now, they have a third option.\n  Let me illustrate this point. On a flight which customarily serves 40 \npassengers, it is currently uneconomical for airlines to use jet \naircraft, which generally have 100 or more seats. Previously, the only \nalternative was to use turboprop service on such routes. Now, however, \njunior jets will permit airlines to serve that market with a 50 seat \njet aircraft.\n  If airlines purchase and use junior jets, jet service may return to \nsome small cities. Other small cities may see an increase in jet \nservice. Of significant importance, use of junior jets could increase \nthe number of seats available in small city markets and this added \ncapacity could help to lower the cost of air travel. In fact, these \njets could reduce airlines' costs of serving some routes and this could \nlead to lower air fares in the long run. All the air service challenges \nsmall communities face surely will not be resolved by junior jets. Use \nof these aircraft would, however, be a step in the right direction.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that a recent article appearing in the \nNew York Times which addresses the great potential junior jets \nrepresent in providing service to smaller air service markets be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks. Will airlines take \nadvantage of the option of providing air service to small cities on \njunior jets? As airlines mull over this questions, I urge them to keep \nseveral important points in mind.\n  First, last year more than 37 percent of all passenger enplanements \nin the United States occurred at airports other than the 25 large \nconnecting hubs, such as Chicago O'Hare. Many of these more than 200 \nmillion enplanements were passengers flying to or from small cities. I \nurge airlines to never forget that small cities, such as Sioux Falls, \nRapid City and Aberdeen, SD, are a very important component of their \ncustomer base and provide critical passenger feed for the airline \nindustry's domestic and international networks.\n  Second, improved quantity and quality of service and lower fares that \ncould result from the use of junior jets could stimulate demand in \nsmall city markets. In addition to making passengers happier, using \njunior jets could also benefit airlines by increasing the number of \npassengers traveling in these markets.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of airline deregulation have not been \nshared by citizens living in smaller cities. Fairness dictates this \nunfortunate reality be changed. I urge airlines to carefully consider \nthe benefits of using junior jets to serve these cities. These new \naircraft have the potential to make a bad situation better. I also urge \nairlines not to underestimate the importance of small city markets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 19, 1995]\n\n Relief for the Turboprop Blues--Small is Suddenly Beautiful for Short-\n                             Hop Travelers\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Until recently, whenever Scott Hansen, a Salt Lake City \n     lawyer, had to visit clients in Boise, Idaho, he dreaded \n     calling his travel agent. Of the eight daily flights, four \n     were on 135-passenger Delta Air Lines jets but the four \n     others were on much smaller turboprops flown by SkyWest \n     Airlines, a Delta commuter affiliate.\n       Of his last 75 flights, Mr. Hansen said, 45 required him to \n     squeeze into the bumpy, low-flying turboprops. ``There's no \n     comparison,'' he said. ``In the jet you have good seats, you \n     board through a jetway and you can stand up when you walk \n     down the aisle.''\n       But some relief for travelers like Mr. Hansen is in sight. \n     Several manufacturers from around the world are racing to \n     deliver a new wave of what might be called junior jets, able \n     to carry between 50 and 80 passengers. They are a vast \n     improvement over the somewhat smaller short-hop turboprop \n     planes, with their propeller-droning, often stomach-wrenching \n     flights as they go right through the middle of the seemingly \n     inevitable summer thunderstorm.\n       Forget about all the attention focused on the competition \n     between Boeing and Airbus for the next generation of jumbo \n     jets. What will really make a big difference in the daily \n     trials and tribulations of tens of thousands of bedraggled \n     airline passengers are these small, often overlooked, \n     regional jetliners.\n       Already, junior jets have started to replace turboprops on \n     some midlength routes like the Salt Lake City-Boise run. And \n     they are increasingly being used to connect less traveled, \n     more widespread cities where passengers were once condemned \n     to go through a connecting airport, often from one turboprop \n     to another.\n       In Brazil yesterday, the newest junior jetliner took its \n     first test flight after rolling out of its factory hangar in \n     Sao Jose dos Campos, a 170-mile hop from Rio de Janerio. The \n     Embraer-145 is a 50-seat regional jet built by Empresa \n     Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A., as the company is formally \n     known, to replace slightly smaller turboprops. That includes \n     Embraer's own Brasilia, which is the most widely used \n     turboprop in the United States. More than 200 are operated by \n     American carriers today.\n       The new plane, which costs $14.5 million, is basically a \n     stretched Brasilia turboprop fitted with jet engines. \n     Meanwhile, another 50-seat jet aircraft, the Canadair \n     Regional Jet, has started to make inroads in the United \n     States and elsewhere since it was introduced in 1993.\n       That Canadian-built plane, a derivative of Bombardier \n     Inc.'s Challenger corporate jet, is intended not so much to \n     replace turboprops on short hops as to allow nonstop jet \n     service between distant cities with limited economic ties, \n     such as Rapid City, S.D., and Salt Lake City, which are 508 \n     air miles apart. Even so, Sky West recently turned to \n\n[[Page S 13619]]\n     Canadair to replace its Brasilia turboprop planes on the Salt Lake \n     City-Boise run. Thirty-one Canadair Regional jets currently \n     operate in the United States.\n       That's not all. Earlier this summer two Fokker 70's a new \n     Dutch jet with 79 seats, began service for America West \n     Express, a unit of Mesa Air Group. They provide non-stop \n     service from Phoenix to Des Moines and to Spokane, Wash., \n     both long, thinly used markets that previously required at \n     least one stop. Also flying in the United States are 16 four-\n     engine British Aerospace BAe-146 jets and a few newer models \n     of the same plane. Fokker is a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G.\n       And at least one American plane maker, McDonnell Douglas, \n     is trying to develop a shorter version of its smooth-flying \n     MD-80. It has not yet decided whether to go ahead with \n     construction.\n       Over the next 20 years airlines worldwide are expected to \n     buy as many as 1,500 jets that carry fewer than 100 \n     passengers, said Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark, an \n     airline industry consulting firm in Arlington, Va.\n       Still, the turboprop is not about to disappear. Bombardier, \n     the Canadian plane maker, estimates that between 1993 and \n     2012 airlines worldwide will spend $91 billion to buy 8,107 \n     regional aircraft with 15 to 90 seats. Most of these planes \n     will be low-cost turboprops with 40 of more seats. Airline \n     industry experts say that turboprops will continue to serve \n     as the backbone of flights between small- and medium-sized \n     cities like Concord, N.H., and Syracuse and nearby major \n     airports, such as Boston and New York.\n       For an increasing number of lucky fliers, though, the \n     junior jets will provide a lot more speed and some added \n     comfort over turboprops. And for thousands of others, there \n     is the prospect of an end to the time-wasting change of \n     planes.\n       ``After two hours a turboprop is a real pain,'' Miss Beyer \n     said, ``Essentially there are two kinds of markets that can \n     be served by regional jets. Those that are more than 400 \n     miles apart, but are not large enough to command larger jet \n     equipment. And those markets that have been abandoned by the \n     major carriers since deregulation of the airlines--markets \n     that had been jet markets and should be jet markets.''\n       For years, the big United States aircraft manufacturers--\n     Boeing and McDonnell Douglas--resisted building smaller jets, \n     arguing that the development costs would be too high to \n     justify the expense of building jets that would inevitably \n     sell for much less than their bigger bread-and-butter jet \n     aircraft.\n       ``Then we hounded Canadair with the idea that they ought to \n     turn their Challenger business jet into a regional \n     airliner,'' Miss Beyer said. ``And ultimately they did and \n     now it is an absolute raving success.''\n       While off to a good start, it remains to be seen just how \n     successful the Canadair will be. Bombardier has delivered 65 \n     such Canadair jets and has orders for 37 more. It says it \n     plans to bring out a lengthened version that can carry 75 \n     passengers.\n       Aircraft makers readily acknowledge that most passengers do \n     not like turboprops, not just because of their noisy \n     vibrations and cramped space, but also because they appear \n     outdated and less safe. And the crash last October of a \n     French-made ATR turboprop plane, which led the Federal \n     Aviation Administration to ban the planes temporarily from \n     flying in icy weather, only added to the safety fears \n     surrounding turboprops. But the manufacturers insist that \n     view is misguided.\n       ``People tend to look at propellers and think old-\n     fashioned,'' said Colin Fisher, a spokesman for Bombardier, \n     which also makes a 50-seat turboprop, the Dash 8. ``But \n     Turboprop and jet technology were born in the same time \n     frame, around the time of World War II.''\n       Whatever the manufacturers say, passengers recognize a \n     clear difference. On a flight from Rochester to Cincinnati, a \n     Canadair Regional jet operated by Comair, another Delta \n     commuter affiliate, was exceptionally quiet and smooth, \n     taking off quickly and flying above the turbulence. But the \n     seats in junior jets do not vary that much in appearance and \n     comfort from those typically found in most turboprops.\n       The main reason more airlines do not rely on junior jets is \n     because they are much more expensive to buy than turboprops. \n     And even though they hold more seats, that's still a real \n     burden, particularly for commuter operators without a lot of \n     extra investment capital that are operating on paper-thin \n     margins. The new Embraer regional jet, for example, will cost \n     nearly double the $7.7 million price of its Brasilia \n     turboprop. A Canadair Regional jet costs even more--$17 \n     million to $22 million a copy.\n       But the new Brazilian operating costs are expected to be \n     comparable. Its new regional jet, Embraer says, should cost \n     about $27 an hour per seat to fly, compared with $29 per hour \n     for a Brasilia. And some airlines think the investment is \n     worthwhile, in part because jets fly much faster than \n     turboprops, allowing more flights each day. Delta Connection \n     flights on a Saab 340 turboprop between Rochester and La \n     Guardia Airport in New York City are scheduled for 85 \n     minutes, compared with USAir's 64 minutes via a 737 jet, \n     adding about one-third to the gate-to-gate time.\n       Jets can also cruise higher, which means fewer cups of \n     coffee ending up in passenger laps. ``You can fly up quickly \n     and get above the weather, which is especially attractive \n     during thunderstorm season,'' said David A. Siebenburgen, \n     president of Comair Holdings, the regional airline in \n     Cincinnati that introduced the Canadair Regional Jet into \n     service. ``Our customers love them.''\n       Comair operates 64 turboprops and 23 Canadair Regional \n     jets, but within five years the company expects to operate \n     fewer than 50 turboprops and at least 70 Canadair Regional \n     jets, Mr. Siebenburgen said.\n       And even though the carrying costs are higher, SkyWest, \n     based in Salt Lake City, sees advantages in the eight \n     Canadair Regional Jets, all leased, that it now flies.\n       ``The reason we feel comfortable with the risk,'' said \n     Bradford R. Rich, SkyWest's chief financial officer, ``is \n     that the plane fits into the longer, thinner markets we have. \n     We believe it can expand our market area because of the high \n     speed and comfort.''\n       As far as Canadair's new Brazilian competitor goes, it \n     already has 18 firm orders for its regional jet, five of them \n     from BWIA, a Caribbean airline. Embraer also says it has 16 \n     options and 127 letters of intent.\n       So far, however, no airline in the United States has \n     ordered an EMB-145. But Michael Warwicke, Embraer's vice \n     president for sales, is counting on a few orders to roll in \n     once the airplane completes flight-worthiness testing. Long-\n     suffering prop-jet passengers may want to start counting the \n     days.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13617-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill entitled the ``Public Broadcasting Financial \nIndependence and Family Viewing Act of 1995''; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND FAMILY VIEWING ACT \n                                OF 1995\n\n Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as Governor and Senator, I have been \na long time supporter of public broadcasting. In Nebraska, public \nbroadcasting leads the way in innovative programming, distance \nlearning, and educational opportunity. That dedication to excellence, \nto children and to families has made Nebraska Public Television an \nisland of decency, sanity, and enrichment in the\n sea of violence, sex, and immorality which is commercial television.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation titled the Public Broadcasting \nFinancial Independence and Family Viewing Act.\n  Opponents of public broadcasting have sparked a debate about the \nfuture on this national treasure. That debate has been healthy and \nironically could lead to the salvation of public broadcasting. As a \nmember of both the Senate Commerce Committee, and the \n\n[[Page S 13621]]\nSenate Budget Committee, I foresee a budgetary situation which \nthreatens the very existence of public radio and television regardless \nof who controls the House or the Senate. The reforms proposed in this \nlegislation would give public broadcasters the tools for survival.\n  As a strong supporter of public broadcasting, I have repeatedly \nexpressed several troubling concerns about recent public broadcasting \nprograms and policies. This legislation is also meant to refocus the \nmission of PBS and CPB on family-friendly, entertainment, educational, \ncultural, and informational programming.\n  I simply can not defend standards and practices which permit displays \nof nudity and use of language in CPB-funded dramatic programming which \nwould not be permitted on commercial broadcast television. Public \nbroadcasting can tackle controversial subjects but it should be done in \na manner which is not offensive.\n  Public broadcasting comes into the homes of American families thanks \nin part to the tax dollars of those families and thanks to the radio \nspectrum owned by the people. It is not too much to ask that \nprogramming be presented in a manner which is appropriate for a home \nwith children.\n  In this regard, I must give the Nebraska Educational Television \nnetwork credit for showing great sensitivity to Nebraska families. Last \nyear NETV only aired the edited version of the controversial program \n``tales of the city'' and decided not to broadcast some of the \nprogramming offered by PBS and other sources which push the envelope of \ntaste and propriety.\n  On a national level, I strongly believe that the CPB and PBS should \nshow the same sensitivity to taxpayers and viewers. It is not \ncensorship to ask\n that American tax dollars be spent in a manner that is consistent with \nAmerican values.\n\n  On the financial side, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should \nmore aggressively pursue and share in the spinoff profits generated by \nproducts related to CPB funded programming. It is tragic that public \nbroadcasting has made millions of dollars for others but must battle \neach year for modest appropriations.\n  In addition, under this legislation public broadcasters would be \ngiven spectrum and schedule flexibility as well as new channel \nplacement options which could generate additional nontax revenues. \nThese measures hold long-term promise toward the goal of making public \nbroadcasting more financially independent.\n  Mr. President, never before has the need for quality television been \nmore critical. Public broadcasting has a long tradition of meeting that \nneed for quality. I believe that we can reinvent public broadcasting. \nAs a supporter of public broadcasting, I am prepared to consider any \ncreative idea to lessen taxpayer burdens in this area. My one bottom \nline; my one nonnegotiable item is that public boardcasting remain \npublic. It should not be privatized or dismantled and sold to the \nhighest bidder. It is a national treasure which must remain in the \npublic domain.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this legislation and extend a hand of \nfriendship and cooperation to Members on both sides of the aisle. \nPublic broadcasting is an institution which means a great deal to the \npeople of Nebraska, and the Nation, and we must find ways to help it \nmeet the challenge of survival in a very difficult fiscal climate.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the National Institute of Justice to \nprovide technical assistance to State and local \n\n[[Page S 13622]]\nlaw enforcement entities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n  the national institute of justice technology assistance act of 1995\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, to empower citizens to take back \ntheir streets from criminals, it is vitally important that the Federal \nGovernment work in partnership with States and localities to deploy \nadditional officers in communities around the country. However, Mr. \nPresident, equally critical to the success of State and local police \nforces in protecting American citizens is the commitment of the Federal \nGovernment to serve as a partner to ensure that State and municipal \npolice officers have access to advanced technology and equipment to \neffectively fight crime.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice's National Institute of \nJustice [NIJ] provides this critical link between the Federal \nGovernment and local law enforcement agencies across the country. The \nmission of NIJ's Office of Science and Technology is to assist law \nenforcement, particularly on the State and local level, with upgrading \ntheir technological infrastructure. This involves the following \nfunctions: First, providing information on products and technologies; \nsecond, developing standards; third, testing and evaluating \ntechnologies and equipment; and fourth, research and development.\n  Because of the critical mission of NIJ, the legislation that I am \nintroducing today seeks an appropriation of an increase of $10 million \neach for fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 to enable NIJ to \ncontinue and expand the work that it is doing to enhance the \neffectiveness of State and local police departments.\n  Mr. President, research and development conducted by NIJ is a \nvaluable resource for State and local law enforcement agencies that are \noften confronted by criminals who have access to the most advanced \ncommercial technologies. The invention of soft body armor was developed \nout of a NIJ project. Since 1975, when NIJ first conducted field tests \nin 15 cities across the country, bulletproof vests have saved the lives \nof thousands of officers. NIJ is also responsible for significant \nadvances in the field of forensic science. For example, NIJ brought DNA \nidentification to the United States and developed new fingerprinting \ntechniques which permits officers to lift fingerprints on major \nfixtures in the field, without removing the fixture.\n  NIJ is currently developing products that will make police work safer \nand more efficient. For example, Mr. President, NIJ has developed a \nprototype rear airbag to use to control suspects in the back of a squad \ncar with minimal disruption. NIJ has also developed a prototype \nretractable barrier strip to enable police to safely stop a fleeing \nvehicle, thereby minimizing the need for dangerous high speed chases \nwhich often result in injuries to police officers or innocent \nbystanders.\n  Mr. President, many local police departments receive no assistance in \nidentifying technology and purchasing equipment. They operate as solo \nactors. For example, a local police department recently spent 8 months \nconducting market research before purchasing motorcycle helmets. To \naddress this problem, NIJ has established the technology information \nnetwork--a combination of a law enforcement internet and consumers \nreport--to afford police departments around the country access to \ntimely and objective information on new products, technologies, and \nsystems. Moreover, NIJ has held and participated in a series of \nsuccessful conferences and town meetings to initiate dialog between law \nenforcement, the Federal technology community, and the private sector, \nand is establishing purchasing consortiums to allow local police \ndepartments to obtain the best prices for technical products and \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, because the overwhelming majority of police work in \nAmerica is conducted by State and local law enforcement, and only 13 \npercent of the crime fighting resources are controlled by the Federal \nGovernment, the answer to violence lies closer to home than to \nWashington, DC. With the establishment last year of NIJ's National Law \nEnforcement Technology Center, the agency has become the model for the \ndecentralized relationship that exists between the Federal Government \nand State and local law enforcement.\n  The National Law Enforcement Technology Center consists of seven \nregional research centers throughout the country. This virtual national \ncenter serves as a focal point for law enforcement research and \ndevelopment and information dissemination. The regional centers are \ncenters of excellence for respective technologies and act as regional \ninterfaces for State and local law enforcement agencies. This \ndecentralized structure brings NIJ's work into the field, thereby \nfostering a closer working relationship with State and local law \nenforcement. For example, the agency has established test bed programs \nto field test new equipment in local police departments.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today seeks an \nappropriation of an increase of $10 million each for fiscal year 1996 \nand fiscal year 1997 to enable NIJ to continue and expand the critical \nwork that it is doing to assist State and local police departments. The \nlegislation specifically authorizes funding to\n provide NIJ with the resources that it needs to identify, develop, and \npurchase new technologies to provide a safer environment for police \nofficers and more effectively curb crime.\n\n  Mr. President, I have advocated a tough, comprehensive, approach to \nbattling the menace of crime that has proliferated in our cities and \ntowns. In authoring the Handgun Control and Violence Prevention Act, I \nhave worked for a commonsense approach to stem the flow of illegal \nweapons that flood our streets and cause mass carnage. In proposing the \nCop Killer Bullet Ban Act. I have sought to halt the manufacture and \ndistribution of ammunition that is designed to kill those who are sworn \nto protect our communities.\n  Mr. President, my approach to combating crime has also been a \ncommunity-oriented approach, whereby the Federal Government and local \ncommunities act in tandem to uproot and eliminate the problem. Last \nyear, this body passed the omnibus crime law, which included the \ncommunity policing initiative, an $8.9 billion program designed to put \n100,000 law enforcement officers on the streets. I provided a jumpstart \nfor the community policing initiative in the omnibus crime legislation \nwhen I introduced a bill in March 1993 that authorized a major new \nexpansion of community policing. In addition, I authored the community \nschools provision in the omnibus crime law, which provides for public \nschool buildings to remain open for youth programs after school hours, \non weekends, and over summers. Moreover, this year, I have introduced \nlegislation providing for community response teams, composed of \ncommunity volunteers, to assist victims of domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, the work that NIJ is performing to enable police \ndepartments to more efficiently battle crime is consistent with my \nphilosophy that together the Federal Government and local communities \ncan share resources and crime fighting expertise to make our \nneighborhoods safer. The work performed by NIJ is invaluable. For \nexample, NIJ has expanded its work in developing standards for law \nenforcement equipment, which will eliminate the risk of officers \nreceiving substandard equipment. NIJ has also established a liability \npanel to assist law enforcement in using new technologies with a \nminimum of legal risk. The expansion of this work will only serve to \nstrengthen police departments around the country as we continue to \nfight against crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Institute of \n     Justice Technology Assistance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Section 202 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n     Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3722) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Technology Assistance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Director shall provide assistance to \n     State and local government law enforcement entities to \n     identify, \n\n[[Page S

Mr. President, on Tuesday, I introduced the Debt \nCollection Improvement Act of 1995, S. 1234, that would reduce the \nGovernment's budget deficit by billions of dollars by clamping down on \nthe huge amount of unpaid debts to the Federal Government.\n  The Government makes thousands of loans and guarantees thousands \nmore. Most citizens, businesses, and organizations pay those loans \nback. Some fall on difficult times and simply cannot pay. Some could \npay, but they do not do so for one reason or another. This is \nunacceptable. We must act to increase the Government's efforts at \ncollecting bad debts so that law-abiding taxpayers do not have to bear \nthis burden.\n  The United States has $67 billion in delinquent taxes and $49 billion \nin other types of delinquent receivables, most from loans and \nguaranteed loans. And, nontax debts have grown by nearly a quarter, $9 \nbillion, over the last 5 years. Generally, those in the debt collection \nfield assume that 90 percent pay in a timely manner. Seven percent pay \nlate. And 3 percent become seriously delinquent. This amendment does \nnot impact a person who is up to 90 days late in making payments. It is \naimed at the seriously delinquent.\n  We must become more systematic, diligent, and aggressive in seeking \npayment. Clearly, the worst way to solve an unpaid debt is to not push \nfor repayment of outstanding funds. Yet, the Federal Government is not \nnearly aggressive enough in going after unpaid debts.\n  In conjunction with the administration, Congressman Horn of \nCalifornia and Congresswoman Maloney of New York introduced similar \nlegislation last month. I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney for all \nher help in working with me on this important measure. She has years of \nleadership on improving Government collection of outstanding debts and \nhas conducted a significant study of the levels of delinquent debt \nearlier this year. My proposal is based on their measure, but I have \nmade a number of modifications to enhance the Government's ability to \nrecover outstanding payments. For example, this measure clarifies the \nFederal Government would collect debts owed to States where there was a \nFederal financial interest and it would help to collect delinquent \ncourt-ordered child support payments. Failure to pay child support \noften results in the custodial parent and the children unnecessarily \nfalling into the welfare system.\n  What does this bill require? The Department of the Treasury would act \nas a central collection agency for nontax debts as well as performing \ntheir current role regarding tax related debts. Other agencies would \nrefer debts over 90 days in arrears, with a few exceptions, to the \nTreasury Department. Exceptions include cases where an agency is \nalready in litigation for foreclosure on property, where the case has \nbeen recently turned over to a private collection agency within 90 days \nor when the loan is scheduled to be sold within 90 days. There is also \nan exception for specific loans or loan guarantees that may be \ncollected after the 90-day period under terms set out in specific \nstatutory authority. The original agency could continue its own efforts \nto collect the delinquent debts.\n  The Treasury could collect unpaid obligations by offsetting Federal \npayments going to the person or entity. In the case of government \nsalary or other non-means tested income checks, up to 15 percent could \nbe garnished. Veterans payments would be exempt and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury would be able to grant additional, but very limited, \nexceptions. The Treasury would also pursue a wide variety of \ntraditional efforts to collect debts:\n  Private attorneys and debt collection agencies could be hired to \nlocate hidden assets;\n  In order to avoid cumbersome legal statutes, the Federal Government \ncould use administrative rather than judicial foreclosure procedures, \nas private creditors can now do, to foreclose on property;\n  Persons in default would not be able to receive new loans or loan \nguarantees from the Federal Government with some exceptions; and,\n  Payments on Federal debts would be reported to credit bureaus so \nthose who pay and those who do not will get the credit rating that they \ndeserve. Where a debt could not be collected, the Treasury would notify \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Under current law, a bad debt which is \nwritten off is considered to be taxable income to the borrower. \nHopefully these provisions will be added incentive to not put the \nFederal Government to end of the list when payment checks are being \nmade out.\n  This proposal provides appropriate notice and preserves everyone's \ndue process rights. It simply says, if you owe, you should pay. \nTaxpayers shouldn't be left carrying the load of those who choose not \nto honor their obligations.\n  As we move to balance the budget, it would be unfair to increase \nMedicare costs or cut college loans while not doing what we can to \ncollect over $100 billion in unpaid debts.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this proposal. I think they will see \nit is a commonsense plan worthy of their support.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13624-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       SIERRA GRANDE HIGH SCHOOL\n Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe celebration yesterday of the 80th birthday of Andrew Heiskell, a \nphilanthropist of the first order, a friend to the arts and humanities, \nand an untiring champion of our democracy and its institutions.\n  He was born in Naples, and so, alas, could never become President. \nInstead, he attended the Harvard Graduate School of Business, worked at \nthe New York Herald Tribune, and in 1937 became science and medical \neditor for LIFE magazine. What follows is a career so brilliant and \naccomplishments so significant that among his contemporaries it has \nbecome legend.\n  Within three short years of his first assignment with LIFE, he became \ngeneral manager. In 1946, he was appointed publisher of that magazine, \nand in 1949 was elected a vice president of Time, Inc. In 1959, he \nbecame a member of the board of directors, and on August 21, 1969, he \nbecame chief executive officer of Time, Inc. In 1982 he was named \nPublisher of the Year by the Magazine Publishers Association, and in \n1986 he was inducted into the Publishing Hall of Fame.\n  Andrew Heiskell retired from publishing 15 years ago, and began, in \neffect, a second career of public service, accomplishing in a decade-\nand-a-half far more than most could hope to accomplish in a lifetime.\n  As chairman of the board of trustees of the New York Public Library \nhe oversaw a campaign to raise over $300 million. The campaign \nrededicated the library's resources not only to New Yorkers, but to the \nNation, and--via electronic means--to the world. As chairman of the \nboard of the Bryant Park Restoration Corp., he led the effort to \nredesign and restore that oasis in midtown Manhattan, and in so doing \nextended the humanist tradition of the public library adjacent to it. \nThere is no more civil space in New York City today. Heiskell made it \nso.\n  The list of his accomplishments continues. As founding chairman of \nthe President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, he established a \nnew tradition of public-private partnerships in support of the arts. As \npresident of the Harvard Corporation he presided over the \nsesquicentennial observances and a major fund raising drive. Earlier he \nhad been an indefatigable member of the advisory board of the Joint \nCenter for Urban Studies of M.I.T. and Harvard. And numerous other \nnonprofit organizations have benefited from his efforts, among them the \nGraduate Center for the City University of New York, the Vivian \nBeaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, the Enterprise Foundation, People \nfor the American Way, the Brookings Institution, the Trust for Cultural \nResources of the City of New York, and the Institute of International \nEducation. For the last 5 years Andrew Heiskell's efforts have been \nfocused on an extraordinary institution, the American Academy in Rome, \nwhich was recognized by Congress and the President in a joint \nresolution last year for its contributions to America's cultural and \nintellectual life on the occasion of its centennial. As chairman of the \nexecutive committee of the American Academy in Rome, Andrew Heiskell \nhas guided that institution and led a $20 million capital campaign to \nre-endow the academy and ensure that American artists and scholars of \nthe next century enjoy the same opportunity provided their \npredecessors: to be enriched by a cultural tradition measured in \nmillennia, and on their return to enrich the culture of our young \nRepublic.\n  Andrew Heiskell has proven himself a brilliant leader and a patient \nteacher of those who would follow in his footsteps. He is also a great \nfriend. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, we can be thankful that \nhe and Marian dedicated so much to the patient improvement of American \nlife.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13625-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         COMMENDING YOUNG-LINE ``DRUG FREE'' ASSOCIATIONS, INC.\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a day does not go by that there is \nnot a newspaper article or news story on the destructive effects drugs \nhave on our youth. Millions of dollars are spent each year on education \nand prevention programs. Despite this attention, we are having \nincremental success in discouraging our young people from choosing this \ninjurious lifestyle. It has been my observation that the most effective \nprograms are those at the local level. During my tenure as the mayor of \nTulsa, I strongly supported and worked with D.A.R.E. because I believe \nit was a program that produced tangible results.\n  Since my election to the Senate, I have been made aware of an \norganization in Oklahoma called Young-Line ``Drug Free'' Associations, \nInc. which focuses on teaching youth the dangers of drug and alcohol \nabuse. Chief Bonnie O. Ezechukwu, who heads the Young-Line \norganization, has been recognized throughout the State of Oklahoma for \nhis outstanding work. Originally from Nigeria, Chief Ezechukwu has \nlived in the United States for 13 years during which time he \nsteadfastly worked to teach respect for human life, importance of self-\nesteem and community involvement in the lives of young people.\n  I want to commend Chief Ezechukwu and Young-Line ``Drug Free'' \nAssociations, Inc. for helping young people combat potential drug and \nalcohol abuse by emphasizing prevention and at the same time aiding \nthem to become worthwhile members of society. Their prevention methods \ngo beyond teaching and focus on leadership and character development. \nTheir work in Oklahoma has made a difference.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/14/senate-section/article/S13625-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13625-S13626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      WALTER A. HAAS, JR., FAMILY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Walter A. \nHaas, Jr., family for its years of community service to the people of \nthe San Francisco Bay area. As owners of both the Oakland A's and Levi \nStrauss & Co., the Haas family has elevated community service to the \nhighest level.\n  The Haas family has been recognized over many years for the \nprogressive corporate philosophy of Levi Strauss & Co. Levi Strauss has \nbeen heralded in publications from the San Francisco Chronicle to \nFortune Magazine for its philanthropic work and community involvement. \nToday, I would like to recognize the Haas family for its dedication to \nthe bay area through its ownership of the Oakland A's.\n  On October 31, 1995, the Haas family will officially transfer \nownership of the Oakland A's, ending a 15-year stewardship of one of \nthe bay area's most beloved sports franchises. I join the A's in \nrecognizing the Haas family for their contribution to the team, major \nleague baseball, and the San Francisco Bay area.\n  In 1980, Mr. Haas and his son purchased the Oakland Athletics ball \nclub out of a sense of civic pride and duty. The previous owner had \nbecome convinced that the city of Oakland simply could not support a \nbaseball team. When Walter Haas was initially contacted by community \nleaders about buying the team, he was not enthusiastic. He and his \nfamily had no experience running a sports franchise.\n  But the Haas family's love of baseball and regard for the community \nprevailed. The Haas purchase of the Oakland A's began 15 years of care \nof a community baseball team that we rarely see in professional sports \ntoday. The Haas family philosophy emphasized civic pride--they believed \nthat the A's were entrusted to them by the community for the benefit of \nOakland A's fans, players, and bay area residents. The Haas family, in \ntheir love for baseball, dedicated themselves to the values of personal \nexcellence, development of talent, and, most of all, to the fun of the \ngame--all qualities that make baseball the quintessential American \nsport.\n  In so doing, the Haas' brought over 3 million fans a year to the \nOakland Coliseum and gave the bay area a resurgence of the former \npowerhouse team of the 1970's. The A's began their first season with \nthe Haas family winning 11 games in a row and went to the playoffs. \nThey were the American League champions 3 years in a row, from 1988 \nthrough 1990, and won the 1989 World Series in the bay area's own \nBattle of the Bay World Series, punctuated as we all remember by the \nLoma Prieta earthquake.\n  The Haas family has been recognized for bringing class and commitment \nto the Oakland A's team, as they have brought such dedication to all of \ntheir contributions to the San Francisco Bay area community. I am \nprivileged to \n\n[[Page S 13626]]\nstand in honor of the Walter A.
