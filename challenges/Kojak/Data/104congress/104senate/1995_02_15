Mr. President, I want to commend the House of \nRepresentatives for completing action on one of the key elements in the \nContract With America--the Taking Back Our Streets Act. As a result of \nyesterday's vote, we are now one step closer to enacting the kind of \ntough-on-crime legislation the American people deserve:\n  Mandatory restitution for the victims of Federal crimes.\n  The swift deportation of illegal aliens who have broken our criminal \nlaws.\n  More funds for prison construction so that Governors like George \nAllen can abolish parole and make truth in sentencing a reality in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  Comprehensive reform of the habeas corpus rules to prevent convicted \ncriminals from exploiting the system, with more frivolous appeals, more \nunnecessary delays, and yes, more grief for the victims of crime and \ntheir families.\n  Reform of the exclusionary rule to ensure that relevant evidence is \nnot tossed out at trial simply because a police officer made an honest \nmistake.\n  And, finally, a rewrite of last year's police-hiring program to give \nStates and localities more flexibility in determining what best suits \ntheir own unique law enforcement needs. Is it more cops? Or is it more \nsquad cars? Better technology? Training? Perhaps even computers?\n  Unfortunately, this last provision has raised President Clinton's \npolitical hackles. He is now out on the stump, threatening a veto, and \narguing that the law enforcement block grants will somehow jeopardize \nhis pledge to put 100,000 more cops on the street.\n  Of course, last year's crime bill was one of the\n   most politically oversold pieces of legislation in recent memory. As \nmost experts will tell you, the 1994 crime bill barely contains enough \nfunding to hire 25,000 more cops, never mind 100,000. So, President \nClinton's complaints may make for good rhetoric, but when all is said \nand done, rhetoric has never put a single cop on the beat.\n\n  The President's veto-threat also raises a more fundamental question: \nWho knows best how to fight crime? Is it Congress? The bureaucrats in \nWashington?\n  Or is it the people on the frontlines: the sheriffs, the mayors, the \ncounty commissioners, the Governors? Does President Clinton not trust \nour State and local officials to make the right decisions, to do the \nright thing, or does he think they cannot be trusted and that, if given \nthe flexibility, they will somehow squander the block-grant funds?\n  As the Washington Post editorialized yesterday, and I quote:\n\n       ``One hundred thousand cops'' sounds good, but \n     congressional failure to include that mandate is not worth a \n     Presidential veto ***. The world won't end if local \n     authorities are given more flexibility.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the House of Representatives for \ntoughening up last year's crime bill and giving the States and cities \nthe flexibility they need. It is now up to the Senate to finish the \njob, and I hope we can do that in the next 60 days.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, last month I spoke in this Chamber about the \nneed for a serious reexamination of United States policy toward Cuba. \nIn the weeks since quite the opposite has occurred. Instead, we seem to \nbe rushing toward an intensification of the current policy.\n  That policy, consisting of a rigidly enforced embargo and an aversion \nto any significant dialog with Cuba, has, as best I understand them, \nthree goals: to promote a peaceful transition to democracy; to support \neconomic liberalization; and to foster greater respect for human rights \nwhile controlling immigration from Cuba.\n  These three goals have guided our national policy toward Cuba for the \nmore than 30 years I have been in this body, Mr. President, yet there \nhas been scant progress toward achieving any of them. There is still a \ngovernment in Cuba which is not freely elected, which is only just \nbeginning tentative steps toward a market economy, and which continues \nto fall short of international standards in the area of respect for \nhuman rights.\n  Therefore, I can only conclude that this policy is not only outdated \nand ineffective, but, far worse, it is counterproductive. It seems to \nme that the time has come to admit the obvious. The policy is a failure \nand will never achieve its stated objectives.\n  [[Page S2679]] I believe that, rather than tightening the embargo and \nfurther isolating Cuba, the United States should expand contact with \nthe Cuban people and enter into negotiations on all issues of mutual \nconcern to our two countries, including the lifting of the economic \nembargo.\n  I say this not because of any regard for the Government in Havana, a \none-party state with a record of intolerance toward dissident voices \nwithin the society. Rather, I say this because, if our country and Cuba \nare to break the impasse that has existed in our relations for more \nthan three decades, someone must take the first step in that direction. \nI believe it is in the U.S. national interest to take that first step--\nto agree to sit down at a negotiating table, where all issues can be \ndiscussed.\n  In the meantime, there should be greater contact between our own \ncitizens and the Cuban people. Such contact will serve to plant the \nseeds of change and advance the cause of democracy on that island. Just \nas greater exchange with the West helped hasten the fall of communism \nin Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, so, too, it can achieve \nthe same results much closer to our shores.\n  Liberal Democrats are not alone in holding this view. Former \nPresident Richard Nixon wrote shortly before his death last year, ``we \nshould drop the economic embargo and open the way to trade, investment, \nand economic interaction.'' Learned people across the political \nspectrum have made similar comments and observations about the policy.\n  Why? Because they have all observed across the globe that policies \nwhich foster greater commerce\n and communication between countries work and those which engender \nisolation and enforced misery don't work. It has been impossible for \nthose who would seek to defend the status quo to cite an instance in \nmodern history where a policy of forced isolation has successfully \ntransformed a totalitarian state into a democracy.\n\n  United States travel restrictions to and from Cuba are among the most \nprohibitive in the world--this to an island that is only 90 miles from \nour shores. At this point, only United States Government officials and \njournalists have unrestricted access to Cuba and only a small \npercentage of Cubans who apply are allowed to travel to the United \nStates each year. Legislation recently introduced in the Senate would \nrestrict binational contacts even further.\n  Mr. President, do we as a nation not have enough faith in the power \nof our democratic system to let contact between our citizens and other \npeoples flourish? In my view, the strongest advocate for democracy and \na free-market economy would be a Cuban student or family member who had \nrecently visited the United States and seen the sharp contrast between \nour way of life and that in Cuba.\n  Current policy not only denies the United States the opportunity to \npromote positive change in Cuba, but it increases the likehihood of \nwidespread political violence and another mass exodus of refugees to \nFlorida. The Cuban Government, which is vigorously pursuing expanding \npolitical and economic ties with the rest of the world, is unlikely to \ngive into unilateral United States demands. Nor is there much \nindication that a viable opposition currently exists within Cuba to \nwrest power from existing authorities.\n  We have made it very easy for Cuban authorities to justify the lack \nof political freedom in Havana. They simply point to the external \nthreat posed by a hostile U.S. policy. That justification would lose \nall credibility were we to adopt a more reasoned U.S. policy. Cuban \nauthorities would then be hard pressed to justify the denial of \npolitical rights and economic opportunities that the Cuban people \nreadily observe elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, it will be an incredible legacy of whatever \nadministration succeeds in achieving what all the United States \nadministrations of the past 30 years have failed to do--to bring about \nthe peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. At last all the peoples \nof the hemisphere would truly be one family, united by common \nprinciples and values.\n  It will require political courage to abandon this antiquated and \nineffective policy. Old hatreds and vested interests have, heretofore, \nheld us captive. However, I believe the rewards of a new policy of \nengagement will be so great that embarking on it will outweigh the \npolitical risks.\n  Mr. President, I urge the administration to take the first step \ntoward a new and enlightened policy--a policy that can once again unite \nAmericans and Cubans. I extend my support and effort in that endeavor. \nI urge my colleagues to join me as well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2678-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2679-S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 248 for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 248.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 9 through 11, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     the later of the following:\n       ``(1) fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(2) the second fiscal year beginning after its \n     ratification; or\n       ``(3) the end of the first continuous seven-year period \n     starting after the adoption of the joint resolution of \n     Congress proposing this article during which period there is \n     not in effect any statute, rule, or other provision that \n     requires more than a majority of a quorum in either House of \n     Congress to approve either revenue increases or spending \n     cuts.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment \ncontemplates a 7-year period during which we would go from where we now \nare--that is, about a $200 billion annual deficit--to a zero deficit. \nThis chart makes the point very obviously that, from 1996 to the year \n2002, we need to make substantial progress in getting from where we are \nto that zero deficit.\n  My amendment tries to assure that during those 7 years--not after the \n7 years--but during those 7 years we can actually reach this goal of a \nbalanced budget. My amendment says that during those 7 years you cannot \nhave a requirement for a supermajority either to cut spending or to \nraise taxes in either House of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the balanced budget amendment before, and \nI can honestly say that the intent of the amendment's proponents in \nthose previous debates here on the Senate floor seems to me different \nfrom what is their apparent intent this time. In the previous \nCongresses the amendment was offered as a mechanism to help achieve \nresponsible fiscal policy. It was to be a prod to keep us focused on \ndeficit reduction; an assist to us in pursuing sound fiscal policy. \nSince I agreed that more discipline was needed, I was willing to \nsupport the amendment.\n  This time the amendment comes to us in a different context, supported \nby some different arguments. Now, the proponents do not just want \ndeficit reduction and sound fiscal policy. They also want that deficit \nreduction achieved in their preferred way and in a way which most \nheavily benefits those they desire to benefit. That is a new and a \ndisturbing aspect of this year's debate, Mr. President.\n  This year, the amendment comes from the House of Representatives \nafter the House has already amended its own rules to require a three-\nfifths supermajority for any increase in income tax rates. Other taxes \ncan still be raised with a simple majority. Of course, spending cuts \ncan still be accomplished with a simple majority, but \n[[Page S2680]] income tax rates cannot be raised without a three-fifths \nvote, according to the House rule.\n  Some argue that this is just a House rule and that we in the Senate \ndo not need to concern ourselves with it. But under the Constitution, \nall revenue measures must originate in the House, so if the House has a \nrule that biases deficit reduction against changes in the income tax, \nthat restricts the options available to the entire Congress, not just \nthe House.\n  Mr. President, this change of rules undermines genuine efforts at \ndeficit reduction, and it undermines our ability to achieve sound \nfiscal policy. The purpose of the House rule is to advance a \nconservative political agenda of less taxation for certain taxpayers \nwithout regard for and in spite of the consequences for the deficit.\n  The purposes of the rule are to protect individuals and corporations \nin the upper tax brackets and to accomplish any increase in revenue by \nraising regressive taxes that affect middle-income individuals and \nfamilies, taxes such as the gas tax, Social Security taxes, sales and \nexcise taxes.\n  Supermajority requirements like the House rule make deficit reduction \nover the next 7 years even more different than it already is. But more \nimportantly, they drastically alter the fundamental fairness of the way \nwe will allocate the pain of deficit reduction during those 7 years.\n  The supermajority requirement shifts the burden away from wealthy \nindividuals and corporations and onto the backs of low- and middle-\nincome working families. For under the House rule, it is the working \nfamilies of America, not the wealthy and the corporations, who will \nfeel the spending cuts. It is those working families who will pay the \ngas taxes and the social insurance taxes and the excise taxes which \nmust get us to a zero deficit.\n  Never before have the proponents of this balanced budget amendment \nargued that it is right for middle-income families to pay to balance \nthe budget but not right for the wealthy and the corporations to pay.\n  So my amendment restores the fundamental fairness of previous \nbalanced budget amendment discussions. It restores the ground rules to \nwhat they were during previous balanced budget amendment debates here \non the floor by establishing this 7-year period in which to get to a \nzero deficit without unfair supermajority requirements in either House \nwith regard either to particular spending cuts or particular tax \nincreases.\n  Now, looking at the second of these charts, it makes a very serious \npoint which I am sure everyone knows here in the Senate and perhaps \nneeds to be repeated. Deficit reduction is not rocket science. It is \nnot difficult to know what to do. It is difficult to have the courage \nto do it.\n  Deficit reduction can be accomplished in two ways. You can cut \nspending or you can increase revenue. Either one of those works. Both \nof them help get you to a zero deficit and a balanced budget. As the \nbottom part of the chart shows, my amendment merely says that during \nthe 7 years leading up to 2002 we cannot have supermajority votes \nrequired either for spending cuts or for revenue increases.\n  Our past experience and simple economic sense leads me to conclude \nthat if we are going to seriously approach accomplishing a balanced \nbudget, we will have to look at both spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to get from here to where we need to go.\n  If we look at history and look at what we have actually done in the \nlast 15 years by way of deficit reduction, we can see the point I am \ntrying to make. There have been five serious efforts at deficit \nreduction during the 1980's and the first half of the 1990's--under \nRepublican Presidents and under Democratic Presidents I point out.\n  In 1982, there was a significant deficit reduction effort. The total \ndeficit reduction there was $116 billion. That was, of course, under \nPresident Reagan. He signed that bill and approved it. Most of the \ndeficit reduction there was accomplished by revenue increases--not by \nspending cuts. People need to recognize that in each of the five cases \nhere we have had both revenue increases and spending cuts.\n  The second serious reduction was when President Reagan was in the \nWhite House in 1987, and again we had substantial revenue increases: \n$75 billion in revenue increases and $118 billion in spending cuts. So \nthere was clearly a combination of the two in that case.\n  In 1989, under President Bush, we had a deficit reduction effort \nwhich was about equally balanced between revenue increases and spending \ncuts.\n  In 1990, we had a very major deficit reduction package when President \nBush was in the White House. There was more in spending cuts, nearly \ntwice as much in spending cuts or a little over twice as much in \nspending cuts as there were in revenue increases. But still there was a \ncombination of the two.\n  Then 2 years ago, in 1993, of course, we had President Clinton's \ndeficit reduction package which involved both spending cuts and revenue \nincreases, totaling, according to the CBO, $433 billion as originally \nproposed. I think the estimates are that that has increased since.\n  I think it is interesting to note when we look at this history of how \nwe have actually tried to accomplish deficit reduction, in four of the \nfive deficit reduction efforts that were made in the 1980's and so far \nin the 1990's we did not have the three-fifths vote necessary in the \nHouse which would be required by this House rule. So these packages, \nfour of the five, could not have passed under the House rule as it now \nstands. Not only does history indicate that serious deficit reduction \nwill require both spending cuts and tax increases, but common sense \nindicates that it will as well.\n  Now, looking at the next chart, that chart shows the Federal budget \nand shows what is available when we start to cut spending. Many \nprevious speakers in the last couple of weeks have pointed to this \nchart or similar versions of this chart to make the very obvious point \nthat the majority of the Federal budget is so-called mandatory \nspending, spending not readily available for cuts. Clearly we can \nchange the eligibility requirements for Social Security or Medicare or \nMedicaid and get savings, but this is mandatory in the sense that it \nwill take a change in the substantive law that we have had on the books \nfor some time in order to bring that about.\n  Interest accounts for about 15 percent of the debt. There is no way \nto dodge that. We have to pay that each year. We cannot make up \nspending cuts there. Medicare and Medicaid is about 17 percent, and as \nfar as I know somebody is talking about cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. \nAll they are talking about is whether we will restrain the rate of \nincrease in those areas.\n  Social Security, we have had votes in the last 2 or 3 days where \neverybody has gone on record, both Democrat and Republican, as not \nwanting to see Social Security counted as part of the way we get to \ndeficit reduction to get to a balanced budget.\n  And other mandatory spending, other entitlement programs, makes up \nabout 10 percent. The areas that are discretionary are defense, which \nis about 18 percent of the Federal budget. The proposal I have heard \naround the Capitol in recent months is not to cut defense. It is added \nto what the President himself has proposed as increases in defense \nduring the next 5 years.\n  Of course, some people think we can balance the budget by cutting out \ninternational foreign aid. That is 1.4 percent of the Federal budget. I \nsuggest that if we eliminate it entirely, we still would have a long \nway to go to get to a balanced budget.\n  Domestic discretionary, 16.5 percent. That is where the cuts will \ncome. I think everybody knows that when we get around to cutting \nspending, the cuts are going to come in domestic discretionary \nspending. That is law enforcement funding, that is education funding, \nthat is public health funding, that is funding of a whole variety of \nthings which generally keep the Government running.\n  While virtually all experts agree that to get to a balanced budget, \nwe will have to both cut spending and raise revenue, the House of \nRepresentatives by rule has made it very difficult for us to raise that \nadditional revenue, at least to raise that additional revenue from the \nincome tax.\n  We are spending a great deal of time in the Congress this year, Mr. \nPresident, talking about the Contract With America. I read that \ncontract, and part \n[[Page S2681]] of it did contain a promise to the American people not \nto raise taxes. The contract does not just contain a promise not to \nraise taxes, it has a promise to require a supermajority to raise \ntaxes. The contract, in fact, proposed to include that supermajority \nrequirement for tax increases in the balanced budget amendment itself.\n  When the Speaker and the majority in the House finally started \nlooking at their votes, they decided they did not have the votes to \npass the balanced budget amendment in that form, but that they did have \nthe votes to put in place a rule which would have the same effect; that \nis, a rule which would say that you have to have not a majority but you \nhave to have three-fifths of the House voting for any kind of change in \nincome tax rates in order to increase those rates.\n  Not only has the Republican leadership in the House made good on \ntheir promise to require a supermajority to raise taxes and to put it \nin the rules, they have also committed to a major tax cut this year.\n  We had quite a debate yesterday about whether or not it was wise to \nproceed with a tax cut. I believe myself that the 1981 tax cut was not \nresponsible in light of the Federal deficit we faced then. It seems \nequally clear to me that this proposed tax cut, which is called for in \nthe Contract With America, is also not responsible.\n  Mr. President, I regret that President Clinton has chosen to advocate \ntax cuts at this particular time, although his proposal is much more \nreasonable in size and it is targeted toward families attempting to \nimprove their own education or their children's education.\n  This is the context in which we are considering a commitment to reach \na balanced budget amendment in the next 7 years. The results, in my \nview, are two:\n  First, the chances are overwhelming that if we keep this \nsupermajority requirement in the House rules, we will not reach the \ngoals set out in the amendment of a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  And second, that if we keep this supermajority requirement in the \nHouse rules, whatever steps we take to reach the goal are going to fall \nhardest on working families.\n  My amendment tries to ensure a good faith effort by all to reach the \ngoal of a balanced budget. It eliminates all the preconditions, it \neliminates all the artificial barriers. No group, and certainly not the \nwealthy, could assume that it would be spared from sharing in the pain \nof deficit reduction.\n  There would be no prohibition against cuts and particular types of \nspending; there would be no prohibition against increases and \nparticular types of taxes. The House rules requiring three-fifths to \nchange income tax rates would have to either be dropped or judged \ninvalid by the Supreme Court.\n  I point out to my colleagues that there is pending today in the court \na suit brought by the League of Women Voters and 15 House Members \nchallenging the constitutionality of the House rule.\n  Mr. President, this is essentially a back-to-reality amendment. It is \nalso a basic fairness amendment. I believe it is an important amendment \ndealing with this issue of a supermajority requirement, particularly as \nit has been manifested in this House rule.\n  Let me look at one final chart to make that last point about the \nimportance of the amendment. We have looked at where the spending \noccurs in Government. Let us look at where the revenue comes from to \nsee what we are taking off the table by adopting that House rule.\n  The income tax, of course, is our most progressive tax. Here you can \nsee the individual taxes account for 43 percent of the revenue that the \nGovernment receives each year, and corporate taxes account for an \nadditional 11 percent. So you add those two together and you have 54 \npercent of the revenue that comes to the Federal Government by way of \ntaxes.\n  We are saying if you want to change the amount of revenue you receive \nfrom those taxes, if you want to get anymore revenue from those taxes, \nyou have to have three-fifths under the House rule.\n  That is a major amount. That is a major source of revenue to be \nbuilding a supermajority requirement around. When you look at where \nelse can we raise revenue, if we are not able to get the three-fifths \nnecessary there, as we have not been able to get the three-fifths \nnecessary in four of the last five major deficit reduction efforts in \nthe Congress, where else can you get those?\n  Social Security taxes, 37 percent; 37 percent of the total revenue \ncoming into the Federal Government comes from Social Security taxes. So \nyou can raise Social Security taxes. Excise taxes, 4 percent, and other \ntaxes, 5 percent. That is things like the gasoline tax and other \nmatters. I point out that the Social Security tax, excise tax, and \ngasoline taxes are regressive. That means that they fall most heavily \non low- and moderate-income individuals. The income tax is the \nprogressive tax. It is the tax that has higher rates that you are \nrequired to pay as your income goes up. So when you say you will not \nchange the income tax, you are clearly looking out for those people \nwith the high incomes.\n  When we say a supermajority is required to raise rates in that tax \nbut not in others, we are protecting those who are relatively \ndisadvantaged by the progressive rate structure of the income tax, and \nthose are clearly the wealthy in our society.\n  The people most affected by taxes, other than the income tax, are not \nprotected. Those are the working families, poor families, the elderly. \nThose other taxes are still available as sources of income. The \ngasoline tax is there, available, excise taxes. Some of my colleagues \nhave an interest in beer and wine and tobacco taxes and other excise \ntaxes as well. The main other source of income for the Federal \nGovernment is the Social Security tax. That accounts for 37 percent of \nall the revenue we receive.\n  In addition to these sources of revenue to get from here to a \nbalanced budget, we also, of course, have areas of spending that can be \ntargeted for reduction. And the area of spending which we all know is \nmost likely to be cut is domestic discretionary spending. That category \nincludes programs that primarily go to benefit the average working \npeople in the country--education grants, loans, health care, health \nclinics in our rural areas, nutrition, school lunch programs, law \nenforcement, funds needed to make good on the promises that were in \nlast year's crime bill.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, this amendment that I am offering today \nlets us go into this 7-year period with ground rules that do not make \nit virtually impossible to get from here to a balanced budget.\n  They also let us go into this 7-year period with ground rules that do \nnot require most of the pain--that is, a disproportionate amount of the \npain--of deficit reduction to be borne by working families.\n  In my view, this is a good amendment. I urge all Senators who are \nseriously committed to deficit reduction and to fairness in the way \nthat we achieve that deficit reduction to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are now in our 17th day under our balanced budget \namendment debt tracker of the increase in the debt as we debate. While \nwe are debating this--this is our 17th day of debate, or 17th day since \nwe started this debate--we can see in this far chart the red line at \nthe bottom is the $4.8 trillion debt that we started with at the \nbeginning of this year. The green lines show how it is going up every \nday $829 million of additional debt on the backs of our children and \nour grandchildren. Today, the 17th day, we are now up to, as you can \neasily see here, $14,100,480,000--in additional debt just while we \ndebate this.\n  The reason we are doing this is so the American people can understand \nthat this is serious business. For 17 days this has been delayed, a \nfull 3 weeks of Senate floor time, 3 weeks on something that a vast \nmajority of Senators are for, and we believe 67 of us will vote for it \nin the end because it is the only chance we have to get spending under \ncontrol, the only chance we have. It is the first time in history that \nthe House of Representatives has passed a balanced budget amendment.\n  [[Page S2682]] Now they have sent it to us. It is the amendment we \nhave been working on now for my whole 19 years in the Senate, and I \nhave to say it is a bipartisan consensus, Democrat-Republican \namendment. It is not perfect, but it is the best we can do, and it is \nmuch better than anything I have seen in all the time we have debated \nit. It will put a mechanism in the Constitution that will help us in \nthe Congress to do that which we should have been doing all these years \nanyway, and that is to live within our means.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is very sincere. He does \nnot like the three-fifths vote over in the House that they have on a \nstatutory basis. It can be changed anytime by a mere 51 percent vote. \nWhen they get a majority over there that can do it, they will change \nit. But that has nothing to do, in my opinion, with whether or not we \nshould pass the balanced budget amendment in the Senate.\n  I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico. The Bingaman amendment, while seemingly aimed at supermajority \nvoting requirements to raise revenues or cut spending, would in fact \nkill the balanced budget amendment, not merely delay its \nimplementation. As I will explain in a few moments, the Bingaman \namendment, if adopted, would render the balanced budget amendment \ninherently contradictory and never, ever capable of going into effect.\n  The Bingaman amendment would ostensibly delay the effective date of \nthe balanced budget amendment until the end of the 7-year period after \nCongress adopts it, ``during which period there is not in effect any \nstatute, rule or other provision that requires more than a majority of \na quorum in either House of Congress to approve either revenue \nincreases or spending cuts.''\n  Now, it may seem that this amendment is aimed at the other body's \nrecent rule that Federal income tax increases are effective only if \nthey receive a three-fifths vote, but it hits the balanced budget \namendment right in the heart. And this is not an errant, leftover arrow \nfrom Cupid's quiver. This is a poisoned dart.\n  Section 4 of House Joint Resolution 1 states that ``no bill to \nincrease revenue shall become law unless approved by a majority of the \nwhole number of each House by a rollcall vote.'' That means at least 51 \nSenators and 218 Members of the House of Representatives must be \nrecorded in favor of any revenue increase. In other words, it is a \nconstitutional majority that our amendment requires.\n  If we adopt the Bingaman amendment into House Joint Resolution 1, \nhowever, then House Joint Resolution 1 can never, ever go into effect. \nThe Bingaman proposal says that House Joint Resolution 1 cannot go into \neffect so long as a provision such as section 4 is law. After all, the \nBingaman proposal says that a majority of a quorum can raise taxes. \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 says that only a majority of the whole number \nof both Houses can raise taxes. You cannot put the two provisions in \nthe same constitutional amendment, at least not if you are really \ntrying to enact that constitutional amendment into law.\n  So the Bingaman amendment is about much more than raising the \nsupermajority requirement for revenue increases or spending cuts. It is \nabout killing the balanced budget amendment by making it incapable of \never going into effect.\n  I might point out that had this section 4 provision been in effect in \n1993, then President Clinton's huge tax increase in 1993 would not have \nbecome law. That tax increase only garnered 50 votes in the Senate and \nneeded Vice President Gore's tie breaker in order to be sent to the \nPresident. But while the Vice President is President of the Senate, he \nis not a Member of the Senate. Accordingly, the 1993 tax increase would \nhave been killed by the 50-50 vote of the Senators under the pending \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  There are other serious problems with the Bingaman amendment. If \nCongress wants to adopt supermajority requirements for raising taxes \nand does so in a constitutional manner, I think that it will be \nperfectly appropriate protection for the taxpayers. I wish we could get \nthe votes to pass the balanced budget amendment with such a \nrequirement, but we cannot. I certainly do not believe that we should, \nin our fundamental charter, put in a provision that explicitly says as \nfew as 26 Senators out of 100 can raise taxes. I think it is a terrible \nidea to write that explicitly into the Constitution. As I say, we \nshould put into our Constitution stronger protections against tax \nraises.\n  While section 4 is not as strong as some would prefer it, certainly \nin the House, it is better than the status quo. The Bingaman amendment, \nin contrast, would make the status quo an explicit part of our \nConstitution.\n  Now, my colleagues should bear in mind that a vote for the Bingaman \namendment is a vote in favor of stating right in the Constitution \nitself that as few as 26 Senators can pass tax raises. Statutory or \ninternal congressional rules seeking to impose a higher hurdle for tax \nincreases would be, on their face, invalid. Today at least we have a \nfighting chance to have such statutory or internal congressional rules \nimposing higher voting requirements for tax increases upheld.\n  Moreover, if Congress adopts House Joint Resolution 1 and sends it to \nthe States with the Bingaman language, even aside from the fatal flaw \nthat I mentioned earlier, take a look at the hurdles House Joint \nResolution 1 would have to go through, even within the terms of the \nBingaman amendment itself. If the other body does not repeal its three-\nfifths rule on tax increases, its statutory rule, for, say, 2 years, \nthen House Joint Resolution 1 would have to wait 7 more years after \nsuch repeal before it can be effective under the Bingaman language. \nThat puts us into the year 2004. We cannot wait that long for the \ndiscipline of the balanced budget amendment to go into effect.\n  President Clinton's proposed budgets would add another $400 billion \nto the national debt in those 2 years alone, even under optimistic \nassumptions, and $1.8 trillion over that period to the year 2004.\n  If my friend from New Mexico does not like the other body's rules on \ntax increases, I say with all respect that concern should not be \naddressed by tampering with the effective date of this badly needed \nconstitutional mandate to balance the budget.\n  Frankly, America cannot wait any longer than the balanced budget \namendment already provides for the Congress to be placed under such a \nmandate. I certainly believe the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nis sincere, but I think these arguments against it are overwhelming, \nand I hope our fellow Senators will vote down the Bingaman amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond to some of the \npoints my friend and colleague from Utah has made.\n  He suggests that the amendment I am offering would make the balanced \nbudget amendment internally contradictory, because of section 4, as I \nunderstand his argument. I do not see it that way, and let me explain \nmy view of it.\n  As I understand the procedure that the balanced budget amendment \ncontemplates, there is a 7-year period during which we try to get to a \nbalanced budget. Section 8 says, ``This article shall take effect \nbeginning with fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year \nbeginning after its ratification, whichever is later.'' So there is a \n7-year period from where we are to the balanced budget. Then the \nbalanced budget amendment, including section 4, takes effect.\n  He is correct, section 4 says, ``No bill to increase revenue shall \nbecome law unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \nHouse by a rollcall vote.'' My amendment does not affect that. What my \namendment says is during the first 7 years, during the time we are \ntrying to get to the balanced budget, we should not have supermajority \nrequirements. Once we have a balanced budget, section 4 says you have \nto have a majority of the whole number of each House to raise revenue, \nand I am not challenging that. My amendment does not challenge that. I \ndo not know that it is great policy but my amendment does not challenge \nthat.\n  So I do not see anything inconsistent between my amendment, which \ndeals with the first 7 years, from now until \n[[Page S2683]] the time we get to a balanced budget, and section 4, \nwhich deals with the time from the effective date of the balanced \nbudget amendment, 7 years down the road, from then on in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  So I do not see there is any inconsistency. If I am missing something \nin the argument I would be anxious to hear the response of the Senator \nfrom Utah on that. But I do not believe I am missing anything. I \nbelieve my amendment would improve the balanced budget amendment as it \nnow stands before the Senate and would not build in any internal \ncontradiction into it.\n  The second point he makes is that if we were to invalidate the House \nrule, we would in fact be allowing as few as 26 Senators--we could be \nputting in the Constitution a provision which says that as few as 26 \nSenators can raise taxes. I would just point out that is what the \nConstitution provides. That is what the Constitution has provided for \n206 years, that as few as 26, a majority of a quorum, is all that is \nrequired by both Houses to either raise taxes or cut spending. That is \nnot changed.\n  I do not see anything terrible about us putting a sentence in saying \nthat is what the Constitution provides because that is what the \nConstitution provides. That is what it has always provided.\n  This is not just a casual result. There was a great debate at the \ntime the Constitution was being written about whether a supermajority \nshould be required. In fact, one of the most famous of the Federalist \nPapers, No. 58, written by James Madison, dealt with this specific \nsubject. I understand the Speaker of the House of Representatives has \nassigned this as one of the books he is requiring all House Members to \nread. So I am sure they are all familiar with this, but maybe some of \nmy colleagues here in the Senate are not. Let me just read a short \npassage from the Federalist No. 58. This is James Madison writing. He \nwrote:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum; and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision. That \n     some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution \n     cannot be denied. It might have been an additional shield to \n     some particular interests, and another obstacle generally to \n     hasty, impartial measures. But these considerations are \n     outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale. In \n     all cases where justice or the general good might require new \n     laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the \n     fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. \n     It would be no longer the majority that would rule: The power \n     would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  That is James Madison's explanation for why the drafters of the \nConstitution did not put in there a requirement for a supermajority. \nThey did not permit rules to exist such as the rule in the House. And \nwe need to clarify that rules such as the rule in the House would not \nbe permitted during this 7-year period while we get to a balanced \nbudget. So I think it is clear that the argument for maintaining the \nright of the majority to rule is a strong argument. It is not a new \nargument in our democratic system. It is a strong argument we should \nstick with.\n  The Senator from Utah made one final point. He said if my amendment \nwere adopted we could delay the time that we are required to have a \nbalanced budget by 2 years, or whatever period until the House decided \nto change its rule.\n  I would point out the House could meet this afternoon and change its \nrule. There is nothing in my amendment which in any way prevents the \nHouse from changing its rule or any court--and we do have a court case \npending on this--from determining that that rule is unconstitutional \nand invalid. As soon as that happens the 7 years begins to run.\n  So if the concern is we cannot get the 7 years running fast enough, I \nwould say there is a ready remedy for that, once my amendment is \nadopted, and that is a repeal of the rule.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the arguments of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico and I appreciate his sincerity. I \njust do not think it refutes what we said earlier.\n  Could I ask the remaining time? On both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes and it \nlooks like 52 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 17 minutes and \n22 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if \nthe Senator from New Mexico is.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have been advised by the Cloakroom \nthat there are certain Senators who expect to have this vote at 10:30. \nI do not need to keep all my time but perhaps we should check on that \nbefore I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we both yield back our time I will move to table, get \nthe yeas and nays, and then we will put it into a quorum call until \nthen?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me also check to see if Senator Bumpers is coming \nto the floor. Let me also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bumpers \nand Senator Dorgan as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nwe charge it equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains for the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not believe I shall use the entire \ntime. I want to stand in support of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] this morning.\n  I find it interesting that those who most loudly profess to want a \nbalanced budget find ways to try to provide handcuffs on those who \nultimately want to achieve a balanced budget. I do not remember who it \nwas who said it, but someone once said, ``The louder they boast of \ntheir honor, the faster I count my spoons.'' I sort of sense that is \nthe situation here.\n  We have a lot of people who say, ``Gee, we want to get to a balanced \nbudget.'' Then they put into law these notions about supermajorities in \norder to do one thing or another. The other body now has a \nsupermajority on raising revenue. What if you have a circumstance where \nthe revenue system is out of kilter and you have one group of people, \nlet us say wealthiest group, that are substantially underpaying what \nthey ought to pay and we feel the need to raise rates on that group, \nand maybe use the money to provide partial benefits to somebody else \nwho is overpaying. You would not be able to do that because it would \ntake a supermajority. That does not make any sense.\n  Why do we prejudge the answer on any taxing or spending issue to \nreach a balanced budget amendment? Some say we do not want anybody to \nincrease taxes. I do not, either. In fact, sign me up for a zero tax \nrate for my constituents. That is what I want. No taxes. But the fact \nis, we have roads, we have schools, we have law enforcement, and we \nhave defense to pay for, the defense of this country. So we have to pay \nfor the things that we spend in the public sector.\n  The question is, Who pays? How do they pay? We can construct a tax \nsystem to do that. Nobody likes it, but it is necessary. It is part of \nour life in this country. We spend money. We raise taxes. Should we cut \nspending? Yes. We should, and we will. Should we raise taxes? Probably \nnot. But is it necessary in some instances probably to do that? We \nfound in 1993 that we had to raise some taxes. I voted for it. I did \nnot like it. The medicine does not taste good, but I was willing to do \nit because I felt it contributed to reducing the Federal deficit.\n  But to allow either body of Congress to prejudge what is necessary to \nachieve a balanced budget is wrong. Senator Bingaman is saying during \nthe 7-year period, you cannot do that. You cannot create \nsupermajorities to try to prejudge those kinds of choices that we \n[[Page S2684]] must take in both the House and the Senate to try to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  I do not ever question motives with respect to Members of Congress. I \nthink some feel very strongly that we ought to have this balanced \nbudget amendment. Others feel equally strongly that we should not. All \nthe Senator from New Mexico is saying is that if you feel strongly that \nwe ought to have a balanced budget amendment or a balanced budget, \neither through an amendment or without an amendment, then you ought not \nput handcuffs on either the revenue or the spending side so that in the \nnext 7 years, freethinking people of good will serving in the House and \nthe Senate can decide on a range of items, on a menu of issues, on how \nto achieve that goal. It is much more important to achieve the goal of \ngetting our fiscal house in order than it is to preach ideology about \ntaxes.\n  The goal is important. Those who crow on the floor of the Senate and \nthe House about the balanced budget amendment are the ones who now say \nto us, yes, we want a balanced budget but we also want to straitjacket \npeople by creating goofy rules. And the Senator from New Mexico says \nlet us all be honest about these things. Let us decide if we are going \nto do this. We will do it the right way.\n  I am happy to cosponsor this. I am pleased to speak for it. I hope \nthat my colleagues who believe that we should balance the budget in \nthis country, who agree with me that we ought to balance the budget to \nget our fiscal house in order, will understand that this is a necessary \ningredient in doing so.\n  I compliment the Senator from New Mexico for offering it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise in support of what I believe is a \nvery well-crafted and thoughtful amendment by the Senator from New \nMexico. If this is going to be a permanent arrangement, then the House \ncould legitimately say you have no business interfering with House \nrules. After all, we hate your 67-vote filibuster rule.\n But that is not what this amendment says. People should not confuse it \nwith any Senate rules. This amendment is crafted to help the people who \nreally believe in this amendment, and especially the people who have \nsigned on to the Contract With America and promised the American people \nthat they will balance the budget by the year 2002. In my opinion, a \nHouse rule that requires a 60-percent majority to raise only one kind \nof tax does not keep you from raising the gasoline tax, does not keep \nyou from raising user fees, excise taxes, does not keep you from \nraising Social Security taxes. What the House has done is say that for \nnow and ever you cannot raise taxes--income taxes only--without a 60-\nvote majority. The Senator from New Mexico is simply saying that this \ncannot go until the House backs off of that for this 7-year period.\n\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if \nthis passes or if this does not pass, I will continue to cooperate with \nevery soul in this body who is genuinely concerned about deficit \nspending and trying to balance the budget. I will help you cut \nspending. I might even help raise taxes if they are properly targeted. \nI will do anything to keep from ending my career in the Senate without \nhaving addressed this most crucial problem facing this Nation. But you \ncannot--the Republicans voted yesterday, and a few Democrats, who said \nyou cannot take Social Security off the table. It has to be a part of \nthis whole plan to balance the budget. Yet, the House says income taxes \nare off the table.\n  What kind of logic is that, to say that the most regressive taxes, \nsales taxes--and we may go with a value added tax here, we may raise \ngasoline taxes, excise taxes, user fees and, yes, even the FICA tax \nthat pays for Social Security. But if you say income taxes are off the \ntable, you are saying the only progressive tax that the Congress might \nwant to use to balance the budget is off the table. Only the regressive \ntaxes that fall heaviest on the people who can least afford it, that is \nwhere you must find it.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to be preaching about this, but that is \nnonsense and it is not fair. It is not fair to the elderly. It is not \nfair to the working people of this country. The people who applaud this \nare the wealthiest people in America, because they pay an inordinately \nsmall part of their incomes for these regressive taxes like gasoline \ntaxes and so on. There are people in my hometown of Charleston, AR, who \ncommute 50 miles to Fort Smith to work. We are sort of a suburb to Fort \nSmith, and most people work in Fort Smith. They drive their cars as \nmuch as I do every year and pay the same tax on that gasoline that I \npay. And I make $133,000 or $135,000 a year--I forget which--and they \nare working for $25,000 a year or less, and we are saying that is just \nJakey, and we may raise taxes on you some more, but we will not raise \nthe taxes on the wealthiest people in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute from the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield an additional minute to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My administrative assistant and I were having a \ndiscussion on the way to work this morning, not just about this \namendment but about the Senate. I said, ``You know, I feel so strongly \nabout the balanced budget amendment and I am so adamantly opposed to it \nbecause I think it guarantees utter chaos.'' It is going to, at some \npoint, absolutely render the U.S. Congress a eunuch. We are not going \nto be able to deal with it under that amendment. I said, ``I do not \nlike to speak unless I feel strongly about something.'' I have a \ntendency to speak on maybe too many amendments. You can wear your \nwelcome out around here by talking too much. So I try to choose \ncarefully. It is very difficult for me because I detest this amendment \nso much. It is difficult to be as choosy about what I talk about. But I \nwant you to know that the Senator from New Mexico is on to something \nvery, very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just say to my colleagues that I have \nnot seen the debate change a vote since the third battle of Manassas in \n1988. People walk on the floor, and they may listen to it in their \noffices, but most do not even do that. So the debate does not change \nit. I daresay that when people walk in here on both sides, they are \ngoing to say, ``What is our vote?'' without realizing the deadly \nconsequences of what the House has done.\n  Senator Bingaman and I and Senator Dorgan, want to help Republicans \nkeep their commitment to balance the budget by the year 2002. I think \nit is utterly and wholly implausible and impossible. But I promise my \ncooperation in helping in any way I can. But to say the one thing you \ncannot do is to raise taxes that are progressive, but you can raise all \nthe regressive taxes you want to to deal with this when we all know \nthat working people in this country are having a terrible struggle just \nkeeping their head above water.\n  So I applaud the Senator from New Mexico. I am pleased he asked me to \nspeak on this because I do feel strongly about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully before they vote on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Is there additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feingold, Senator \nBradley and myself, I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the \nBudget Committee with instructions to report back forthwith, House \nJoint Resolution 1 in status quo, and at the earliest date possible to \nissue a report. I send my motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 in status quo and at the earliest date \n     possible, to issue a report, the text of which shall be the \n     following:\n       The Committee finds that--\n       (1) Congress is considering a proposed amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States which will require a \n     balanced budget by the year 2002, or the second fiscal year \n     after its ratification, whichever is later;\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, using \n     current baselines, that between 1996 and 2002, Congress would \n     have to enact some combination of spending cuts and revenue \n     increases totalling more than $1 trillion to achieve a \n     balanced budget;\n       (3) some taxpayers now receive preferential tax treatment \n     and tax subsidies through such things as special industry-\n     specific exemptions, exclusions, deductions, credits, \n     allowances, deferrals or depreciations which are not \n     available to other taxpayers;\n       (4) some special industry-specific tax preferences do not \n     serve any compelling public purposes, but simply favor some \n     industries over others and serve to distort investment and \n     other economic decisionmaking;\n       (5) certain of these tax preferences, which serve no \n     compelling public purpose, are special exceptions to the \n     general rules of the tax law to which most Americans are \n     required to adhere;\n       (6) the costs of such tax preferences are borne in part by \n     middle-income taxpayers who pay at higher tax rates than they \n     would otherwise;\n       (7) special tax treatment and tax subsidies constitute a \n     form of tax expenditures which should be subjected to the \n     same level of scrutiny in deficit reduction efforts as that \n     applied to direct spending programs, and\n       (8) it is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     that tax expenditures, particularly industry-specific \n     preferential treatment, should be subjected to the same level \n     of scrutiny in the budget as direct spending programs.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to yield myself such time as I \nmay consume but before doing so, I would like to defer for a moment to \nthe Senator from Washington who I know has another engagement. The \nSenator wanted to speak, I think, in opposition to this amendment, but \nI would like to give him the opportunity to do so since he will not \nhave any time later on.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. First, Mr. President, I would like to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Minnesota for giving me the courtesy and \nreferring me this time. It is, of course, appropriate for the maker of \nthe motion to speak first. It is very nice of him to allow this.\n  It does, however, seem to me that this motion is very closely related \nto the debate that we have had earlier on the proposition that there \nshould be a condition which takes place before or during the time that \nthe constitutional amendment is submitted to the States relating to the \nmethods by which we are to meet the requirement of a balanced budget.\n  In this case, I gather, most of the motion refers to tax \nexpenditures.\n The bottom line, however, Mr. President, is that these motions and the \namendments which have been proposed heretofore have almost, without \nexception, come from those who oppose amending the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget, and they are designed to inhibit or to slow \n  down either its passage by this body or its ratification by the States.\nMost of those Members, I am certain, including the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, do speak of their devotion to fiscal \nresponsibility and to a balanced budget. It seems to me that under \nthose circumstances, the thrust, the duty to explain what they will do \nto deal with the terrible $200 billion-a-year budget deficits from now \nto eternity rests on them, those who feel that the status quo is \nperfectly all right; that we should not change the rules relating to \nbudget deficits; that the way we have dealt with them in the past is \nthe way we should deal with them in the future. It is they, Mr. \nPresident, who ought to explain to us precisely how it is that they \nwould change either our spending processes or our taxing programs to \nbring the deficit of the United States into balance.\n  Those of us who favor the passage of this constitutional amendment \nunadorned are those who feel that the system is broken, that the system \nis not working, that 25 consecutive years of mounting budget deficits \nand a $4 to $5 trillion debt require a drastic and a fundamental change \nin the way in which it would work and are doing so because we observe \nthe history of those 25 years. We have observed all of the unsuccessful \nattempts to reach a degree of fiscal sanity and fiscal responsibility, \nand we have observed that those alternate methods have not worked and \nthat it is unlikely that they will work in the future.\n  We propose a constitutional amendment because a constitutional \namendment will bring everyone into the fold. Presidents, liberal \nMembers, conservative Members, Democrats and Republicans will be forced \nby the constraints of the Constitution to deal with budget deficits in \nthe future in a way in which they have refused to deal with them in the \npast.\n  The latest example of this failure, of course, is the President's \nbudget itself, a budget which simply gives up on dealing with the \ndeficit, which calls for no significant reductions in the deficit, not \njust for the 5 years that it covers but for 10-year projections out \nfrom today. It is a confession of failure. But more than a confession \nof failure, it is a confession of failure coupled with the proposition \nthat there will be no attempt to cure that failure, to do better at any \ntime in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that the best thing, the desirable \nthing, for us to do in the Senate is to recognize that the system is \nbroken, that the system needs fixing, that the only fix that is likely \nto be successful is a constitutional amendment, that we should pass it \nand begin the process by which the States can consider its ratification \nas quickly as possible.\n  But in the alternative, it seems to me that it is up to those who \noppose this constitutional amendment to tell us how they are going to \ncure the problem operating under exactly the system which has created \nthe problem in the first place.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota very, very much for yielding to \nme. I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S2686]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Douglas \nJohnson and Mark Miller be given the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just to be very, very clear because I \nbelieve that all of us, Democrats and Republicans, should be clear \nabout what we are voting on, this amendment does not in any way, shape \nor form have any kind of conditions vis-a-vis the balanced budget \namendment. There is not any language in this amendment that so states.\n  What this amendment says is:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in enacting the policy \n     changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion in \n     deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     that tax expenditures, particularly industry-specific \n     preferential treatment, should be subject to the same level \n     of scrutiny in the budget as direct spending programs.\n\n  It just simply says that since we know we are going to be involved in \na serious effort on deficit reduction and since we know we all share \nthe common goal of balancing the budget, though we may not agree a \nconstitutional amendment is the way to do so, that we ought to make \nsure that tax expenditures, which Senator Feingold and I are going to \nexplain at some length during the course of this debate, be on the \ntable; that that be part of what we look at; that we look at certain \nbreaks, loopholes, and certain deductions. That is all. There is no \ncondition vis-a-vis the balanced budget amendment. The Senator from \nWashington is wrong on that point.\n  Second, I might add, that procedurally, this is really identical to \nthe motion of the majority leader dealing with Social Security. It is \nidentical, and I believe that motion was passed by over 80 Senators. So \nthis has nothing to do with your position on the balanced budget \namendment one way or the other.\n  Let me go on and explain.\n  Mr. President, this motion will put the Senate on record saying that \nin our effort to balance the budget, in our effort to go forward with \ndeficit reduction--whether it be by a balanced budget constitutional \namendment or otherwise; we are all aiming in the same direction--that \nwe will scrutinize all Federal spending not just, Mr. President, cuts \nof least resistance.\n  What I am worried about, speaking for myself, and I look forward to \nhearing the remarks of the Senator from Wisconsin, is that when it \ncomes to deficit reduction or when it comes to balancing the budget, \nwhat we will do is make cuts according to the path of least political \nresistance. That is to say, when it comes to ordinary citizens who do \nnot have the clout, who do not have the lobbyists, who do not make the \nlarge contributions, they will be called upon to sacrifice.\n  I think most people in the country are willing to sacrifice. We just \nwant to make sure that there is a standard of fairness and that large \ninterests, large corporations, financial interests, wealthy people, and \nothers who, as a matter of fact, benefit disproportionately by some of \nthe tax breaks which cause other people to pay more in taxes, also are \ncalled upon to pay their fair share or to sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, in all of the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nin all of the debate about how we are going to essentially have budget \ncuts of $1.4 trillion or thereabouts there is an enormous credibility \ngap. Because so far all I have heard on the Republican side is \nproposals for budget cuts of $277 billion. There is a big difference \nbetween $277 billion and $1.481 trillion.\n  In all of the debate so far, whether it be right to know vis-a-vis \nStates saying that the people back in our States ought to have a right \nto know what the impact would be on them or, for that matter, whether \nit is our right to know, I still believe that the most important \nprinciple of all is that Senators ought to have the right to know what \nthey are voting on, where the cuts will take place, and how they will \naffect the people.\n  There has not been a word uttered about one particular kind of \nspending that enjoys a special status within the Federal budget. I am \ntalking about tax breaks for special classes or categories of \ntaxpayers, many of whose benefits go largely to large corporations or \nthe other wealthy interests in our society.\n  I remind you, Mr. President, that when we have these tax breaks and \nwhen we have these deductions and loopholes and when certain citizens \nor certain large interests are forgiven from having to pay their fair \nshare, all of the rest of us end up paying more.\n  Let me make a simple point here that is often overlooked. We can \nspend money just as easily through the Tax Code through what are called \ntax expenditures as we can through the normal appropriations process. \nSpending is spending, whether it comes in the form of a government \ncheck or in the form of a tax break for some special purpose, like a \nsubsidy, a credit, a deduction, or accelerated depreciation for a type \nof investment that is made. These tax expenditures--in some cases they \nare tax loopholes--allow some taxpayers to escape paying their fair \nshare and thus they make everyone else pay at higher rates.\n  The Congressional Joint Tax Committee has estimated that these tax \nexpenditures cost the U.S. Treasury $420 billion every single year. \nThese loopholes, these deductions cause the U.S. Treasury to lose $420 \nbillion every single year, and this amount will grow on present course \nby $60 billion to over $485 billion by 1999.\n  Mr. President, these tax expenditures, often they are tax dodges, \nshould be on the table along with other spending as we look for places \nto cut the deficit. That is our point. That is, by any standard of \nfairness, what we should do. Just because certain people have a \ntremendous amount of political clout does not mean they should not be \nasked also to be a part of this sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, when we begin to weigh, for example, scaling back \nspecial treatment, depreciation allowance for the oil and gas \nindustry--and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \neliminating this tax break would generate $3.4 billion over the next 5 \nyears--when we start to compare and measure tax breaks for oil \ncompanies compared to cuts we are going to be making in food and \nnutrition programs for hungry children, we might have a very different \nanswer.\n  We have to make tough choices. And what Senator Feingold, myself, and \nSenator Bradley want to make sure of is that all of the options are on \nthe table, and that when we make these choices, and we do the painful \ndeficit reduction, we do it according to some basic standard of \nfairness.\n  What this motion does is simply state the sense of the Senate that we \nwill carefully examine tax expenditures when the Budget Committee makes \nrecommendations as to how we are going to continue on this path of \ndeficit reduction and how we are going to balance the budget. At the \nmoment, these tax expenditures are unexamined. They are hidden. They \nare untouchable. And, essentially, these are the real entitlements \nbecause we do not even examine any of these large subsidies.\n  What we are saying in this amendment is that we ought to at least \nexamine these tax expenditures, we ought to at least examine these \nsubsidies. This motion does not specify what specific subsidies might \nbe eliminated. It just says tax expenditures ought to be a part of our \nprocess here in the Congress as we make these decisions about where we \nare going to make the cuts.\n  As I have listened to this debate--and again I am struck by this \nfigure of $1.4 trillion worth of cuts that would have to be made by \n2002 to balance the budget--I must say that I have heard little \ndiscussion, first of all, about where we are going to make the cuts, \nand second of all, I have heard little discussion about any sacrifice \nfrom large corporations and special interests who have \ndisproportionately enjoyed all of these breaks, all of these benefits, \nall of these preferences, all of these deductions that many, many \nmiddle-class Americans do not enjoy.\n  And so that is why we offer this motion to refer this amendment to \nthe Budget Committee with instructions to report back a sense of the \nSenate that these breaks and preferences should be put that on the \ntable when we are talking about how we do our deficit reduction.\n  Now, Mr. President, not all of these tax expenditures are bad. Let me \nbe \n[[Page S2687]] clear. Not all of them should be eliminated. Some of \nthem serve a real public purpose, providing incentives to investment, \nbolstering the nonprofit sector, enabling people to purchase a home. \nThat is very important. However, some of them are simply tax dodges \nthat can no longer be justified, but we do not even examine them. What \nwe are saying in this amendment is, let us at least examine these tax \nexpenditures and especially let us get strict and rigorous when we are \nlooking at some of these tax dodges.\n  Mr. President, this motion simply states that if we are going to move \ntoward balancing the budget, tax expenditures that provide this \npreferential treatment to certain taxpayers should be subject to the \nsame scrutiny as all direct spending programs. That is all we are \nsaying. This is really a matter of accountability.\n  I think it is also, Mr. President, a simple question of fairness. If \nwe are going to make all of these cuts, then we should make sure that \nthe wealthy interests in our society, those who have the political \nclout, those who hire the lobbyists, those who make the large \ncontributions, those who we call the big players are also asked to \nsacrifice as much as regular middle-class folks in Minnesota and in \nWisconsin; they should be asked to sacrifice as much as anybody else, \nespecially when we know there are going to be deep and severe cuts in \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid, veterans programs, and education.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report last year. It is titled \n``Tax Policy--Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny.'' I commend it to \nmy colleagues' attention. I really think that my colleagues ought to \nread it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an executive summary of the report be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The GAO report of 1993 makes a compelling case for \nsubjecting these tax expenditures to greater congressional and \nadministration scrutiny just as direct spending is scrutinized. The GAO \nnotes that most of these tax expenditures currently in the Tax Code are \nnot subject to any annual reauthorization or any kind of periodic \nreview. And they observe that many of these special tax breaks were \nenacted in response to economic conditions that no longer exist. In \nfact, they found that of the 124 tax expenditures identified by the \ncommittee in 1993, half of these tax expenditures, half of these \nspecial breaks were enacted before 1950.\n  Now, that does not automatically call them into question, and our \namendment does not talk about any specific tax expenditure that should \nbe eliminated. But it does illustrate the problem of not annually \nreviewing these tax expenditures. These tax expenditures should not be \ntreated as entitlements. They should not go on year after year and \ndecade after decade without there being any careful examination. There \nhas been no systematic review of these expenditures.\n  Indeed, the GAO reports that most of the revenue losses through tax \nexpenditures come from provisions enacted during the years 1909 to \n1919. Let me repeat that. Most of the revenue lost from these tax \nbreaks--some of them necessary but many of them just blatant tax \ndodges--must be made up by either regular taxpayers through higher \ntaxes or revenue not there for deficit reduction, comes about from \nprovisions enacted during the years 1909 to 1919.\n  When I looked at the Republican Contract With America, I did not see \none single sentence, not one single word in this Contract With America \nthat called upon any large financial interest or any large corporation \nor, wealthy citizens, to be a part of this sacrifice. Let me just \nfinish up by listing a few provisions, to give a sense of where we \ncould have it. And, again, we call for no specific elimination of any \nspecific tax expenditure.\n  Mr. President, I think actually what I will do for the moment is \nyield myself the rest of the time I might need but defer to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for a moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        [From GAO Report 94-122]\n\n Tax Policy--Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny--Executive Summary\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       At a time when the federal government faces hard choices to \n     reduce the deficit and use available resources wisely, no \n     federal expenditure or subsidy, whether it involves outlays \n     (i.e., discretionary or direct spending) or tax revenues \n     forgone, should escape careful examination. Congressional and \n     executive branch processes do not subject existing tax \n     expenditures to the same controls that apply to programs \n     receiving appropriated funds.\n       Congressman William J. Coyne was concerned that a lack of \n     attention to income tax expenditures has allowed them to \n     increase and was interested in how they could be controlled. \n     GAO examined a wide range of alternatives for the review and \n     control of income tax expenditures. This report describes the \n     size of increases in tax expenditures; examines whether tax \n     expenditures need increased scrutiny; and identifies options \n     that could be used to increase the scrutiny of and/or control \n     the growth of tax expenditures, discussing the advantages and \n     disadvantages of each.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Tax expenditures are reductions in tax liabilities that \n     result from preferential provisions in the tax code, such as \n     exemptions and exclusions from taxation, deductions, credits, \n     deferrals, and preferential tax rates. Many tax expenditures \n     are subsidies to encourage certain behaviors, such as \n     charitable giving. A few tax expenditures exist, at least in \n     part, to adjust for differences in individuals' ability to \n     pay taxes, such as deductions for catastrophic medical \n     expenses. Some tax expenditures may also compensate for other \n     parts of the tax system. For example, some argue the special \n     tax treatment of capital gains may in part offset the \n     increased taxes on capital income that result from such gains \n     not being indexed for inflation. Congress sometimes reviews \n     tax expenditures and has limited some tax expenditures by \n     various means, such as by limiting the benefits as taxpayers' \n     incomes increase.\n       Although widely used to describe preferential provisions in \n     the tax code, the term tax ``expenditures'' is not \n     universally accepted. Some observers believe that labeling \n     these provisions tax ``expenditures'' implies that all forms \n     of income inherently belong to the government. However, the \n     concept was developed to show that certain tax provisions are \n     analogous to programs on the outlay side of the budget, and \n     it was intended to promote better informed decisions about \n     how to achieve federal\n      objectives. In using this term, GAO is recognizing that, as \n     a practical matter, tax expenditures are part of the \n     federal budget, and Congress already uses the tax \n     expenditure concept to a limited extent in budgetary \n     processes.\n       Currently, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Senate Committee on Finance have jurisdiction over both new \n     and existing tax expenditures. These Committees propose the \n     mix of tax rates and tax expenditures to be used to obtain a \n     specified amount of revenue. In reviewing tax expenditures, \n     these Committees have used several techniques to limit \n     individual tax expenditures or groups of them. These reviews, \n     however, are not conducted systematically and may not \n     explicitly consider possible trade-offs between tax \n     expenditures and federal outlay programs and mandates.\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       Tax expenditures can be a valid means for achieving certain \n     federal objectives. However, studies by GAO and others have \n     raised concerns about the effectiveness, efficiency, or \n     equity of some tax expenditures. Substantial revenues are \n     forgone through tax expenditures but they do not overtly \n     compete in the annual budget process, and most are not \n     subject to reauthorization. As a result, policymakers have \n     few opportunities to make explicit comparisons or trade-offs \n     between tax expenditures and federal spending programs. The \n     growing revenues forgone through tax expenditures reduce the \n     resources available to fund other programs or reduce the \n     deficit and force tax rates to be higher to obtain a given \n     amount of revenue.\n       The three options discussed in this report may help \n     increase attention paid to tax expenditures and reduce their \n     revenue losses where appropriate. First, greater scrutiny \n     could be achieved with little or no change in congressional \n     processes and jurisdictions by strengthening or extending \n     techniques currently used to control tax expenditures. \n     Ceilings and floors on eligibility, better highlighting of \n     information, or setting a schedule for periodic review of \n     some tax expenditures are some possibilities under this \n     option. If controlling tax expenditures through the current \n     framework is considered insufficient, Congress could change \n     its processes to exert more control over them.\n       The second option is for Congress to further integrate tax \n     expenditures into the budget process. One feasible approach \n     would be for Congress to decide whether savings in tax \n     expenditures are desirable and, if so, to set\n      in annual budget resolutions specific savings targets. \n     Savings could be enforced through existing reconciliation \n       processes.A third option is to integrate reviews of tax \n     expenditures with functionally related outlay programs, which \n     could make the government's overall funding effort more \n     efficient. Such integrated reviews could be done by the \n     executive or legislative branches, or both.\n       [[Page S2688]] Under the Government Performance and Results \n     Act of 1993 (GPRA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n     plans to report information on program goals and key \n     indicators for both outlays and tax expenditures. In January \n     1994, OMB designated 53 performance measurement pilot \n     projects to begin in 1994. Implementation of GPRA provides a \n     promising opportunity to increase the usefulness and \n     visibility of outcome-oriented performance data.\n\n\n                             GAO's Analysis\n\n       Tax expenditures can be a useful part of federal policy. \n     But in some cases tax expenditures may not be the most \n     effective, efficient, or equitable approach for providing \n     government subsidies. For example, it might be less expensive \n     for the federal government to provide assistance to state and \n     local governments through direct payments than through tax-\n     exempt bonds. Because tax expenditures represent a \n     significant part of the total federal effort to reallocate \n     resources, choosing the best methods for achieving \n     objectives, including the most effective tax expenditure \n     designs, could have significant results. (See pp. 23-32).\n\n    Tax expenditures have been growing but are difficult to measure\n\n       GAO primarily used Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) \n     estimates to analyze the size and growth of tax expenditures. \n     According to these data, tax expenditures totaled about $400 \n     billion in 1993. Their average annual percent increase in \n     real terms for the period from 1974 to 1993 was about 4 \n     percent, which compares to an average annual real increase \n     for gross domestic product of about 2.5 percent. Tax \n     expenditures are expected to continue growing; however, the \n     rate of growth is uncertain.\n       As experts note, tax expenditure revenue loss estimates are \n     not as informative as the revenue estimates made for proposed \n     changes to the tax code. Whereas revenue estimates \n     incorporate the changes in taxpayer behavior that are \n     anticipated to occur as a result of the change, tax \n     expenditure revenue loss estimates do not incorporate any \n     behavioral effects. Furthermore, summing tax expenditure \n     revenue losses ignores\n      interaction effects among tax code provisions. Because of \n     interactions with other parts of the tax code, the revenue \n     loss from the elimination of several tax expenditures \n     together may be greater or smaller than the sum of the \n     revenue losses for each tax expenditure measured alone. \n     Nevertheless, GAO believes tax expenditure revenue loss \n     totals represent a useful gauge of the general magnitude \n     of government subsidies carried out through the tax code.\n       When trends in these totals are looked at, however, care \n     must be taken to consider the possible underlying causes. \n     Aggregate tax expenditure magnitudes are affected by changes \n     in tax rates, in economic activity, and in the number of tax \n     preferences. An overall growth in aggregate tax expenditures \n     may be due to rapid growth of a few tax expenditures--and \n     some point to the rapid growth of health-related expenditures \n     as a current example. However, no process currently prompts \n     Congress to address these trends and decide whether they \n     warrant policymaking actions.\n       JCT and the Department of the Treasury devote limited \n     resources to estimating tax expenditure revenue losses \n     because decisions are not based routinely on this \n     information. GAO did not attempt to verify either JCT's or \n     Treasury's tax expenditure estimates. (See pp. 33-38.)\n\n      Processes do not highlight tax expenditures for policymakers\n\n       Despite their significance, existing tax expenditures do \n     not compete overtly in the annual budget process. Under \n     budget processes, new tax expenditures must be funded as they \n     are created. However, except for a few that are subject to \n     reauthorization, existing tax expenditures, like most \n     entitlement programs, can grow without congressional review. \n     These tax expenditures are indirectly controlled primarily to \n     the extent that revenue targets allocated to the tax \n     committees under the budget process create pressure to \n     decrease their growth. Although tax expenditures are listed \n     separately in the president's budget each year, the lists are \n     not used for making tax expenditure allocations or for \n     comparisons with outlay programs. As a result, policymakers \n     have few opportunities to make explicit comparisons or trade-\n     offs between tax expenditures and federal spending programs. \n     (See pp. 30-32.)\n\n                      Options for greater scrutiny\n\n       Increased congressional review of or control over tax \n     expenditures could be achieved under three general options, \n     each consisting of several alternative approaches:\n       Option 1: This option involves methods currently within the \n     purview of congressional tax-writing committees. It includes \n     ``program'' reviews of individual tax expenditures that may \n     lead to the redesign or elimination of some that are deemed \n     inefficient or outmoded. Currently available control \n     techniques include placing ceilings or floors on eligibility \n     for tax expenditure benefits, structuring tax expenditures as \n     credits rather than exclusion or deductions, limiting the \n     value of itemized deductions to the lowest marginal tax rate, \n     and limiting the value of deductions and exclusions for high-\n     income taxpayers. To promote debate on tax expenditures, \n     additional information on them could also be highlighted \n     using current processes. For instance, they could be merged \n     into budget presentations with related outlay programs. The \n     methods currently used to review and control tax expenditures \n     also could be used in conjunction with the following two \n     options that would alter somewhat the existing congressional \n     procedures for overseeing tax expenditures. (See pp. 39-56.)\n       Option 2: This option involves further integrating tax \n     expenditures into budget rules. This could limit existing tax \n     expenditures and encourage closer reviews of performance. One \n     approach to further integration that GAO examined--placing an \n     aggregate cap on forgone revenue--probably would not work \n     because technical problems would be difficult to overcome. A \n     second approach--in the form of a tax expenditure savings \n     target--is feasible. Under this approach, in years that it \n     wishes, Congress could specify a fixed amount of reduction in \n     forgone revenue from tax expenditures in the budget \n     resolution, which would be enforced through existing \n     reconciliation processes. To promote greater public \n     accountability, Congress could be prompted to explain in the \n     annual budget resolution the reasons for its decision to \n     either adopt or not adopt a savings target.\n       Definitional and measurement problems, which are \n     exacerbated by an aggregate cap, could be lessened \n     substantially under a savings target. Technical problems \n     would be reduced because--as is now the case in \n     reconciliation--revenue estimates are required only for the \n     subset of tax expenditure provisions under consideration. \n     However, requiring a specific amount of base broadening \n     through the budget process would involve more actors in tax \n     policymaking, especially with respect to expanding the \n     authority of the budget committees. (See pp. 57-70.)\n       Option 3: Joint reviews of federal spending programs and \n     related tax expenditures could be adopted to improve \n     coordination and reduce overlap or duplication among outlay \n     and tax expenditure programs. Joint reviews could be done in \n     both the legislative and executive branches. Joint\n      review of spending programs and related tax expenditures \n     could be accomplished by having program committees hold joint \n     hearings with tax committees. More formally, Congress could \n     adopt sequential jurisdiction for tax expenditure subsidy \n     ``programs'' or establish joint committees in functional \n     areas. Because fewer jurisdictional hurdles would arise, the \n     executive branch annual budget preparation process may offer \n     a more expeditious opportunity to implement such reviews. \n  (See pp. 71-92.)Recent legislation promises better tax expenditure \n                              information\n\n       According to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     report on GPRA, OMB is expected to describe a framework for \n     undertaking periodic analyses of the effects of tax \n     expenditures in achieving performance goals in a May 1, 1997, \n     report to the President and Congress. GPRA thus presents an \n     opportunity to develop better information about tax \n     expenditure performance and to use that information to \n     stimulate discussion and oversight as well as to make \n     determinations as to how the government can best achieve its \n     objectives, OMB indicates that initial discussions have been \n     held on developing output measures for key tax expenditures \n     and that reviews or related tax expenditures and outlays will \n     be done in the future. (See pp. 90-92.)\n\n\n               recommendation to congressional committees\n\n       GAO recommends that the tax-writing committees explore, \n     within the existing framework, opportunities to exercise more \n     scrutiny over indirect ``spending'' through tax expenditures.\n\n\n                matters for congressional consideration\n\n       Should Congress wish to view tax expenditure efforts in a \n     broader context of the allocation of federal resources, it \n     could consider the options of further integrating them into \n     the budget process or instituting some form of integrated \n     functional reviews.\n\n\n                         agency recommendations\n\n       GAO makes several recommendations to the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget intended to encourage a more \n     informed debate about tax expenditures among executive and \n     legislative policymakers and to stimulate joint review within \n     the executive branch of tax expenditures and related spending \n     programs. These recommendations should result in more \n     informed decisions, by Congress and by the public, about the \n     most appropriate means of achieving federal objectives. GAO \n     envisions that in carrying out these recommendations, OMB \n     would consult as appropriate with the Department of the \n     Treasury and other federal agencies.\n\n\n                            agency comments\n\n       In written comments on a draft of this report, OMB and \n     Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) expressed support for \n     expanded federal review of tax expenditures by the executive \n     branch or Congress. More specifically, OMB agreed, with \n     certain caveats, that GAO's recommendations to it were \n     reasonable and indicated that the recommendations were \n     consistent with efforts OMB has already begun. Regarding the \n     three options for improved oversight of tax expenditures, OMB \n     agreed that improved information on tax expenditures was \n     desirable and that integrated comparisons of outlay programs \n     and related tax expenditures may provide useful insights. In \n     its recently announced reorganization, OMB promised to \n     undertake joint reviews of related spending and tax \n     expenditure programs during upcoming budget cycles.\n       OMB and Treasury were concerned that the integration of tax \n     expenditures into the \n     [[Page S2689]] budget process might not produce better \n     outcomes than current processes. Treasury also expressed \n     reservations about whether joint reviews of related spending \n     and tax expenditure programs would provide the benefits \n     anticipated.\n       OMB and Treasury's comments are discussed at the end of \n     chapter 6. (See pp. 99-108.) OMB also suggested a number of \n     useful technical changes, which were included.\n       OMB also obtained reactions on its draft report from JCT, \n     the Congressional Budget Office, and two individuals \n     knowledgeable about the issues discussed in the report. These \n     organizations and individuals made observations on the report \n     message, which are discussed at the end of chapter 6, and \n     offered technical suggestions, which were included as \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my particular thanks to the senior \nSenator from Minnesota, who is doing a wonderful job of raising this \nissue of tax expenditures. I have enjoyed, both here in the U.S. Senate \nand especially back in the Wisconsin State Senate, just trying to point \nout when you spend money on a tax loophole and give people a special \ntax break, that is spending, too. It is taking the hard-earned tax \ndollar of the American people, putting it into a package and sending it \nout just to a few people. It is an awful lot like a spending program.\n  Our point here today is that often it does not get treated that way. \nIt gets treated like somehow it is just a tax break for everybody, \nwhich, of course, it is not. If we are going to solve the Federal \ndeficit and really have a balanced budget amendment, the Senator from \nMinnesota and I are saying this obviously has to be on the table. This \nhas to be considered, too.\n  So I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Minnesota in \noffering this motion which is designed to put the Senate on record, \ninsisting that when we get around to actually trying to balance the \nFederal budget we have to subject these tax expenditures--many of them \ninappropriate tax loopholes--to the same kind of scrutiny we will use \nto examine direct spending programs.\n  I feel I need to respond to the comments of the Senator from \nWashington, who spoke earlier today. He suggested all the Senator from \nMinnesota and I were doing was proposing an amendment designed to \ninhibit the balanced budget amendment itself. That is just not the \ncase. I think those watching, everybody involved in this, should know \nthat is really an unfortunate argument since the mechanism we are \nusing, a motion to refer, is the very same mechanism that the majority \nleader used to get himself on record on Social Security. It does not \ndelay the process at all. It just is a statement about the fact that \ncertain things ought to be considered when we balance the budget.\n  It strikes me as a little bit unfair to attack the motives of those \nbehind this amendment. There is no possibility that this will upend the \nbalanced budget amendment. Whether it has the votes or not, even though \nI like this amendment a lot I do not think the Senator from Minnesota \nor I have any belief at all this will stop the balanced budget \namendment. It is just another attempt to have some honesty and some \ncandor with the American people about what is going on here. And, in \nparticular, to identify where the money is, why we have such a huge \nFederal deficit. One of the big reasons is tax loopholes that have not \nbeen covered, that have not been fixed, and that cost us a fortune.\n  Mr. President, no one should mistake the difficult job that lies \nahead in seeking to achieve a balanced budget, with or without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has already told us, using current \nbaselines, that between 1996 and 2002, Congress will have to enact some \ncombination of spending cuts and revenue increases totaling more than \n$1 trillion to achieve a balanced budget.\n  There is strong sentiment, which I share, that we need to cut Federal \nspending, and that much of the deficit reduction achieved over the next \nseveral years will be as a result of cut backs in direct spending \nprograms.\n  That will happen. I am very enthusiastic about being part of that \nprocess, as I have been for the last 2 years--identifying specific \nprograms that do not make sense anymore and that can and should be \neliminated. That is very important to this process. But I also believe \nit is vitally important that in looking for ways to reduce the Federal \ndeficit and bring the Federal budget into balance that we subject tax \nexpenditures to the same kind of scrutiny applied to direct spending \nprograms. That sounds simple, but in the land of the lobbyist inside \nthe beltway of D.C., it is not so simple. Tax expenditures, tax \nloopholes get treated very differently. They are special. They are off \nthe table. They are protected.\n  Tax expenditures generally refer to preferential Tax Code provisions \nwhich give special treatment to specific industries or provide tax \nsubsidies to consumers of particular products.\n  Last year, the General Accounting Office issued a report, ``Tax \nPolicy: Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny,'' which focused upon \nthe need to subject tax expenditures to the same type of scrutiny \napplied to direct spending programs.\n  The GAO report noted that most tax expenditures are not subject to \nreauthorization or any type of systematic review.\n Once they are in, they are in. They have a life of their own. They \nhave immortality, in effect, in a way that spending programs do not. \nOnce enacted these provisions are enshrined in the Tax Code and they \n  are very, very difficult to dislodge.GAO noted many were originally \nenacted to address economic conditions that at the time were important. \nBut many of the economic conditions that these tax expenditures were \nmeant to address just do not exist anymore. But they keep on going, \nlike the Energizer tax expenditures--it does not matter. They can be \ncompletely irrelevant. Once they are in the Tax Code they are there and \nyou are paying for it. We are all paying for these in higher taxes--or, \nat this point, in higher deficits and higher payment on interest to pay \nfor those deficits.\n  For example, the GAO found of the 124 tax expenditures identified by \nthe Joint Tax Committee in 1993, about half were enacted before 1950 \nsomething that the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out very \npersuasively. A lot of these are real old. They were not just enacted \nin the last 2 or 3 years. For example some of the tax allowances \navailable to specific industries to recover certain costs of acquiring \nmineral deposits were enacted during World War I. Without an expiration \ndate there is just very little impetus and no real trigger to review \nwhether these provisions still make sense.\n  It reminds me a lot of some of the programs we have talked about and \nboth parties seem willing to eliminate, such as the helium program. I \nhave authored a bill to eliminate the old helium program that had to do \nwith providing helium for blimps. It is an old program from the earlier \npart of the century. The President said we should get rid of it. \nRepublicans in the other body say we should get rid of it. Those are \nheld up to scrutiny, those are held up to ridicule sometimes, as the \nwool and mohair program, the Tea Testing Board, the search for \nextraterrestrial intelligence--these get held up in the light of the \nday. Everybody laughs at them. They are prime time because they are \nspending programs. But if it is the same kind of thing for special \ninterests in the Tax Code nobody talks about them. It is a nice, quiet \nthing to sweep under the rug and make the American people pay a ton of \nmoney to keep these tax expenditures going. Let me give a couple of \nexamples.\n  Since 1943, the Tax Code has allowed U.S. civilian employees who work \nabroad certain special allowances for things like housing and \neducation, travel, and special cost-of-living allowances. As a result, \nemployees who receive a large part of their incomes through these \nallowances rather than through direct salaries receive preferential \ntreatment--a better deal than the rest of the American people.\n  I became aware of these special allowances when I was involved in \ntrying to accomplish another cut last session which we did achieve, a \nsubstantial spending cut in direct spending in overseas broadcasts. We \nfound out in the last Congress that to curb some of the excessive \nsalaries and allowances paid to employees of Radio Free Europe and \nRadio Liberty, to the Board of International Broadcasting, would \ninvolve dealing with one of these tax expenditures. As the Senator from \nMinnesota has said, some of these exemptions may be justifiable. \nHowever, I do know they can be abused and manipulated to \n[[Page S2690]] get around salary caps that Congress has put in place \nfor all the other Federal agencies. For these folks there is a special \ndeal. It gets no review.\n  Another example, Citizens for Tax Justice noted in a recent report \nthat interest income earned by foreign nationals on loans to American \ncompanies or the U.S. Government was exempted from the U.S. tax since \n1984. In other words each of us pays taxes on our interest income but a \nforeign national does not pay any U.S. tax on that income, according to \nthe Citizen's for Tax Justice. And this is again an unfair deal, in my \nview. When this exemption was passed a decade ago maybe there was some \njustification for it. But we ought to have some kind of review of this \ntype of tax preference to see if it is still appropriate. Has it had \nsome beneficial impact in terms of inducing foreign nationals to make \nloans to U.S. entities? Maybe so. Or is it just a windfall that is \nstuck in the Tax Code and that we cannot get rid of? We need to ask \nwhether in today's international climate our foreign investment \ndecisions are made more on projections regarding political and economic \nstability or on these kind of breaks.\n  A third example, and the Senator from Minnesota alluded to this.\n  Since 1916, the gas and oil industry has had special expensing rules \nfor exploration and development costs.\n  A compendium of background material on individual tax expenditure \nprovisions that was compiled by the Senate Budget Committee last \nDecember described these provisions as having ``very little, if any, \neconomic justification.''\n  This report goes on to say that many economists believe that these \nprovisions are a ``costly and inefficient way to increase oil and gas \noutput and enhance energy security.''\n  Again, Mr. President, we are not raising this example alone because \nwe have reached a final conclusion as to the merits of this special tax \npreference that is provided to one industry; rather, a tax preference \nestablished in 1916 simply ought to be carefully reconsidered in 1995 \nand thereafter, and the burden, Mr. President, should be on the \nproponents of the special preference to justify it because, by having \nthis special preference, we all have to pay more.\n  If tax expenditures were subjected to reauthorization and sunset \nrules like direct spending programs, they might not fare as well as \nthey do today.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is interested in \nspeaking again. Let me just add a few other quick comments.\n  There are other cases. I just mentioned some larger items. Although \nthe revenue loss to the Treasury over time is actually significant, it \ndoes not look like so much in any particular year. The Joint Tax \nCommittee only lists preferential Tax Code provisions that have a \nprojected total revenue loss of over $50 million or more in a 5-year \nperiod.\n  So these are regarded as small tax court provisions and again, even \nthough they amount to quite a bit over time, they escape scrutiny year \nafter year in the budget process. In contrast, you can be sure, Mr. \nPresident, that a direct spending program that would cost $10 million \nper year for 5 years would certainly be subject to review by both an \nauthorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee on a regular \nbasis.\n  But to try to put it simply, what the Senator from Minnesota and I \nare talking about is this: He said, if you have the political clout and \nthe influence to stick a special tax exemption in the House Ways and \nMeans Committee or in the Finance Committee in the Senate, you are all \nset. That thing is in there forever. It is protected. It is not talked \nabout. It is not considered spending. It is not considered part of the \ndeficit. It is not considered part of the debt. It is not considered \npart of the burden on our children and grandchildren. But it is money. \nIt is real money. But if you are an older person who wants a meal at an \nelderly nutrition site, or a child who is in Head Start, or somebody \nwho wants to see an Amtrak train in your State so people can get to \nwork without polluting the environment, you are scrutinized. You have \nto defend and stand and undergo the tremendous pressure that this \ndeficit has created, and, in part, that deficit is because of these tax \nloopholes.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, there are a number of reasons why tax \nexpenditures should be subjected to the same scrutiny as direct \nspending programs. First, it is an equity issue. When some taxpayers \nreceive special preference, the burden shifts to those who do not have \nlobbyists to win special breaks to pick up the difference. Giving \nspecial tax breaks to some industry means other industries will have \nthe higher tax rates to get the same revenue. It also means the \ntaxpayers with similar income and expenses end up having to pay \ndifferent rates of taxes depending on whether they engage in the tax \nsubsidization activity. Many tax expenditures make sense, and they \naccomplish important policy goals. But it is important that all such \nexpenditures receive regular review, and they ought to be measured \nagainst each other, perhaps a more important policy goal.\n  So to conclude, Mr. President, the Senator from Washington says it is \na confession of failure to attack the balanced budget amendment. This \nis a continued attempt to try to level with the American people just as \nthe right-to-know amendment was. They talk about middle-class tax cuts. \nThis is a huge pot of money that we need to balance the budget. It \nshould be on the table. And the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota \nwould put the Senate on record that we are not going to hold this \nimmune while everyone else has to suffer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I \nwant to respond to some of his comments. But I would like to ask how \nmuch time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my friend from Utah that I would assume that \nhe and others might want to respond to our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from you Utah has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. First, I would like to extend my thanks to the \ndistinguished colleague from Utah for bringing the balanced budget \namendment to the floor for a full debate and vote because I believe, \nmore than any other legislation, passage of the balanced budget \namendment means keeping the promises that we made to the American \npeople last November.\n  I also want to congratulate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nfor his efforts to bring this legislation to the floor.\n  I also want to thank the American voters for sending a clear message \nthat they expect and that they also deserve fiscal responsibility from \nCongress, and that they expect it now.\n  It is my understanding, however, that, like me, the distinguished \nSenator from Utah also supports the three-fifths vote, or the \nsupermajority, amending the Constitution to make it a little more \nresponsible in rating taxes. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. There are a lot of us who would like to do that. On the \nother hand, a constitutional majority would provide for it here, a \nsupermajority tax limiting device as well. But there are a lot of those \nwho would like to have the three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. GRAMS. When we are talking about the balanced budget amendment, I \nthink the goal that we have is to make sure that the Government lives \nwithin its own means, or not being able to spend more dollars than it \ncan take in. So I would like to believe that the balanced budget \namendment is an attempt to reduce really the growth or irresponsible \nspending of the Federal Government rather than as a device or an excuse \nsometime in the future to raise taxes to cover these debts.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator makes a very good point.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I also believe it should be more difficult for Congress to \nbe able to raise taxes or take tax dollars from hard-working Americans \nand to \n[[Page S2691]] make it harder for them to spend their hard-earned tax \ndollars. I also believe that the Federal Government has a budget \ndeficit because spending is too high, not that taxes are too low. Does \nthe Senator from Utah agree with me on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. Boy, do I ever. I certainly do. I think that is one of the \nreasons for this balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Is the Senator from Utah aware that in the country there \nare nine States that have a supermajority vote in order for their \nlegislators to raise taxes? In those States, a portion of personal \nincome has decreased on average by about 2-percent. So it does have the \neffect of not being able to raise--or reduce--the amount of taxes. \nAcross the country, if you applied that 2 percent formula, you would \nsave about $30 billion a year in taxes for hard-working Americans. That \nsounds like a good scenario.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it does. I am a firm believer that the right tax \nrate reduction, especially marginal tax rate reductions, actually leads \nto more revenues as it increases more savings, investment, creation of \njobs, and people working and people paying into the system.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Because of the sentiments expressed by the Senator from \nUtah and by thousands of Minnesotans that I have met over the last 2 \nyears, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 22, a balanced budget \namendment which requires a three-fifths supermajority vote to increase \ntaxes. Because I believe that Congress must pass the balanced budget \namendment this month and because I do not want the taxpayer protection \nclause to be used as a cynical device to derail passage of the balanced \nbudget amendment, I have decided not to offer this legislation as a \nsubstitute to the legislation currently pending on the floor. But as \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives has scheduled a vote for a \ntaxpayer protection amendment to the Constitution on April 15 of next \nyear, I believe that the Senate should take a similar step in \nscheduling a similar vote for next year.\n  Would the Senator from Utah agree with that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would have no problem with that, if that is what the \nmajority leader decides to do.\n  Mr. GRAMS. For that reason, I will be introducing a constitutional \namendment requiring a three-fifths supermajority vote to increase taxes \nas separate legislation shortly in the Senate. I hope that the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah will support this measure and also help \nus get it to the floor for a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I commend the Senator for being willing to stand up on the \nthree-fifths vote and be against further tax increases on an already \nburdened populace.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee if he would \nbe willing to hold hearings of this legislation yet later this year.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be willing to do so. I think they are worthy of \nhearings because so many people in the House, and the Senator from \nMinnesota, feels so strongly about it. I would be willing to hold a \nhearing at least.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator for his assurance that we will have a \nhearing and also a markup on my legislation to protect taxpayers from \nhigher taxes. I thank him for his efforts on behalf of all taxpayers, \nour children and grandchildren, to bring the balanced budget amendment \nto the floor of the Senate for a vote. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis measure without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota and I \nappreciate his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may say a few words about the suggestion of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Wisconsin. \nThe Senators from Minnesota and Wisconsin, I believe, continue to \nconfuse the distinction between a debate of constitutional language and \nprinciple and a debate of implementing legislation. We are here to \naffirm the principle of Government that we should not spend excessively \nand should not leave excessive debt for our children. But this motion \ndoes not deal with the timeless principles of Government of broad \napplication. It deals with a subsection of our tax policy.\n  I, once again, invite my dear colleagues to bring this and similar \nideas back during the budget debate, or the debate over the \nimplementing legislation, which we are going to have to go through \nfollowing passage of the balanced budget amendment. That would be the \nappropriate time to do that. Self-declared opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment continue their attempt to shift this debate from the \nappropriate focus on constitutional principles to an inappropriate \nfocus on the details of tax policy or some other minutia of \nimplementation.\n  My attitude is, let us do first things first. I think we have to \ntable this motion and pass the balanced budget amendment, and then let \nus face these problems that they are sincerely raising on the \nimplementing legislation and do what has to be done. If we can, that \nwill be the way to do it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say I \nappreciate the colloquy. What we are trying to focus on at the moment \nis how we are going to cut $1.481 trillion, between now and the year \n2002. That is the credibility gap.\n  I came on the floor earlier, several weeks ago, with an amendment \nthat came right from the State of Minnesota, where the State senate \nunanimously--the house of delegates was three votes short of \nunanimous--and the Republican Governor all signed a resolution saying: \nBefore you send the balanced budget amendment to Minnesota, Wisconsin, \nor any State, please specify where the cuts are going to take place, \nand how it will affect our States. Let us do the planning. What kinds \nof people are going to be affected by this? Step up to the plate and \ntell us what you are going to do.\n  I still do not hear any of my colleagues on the other side or, for \nthat matter, on this side, that are for this balanced budget amendment \nspecifying how in fact we are going to reach this goal.\n  But, Mr. President, this amendment today is identical to the majority \nleader's motion to refer. It does not have any real connection to the \nbalanced budget amendment in terms of any conditionality at all. We are \nsimply saying, given the focus on balancing the budget and on deficit \nreduction, do not take all of these tax expenditures--$420 billion \nworth--off the table. The motion is very general. It does not target \nspecific tax breaks because we do not think that would be appropriate \non a constitutional amendment. The Senator from Wisconsin made that \nclear and I have made it clear. We simply want to express the sense of \nthe Senate that tax expenditures will undergo the same scrutiny that \nall other spending goes through. We do not eliminate any expenditures. \nWe do not specify what should be eliminated. We leave that to another \nday, when we get to the specifics of the budget and the budget \nreconciliation process.\n  This is a statement of principle today, that as we continue this \nbudget debate in the Congress and in future Congresses, we intend to \nsubject these $420 billion worth of tax expenditures--all too many of \nthem tax dodges--to much closer scrutiny than in the past.\n  My colleague from Utah wants to separate out this notion, this \nprinciple, from a debate on balancing the budget. You cannot. This is a \nbasic standard of fairness. I think in many ways this amendment really \nis a litmus test, because what people in Minnesota and around the \ncountry are saying is we want to know where the cuts are going to take \nplace.\n  People are for the balanced budget amendment in the abstract, but \nwhen you get into specifics and people hear about draconian cuts, cuts \nin Medicare, Medicaid, higher education, people say, ``Wait a minute.'' \nEven if we all understand that we need to continue to invest in people \nand communities, but we also need to continue down the path of deficit \nreduction, what we are saying is that the Senate go on record saying we \nshould evaluate these tax expenditures, \n[[Page S2692]] all of these different expenditures, some of which may \nbe necessary but many of which, some say in the General Accounting \nOffice, are outdated, inefficient, unnecessary--and I add, about the \nhuge dodges.\n  Why should regular Minnesotans be asked to pay more in taxes, be \nasked to sacrifice? I have not heard anybody on the other side--my \ncolleague from Minnesota came out, but there was no response to this \namendment. Nor have I really heard a response from my colleague from \nUtah. Should the Senate go on record that as we evaluate how we are \ngoing to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, that we are going \nto call upon all Americans to be part of the sacrifice? Large \ncorporations, large financial institutions, the wealthiest of the \nwealthy people in our country, are we not going to ask them to be part \nof the sacrifice?\n  I will tell you something, Mr. President. I think the Senate ought to \ngo on record that each and every citizen and each and every interest, \nall interests, ought to be asked to be a part of the sacrifice. \nEverybody should be asked to sacrifice. There should be some standard \nof fairness. That is one of the reasons I have so much trouble with the \nlast 2 weeks of this debate. We are asked to vote for a balanced budget \namendment without specifying what you are going to do.\n  If I thought there was some standard of fairness, if I was not so \nsure that there are just going to be cuts that are going to affect the \nmost vulnerable citizens, if I was not sure about what this is going to \ndo to higher education and health care, if I really thought we were \ngoing to go after $420 billion worth of tax expenditures and put that \non the table, and that we were also going to scrutinize the Pentagon \nbudget and we were going to cut where we should cut, that is exactly \nthe path I want to go down. That is what this amendment says. Subject \nthese expenditures to the same scrutiny that we are putting a whole lot \nof other programs and expenditures under.\n  How much time do I have, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he \nnoticed in his State the same thing I have in my State in recent weeks: \nThat there is a heightened level of anxiety around our States about \nwhat is going to happen when we balance this budget.\n  I am hearing people who are concerned about the elderly nutrition \nprogram, people that are concerned about what is going to happen with \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting. So far, there does not seem to \nbe much talk about the so-called tax loopholes as a way to solve the \nproblem. That is one of the reasons I want to bring this up. I am \nwondering whether the Senator is experiencing this sort of discrepancy \nbetween direct spending programs versus not talking about the tax \nloopholes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, just this \npast Saturday, I was in southwest Minnesota in a meeting with a group \nof citizens that are really worried that Pioneer Public Television--\nwhich, in the rural area, is so important; it is a pool of information; \neconomic development, citizenship--is going to be eliminated. They are \nvery worried about that for very good reasons. Certainly when I meet \nwith the elderly or I meet with children or advocates for children, \npeople who work in schools and universities, everybody was very worried \nabout this.\n  What people say to me in cafes is, ``Look, we understand that we have \nto continue down the path of deficit reduction; we have to be fiscally \nresponsible. We also know that there are crying needs in our community. \nWe want to make sure children have opportunity, that we have to invest \nin education in our communities. We know it is not done by waving a \nmagic wand, but there has to be some standard of fairness.''\n  That is what I think we are talking about here today. Absolutely.\n  I would say to my colleague, I would be interested in his response. \nLet me just put a question to him.\n  I really fell like if we are not willing to go on record today on \nthis motion to refer, which just puts the Senate on record as saying we \nshould just look at tax expenditures and consider whether they should \nbe part of what should be cut. We see cynicism in people in Wisconsin \nand Minnesota who will say, ``Yeah, of course they will vote against \nthis. Unlike those folks, we don't have the big bucks. We do not lobby \neverybody. Who do they represent? They don't represent us.''\n  I think we have to consider these tax expenditures to have \ncredibility.\n  I will ask the Senator from Wisconsin what his view is about it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is exactly my concern. We are out here talking \nabout the big picture, in terms of we have to balance the budget, we \nare talking about direct spending programs, but we have an obligation \nto talk about everything that is spent out here.\n  I find in Wisconsin, and I am sure you do in Minnesota, that people \ndo not know about some of these oil and gas deals. They do not know, \nnecessarily, that foreign nationals get the special deals on tax \nbreaks. We talk about it. We do a heck of a job in telling people about \nwhere this item of pork--you know, the Lawrence Welk issue, the \nsteamboat issue--and we should, and we made some progress on this.\n  But back home people are being prevented from finding out--because we \nwill not talk about it--that there is worse stuff a lot of times stuck \nin the Ways and Means Committee and in the Finance Committee that never \ncomes up to public scrutiny.\n  That is why it is particularly unfair, when these other programs are \nthreatened that really help people and they may have to take some cuts, \nthat they are on the chopping block and the American people are not \neven told the truth. No one is telling the people about the tax \nloopholes; in effect, a conspiracy not to talk about it.\n  I think that is a very serious injustice to the people that you have \ndescribed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I interrupt my colleague to ask \nhim a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is not also true that there is a very direct \ncorrelation--and, unfortunately, it is a hidden correlation, unless we \nare willing to be accountable and open and honest about this--between \nour failure to even look at--which is all we are asking for today--\nthese tax expenditures and the kinds of cuts that are going to take \nplace in some of these programs that are so important to people? And, \nin addition, is it not also true that regular taxpayers end up paying \nmore?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Exactly.\n  If I may respond to the Senator from Minnesota, let us just think \nabout, if you happen to be a supporter of the balanced budget \namendment, your goal out of all of this is, of course, is that the \nStates would ratify the balanced budget amendment. What do the \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment think is going to happen \nback in our home States when the people that are concerned about these \nprograms find out the following: when they find out that defense \nspending is going up; when they find out that we are going to give out \na big tax break across the board to everybody in the country; when they \nfind out we would not even talk about tax loopholes?\n  It is not going to take too long before some of those State \nlegislatures figure out, ``Wait a minute. What is this coming out of?''\n  It is coming out of the local programs and the tax dollars, the \nproperty taxes, of hard-working people of places like Minnesota and \nWisconsin.\n  So I would think you would be concerned that not laying it out for \nthe American people and putting tax expenditures off the table--as \nthis, in effect, does if we do not put it in the sense of the Senate--I \nwould think you would be concerned and I think the Senator from \nMinnesota is right on target.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to my colleague, if I was a proponent of \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which I am not, I \nwould vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Because once people understand that some of the \nprograms that have been most important \n[[Page S2693]] to them and their communities, be it Medicare, be it \nMedicaid, be it Pell grants, be it nutrition programs for children, be \nit veterans' programs, you name it--are going to be cut and cut \ndeeply--but the Pentagon budget is going up; and, you have all of these \nloopholes which are flowing disproportionately to large corporations \nand financial institutions in America with all the clout, without their \nbeing asked to sacrifice at all, there is going to be a huge amount of \nanger.\n  And I would say to my colleague, that is why I think the Senate must \ngo on record today on this.\n  I would say to my colleague from Wisconsin we have a little under a \nminute left. I would be pleased if he would just conclude for us. It \nhas been a joy working with him and I hope we get a good strong vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. We will visit this \nsubject again many times, both of us, and I know we will have support \nfrom others.\n  But what it really comes down to, this is not an attempt to delay on \nthe balanced budget amendment. What we are doing here is to try to \npoint out there are certain special interests that are being protected \nby tax expenditures and that those tax expenditures should be on the \ntable. And, in large part, this is true because these tax expenditures \nhave been a big part of the reason why this mess was created in the \nfirst place; one of the big reasons we have this deficit.\n  So why in the world should not that be on the table with all the \nother things?\n  That is our message and that is why we would urge the adoption of \nthis motion to refer.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time, if the \ndistinguished Senators are prepared to yield back their time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Utah. I am prepared to yield \nback my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the motion and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Utah to table the motion of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone]. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \na motion to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee, \nwhich I intend to make, be printed in the Record for the information of \nSenators.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Proposed motion to be made by Mr. Bumpers:\n       I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 and issue a report, at the earliest \n     possible date, which shall include the following:\n       ``Section 1.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding.\n  He is about to lay down an amendment that is a very important \namendment to this issue that I think both sides are very concerned \nabout and want ample time to debate. I would like to see if we could \nnot arrive at a unanimous consent agreement here. Is it acceptable to \nthe Senator from Louisiana if we look at 4 hours equally divided?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, that is acceptable.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I hope that if we can get a unanimous consent on that, we \nwould both try to yield back as much as possible of the unused time and \nso encourage our colleagues.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Certainly. Mr. President, there is no intent at all to \ndelay. All amendments are important. But this is one that I hope will \npass and that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will accede \nto. But in any event, we will yield back to the extent we do not use \nthe time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I then ask unanimous consent for 4 hours \nequally divided on the Johnston amendment, prior to a motion to table, \nand that no amendments to the Johnston amendment be in order.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I certainly do not plan any second-\ndegree amendments. I do not see any of my colleagues who do. So that \nwould be suitable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the \namendment by Mr. Johnston, I be recognized to call up an amendment. If \nthis request is not agreed to, I will be here and seek recognition in \nmy own right. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold that for just \na \n[[Page S2694]] minute and let me talk to him about that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was my request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator have a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. That upon the disposition of the amendment that is being \noffered by Mr. Johnston, I be recognized to call up an amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. And I will not object, would the Senator from West \nVirginia mind discussing with us at this time the amendment he plans to \noffer following this amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I stated to the Senator in private what it was.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator mind for the Record saying so?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will say so when I get ready.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I see. Let me say for the Record, because I do not want to \nobject to proceedings here, the three-fourths amendment in section 1, \nit is my understanding the Senator from West Virginia plans to offer an \namendment to it?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is, but I have not reached the point yet that I feel I \nam under obligation to announce what my amendment does before I call it \nup.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this is not an issue here. The Senator \nknows the rules of the Senate as do I, and certainly he is not under \nthat obligation. I was only asking for a courtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I told the Senator in private out of courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n(Purpose: To provide that no court shall have the power to order relief \n pursuant to any case or controversy arising under the balanced budget \n     constitutional amendment, except as provided in implementing \n                              legislation)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], for himself, Mr. \n     Bumpers, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Pryor, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 272.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Section 6, add the following: ``No court \n     shall have the power to order relief pursuant to any case or \n     controversy arising under this article, except as may be \n     specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \n     to this section.''\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is \nessentially the 1994 Danforth amendment which was adopted by this body \nwithout dissent.\n  What it says is that no court shall have the power to order relief \npursuant to any case or controversy arising under this article except \nas may be specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \nto this section--no court jurisdiction unless specifically authorized \nby the Congress. That is virtually identical to the amendment which was \nadopted last year.\n  Why do we propose this? On January 31, we had an extended debate here \non the question of whether or not this amendment is enforceable, and if \nso, how it is enforceable. I opined that the way it would be likely \nenforced would be to have the Supreme Court order an income tax \nsurcharge, because the Court is particularly ill qualified to make \nchoices between various spending programs, to choose between the B-2 \nbomber and the F/A-18, or to choose between Social Security and \nMedicare, or to determine what the effects of these budget cuts would \nbe. The thing they would be able to do is to order an income tax \nsurcharge. It would not change any of the rules. It would simply say \nyou add on to the present income tax, using those rules, a surcharge, \nwhich they would order the Treasury to collect.\n  In response to that argument, I had an extended colloquy with my \nfriend from Utah, Mr. Hatch. Mr. Hatch stated that he did not see any \nway the courts would find standing or justiciability, that only the \nCongress had power to enforce this amendment. Mr. Hatch made very clear \nthat it is the intent of the majority party that this amendment not be \nenforceable by the courts.\n  I then asked, ``If that is the intent, why did you not spell it out \nas we did in the Danforth amendment the previous year?''\n  To that, Mr. Hatch replied, in effect, that, ``Frankly, there are \nthose on the other side who I think will argue the courts ought to have \nsome control. We just want to avoid that particular argument.''\n  So in effect what we have is an intentional ambiguity fashioned in \norder to appeal to both sides of this argument. There are some who \nthink the courts ought to be involved. There are some who think the \ncourts should not be involved. Mr. Hatch thinks the courts are not \ninvolved. So, therefore, it is left intentionally ambiguous.\n  Mr. President, I would first like to submit to my colleagues that \nthis is not at all clear. As a matter of fact, I believe the majority \nlegal opinion would be that jurisdiction does lie. Quoting from a \nHarvard Law Review article of May 1983, they state:\n\n       Doctrinal analysis demonstrates, however, that taxpayers \n     probably would have standing to challenge alleged violation \n     of either the deficit spending prohibition or the tax \n     limitation provision.\n\n  Harvard Law Review says when you analyze all the cases, they probably \nwould have standing.\n  Assistant Attorney General Dellinger testified before the committee. \nAssistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger stated as follows:\n\n       Moreover, it is possible that courts would hold that either \n     taxpayers or other litigants would have standing to \n     adjudicate various aspects of the budget process under the \n     balanced budget amendment. Even if taxpayers and Members of \n     Congress were not granted standing, a criminal defendant \n     prosecuted or sentenced under an omnibus crime bill that \n     improved tax enforcement or authorized fines or forfeitures \n     could argue that the bill ``increased revenues'' within the \n     meaning of section 4.\n\n  Or take the distinguished professor, Harvard law professor Laurence \nTribe. Mr. Tribe says:\n\n       So that one way or another, Members of Congress, a House of \n     Congress, someone who has been cut off from a program, a \n     taxpayer--these people will be able to go to court. No \n     question about it.\n\n  I have a whole folder of cases and experts who say that taxpayers \ncould go to court, that there would be jurisdiction in the courts, that \nit would be enforceable. Others say it is a question to be determined \nby the courts.\n  Suffice it to say, in my judgment, no one can seriously rise to his \nfeet on the floor of this Senate and say that this is a clear question; \nthat what Mr. Hatch says is correct, that is, that there is clearly no \nstanding or jurisdiction to enforce this amendment. It simply is not \nso. As I have just quoted from Professor Tribe, from Professor \nDellinger--Professor Fried says the same thing--Harvard Law Review--on \nand on. It is not clear what the limits of court jurisdiction would be.\n  I ask my colleagues this question, which is a fundamental question. \nIs there advantage in ambiguity? Is there some reason that we in this \nU.S. Senate, understanding the ambiguity of court jurisdiction, would \nwant to leave it ambiguous? I think the answer is--which Mr. Hatch \ngave--that some of our people think they ought to have jurisdiction and \nsome think they should not have jurisdiction so, therefore, we leave it \nambiguous and hope to get the votes of both sides.\n  I submit that as a political matter on the floor of this Senate that \nis likely to do you more harm than good. There are some on this side of \nthe Senate who, just as recently as 10 minutes ago, said the outcome of \nthe Johnston amendment will influence their vote on this matter. There \nmay be some on the other side of the aisle who feel differently.\n  [[Page S2695]] I suggest if it is a political calculation that my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who are supporting this \namendment check with their Members and see how many you lose by making \nclear the most fundamental question in this amendment. Are there really \npeople in this Senate who would vote against the amendment because you \ncleared up an ambiguity? I do not believe so. But there may be some on \nthis side of the aisle who recognize the pernicious, difficult effect \nof this amendment--no less authority than former Solicitor General, \nJudge Robert Bork, said the following, in a 1983 article:\n\n       The result would likely be hundreds, if not thousands, of \n     lawsuits around the country, many of them on inconsistent \n     theories and providing inconsistent results. By the time the \n     Supreme Court straightened the whole matter out, the budget \n     question would at least be 4 years out of date and lawsuits \n     involving the next 3 fiscal years would be slowly climbing \n     toward the Supreme Court.\n\n  Judge Bork is giving nothing but common sense. Everything the Federal \nGovernment would do would be subject to litigation. And, as Judge Bork \nsays, thousands of lawsuits matriculating their way up to the Supreme \nCourt, inconsistent results, and in the meantime what happens to this \ncountry? There would be bond issues which are subject to doubt. What \nattorney would issue an opinion on a bond issue that was clouded by a \nSupreme Court or by a district court case? There are so many other \nthings that this Congress does with respect to issuing debts, making \ncontracts--all would be unclear because we would not know what the \njurisdiction of the court was.\n  To those who say that the court needs to be involved, I say the \nCongress, under this amendment, has that power. To the extent that \nCongress specifically gives to the court the power to get involved in \nthe balanced budget amendment, we have the ability to do so. And we may \nwish to do so. We may, for example, wish to limit them to declaratory \njudgments. We might wish to limit them to interpreting the words of the \nConstitution, determining what an outlay is, what a receipt is, et \ncetera. We may want to give them injunctive power. We may want to limit \ntheir ability to raise taxes. In fact, on the Republican side of this \naisle, there is a lot of feeling against raising any taxes, whether by \nCongress--there was one amendment proposed which required 60 votes to \nraise taxes, as part of this amendment. But you would give that power \nto an unelected court.\n  So the power to raise taxes is clearly, Mr. President, something that \nought to be cleared up. Or, on the other hand, we may wish to say that \nthe Supreme Court has original jurisdiction for the purpose of \nconsidering the balanced budget amendment. In other words, we may think \nthat the matter is so important and it requires such expeditious \nrelief, considering the uncertainties in the bond market, the \nuncertainties in contractual rights, that we need to expedite that \nconsideration by providing that original jurisdiction in the Supreme \nCourt. The Congress under this amendment would have that power. We \nwould be able to define those limits, provide for that expediency, and \nprovide whatever jurisdiction or limits on that jurisdiction that we \nwish under this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask why not do that? Why not clear up that American \nambiguity? Why not make this constitutional amendment so far as we can \nfree from litigation?\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Idaho, for whom I have great \nrespect and affection, first of all, if he agrees with me that this is \na matter which is at least ambiguous and that the weight of authority \nis probably on the side of saying the court has jurisdiction. Would my \ncolleague agree with that statement?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator, I too have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Louisiana and admire the fact that \nhe is bringing this sort of discussion to this issue. But really I \nwould defer from responding to that because I think the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee would be more appropriate who is grounded in this \nfield and aspect of it to respond to you so you get the meaningful \ndialogue and exchange that really this issue merits.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator agree with me that, if it is a matter \nof ambiguity--and we will let Senator Hatch respond to that--then it \nought to be an ambiguity that could be cleared up?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I think when you have ambiguity, I do not know why we \nwould want to proceed down the road of solidifying ambiguity.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator. In his usual candor, he I think \nreinforces the point.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Utah coming onto the floor. I \nwonder if I could engage with him in a colloquy on this matter.\n  I thank my friend from Utah. My question was this: I had just quoted \nfrom the Harvard Law Review a number of professors who have stated that \nin their view there would be standing, justiciability and the matter \nwould be handled by the court, although there are doubts about the \nlimits about it. Will the Senator from Utah agree with me that it is at \nleast a matter of ambiguity as to what the jurisdiction of the court \nwould be?\n  Mr. HATCH. I really do not agree. I really do not think that you can \nfind standing across the board. I do not think you can find standing. \nThere may be some isolated cases where a person's peculiar interests \nhave been affected. I cannot think of any right offhand. But I am \ncertainly not ruling that out. But I really do not think you can find \nall three of those conditions to exist with regard to the balanced \nbudget amendment. I will be happy to address that in greater detail \nwhen it comes my time to say a few words about it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did the Senator have an opportunity to hear me quote \nAssistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger who said that it is \npossible that the courts would hold that either taxpayers or other \nlitigants would have standing to adjudicate various aspects of the \nbudget process?\n  Mr. HATCH. I was there when he said that and he backpedaled off that \nin the middle of the hearings and had to admit that there is not much \nbasis for that statement. I might add that was in the face of a former \nAttorney General and a whole raft of other witnesses who said that just \nis not true.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What Attorney General?\n  Mr. HATCH. Attorney General Barr was there.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You understand Attorney General Barr, to quote Attorney \nGeneral Barr:\n\n       I do believe Congress should consider including language in \n     the amendment that would expressly limit judicial review to \n     actions for declaratory judgments. If, however, such a \n     provision would prove to be politically unpopular, I believe \n     for the reasons detailed in my written statement that \n     Congress can safely pass the amendment in its current form \n     without undue concern that the courts will entertain large \n     numbers of suits challenging Congress' actions under the \n     amendment or that, even if the courts do entertain some \n     suits, they will order intrusive injunctive remedies.\n\n  General Barr says we ought to clear up the ambiguity because \naccording to him, he says they--I mean the obverse. He says they will \nnot entertain large numbers of suits. I do not know what large numbers \nare to him, and I do not know what intrusive injunctive remedies are.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I was there. He did say that as \na political matter, if it helps you to pass a bill and dispose of \namendments, that you might want to put a provision in with regard to \ndeclaratory judgments. We did that when we lost the last amendment. He \nsaid it is just a matter of political judgment. His opinion was that \nyou are not going to----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I just quoted his opinion.\n  Mr. HATCH. No. No. That is what he said, not in his written \nstatement. He was making a point in front of the committee that, if \npolitically that helps you to pass the balanced budget amendment, you \ncould live with that type of a provision. But his main points were that \nhe did not see any reason to involve courts in the amendment either \nway.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am quoting Attorney General Barr in a written answer \nto a posthearing statement in which he says ``I do believe''--do \nbelieve--``Congress should consider including language in the amendment \nthat would \n[[Page S2696]] expressly limit judicial review to actions for \ndeclaratory judgment.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. That is what we did in last year's debate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In the Danforth amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. But that has nothing to do withstanding, nothing to do \nwith justiciability. The fact of the matter is----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of course it does.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me make my point. Declaratory relief in the eyes of \nmany--and I think most authorities--can be as intrusive as injunctive \nrelief. Take Justice Frankfurter in Coalgrave v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, \npage 552, a 1946 case, and he opined that declaratory relief should not \nbe granted in situations where injunctions are inappropriate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just finish, maybe I can help clarify. Let me \nfinish. I only have two more comments to make.\n  Thus declaratory relief would be limited by the standing political \nquestions of separation of powers doctrines.\n  Finally, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nwould be construed, if it passes, to grant the courts broad declaratory \nrelief despite the standing in the political question of doctrine,\n and I might add the separation of powers doctrine. We think that is a \n  mistake.Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may correct the Senator at that point, my \namendment precludes any judicial order of relief, except to the extent \nexpressly authorized by the Congress and, unlike the Danforth \namendment, does not include declaratory relief.\n  What I was saying about Judge Barr was that Judge Barr says you ought \nto limit this at least to declaratory relief, but he goes on to point \nout that it is probable that you would have some suits entertained. The \ndistinguished Harvard law professor, Laurence Tribe, says:\n\n       So that one way or another, Members of Congress, a House of \n     Congress, someone who has been cut off from a program, a \n     taxpayer, these people will be able to go to court; no \n     question about it.\n\n  We could go on here quoting from cases, quoting from other experts. I \nhave not come across any expert who says it is clear that there is no \njurisdiction, not one. I would welcome that statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact that we leave it open says there may be \njurisdictions. It does not mean the courts will grant it. I do not \nthink they will. Let me read----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Wait. We are on my time now. Let me make my point \nfirst, and the Senator may respond. There is not one expert--not one--\nthat I have come across who says the matter of justiciability, the \nmatter of standing, or the matter of being a political question, which \nare the three bases on which my friend from Utah relied in our January \n31 debate, not one expert says that that is a clear question. On the \nother hand, Professor Tribe says it is clear they would have standing. \nMr. Dellinger says he believes they would have standing. Judge Barr \nsays you ought to limit that because there may be some lawsuits and \nthey may order some judicial relief, and no one that I can find \ndisagrees with that.\n  What I am saying is that it is at best an ambiguity--at best--and a \nprobability of court jurisdiction, a probability of court intrusiveness \nhere. How can my friend from Utah say it is not a matter of ambiguity \nin the face of the Harvard Law Review and distinguished professors, \nincluding his own, who say otherwise?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because there is little or no chance that is going to \nhappen. Let me, if I can, just go back to the written remarks----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Can the Senator give me one single expert who agrees \nwith him?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to give it to you right now. Let me just go \nback--if you want to enshrine the word ambiguity, I am not going to do \nthat for you. I can say that I cannot rule out that there might be some \noddball case where somebody might have standing. I cannot rule that \nout. But I do believe we can rule it out on the basis of just \nreasonability that some oddball is not going to have an oddball case \nthat affects everybody in the country because they are not going to be \nable to meet those three requirements.\n  Here is what General Barr said in his written comments: ``In my view, \nthough it is always difficult to predict the course of future \nconstitutional law development''--from that standpoint, I have to grant \nthe point that who knows whether some crackpots who occasionally do get \nto the courts, if we believe that is what is going to happen to the \nSupreme Court, who knows, you cannot say that anything is absolute in \nthis world. Here is what he said:\n\n       In my view, though it is always difficult to predict the \n     course of future constitutional law development, the courts' \n     role in enforcing the balanced budget amendment will be quite \n     limiting.\n\n  I see little risk that the amendment will become the basis for \njudicial micromangement or superintendence of the Federal budget \nprocess.\n  Furthermore, to the extent such judicial intrusion does arise, the \namendment itself equips Congress to correct the problem by statute. On \nbalance, moreover, whatever remote risks there may be that courts will \nplay an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, that risk is, \nin my opinion, vastly outweighed by the benefits of such an amendment.\n  Then he says:\n\n       I believe there are three basic constraints that will tend \n     to prevent the courts from becoming unduly involved in the \n     budgetary process. One, the limitation on the power of the \n     Federal courts contained in article III of the Constitution, \n     primarily the requirement of standing; two, the deference the \n     courts will owe to Congress, both under existing \n     constitutional doctrines and particularly under section 6 of \n     the amendment itself, which expressly confers enforcement \n     responsibility on Congress; and three, the limits on judicial \n     remedies running against coordinate branches of Government, \n     both that the courts have imposed upon themselves and that in \n     appropriate circumstances Congress may impose on the courts.\n\n  When the Senator cites Laurence Tribe of Harvard to me and Walter \nDellinger of Duke, they are both ardent advocates against the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let us quote from Mr. Barr, who says in that same \nstatement on page 8:\n\n       But I would be the last to say that the standing doctrine \n     is an ironclad shield against judicial activism. The doctrine \n     is malleable and it has been manipulated by the courts in the \n     past.\n\n  The one expert that my friend from Utah quotes to say that this \nmatter is clear himself says it is unclear, and he says you cannot \npredict what the court will do, and himself urges that you limit the \njurisdiction of the court. That is what he says.\n  I ask my friend, why do we not clear it up?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because we do not have to. Even though he says that there \nis no absolute in the law, because you can always find, or you may find \nin the future, some judicial activist who will ignore what the law \nsays, we do have all kinds of checks and balances in this country, not \njust the courts, but in the other branches of Government as well. Even \nin the courts we have checks and balances. That is why we have nine \nJustices on the Supreme Court. What he is saying is there is little or \nno likelihood that anybody is going to be able to go to court and meet \nthose three requisites under current law or under the law as he \nenvisions it to be.\n  If you ask him, well, assuming that there are no absolutes, and you \nwant to be absolutely sure that the courts can never intrude, what \nwould you do? Naturally, he would say I think you can have declaratory \njudgment relief if you want to write that into the amendment. We do not \nwant to do that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What harm does it do, to clear up this matter, to say \nthat there is no jurisdiction, no power for the courts to grant \njudicial relief except to the extent we authorize it in the Congress; \nwhat harm does it do?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the harm is that if the Senator writes the courts \nout of the Constitution, or out of this balanced budget amendment, he \nwill be writing people out that we cannot foresee at this time--I do \nnot know--who may have some legitimate, particularized injury to \nthemselves that will enable them to have standing and a right to sue. \nThat is a far cry from giving a broad, generalized right to the public \nat large.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator understand what he just said? He has \njust been saying that this matter is clear that there is no \njurisdiction, but \n[[Page S2697]] we better not say there is no jurisdiction because there \nare some people we cannot foresee who may have jurisdiction and may \nwant to sue, and the courts ought to be enforcing their rights.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is a difference between a general right to sue for \nall citizens and a particularized injury to one individual which I \ncannot foresee right now. I do not believe there are any instances I \ncan come up with, but there may be.\n  Let me give you an illustration. Suppose Congress--this is not to say \nthis is going to happen--but suppose Congress passes legislation \ncutting spending programs only to Jewish people. That will not happen, \nbut let us give that as a bizarre illustration.\n   In this case, should they not have a right to sue?Mr. JOHNSTON. \nWell, now, tell me, would the court's power to order relief be limited \nor could the court say you have not balanced the budget and therefore \nwe order an income tax surcharge?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think the court can do that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Where does my friend find such limitations on the \ncourt's power? If somebody has standing to sue, then they have standing \nto ask for whatever relief is appropriate.\n  Mr. HATCH. We deal with judicial restraints, judicial powers, every \nday in our lives. And one of the reasons why the law develops year \nafter year after year is because of ingenious people who find ways to \ndevelop it.\n  All I am saying is this: We do not want to take away anybody's rights \nthat may develop sometime in the future. We do not want a generalized \nright to sue and we do not believe anybody can make a good case that \nthey will have that right.\n  I do not think Professor Tribe did it or Walter Dellinger did it in \nfront of the committee.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do you know what Robert Bork said?\n  Mr. HATCH. And on the courts raising taxes, it is a question of \nredressability. You know, it is a separation of powers of doctrine.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Judge Bork says:\n\n       The result would be hundreds, it not thousands, of lawsuits \n     around the country, many of them on inconsistent theories and \n     providing inconsistent results.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. And Judge Bork has very good reason to feel that way with \nthe way he was treated. His legal contentions are based on \noverexaggerated fears of judicial activists. Actually, the post-Warren \nSupreme Court has tightened the standing and justiciability doctrines \nto such a degree that balanced budget enforcement suits would probably \nbe dismissed on those grounds alone.\n  And I cite the Lujan versus the Defenders of Wildlife case in 1992.\n  In fact, Bork admits----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may interrupt--and I do not like to interrupt.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may just finish.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Are we proceeding on my time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to make this response on my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. In fact, to make my case a little more clear, Bork admits, \non page 2 of the letter he wrote, that standing would probably be \ndenied. That is what most real constitutional experts would say. The \nsubstance of the legal argument is to speculate on the consequences of \nwhat if courts assumed jurisdiction. Well, what if courts decided to \nraise taxes? What if they decide to send armies to war? What if \njudicial activists decide to do anything that is outside of their \njurisdiction and their range? I suspect we could conjure up any kind of \na scare tactic, any kind of bizarre situation.\n  What we have to rely on is what is the law. And it is very tough \nunder current law and under the laws that existed for a long time, to \ncome up with standing, with the requisites to meet the standing, \njusticiability, and the political question doctrine and some separation \nof powers doctrine in order to do what the distinguished Senator is \nsuggesting Tribe and Dellinger say can be done.\n  Mr. Dellinger back-pedaled quite a bit at that hearing. We did not \nhave a lot of time to question him, and if we had, I think he would \nhave back-pedaled a lot more. Neither Tribe nor Dellinger are \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment.\n  And I have found, as the excellent lawyers they are, and they are \nreally excellent lawyers, that they can come up, as law professors--and \nboth of these are law professors, although Dellinger, Professor \nDellinger, and I do not mean to denigrate him; Professor Dellinger is \nnow down at the Justice Department--both of them can come up with \nalternatives on everything.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. Barr is a supporter.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, Mr. Barr is not a supporter. I listened to the \ntestimony, and in speculating about it and hypothesizing about it, he \nsays, ``Well, if you want to do this, you can do it.'' But Barr \nbasically says you should not have to do it; the law is such that you \nshould not have to do it.\n  And Bork is just saying it because he fears judicial activists. Bork \nis saying that, you know, well, his comments are based on what I \nconsider to be, and I think many others, exaggerated fears of judicial \nactivists.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You do understand that Mr. Barr said:\n\n       I do believe Congress should consider including language in \n     the amendment that would expressly limit judicial review.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I was there. I believe I was there when he said it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, this was in the posthearing answer to written \nquestions. That is the last word from Mr. Barr.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did he ever back up on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think if Mr. Barr, if General Barr, was asked what his \nopinion is, he would say, ``Don't clutter up the Constitution.'' \nBecause every time you add a provision like this into to, every time \nyou add that kind of provision or any kind of provision, you have a \nwhole myriad of problems that arise from there.\n  Now we have people in both bodies who want the courts involved. We \nhave people who do not want the courts involved. I think there is \nlittle or no likelihood that the courts are going to be involved on \nthis amendment as it is written.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is that not the real answer; that some of your Members \nare for it and some are against it, and you want to please both sides, \nso you leave it ambiguous?\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, I do not think it is really ambiguous. \nNothing is absolute, so I guess you can claim ambiguity on any \nproposition you make.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I just read to you the most distinguished professors in \nthe country, including Mr. Bork, and you have not one single expert, \nnot one, who supports your position. Name me one. I mean, you do not \nlike Judge Bork; you do not like----\n  Mr. HATCH. I love Judge Bork. And I do not disregard Professor Tribe \nand Professor Dellinger.\n  What I am saying is this: The Senator is partially correct. We are \ndealing here with a constitutional amendment of general application. We \nare dealing with one of the most difficult debates in the history of \nthe country. We are dealing with consensus problems. We are dealing \nwith Republicans and Democrats. We are dealing with 38 years of trying \nto get this to the floor--38 years; really, better than 200 years of \ngetting the House to vote on this. Thirty-eight years of trying to get \nit to the floor, nineteen years in my life of trying to do it, having \nbrought it to the floor in 1982, where we passed it in the Senate \nwithout that language, having brought it three other times to the \nfloor, and this is the fourth time, and trying to bring people together \nwho have a mixture of viewpoints.\n  We are doing the best we can. Now, can we satisfy everybody's urge, \nincluding Professor Tribe's or Professor Dellinger's? Can we satisfy \neverybody's demand or desire for their own wording in this amendment? \nCan we satisfy those who do not want the courts involved in this to the \nexclusion of those who do? There are not many who do, but there are \nsome who do.\n  Or do we do what we have to do, and that is, get a consensus on this \nmatter and fight for it as hard as we can and do the best we can? Well, \nthat is what we are doing.\n   [[Page S2698]] Mr. JOHNSTON. If I could ask my colleague at that \npoint, I disagree not just with the legal calculus, but with the \npolitical calculus, as well.\n  The Danforth amendment was virtually identical to this amendment and \nwas passed without opposition. Is there really opposition on your side? \nAre there Senators who on your side would say, I will not support this \namendment unless it has the right of the courts to order relief?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe there are. I believe there are some on your \nside. In fact, I think there are as many, if not more, on your side.\n  So what I am saying is we are trying to do the art of the doable \nhere. Personally, I do not like courts involved--in certain aspects of \nthis, I would not want them involved at all--and I do not believe they \nwill be, or I would be arguing for the Senator's position. I might add \nthat some do like the courts involved in some of these areas, but I do \nnot know many who do.\n  But let me just say that what we are trying to do is bring Senators \ntogether and reach a 67-vote total. We are one or two votes away from \nthat. Some think we are there, but I do not ever count that until the \nfinal vote. We are one or two votes away from being there. And we are \ntrying to keep the amendment intact.\n  And keep in mind, we have 300 people in the House of Representatives \nwho voted for this amendment. If we add anything to it, it has to go \nback to them.\n  These are considerations the distinguished Senator from Illinois and \nI have to meet.\n  Now, as I recall, just to name two experts, Griffin Bell, former \nAttorney General of the United States, upholds this position. Professor \nVan Alstein, from Duke, who was Walter Dellinger's partner down there, \nupholds this position, as far as I know.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Who say this is a matter that has no ambiguity.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who say there is little or no likelihood that people can \ngenerally sue on behalf of all Senators under this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is a huge amount of difference between ``little \nlikelihood'' and ``clear.''\n  See, the difference is that we would have this litigation going \nthrough the courts. As Judge Bork said, thousands of cases with \ninconsistent results. Bond issues, contracts, subject to lack of \nclarity.\n  It is not too much to say that the capital markets of this country \ncould, during the pending litigation, be put into complete chaos.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think those are scare tactics myself. Let me say a few \nthings, and maybe I can clarify to a degree.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is a fine-tuned law. It \nmanages to strike the delicate balance between reviewability by the \ncourts and the limitations on the courts' ability to interfere with \ncongressional authority.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the former Attorney General William B. \nBarr, who stated that if House Joint Resolution 1 is ratified there is,\n\n       * * * little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micromanagement or superintendence of the \n     Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute.\n\n  In other words, we can correct any problem that does arise. ``On \nbalance,'' he goes on to say, ``whatever remote risk there may be the \ncourt will play an overtly intrusive role in forcing the amendment, \nthat risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by the benefits of such \namendment.''\n  In regard to Congress' power to restrain the courts, which I think is \nan important point, I think the Senator from Louisiana does the Senate \na service in raising the issue.\n  In order to resist the ambition of the courts, the framers gave to \nthe Congress in article III of the Constitution the authority to limit \nthe jurisdiction of the courts, the type of remedies the courts may \nremedy, if Congress truly fears certain courts may decide to ignore the \nlaw and the precedence. If Congress finds it necessary, through \nimplementing legislation, it may forbid courts the use of their \ninjunctive powers already. And the Congress has done that from time to \ntime.\n  Or Congress could create an exclusive cause of action or tribunal \nwhich carefully limits power satisfactory for Congress to deal with the \nbalanced budget components or complaints.\n  But Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nproposes, cut off all judicial review. I believe that House Joint \nResolution 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial review. By \nremaining silent about judicial review in the amendment itself, its \nauthors have refused to establish congressional sanction for the \nFederal courts to involve themselves in fundamental, macroeconomic, and \nbudgetary issues in question.\n  At the same time, this balanced budget amendment does not undermine \nthe courts' equally fundamental obligation, as first stated in Marbury \nversus Madison, to say what the law is. After all, while I am confident \nthat courts will not be able to interfere with our budgetary \nprerogatives, I am frank enough to say I cannot predict every \nconceivable lawsuit--nobody can--which might arise under this amendment \nand which does not implicate these budgetary prerogatives.\n  A litigant in such a narrow circumstance, if he or she can \ndemonstrate standing, ought to be heard. They ought to have their case \nheard. It is simply wrong to assume that Congress would just sit by in \nthe unlikely event that a court would commit some overreaching end. \nBelieve me, Congress knows how to defend itself. Congress knows how to \nrestrict the jurisdiction of courts or limit the scope of judicial \nremedies where the courts get completely out of line as they would have \nto be in this situation.\n  I do not think it is necessary. Lower courts by and large, and really \nalmost always, follow precedent. The precepts of separation of powers \nand the political question doctrine effectively limit the ability of \ncourts to interfere in the budgetary process. Nevertheless, if \nnecessary, a shield against judicial interference is section 6 of House \nJoint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment itself. Under this \nsection Congress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any \npurported budgetary shortfall such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear that \nCongress if it finds it necessary, could limit the type of remedies the \ncourt may grant or limit the courts' jurisdiction in some other manner \nto proscribe judicial overreaching. This is not at all a new device nor \nis it at all a new constitutional device. Congress has adopted such \nlimitations in other circumstances pursuant to its article III \nauthority.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit standing, judicial review, \nparticular special tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. \nSuch a tribunal was set up recently as the Reagan administration needed \na special claims tribunal to settle claims on Iranian assets. Beyond \nwhich, in the virtually impossible scenario where these safeguards \nfail, Congress can take whatever action it must to moot any case in \nwhich a risk of judicial overreaching becomes something real.\n  Now, these standing, separation of powers, and political question \nissues are restraints. I might add, there is a distinction between \nremedies court can give and the ability to bring relief. Courts cannot \ninterfere with the budgetary process. It is a political question. It \nwould violate the separation of powers doctrine.\n  These three restraints--these are basic constraints--prevent the \ncourts from interfering in the budgetary process.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish this, I would like it to be \nuninterrupted. Then I would be happy to yield.\n  First, limitations on Federal courts contained in article III of the \nConstitution, primarily the doctrine of standing. That is not one.\n  Second, the deference the courts owe to Congress under both the \npolitical question doctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself, \nwhich confers enforcement authority in Congress--not in the courts, in \nCongress--specifically. I think a court would really have to overreach \nand overreach badly to try to go around that.\n  Third, the limits on judicial remedies which can be imposed on a \ncoordinate \n [[Page S2699]] branch of government; in this case, the legislative \nbranch.\n  These are limitations on remedies self-imposed by courts and that, in \nappropriate circumstances, may be imposed on the courts by Congress. \nThese limitations such as the doctrine of separation of powers \nprohibits courts from raising taxes--that is a power exclusively \ndelegated to Congress by the Constitution--and it is not altered in any \nway, shape or form by the balanced budget amendment that we are \noffering here today.\n  Consequently, contrary to the contention of the opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment, separation-of-power concerns further the \npurpose of the amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance \nthe budget falls squarely on the shoulders of Congress, which is \nconsistent, as I see it, with the Framers of the Constitution that all \nbudgetary matters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n  Concerning the doctrine of standing, it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must further demonstrate the \nstanding to sue. To demonstrate article III standing, a litigant at a \nminimum must meet three requirements: No. 1, injury, in fact, that the \nlitigant suffered some concrete and particularized injury.\n  No. 2, traceability\n   --that the concrete injury, not only is the injury in fact because \nthe litigants suffer some concrete or particularized injury, but \ntraceability means that the concrete injury was both caused by and is \n  traceable to the unlawful conduct.And No. 3, redressability--that the \nrelief sought will redress the alleged injury.\n  That is a large hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate that injury in \nfact requirement. That is something more concrete than a generalized \ngrievance and burden shared by all citizens and taxpayers.\n  I do not know anybody who is an authority on this subject who would \ndisagree with that. They might not like that, but that is what the law \nis. Even in the vastly improbable case where an injury in fact was \nestablished, a litigant would find it nearly impossible to establish \nthe traceability and redressability requirement of the article III \nstanding test. After all, there will be hundreds and hundreds of \nFederal spending programs even after Federal spending is brought under \ncontrol.\n  Furthermore, because the Congress would have numerous options to \nachieve balanced budget compliance, there would be no legitimate basis \nfor a court to nullify or modify a specific spending measure objected \nto by the litigant.\n  Now as to the redressability problem, this requirement would be \ndifficult to meet because courts are wary of becoming involved in the \nbudget process. They always have been, which they admit is legislative \nin nature, and separation of powers concerns will prevent courts from \nspecifying adjustments of any Federal program or expenditures.\n  Thus, for this reason, Missouri versus Jenkins, the 1990 case that is \noften cited, where the Supreme Court upheld a district court's power to \norder a local school district to levy taxes to support a desegregation \nplan is inapposite. Plainly put, the Jenkins case is not applicable to \nthe balanced budget amendment because section 1 of the 14th amendment, \nfrom which the judiciary derives its power to rule against the States \nin equal protection claims, does not apply to the Federal Government \nand because the separation of powers doctrine prevents judicial \nencroachments on Congress' bailiwick. Courts simply will not have the \nauthority to order Congress to raise taxes. It is just that simple. And \nanybody who argues the Jenkins case just does not understand its 14th \namendment implications.\n  Now on the political question, and these are important points, and I \napologize to my colleague for making him wait until I make these points \nbut I think they need to be made in order, and then, of course, I will \nbe glad to discuss it with him.\n  The well-established political question doctrine and justiciability \ndoctrine will mandate that the courts give the greatest deference to \ncongressional budgetary measures, particularly since section 6 of House \nJoint Resolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress the responsibility of \nenforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows Congress to ``rely on \nestimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  Under these circumstances, it is extremely and all but unlikely that \na court will substitute its judgment for that of Congress. I just \ncannot conceive of it, other than some future country that does not \nabide by its laws.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the taxpayer standing case, Flast versus Cohen, in \n1968, is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. The Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court to \nestablishment clause cases. Also, Flast is, by its own terms, limited \nto challenging cases for an illicit purpose.\n  I also believe there would be no so-called congressional standing for \nMembers of Congress to commence actions under the balanced budget \namendment because Members of Congress would not be able to demonstrate \nthat they were harmed in fact by any dilution or nullification of their \nvote, and because under the doctrine of equitable discretion, Members \nwould not be able to show that substantial relief could not otherwise \nbe obtained from fellow legislators, through the enactment, repeal or \nenforcement or amendment of a statute, it is hardly likely that Members \nof Congress would have standing to challenge actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Highly unlikely.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that the enforcement concerns \nabout the balanced budget amendment do not amount to a hill of beans. \nThe fear of the demon of judicial interference is exorcised by the \nreality of over a century of constitutional doctrines to prevent \nunelected courts from interfering with the power of the democratically \nelected branch of Government and to bestow Congress with the means to \nprotect its prerogatives.\n  I think that even though you can always say there are ambiguities in \nthe law, there always are. That does not negate the fact that this \nbalanced budget amendment does not need to be amended to take care of \nsomething that is the most highly unlikely set of occurrences that \ncould happen.\n  I will be happy to interchange with my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. On \nthis question of justiciability and standing, the Senator is, I \nbelieve, familiar with the fact that many States have balanced budget \namendments and there is a plethora of litigation in which State courts \nhave taken jurisdiction.\n  In New York, in the 1977 fiscal crisis where they had a loan of $250 \nmillion, the court declared that that was permissible; took \njurisdiction.\n  In the State of Georgia, a lease by development authority, the \nquestion whether that constituted indebtedness under that State's \nconstitution.\n  In Wisconsin, whether a lease-purchase agreement constituted \nindebtedness.\n  In 1981 in Illinois, the legislature closed the schools early in \npursuit of the balanced budget amendment of that State. The court took \njurisdiction and, by the way, they said it was permissible but they \ntook jurisdiction and made the decision.\n  In California, the employees' retirement system challenged the action \nof the State legislature which, in turn, passed fiscal emergency \nlegislation to suspend funding to the State employees' retirement \nsystem, and the court took jurisdiction in that case and was able to \norder. They do so all across the country.\n  In my State, the courts specifically have stated they have \njurisdiction. In the face of all of these State courts, in the face of \nJudge Bork, Attorney General Dellinger, in the face of Laurence Tribe \nof the Harvard Law Review and all of these others who say you probably \nwould have standing, jurisdiction, justiciability, how it can be said--\nand I ask my colleague--how it can be said that there is no standing \njusticiability or that this is a political question escapes me.\n  Does the Senator desire to respond to that, or may I make one other \npoint? Is he ready to respond to that? I see my colleague from Utah is \nnot here.\n  Mr. BROWN. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana may want to go \n [[Page S2700]] ahead and complete his points before we respond.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator from Utah also said the Congress would have \nthe power if there were courts who began to meddle in this, accepted \njurisdiction, that the Congress would then have the power, I guess by \ngetting 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, in order to limit that \njurisdiction of a case already started.\n  I just wonder at what point the Congress would feel constrained to \nact. Would it be after the district court had issued an injunction, \nafter the court of appeals had ordered taxes increased or after the \nSupreme Court had acted? Why do we not fix that in advance so the court \nwill not exercise this jurisdiction, will not exercise that power, \nexcept to the extent that the Congress specifically authorizes it? That \nis my question, and then I will yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nhas raised some concerns. My hope is that I can offer at least some \ncomments that will be helpful to a portion of his concerns.\n  The issue of whether or not this provides ``a plethora of \nlitigation''--I think those are the words that were stated--is a fair \nquestion to ask, and I think it is reasonable to bring it before the \nbody. I asked that question specifically of the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral when he came before the Judiciary Committee.\n  The point of the administration was that this could lead to a flood \nof litigation. I noted that a large number of our States, the vast \nmajority of our States have similar balanced budget amendments. The one \nin Colorado is, of course, very strict, much stricter than this. This \nis the softest form of a balanced budget amendment that I know of. I \nthink Americans that watch this debate will be shocked to find how weak \na version it is because it can be waived by simply 60 votes.\n  However, the allegation that this would lead to a large amount of \nlitigation already is a question that has been faced by this country \nbecause the vast majority of our States have constitutional amendments \nthat require a balanced budget, and they are much tougher than anything \nwe are talking about.\n  I asked the Assistant Attorney General to name for me the cases that \nhe was worried about, this flood of litigation. He could not name one \nsingle case. Mr. President, let me repeat that because the Attorney \nGeneral who had made that allegation was unable to name a single \nsolitary case. And when pressed on it, he came up with the name of \nseveral cases that, indeed, involved States but did not involve the \nbalanced budget amendment that those States had.\n  Now, what is the fact? Colorado has a balanced budget amendment. The \nlast litigation we had----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield on the question of what the \nAttorney General said?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Quoting from Mr. Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General \nDellinger's testimony on page 137 of the hearings, he stated as \nfollows:\n\n       There is as yet nothing in this amendment proposal that \n     would preclude the courts of getting involved in issues of \n     taxation. Recall Missouri v. Jenkins from 1990, where the \n     Supreme Court held that while a Federal district court had \n     abused its discretion in directly imposing a tax increase to \n     fund a school desegregation program, that the modifications \n     made in that case by the Court of Appeals satisfied equitable \n     and constitutional principles.\n       If we have an amendment that for the first time \n     constitutionalizes the taxing and spending process and \n     creates a constitutional mandate which the courts are sworn \n     on oath to uphold, there is simply no way that we can rule \n     out the possibility that tax increases or spending cuts would \n     be ordered by the judiciary.\n\n  The Senator asked what was the case Mr. Dellinger was concerned \nabout. That is it--taxing being ordered by the courts or spending cuts \nbeing ordered by the courts. That is page 137 of last year's hearing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to place in \nthe Record at this point Mr. Dellinger's testimony.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt From Hearing on Senate Joint Resolution 41--Balanced Budget \n                               Amendment\n\n       Mr. DELLINGER. Mr. Chairman, thank you.\n       Two hundred and seven years ago this summer, the framers of \n     the Constitution met in Philadelphia. Their goal, as one of \n     the founders put it, was to design a system of government \n     that would ensure the grandeur and importance of America \n     until time shall be no more.\n       The coming together of the American Colonies into a single \n     Nation was more difficult than we can easily now imagine. \n     John Adams wrote home from the Continental Congress in 1775 \n     to the remarkable Abigail Adams, and he spoke of 50 gentlemen \n     meeting together, all strangers, not acquainted with each \n     others' ideas, views, language, designs. We are, he said, \n     timid, skittish, jealous.\n       They came as representatives of legislative democracies \n     that had some independence from England and had engaged in \n     self-government, in many instances, for more than a century. \n     They took enormous risk to create, in that summer of 1787, \n     between the first day, May 25, and the last day, September \n     17, 1787, a system of government that has lasted longer and \n     served better as a foundation for free government than any \n     other constitution yet written.\n       It was the government designed to create a great republic, \n     the kind of republic that John Marshall could then imagine as \n     a young Chief Justice; where, from the St. Croix to the Gulf \n     of Mexico, revenue was to be collected and expended, armies \n     are to be marched and supported. To this end, Marshall wrote, \n     all the sword and the purse, all the external relations and \n     no inconsiderable portion of the industry of the Nation are \n     entrusted to this Government.\n       This Government, under this system of government, as you \n     know as the great historian of this body, the Senate, has \n     provided an extraordinary basis for the achievement of the \n     grandeur and importance of the American Nation.\n       I think we are considering today an amendment to that \n     document that poses great risk. For that amendment is \n     profoundly anticonstitutional, not unconstitutional--no \n     amendment ratified in due course could rightly be called \n     unconstitutional--but anti- constitutional in the \n     sense that it goes against the basic spirit, the basic \n     essence of some of the most profound aspects of the \n     Constitution.\n       The Constitution, as written by the framers, did not \n     constrain choices, It, rather, empowers the people to enact \n     choices, except in those few instances, such as the freedom \n     of speech and the press and of religion, that are ruled out \n     of bounds altogether. This\n      amendment is inconsistent with that goal, by seeking to \n       shackle government.It is a Constitution in which the \n     principle of majority rule is so fundamental, so essential, \n     that it literally goes without saying. There is no need even \n     to mention that decisions are made by majority rule. And yet, \n     here is an amendment that would, for the first time, allow 40 \n     percent to hold hostage a majority of the Government with \n     respect to a matter--the passage of a budget--that must be \n     done.\n       We have, and will hear in the judiciary subcommittee today \n     and yesterday, discussions to the fact that there are other \n     supermajority provisions of the Constitution--and so, there \n     are. But notice how different this proposal is. Each of the \n     other supermajority provisions of the Constitution--the \n     ratification of treaties, conviction of a President on \n     charges of impeachment, the override of a veto, the expulsion \n     of a Member or proposing an amendment to the Constitution--\n     each of those calls for a supermajority in circumstances in \n     which the default, the status quo, is perfectly acceptable \n     and can remain if no action is taken.\n       If we do not propose a constitutional amendment because \n     there is no supermajority, the Constitution we have remains \n     as it is. We can go without a treaty. We can decline to \n     impeach a President. We can decline to override the \n     President's veto. But we must pass a budget. There is no \n     underlying status quo of no budget that is acceptable. So \n     that, in this unusual event, we would distort and challenge \n     the basic notion of majority rule.\n       Some have noted that, indeed--and you would know this \n     better than I--such a provision could, in fact, worsen budget \n     deficits. I would certainly defer to your judgment, Mr. \n     Chairman, on this, but I could easily imagine circumstances \n     in which a majority and a minority leader thought it a lot \n     more difficult to assemble 50 votes for a stringent budget \n     vastly increasing taxes and cutting cherished programs than \n     it would be to outbid each other to assemble 60 votes, where, \n     if you achieve 60 votes through a bidding war, there is \n     simply no limit on how large the deficit may be under this \n     amendment.\n       So, you have this odd distortion between the votes \n     necessary to pass a budget and one which could work in quite \n     unexpected ways.\n       But those, Mr. Chairman, are just introductory remarks to \n     what I think is the central concern that would be appropriate \n     for the Department of Justice to represent to you today. And \n     that is the implications of this amendment for the basic \n     structure of our constitutional government and to the status \n     of our Constitution as positive law.\n       [[Page S2701]] Yesterday, one of the thoughtful supporters \n     of this amendment described it as a necessary, quote, \n     mechanism of discipline for our budget situations. And yet, \n     the very flaw of this proposal is that it has no mechanism. \n     And it is that absence of a mechanism of enforcement that \n     makes this amendment such a threat to our basic \n     constitutional values.\n       The central problem is that this proposed amendment \n     promises a balanced budget without providing any mechanism \n     for accomplishing that goal. It simply declares that outlays \n     shall not exceed expenditures, without ever explaining how \n     this desirable state of\n      affairs shall come about, and without specifying who among \n     our Government officials shall be empowered to ensure that \n     the amendment is not violated or, if violated, the Nation \n     is brought into compliance.\n       Some have said that Congress will feel duty bound to comply \n     with the requirements of this constitutional amendment. And I \n     agree that each Member of Congress would properly consider \n     himself or herself individually bound to comply with the \n     amendment. The difficulty is that the amendment does not \n     provide any mechanism by which those individual Members of \n     Congress can coordinate their separate constitutional \n     obligation to support a balanced budget.\n       Each Member of the Senate and House might conscientiously \n     set about to comply with the amendment. One Senator might \n     vote to cut military spending; another to reduce retirement \n     or other entitlement benefits; a third to raise taxes. Each \n     would have been faithful to his or her oath of office. But \n     each of the measures may fail to gain a majority support and, \n     therefore, the amendment would not be, and the requirements \n     of the amendment would not be, met.\n       Or, of course, Congress might simply, by 55 votes, pass an \n     amendment that does not, in fact, produce a situation in \n     which outlays do not exceed receipts.\n       What are we then left with? What would the senior advisors \n     to the President tell the President would be the case if this \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States was not \n     being complied with by the functioning and processes of \n     Government?\n       I think we would certainly expect a vast array of \n     litigation to ensure. One of the first matters to be \n     litigated would be whether the President was obligated or \n     entitled to make his own unilateral cuts in budget or \n     otherwise, unilaterally, to raise revenues. This would be a \n     very difficult question. I would imagine that different \n     courts would resolve the issue differently.\n       Some would say that the President alone would be in a \n     position simply to order a cut, even where the law required \n     otherwise, because now he had the higher obligation to ensure \n     that the Constitution was complied with.\n       Others would argue that it would be extraordinary to infer \n     from the silence of this amendment such a sweeping and \n     radical change in the allocation authority among the branches \n     of Government. And yet, the issue would be resolved by judges \n     and courts.\n       Surely the most alarming aspect of the amendment is that by \n     constitutionalizing the budget process, the amendment appears \n     to mandate an extraordinary expansion of judicial authority. \n     Both State and Federal judges may well be required to make \n     fundamental decisions about taxing and spending--issues that \n     they clearly lack the institutional capacity to resolve in \n     any remotely satisfactory manner.\n       One would hope that the judiciary would consider these \n     questions political and beyond their scope. This political \n     question doctrine, simply put, is the doctrine that is \n     designed to restrain the judiciary from inappropriate \n     interference in the business of the other branches of \n     Government.\n       On its face, that basic doctrine would appear to constrain \n     the court's review of a balanced budget amendment. And yet, \n     the most recent decisions of the Supreme Court suggest that \n     the court would be prepared to resolve questions that might \n     once have been considered political.\n       We have the example of United States v. Munoz-Flores from \n     1990, in which the court adjudicated a claim that an \n     assessment was unconstitutional because it failed to comply \n     with the provision that it originate in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       I would have thought before Munoz-Flores that the court \n     would decline to adjudicate and would accept the \n     authentication of Congress. And I would have been wrong.\n       In 1992, the court considered the congressional resolution \n     of how one goes about apportioning the last seat for the \n     House of Representatives, what formula to choose when \n     Congress decides which State gets that last 435th seat in \n     Congress. The losing State challenged--Montana--the \n     Department of Commerce. And I would have assumed that the \n     court would have considered this, too, a political question, \n     left for the final resolution of the Congress. And, again, I \n     was wrong in that assumption. Because the court did go to the \n     merits, did consider it judiciable, and did pass judgment on \n     this question.\n       So I think that however wise or unwise it may be for the \n     courts to be involved in these issues--and I tend to think it \n     is unwise--it is nonetheless the case that no one can provide \n     any assurances that once this amendment constitutionalizes \n     the budget process the court will not consider itself \n     obligated to resolve issues that arise under that amendment.\n       Let me mention, for example, one that I noted just last \n     evening where I could readily imagine a justiciable case \n     where the party has standing and a declaration invalidating a \n     major act of Congress, if this amendment were law today.\n       Section 4 of Senate Joint Resolution 41 provides that no \n     bill to increase revenue shall become law--no bill shall \n     become law if it increases revenue--unless approved by a \n     majority of the whole number of each House on a rollcall \n     vote. It is often the case that there are major pieces of \n     legislation, like the crime bill, that contain provisions \n     which a litigant might later argue, increase revenue, by \n     providing more effective enforcement mechanisms, by providing \n     forfeiture provisions.\n       A criminal defendant would surely have standing, prosecuted \n     or sentenced under omnibus crime legislation, to say that \n     this bill contains a provision which would increase revenues, \n     and, therefore, it falls under section 4 of this amendment \n     and is unconstitutional unless Congress had been alert to \n     ensure that its approval was by a majority of the whole \n     number of each House on a rollcall vote. Once you \n     constitutionalize an area you take the resolution of critical \n     questions, critical concerns, out of the hands of the elected \n     representatives of the people and leave them in the hands of \n     courts that now would be under a mandate to resolve these \n     issues.\n       There are others who might have standing. Taxpayers, to be \n     sure. I have never, myself, fully been reconciled to Flast v. \n     Cohen, but it remains the law. Many of the provisions of this \n     amendment appear to be an express or specific limitation on \n     the tax against\n      spending power which would generate standing in taxpayers to \n     litigate. Certainly, if the President took action to cut \n     benefits, if he, say, cut Social Security across the board \n     by 9 percent in order to comply with the amendment, a \n     beneficiary would challenge the President's authority to \n     do that, and that issue would wind up in litigation.\n       There is as yet nothing in this amendment proposal that \n     would preclude the courts of getting involved in issues of \n     taxation. Recall Missouri v. Jenkins from 1990, where the \n     Supreme Court held that while a Federal district court had \n     abused its discretion in directly imposing a tax increase to \n     fund a school desegregation program, that the modifications \n     made in that case by the Court of Appeals satisfied equitable \n     and constitutional principles. Those modifications included \n     leaving the details of the mandate to increase taxes to State \n     authorities, while nonetheless imposing a mandate that must \n     have been met.\n       If we have an amendment that for the first time \n     constitutionalizes the taxing and spending process and \n     creates a constitutional mandate which the courts are sworn \n     on oath to uphold, there is simply no way that we can rule \n     out the possibility that tax increases or spending cuts would \n     be ordered by the judiciary. And I think we would all agree \n     that that is a profound change in our constitutional system.\n       I believe it was in the 48th Federalist that Madison \n     assured those who were about to vote on whether to ratify or \n     reject the proposed Constitution, Madison assured them that \n     the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of \n     the people. That is a theme which is carried forward by \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy in his dissent in Missouri v. \n     Jenkins, where he writes of how jarring it is to our \n     constitutional system to have unelected life tenure judges \n     involved in the process of taxation. Justice Kennedy wrote, \n     ``It is not surprising that imposition of taxes by an \n     authority so insulated from public comment and control can \n     lead to deep feelings of frustration, powerlessness, and \n     anger on the part of taxpaying citizens.'' We would not, I \n     think--you would not want lightly to have put out a provision \n     that so radically restructured the fundamental nature of our \n     constitutional system in the face of such limited discussion \n     about how these enforcement mechanisms would work.\n       Chairman Byrd. Mr. Dellinger, what was the vote in that \n     case? The Supreme Court vote?\n       Mr. Dellinger. I believe it was five to four. But I have \n     not checked the vote. I believe it was five to four. I am \n     seeing one of your very helpful staff members nodding behind \n     you and assuring me. So it is a very close case, and I think \n     the constitutional proposition set forth in section 1 would \n     provide for many justices a more sound basis for being \n     engaged in taxing and spending, where it says total outlays \n     for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts. This is \n     no longer part of the Pledge of Allegiance or a Fourth of \n     July speech. We are talking about making this a part of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my friend for raising that point, and it proves \nprecisely the point that I want to make. That case was not based on a \nbalanced budget amendment. That case was based on the 14th amendment.\n  I might mention that the constitutional amendment before this body \ndoes not repeal the 14th amendment. The 14th amendment is in the \nConstitution. The cases are going to come up about the 14th amendment \nall the time. That was the whole point. The Assistant Attorney General \nhad brought this specter of floods of litigation and his prime example \nwas one \n [[Page S2702]] that dealt not with the balanced budget amendment but \ndealt with the 14th amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. He was saying that under the balanced budget amendment \nthey would have the authority, that nothing would prevent the same \nauthority exercised as in Missouri versus Jenkins.\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the point here is that the case he cited to \nexpress his concern was one that did not deal with the balanced budget \namendment, and there are many of them that exist across the country.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, but it dealt with the power of Federal courts to \norder taxation, which was what his concern was, which is what my \nconcern is, and my amendment would prevent that. And why not do that?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me suggest, the Senator's amendment deals not with the \n14th amendment. It deals with appeals to courts and deals with appeals \nto courts on this amendment.\n  Now, the question is clearly this: Is the passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment going to lead to a flood of litigation? When the \nAssistant Attorney General was asked to name a case, one case where you \nhave had appeals to the courts and litigation in the courts about the \nnumerous balanced budget amendments around the country, he was unable \nto name a single solitary case.\n  Now, Mr. President, those cases do exist. Colorado has had a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget in its constitution for \nover 100 years. We have had litigation on it. And the last litigation \nin Colorado on our balanced budget amendment was in 1933. It dealt with \na peripheral case.\n  Now, this flood of litigation that the Assistant Attorney General is \nforecasting has not reared its head in the State of Colorado for over a \nhalf century, not a single case in over a half century. And the one \nthat came up literally 60 years ago was one that did not deal directly \nwith the issue of the balanced budget. It dealt with a peripheral \nissue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Perhaps my friend did not hear the cases which I cited \nfrom around the country where courts have gotten involved in this. \nLooking to my own State of Louisiana, for example, in 1987, the court \nof appeals case, just to quote briefly, says:\n\n       Defendants contend that there exists no justiciable issues \n     in this case because the courts should not ``step in and \n     substitute their judgment for that of the legislature and \n     executive branches'' in the budget process. We disagree. The \n     determination of whether the legislature has acted within \n     rather than outside its constitutional authority must rest \n     with the judicial branch of government.\n\n  That is from Bruno v. Edwards, 517 So. 2d 818, a 1987 case. It is all \nover the country that this is done. I do not know what they have done \nin Colorado. They have done it in my State. They have done it in New \nYork. They have done it in Georgia. They have done it in Wisconsin, \nCalifornia. All across the country they have taken balanced budget \namendments, and there has been standing found and the courts have found \nthose issues to be justiciable and indeed in a 14th-amendment case, \nMissouri versus Jenkins they ordered up taxes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me reclaim my time, if I could.\n  Mr. President, the statement that I made was not that it is \nimpossible that you would ever have litigation. That certainly has \nnever been my position, and it is not now. And if the Senator's point \nis that it is possible that you could have litigation over this \nquestion, I would certainly indicate to him I think he is right. It is \npossible you could have litigation come up.\n  What we are dealing with here, though, is a question of whether or \nnot this is going to engender a flood of litigation, a plethora of \nlitigation, as has been indicated. That simply is not an accurate \nstatement if you look at what has happened in the States of our \ncountry. It is simply inaccurate, and the proof--I have given proof in \nmy State. We have not had a case in 60 years, and the one we did have \n60 years ago dealt with a side issue.\n  Now, the Missouri versus Jenkins case that was referred to was a \nState action, and it dealt with the 14th amendment. It was not a \nbalanced budget amendment case. So you can raise all sorts of specters, \nbut let me suggest a test for all of these. Many Members honestly and \nsincerely think it is a mistake to have a limitation on spending. That \nis a difference between men and women of good spirit. While I am one \nwho thinks the record shows that this country is not going to survive \nwithout a change in the way we appropriate money, while I am one who \nbelieves that some control on spending is essential to this Nation \nproviding leadership in a world economy in the next century, I \nrecognize that people of good spirit and good intentions may not share \nthat view.\n  But when the question is put, if this amendment is passed will people \nwho currently oppose the amendment to the Constitution then vote in \nfavor of the constitutional amendment, my understanding is that they \nwill not. I think you have to ask yourself, is this amendment put \nforward to improve the constitutional amendment to balance the budget? \nI believe that is the intent of the Senator from Louisiana. It is a \nsincere effort to deal with a problem of excessive court involvement. I \nknow he is sincere about that. I think the purpose of his amendment is, \nindeed, to improve this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield briefly on that point?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will in just a moment.\n  I think it is important to note that there does not appear to be \nanyone who is coming forward and saying look, if this amendment is \nadopted, we are willing to sign on and agree with you; limitations are \nimportant.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I just want to point out, right before \nthis debate started there were, I believe, two Members who are \nundecided, on our side, who said in my presence right here that this \namendment may determine how they vote. They will have to speak for \nthemselves.\n  I will tell my colleague privately who they were. I do not think I \nshould use their names. They can speak for themselves. My question is, \nare there those on your side of the aisle whose votes you lose by \nmaking clear the jurisdiction of the court? My guess is you do not, \nbecause this is almost identical to the Danforth amendment which was \npassed in the last Congress without objection.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is a fair and appropriate question. I suspect I have \na responsibility to check on that.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana would be \nwilling to respond to a question of mine?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. BROWN. I guess the question that occurs to me is, would it be the \nSenator's intent, if this constitutional amendment is passed and if \nCongress refuses to abide by that constitutional amendment, to preclude \nany enforcement of it through the courts?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. As a matter of fact, the amendment very \nspecifically allows the Congress to implement the--to authorize \njudicial relief. But only to the extent that Congress specifically \nauthorizes it.\n  As I mentioned, the Congress may well want to, for example, say the \ncourt shall have declaratory relief; may be able to cut spending but \nnot raise taxes; or you may want to have direct jurisdiction in the \nSupreme Court--original jurisdiction there, so as to expedite the \nhearings. There are all kinds of things we may want to do that would \nhelp clear up, for example, what happens in the bond market while these \ncases are moving through ever so slowly from all around the country. We \nought to be able to deal with that in congressional legislation. I not \nonly do not preclude that, I specifically authorize it in this \namendment.\n  The difference between that and the way we are now is it is unclear \nwhether or not the courts have that inherent authority. If the Congress \ndoes not act, then it is my belief, along with Laurence Tribe and \nRobert Bork and Professor Dellinger, et cetera, that they would \nprobably have that jurisdiction. I say: Make it clear.\n  Mr. BROWN. At least my understanding is that Congress does have the \nability to deal with that now.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Congress does have the ability under, I believe it \nis section 5--section 6, to do that. That is clear.\n  However, upon failure to act by the Congress, then the courts would \nprobably have this jurisdiction anyway. The difference between section \n6 of the amendment as presently stated and \n [[Page S2703]] under my amendment, my amendment says that unless \nCongress specifically acts, there is no jurisdiction in the court. \nWhereas section 6 says the Congress may act, but in the meantime it is \nunclear what the authority of the courts is.\n  Mr. BROWN. I wonder if the Senator has thought about spelling out in \nhis amendment the kinds of appeals that he would have in mind? I think \npart of the concern as we look at the amendment is the concern that \nthis could well end up sabotaging the balanced budget amendment, in \nthat if the Senator spelled out the kinds of appeals he had in mind, it \nmight go a long way toward generating support on it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What Senator Hatch has stated is that the court would \nhave no jurisdiction. He says that is clear. I think it is demonstrably \nunclear.\n  I think the question of how you spell out the jurisdiction and \nremedies ought really to take up some serious time of the Judiciary \nCommittee: Bring in the legal experts, talk about whether you want to \nlimit it to injunctive relief, whether you want to limit the power to \nenact taxes. All of those are very close and difficult legal questions \nthat I think take a lot of thought, which are beyond my ability to \nspell out.\n  I think you can spell out the broad constitutional terms right here. \nThe court shall or shall not have power. But we would preserve that \npower of the Congress to do that. The real question is: Should the \ncourt have the power to order taxes, provide injunctive relief, make \ndecisions, declaratory judgments, if the Congress does not specifically \nauthorize it?\n  I believe the answer to that is no. And that is why this amendment \nclears that up and makes it unambiguous.\n  Mr. BROWN. I might say, Mr. President, at least my understanding, and \nthe Senator may want to correct me if he feels I have misphrased it, my \nunderstanding is Senator Hatch's view is that the courts could not \ninterfere with the budgetary process but that Senator Hatch does feel \nthe courts should be able to give some limited relief.\n  I think that may be a different way of describing the Senator's \nposition. Obviously, Senator Hatch is quite able to describe his own \nposition.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My description of Senator Hatch's position is that he \nwould like to have it both ways to satisfy those who think there ought \nto be court relief and to satisfy those who think there should not be \ncourt relief, because he has some of those voting for the amendment. I \nunderstand the position of my friend, Senator Hatch, which is he wants \nto pass the amendment, and that is fine.\n  I have called into question the political calculus that says you lose \nvotes by passing this amendment. I think you endanger, politically, \nthis amendment by not clearing up this fundamental question.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say I am shocked to hear that any Member of the \nSenate would want to have it both ways. I cannot imagine--it seems \nunprecedented--that any august Member of this body would take that \nposition.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One wants it this way and one wants it that way. You \ncan sort of be all things to all people by saying: Well, it is clearly \na settled question there is no standing to sue, so therefore the court \nwill not get involved. But, on the other hand, there may be some cases \nthat will need to come to the court, where the court will need to order \nsome relief.\n  The classic, to me, was Attorney General Barr, who said--this is \nreally rich. First of all, he said:\n\n       I do believe the Congress should consider including \n     language in the amendment that would expressly limit judicial \n     review to actions for declaratory judgment.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       If, however, such a position would prove to be politically \n     unpopular, I believe, for the reasons detailed in my written \n     statement, that Congress can safely pass the amendment in its \n     current form without undue concern that the courts will \n     entertain large numbers of suits challenging Congress' action \n     on the amendment or that, even if the courts do entertain \n     some suits, they will order intrusive injunctive remedies.\n\n  I mean, he says well, they are probably not going to do it. If they \ndo, there will not be many. And even if they do a few, they will not \norder intrusive injunctive relief.\n  What is intrusive? I would think Missouri versus Jenkins--if they got \ntheir foot in the door, and Solicitor General Barr says they might have \nsome suits, having their foot in the door it does not take many orders \nof the Supreme Court increasing taxes to be pretty intrusive to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I, of course, am \nshocked that any Member would try and have it both ways as we go \nforward.\n  But let me suggest----\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the Senator is expressing his shock, I wonder if he \nwill yield for additional comment?\n  Mr. BROWN. No, I will not yield. Let me finish my statement, and then \nI will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  It is quite clear there is a distinction between remedies that the \ncourts can give and their ability to bring relief. That is well \nestablished. I do not think anyone questions it. The courts cannot \ninterfere with the budgetary process because it is a political \nquestion. I think that is well established. It would violate the \nseparation of powers. Those are quite clear. The real question I think \nyou get down to with this is do you want to find a way to wiggle out \nfrom even the very, very modest levels of discipline that this \nconstitutional amendment would bring?\n  My belief is that it is quite clear that the courts cannot get \ninvolved with a political question, that the talk about a 14th \namendment case as applying here when it has not found that kind of \naction with regard to any of the balanced budget amendments that appear \nin any of the States is to raise a red herring. I do not mean it is not \nbrought up in good faith. I share the view that the Missouri versus \nJenkins case was not decided correctly. But it does not apply to the \nbalanced budget amendments. It dealt with the 14th amendment.\n  Let me just say one other thing. Any American that honestly believes \nthat we can continue on the way we have been I think is kidding \nthemselves. Any American that can look at the last quarter-century in \nwhich we have not balanced the budget one single solitary time and \nthink that we are going to solve this without changing the system is \nkidding themselves. Whether Democrat, Republican, liberal or \nconservative, you are driving this train off a cliff. You are taking \nthe future of this Nation, the future of our children and running it \noff a cliff.\n  There may be Members who come to this floor and say, look. We can \nsolve this thing. Just let us continue on the way we are, and say it \nsincerely. But I do not think it is true. I do not think you can look \nat what has happened and decide in any other spectrum that we have a \ntrain wreck ready to happen, that we are unable to help ourselves, that \nwe have to have some discipline.\n  The question I think that is fairly asked is, is this the right \nremedy? The American people ought to look at the States that have \nconstitutional amendments that require a balanced budget. In Colorado \nwe have had the constitutional mandate to balance the budget for over \n100 years. Of those over 100 years it has been balanced every single \nyear. It has been balanced in good years and it has been balanced in \nbad years. It has been balanced when we have had a Republican \nadministration and when we have had a Democratic administration. It has \nbeen balanced when we have had a Democratic legislature, and it has \nbeen balanced when we have had a Republican legislature, and it has \nbeen balanced because they had to do it. If you had not required them \nto do it, I guarantee it would not have gotten done.\n  In the last 25 years, we have not had a single, solitary year, not \none, where you have had a balanced budget. I do not think there is \nanybody in this Chamber--or at least not very many--who would come to \nthe floor and say we have done a good job setting priorities. If \nanybody is comfortable with a program to subsidize tobacco at the same \ntime you have a program to urge people not to use it, I want them to \ncome forth and tell me about it. That is ludicrous. Whether you are \nfrom a tobacco State or not, to subsidize a crop that you turn around \nand urge people not to use and bill the taxpayers for both ends of it \nis stupid. That is what we are doing.\n  We have a foreign assistance program that buys weapons for one \ncountry to \n [[Page S2704]] counter the weapons we bought for another country which \nwere given to counter the weapons we bought for the other country to \nbegin with. That is nuts. We have refused to set priorities. That is \njust plain ludicrous.\n  We have a farm program that results in people growing crops on land \nthat are better suited to other crops. Does that make any sense at all? \nWe literally grow crops on ground that would never be used for that \npurposes if you did not have a program like that. That is the silliest \nthing I ever heard of. And we continue to do it.\n  If you think those examples are out of place, look at the rest of the \nway we spend our money. Does anybody believe that the Tea Tasting Board \nis a good idea? The National Jute Association or the International Jute \nAssociation? There is not one of these, there is not 10 of these, there \nis not 1,000 of these. There are thousands and thousands and thousands, \nand the reason they exist is we have not set priorities.\n  The facts are these: We have not balanced the budget once in 25 \nyears. We have not balanced it when we have had a recession and we have \nnot balanced it when we have had a boom.\n  The President who says we can solve this without a balanced budget \namendment sent us a budget the other day. The estimates I believe are \ninaccurate. But even if you accept the estimates, which incidentally \ninclude a suggestion that we are not going to have a recession in the \nnext 5 years--and, if anybody wants to make a bet on that one, I would \nbe glad to take their money--even with assumptions that you are not \ngoing to have a recession again, even with the assumptions that the \nrate of inflation is going to have less of an impact on increasing \nspending than it will on raising revenues. Let me be specific about \nthat.\n  They assume a rate of inflation that will increase revenue at a \nhigher rate than you will increase the cost of programs. One level of \ninflation, and they assume that you are going to have a higher level of \ninflation for increasing revenue than you will have for increasing \nprograms. It would be laughable if it were not so serious. Even with \nassumptions that by anybody's definition are creative, even with \nassumptions that say we are not going to have any new spending \nprograms--and we have not had a Congress when you did not have new \nspending programs that I can recall--even with wild assumptions, even \nwith no new programs, even with no emergencies, even with no waivers \nfor the budget, the deficit continues on for a level of a couple \nhundred billion dollars. And CBO says that it is going to go up to \nabove $400 billion by 10 years out.\n  That is from the person who says we can solve this legislatively. It \nis nonsense. It is nonsense. To say no to a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution is to say no to our future, to gut this \nconstitutional amendment from ever being able to be enforced is a \ntravesty in this Member's view.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. If we are going to deal with this issue, we need an \nalternative. I have to tell you I think this balanced budget amendment \nthat is before this body is far too weak. Colorado says you have to \nhave a balanced budget. And we balanced it. This says you have to have \na balanced budget unless 60 percent of Members vote to waive it. It is \nthe softest, weakest, most ineffective balanced budget amendment I have \nseen. There may be others in the States that are weaker than this. But \nI do not know about them.\n  This very, very, very modest form of discipline apparently is too \nmuch for people who believe that the future of our country is on \nuncontrolled spending. But let me tell you, Mr. President. This issue \nis a lot more important than Colorado or Louisiana or Michigan. This \nissue goes to the very heart of the future of this Nation and the \nfuture of the men and women who have their children and their \ngrandchildren who are going to be raised in this country.\n  This issue is a question of whether or not we are able to control the \nwaste that has given us the biggest national deficit in the history of \nthis country or the history of any country in the history of the world.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me finish my statement, if I could, because it seems \nto me we are overlooking the real problem. The real problem here is an \nappetite by this Congress for uncontrolled spending. The real problem \nhere is an unwillingness to live by any limitation.\n  Mr. President, I want to relate a fact to the Members in this body, \nbecause I think every one of them knows it and shares it. I came to \nCongress in 1981. We passed a budget, and the budget was not balanced. \nBut what it said is the next year out it is going to be balanced. We \nare not balanced this year. But give us another year, and we will have \nit balanced. We had a plan to get there. We had limitations on \nspending, and projected tax revenue. What happened? What happened was \nthis: Congress appropriated more money than they had allowed for in \ntheir own budget. They waived their own Budget Act. The fact was our \nestimates were overblown, and we exceeded our own spending limits. You \nwould say, OK. That is one year out of one. That is not too bad. But \nwhat happened the next year? The next year we adopted a budget with the \nphony estimates in it. And that is exactly what they were. They were \nphony, and they were Reagan estimates, and I called them phony at the \ntime. We adopted a budget with phony estimates in it, and Congress \nexceeded its own spending budget again. And everybody said next year. \nThe next year we adopted a budget, and it said after a couple or 3 \nyears we are going to get down to a balanced budget. It had phony \nestimates in it, and Congress exceeded the amount that they allowed \nthemselves to spend.\n  Mr. President, that has happened every single, solitary year. It \nhappened in 1981, it happened in 1982, and it happened in 1983 and \n1984, it happened in 1985, 1986, and 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, \n1992, 1993, and 1994. Does anyone honestly believe it is not going to \nhappen again and again and again? If you do not believe it look at the \nPresident's budget. Look at the assumptions that are in the President's \nbudget. Come to this floor and honestly tell me you think we are on the \nright path.\n  The simple facts are these: We are hoodwinking America. We have \npassed budgets every time in the last 15 years, and every time those \nbudgets were not realistic, and every time those budgets were not \nfollowed and they are not going to be followed.\n  We are debating an amendment that says we are going to eliminate the \nCourt's ability to have any discipline here. It does not surprise me \nthat this Congress does not want to have discipline over spending. But \nif anybody cares about the future of their kids and grandkids and what \nthis country stands for, then they had better figure out a way to bring \ndiscipline to this place and figure out a way to have accurate \nestimates, better figure out a way to have us change our ways, because \nthe reality is that this is shameful. The reality is that we have taken \nthe future of the strongest, greatest Nation on the face of the Earth \nand we have thrown it in the trash because people did not have the \ncourage and the willingness to stand up and eliminate wasteful spending \nand set priorities.\n  I do not know how many people watch Presidential trips, but I can \ntell you it happens both in Democratic and Republican administrations. \nYou have so many people that go with the President on trips, and it is \nshameful. Anyone who looks at the way Congress spends its money has to \nbe shocked. Do you really need elevator operators on automatic \nelevators? Are Members really unable to push the buttons themselves? Do \nyou really need a staff that is nine times bigger than any other \ncountry in the world has for its deliberative body? Incidentally, that \nis what our staff is, said the Congressional Research Service the last \ntime they did a study on it. Does anybody believe we need 1,100 police \nofficers on Capitol Hill? I mean, that is two, 2\\1/2\\ for every Member \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, this Congress is out of control. We desperately need \ncontrols. We desperately need discipline. To adopt an amendment that \neliminates our ability to have this measure enforced, I think, turns a \nblind eye to the problem the American people have. I do not know \nwhether this constitutional amendment is going to pass, but I will tell \nyou one thing, the American people are not going to watch their future \nthrown down the drain.\n   [[Page S2705]] This is a lot more important than Democrats or \nRepublicans, a lot more important than party. It deals with the future \nof our country and of our children. I do not think anybody who believes \nyou can continue on with the kind of abuse we have had for this system \nis looking at the world right. I have listened to the debate on the \nfloor. I hear Members come to the floor say, goodness, the problem is \nnot with Congress. The Congress' budgets have been less than what the \nPresident has asked for. That is right, but it is not accurate. The \ntruth is, yes, the budgets Congress has passed have not been as large \nas what the Executive--sometimes--has asked for, but left unsaid in \nthat is the fact that Congress has appropriated more than either they \nbudgeted or what the President asked for in budgeting.\n  To say that and describe the problem in that way simply misleads \npeople. Congress has not been responsible when it has come to our \nbudget. Yes, we have adopted budgets that look good at the time, but we \ndid it with phony estimates and we turned around and ignored them.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the point of all of this--and then I will yield--\nis simply this: If we are looking for an answer to this problem that \navoids discipline, that avoids controls, that avoids limits, we are \ngoing to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My colleague made a powerful speech--and I really mean \nthat--for a balanced budget. But I do not understand him to be saying \nthat the court ought to be the one to order a balanced budget, to order \na tax increase, or to order spending cuts; am I correct in that?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, my belief is that political questions will not come \nout of the jurisdiction of the court. It seems to me there is an area \nfor court jurisdiction here--enforcement.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But is the Senator familiar with the fact that, in \n1982, two former attorneys general, Senators Gorton and Rudman, offered \nan amendment of the same import of my amendment today, and that \nalthough it was defeated, 12 Republicans who are still serving in the \nSenate voted for the amendment, including Senators Chafee, Cohen, Dole, \nGorton, Hatfield, Kassebaum, Lugar, Murkowski, Pressler, Roth, Specter, \nand Stevens--that list includes some of the best lawyers in the \nSenate--and the point is, on this question of whether the courts ought \nto have jurisdiction--I think my friend would agree with me--is one \nthat really merits some very serious thought; would the Senator not \nthink?\n  Mr. BROWN. I certainly agree. In terms of the other Members the \ndistinguished Senator mentioned, I would leave it to them to defend \ntheir votes. I have enough trouble defending my own.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Has the Senator voted on this question before?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be glad to check the record and let the Senator \nknow.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would not think the Senator made the mistake of \nvoting against this kind of amendment before. I do not believe he has, \nbecause it was passed in the last Congress, without objection. The \nDanforth amendment was passed in the last Congress, without objection. \nIt truly has been a bipartisan amendment, where Senators on both sides \nhave seen the real need to limit the intrusiveness of the courts. The \npower of the courts, once granted, can extend to raising taxes, as well \nas cutting budgets, and they are not elected. They do not represent the \npeople and they should not be able to do it, except to the extent that \nwe in the Congress give them the power to do it.\n  I hope the Senator will come to my point of view. That has nothing to \ndo with whether you are for this balanced budget amendment or not--just \nas those Republican Senators who voted in 1982 for the Rudman-Gorton \namendment were supporters of the balanced budget amendment but wanted \nto limit the intrusive powers of the courts to get involved in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me suggest to my friend that while 1982 was not a long \ntime ago, it was before the Lujan case, which occurred in 1992 and \nwhich, obviously, affects thinking in this area. Clearly, these Members \nwill be able to speak for themselves and defend it as they wish. We \nhave other requests for time, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Our time is limited. I will yield the floor, and I know \nthe Senator will be recognized in due course by the Chair.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Colorado will respond to some \nquestions that I have of him on my time now. One of the things which \nthe Senator from Colorado epitomizes is honesty and \nstraightforwardness, and he, with great feeling, I think, expressed the \nview of all of the Members of this body, which is that we should not \nkid ourselves, that we ought to be honest. Honesty is something which \nhe has reflected throughout his career, and I admire him for what he \nsays, what he believes, what he feels and what he represents.\n  The Senator has made some statements about the balanced budget \namendment and how it is, in some respects, quite weak and not self-\nenforcing which, frankly, I happen to share, but that is not the \npurpose of my question. The purpose of my question goes to the Johnston \namendment and whether or not we should be honest as to whether or not \nthe courts are going to be able to enforce the balanced budget \namendment in the absence of legislation, pursuant to section 6.\n  The Johnston amendment makes it very clear that we are able to \nauthorize the court, if we adopt enforcement and implementation \nlegislation, pursuant to section 6, to do whatever we authorize that \ncourt to do. But in the absence of implementation legislation, setting \nforth the authority of the court, the question is, honestly, what is \nthe intention of this amendment? There is ambiguity, and if we are \nlooking for honesty--and I believe we all are--we should clarify that \nissue. There is no reason to write a constitutional amendment which is \nambiguous at the heart of the amendment which is: How is it going to be \nenforced? That is the heart of it. We can make all of the great \nstatements we want about balancing the budget, and we have during the \nearly 1980's.\n  But the key to a constitutional amendment is how it is going to be \nenforced. The key to this constitutional amendment, as has been said \nover and over again by the sponsors, to section 6 which is the \nimplementing legislation, implementing legislation which would be \nrequired of a future Congress.\n  I have problems with laying this on the doorstep of a future \nCongress, because I think we ought to adopt implementing legislation. I \ndo not think we ought to kick this can down the road up to 7 years. But \nthat is a different speech. That goes to the question of just how \neffective this is as a budget balancing tool.\n  My question of my friend from Colorado goes to the intent of the \nsponsors of this amendment as to court enforcement, and I have two \nquestions. First, is it the intent, is it his understanding of the \nintent, that Members of Congress would have standing to file suit to \nenforce this constitutional amendment?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, the Senator is asking for a legal interpretation. I \nwould be glad to supply that and I will supply it for both the Senator \nand for the Record.\n  Let me say I think it is worthwhile noting here that none of the \namendments to the Constitution--and, as you know, we have a number--\nhave included the language as suggested by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana. What is being suggested is different from what we have \ndone with any other constitutional amendment.\n  Second, we did have a proposal last year, I understand, that did \nlimit appeals to declaratory judgments. That is the first time I am \naware of--the distinguished Senators may wish to correct me--it is the \nfirst time I am aware of that you have had that added to a proposed \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Finally, let me suggest, I think it is section 2 of this amendment \nthat deals with the question of whether or not those questions are left \nopen or vague or unanswered. At least I think a fair \n [[Page S2706]] reading of that section indicates that there is real \nguidance within the amendment itself.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Specifically in section 2, what is the Senator referring \nto?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me get that section for you.\n  Section 2 reads as follows:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by rollcall vote.\n\n  That, at least as I read the constitutional amendment, is where the \nreal discipline of this matter is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My friend from Colorado points to something which has also \nbeen pointed to by other sponsors of this legislation, which is section \n2. But is it not true that section 2, in terms of that particular type \nof debt limit, requires Congress to act?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So that even section 2 depends upon implementation by \nCongress of a limit on the publicly held debt; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the value of this, I say to my friend, is that \nwhile you are looking for a device that controls this and avoids ways \nfor people to wiggle out of it, by focusing on what people borrow, we \nthink that may be the single most effective enforcement device there \ncan be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But my friend from Colorado is not responding to my \nquestion, which is: Is it not true that there is no current debt limit, \nas defined in section 2, which is a debt limit on the publicly held \ndebt and, in order to establish such a debt limit, legislation would \nhave to be passed?\n  So again, it depends on a future Congress to establish a limit on the \nso-called publicly held debt, a limit which has not heretofore been \nestablished by statute; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Senator makes a valid point. There is no \nquestion that future Congresses obviously have to be involved in this \ndecision, whether it is the discipline or whether it is the definition.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The discipline which my friend refers to again depends on \nfuture Congress acting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Attorney General to me \nstating exactly that be now printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcoll vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact this Office if we can be \n     of assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Anthony,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because over and over again we have heard that section 2 \nis the discipline. In fact, section 2 is only operative if a future \nCongress establishes something called a limit on publicly held debt--\npublicly held debt.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would beg to differ with my friend. I think the language \nof section 2 is quite clear, not vague. ``The limit on the debt of the \nUnited States held by the public shall not be increased unless three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \nan increase by rollcall vote.'' Obviously, it involves the Congress in \nseveral extents. One, of course, is the waiver should they vote---\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could interrupt my friend again. That is not the \npoint I am making. Any increase in that debt would have to be voted by \n60 percent of the Senate. That is clear in the language. But the \nestablishment of the limit itself would have to be, in the first \ninstance, created by the Congress, because there is no such limit at \nthe moment. Would the Senator from Colorado agree with that?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Senator is right to point out that defining \nwhat the terms ``debt of the United States held by the public'' is \nindeed something that requires it.\n  But I would point out---\n  Mr. LEVIN. It requires Congress to act; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes. Indeed, I think the Senator is correct. But I would \npoint out on that that if that is the Senator's concern, let me suggest \nI think the words of that section are very clear. I do not mean to \nsuggest to the Senator that creative minds that abound in this Congress \nand our courts could not find a way to misinterpret that. But I suspect \nthat even the most creative minds would be pressed to find that \nlanguage vague or unreasonable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it would be quite simple, actually, to have an \nargument as to what is meant by that term.\n  Now to get back to my question. Is it the intent of the Senator from \nColorado that a Member of Congress would have standing to file suits to \nenforce this constitutional provision?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is an appropriate legal question. I would be glad to \nsupply the Senator a legal memo to that effect, and I would be glad to \nput it in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I will ask a second question. I think these \nare critical questions and I think we should get answers to them from \nthe sponsors.\n  Is it the intent of the Senator from Colorado that a court could \ninvalidate an individual appropriation or a tax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me speak in reference to section 2. It seems to me, at \nleast in regard to section 2, the device here that I think is so \nhelpful, at least I like it very much, is that it limits Congress' \nability to continue to borrow money in that regard and that indeed does \nhave an impact on one's ability to fund new programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Michigan \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana \nwould yield me 5 additional minutes?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I so yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question to the Senator from Colorado is: Is it the \nintention under this amendment that courts could invalidate the \nindividual appropriations or tax acts? The Senator from Colorado \nrepeatedly said that it is not the intention of the Congress, it is not \nthe intention of this balanced budget amendment to have courts \ninterfering with the budgetary process. That is what the Senator from \nColorado has represented. It is not the intention of this amendment to \nhave courts interfere in the budgetary process?\n  My question is: Is it the intention of the sponsors or of the Senator \nfrom Colorado that a court could invalidate an individual \nappropriations or a tax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator wish me to repeat the question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Would you please?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention of the sponsors or the Senator from \nColorado that a court could invalidate an individual appropriations or \ntax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. It strikes me that the beauty of section 2 is that it \nplaces the limit on the amount we can borrow, which places then back in \nthe hands of Congress the discretion as to what we fund and the limit \ndiscipline it places on us is our limit to add to the debt. So at least \nmy impression would be Congress would retain the ability to make a \ndecision as to where their limited funds would be allocated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me ask my friend from Illinois, because I do not think \nthat is responsive to the question.\n  The Senator from Illinois is on the floor. Is it the intention of the \nsponsors of this amendment that the court, without further authority \nunder section 6, would have the power to invalidate an individual \nappropriation or a tax act?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n   [[Page S2707]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response, my instinct is that unless \nthere was a blatant violation of the intent of this amendment, the \ncourts would not get involved. We are not dealing with something like \nthe 14th amendment where it is somewhat amorphous.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The words ``blatant violation'' are all that have to be \nalleged in a suit brought in a court to then allow the invalidation of \nan appropriation or tax act.\n  Is that what the Senator from Illinois is saying?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the answer is we can imagine all kinds of \nscenarios. But the reality is that we want to handle this ourselves. We \ndo not want the courts to get involved. If some future Congress were \njust to blatantly say, ``We will ignore the Constitution,'' then the \ncourts might get involved.\n  The courts have only been involved in a tax matter in the Jenkins \ncase in Kansas City where we have a different constitutional principle \ninvolved.\n  In this amendment we are not talking about very precise things, but \nabout a self-enforcing mechanism.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since we are on my time, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to \ncomment.\n  Let me tell Members what the reason is that I am pressing folks on \nthis. The key sponsor of this legislation in the House, Representative \nSchaefer of Colorado, who is the lead sponsor of Schaefer-Stenholm, had \nthe language that we are debating now. He said the following: ``A \nMember of Congress or an appropriate administration official probably \nwould have standing to file suit challenging legislation that subverted \nthe amendment.''\n  I want to read all three of these comments of Representative Schaefer \nand contrast this to the assurances that the Senator from Utah, I think \nin good conscience, gave as to his intention that there is no standing \nto sue on the part of Members of Congress, that the courts will not be \nable to intervene. And yet the sponsor on the House side states a very, \nvery different intent, which is the reason we should adopt the Johnston \namendment, because there is not only ambiguity among law professors, \nthere are differences between sponsors on this side and sponsors on the \nHouse side.\n  The second statement of Representative Schaefer: ``The courts * * * \ncould invalidate an individual appropriation or tax act.'' Think about \nthat. Here we are told there is no intention for courts to be involved \nin the budgetary process. The principal sponsor on the House side says \nunder this amendment a court could invalidate an individual \nappropriation or tax act. If that is not meddling in the budgetary \nprocess, I do not know what it is.\n  Finally--I think my time is run out. I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the statements of \nRepresentative Schaefer, along with the accompanying letters, be \ninserted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: Enclosed is a copy of the \n     proposed Constitutional Amendment relative to the balanced \n     budget. My question is the following:\n       The Committee Report states (p. 8) that the amendment is \n     ``self-enforcing'' because of Section 2, which requires a \n     three-fifths vote to increase ``[t]he limit on the debt of \n     the United States held by the public.'' Is Section 2 self-\n     enforcing, or must Congress act pursuant to Section 6 to \n     adopt enforcement and implementation legislation for this \n     provision to be legally enforceable?\n       I would appreciate your very prompt reply, given the fact \n     that we are debating this amendment at the current time.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcall vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact this Office if we can be \n     of assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Anthony,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Statements of Representative Dan Schaefer, Lead Sponsor of the \n        Schaefer-Stenholm Substitute to House Joint Resolution 1\n\n       A member of Congress or an appropriate Administration \n     official probably would have standing to file suit \n     challenging legislation that subverted the amendment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The courts could make only a limited range of decisions on \n     a limited number of issues. They could invalidate an \n     individual appropriation or tax Act. They could rule as to \n     whether a given Act of Congress or action by the Executive \n     violated the requirements of this amendment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       . . . no role for the courts is foreseen beyond that of \n     making a determination as to whether an Act of Congress . . . \n     is unconstitutional and a court order not to execute such \n     Act. . . .\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana which \nwould make it clear that the balanced budget amendment cannot be used \nto turn over to the judicial system the responsibilities of managing \nthe fiscal obligations and priorities of the United States.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana would make clear we do \nnot intend that unelected judges would assume the power to set tax \nrates or impound Social Security checks of elderly citizens in order to \ncomply with the constitutional mandate that is created through the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is probably no more significant amendment that \nwill be offered during this entire debate on the balanced budget \namendment. It goes to the very heart and structure of our system of \ngovernment which we established over two centuries ago.\n  Unless the Johnston amendment is adopted, the constitutional \namendment we are debating could be construed to authorize Federal and \nState courts to intervene into the most political decisions now made by \nelected officials, including decisions about levying taxes and spending \nthe revenues raised on national priorities that are established through \nour democratic process.\n  Instead, Mr. President, individuals appointed, not elected, to \nlifetime judicial seats could become intimately involved in these \nmatters. The independent judiciary, of course, is as important to our \nsystem as any other element, one of the most important. We do intend \nthat our judges be free from partisan pressures. We intend that they \nmake decisions based upon the law, not upon opinion polls or election \nreturns.\n  That structure is also based on something else, Mr. President. It is \nbased upon the assumption that those courts with unelected leadership \nwill not be given the responsibility for actions which are intended and \nreserved for elected officials, those in the legislative and executive \nbranches.\n  If the balanced budget amendment is added to the Constitution without \nan amendment which clarifies and limits the potential role of the \ncourts in establishing fiscal priorities for the Federal Government, we \nwill have suddenly opened the door to one of the most radical \nrestructurings of our system at any time in our history.\n  I assume in the last Congress, Mr. President, concerns about this \nissue led \n [[Page S2708]] to the adoption of the so-called Danforth amendment \nwhich specifically restricted the role of the courts in enforcement of \nthe balanced budget amendment to the issuance only of declaratory \njudgments. We do not have that here in this amendment now. We do not \nhave that restriction. Indeed, some of the most stalwart proponents of \nthe amendment have conceded that without clear limitations, either in \nthe amendment itself or the implementing legislation, the judiciary \ncould become intimately involved in actually directing compliance with \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Now, of course, the response to these concerns has uniformly been, \n``Do not worry about the details; we will fix it later.'' That is what \nwe are told about all of our amendments. Repeatedly it is asserted that \nthis issue can be addressed simply by implementing legislation.\n  Now, the Judiciary Committee report accompanying Senate Joint \nResolution 1 suggests that the silence of the amendment on the issue of \njudicial review is somehow a good thing, a virtue, asserting that \nthrough this silence the authors have refused to establish a \ncongressional sanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in \nfundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions while not undermining \ntheir equally fundamental obligation to say what the law is.\n  The proponent goes on to say to the extent that we do have any \njudicial intrusion, it can be reigned in later on by having \nimplementing legislation.\n  Mr. President, that is the classic sidestepping of critical decisions \nthat has engendered public disdain for this body and for elected \nofficials in general. It is irresponsible and an abdication of our most \nawesome duties to have failed to address this issue in a forthright and \nhonest manner.\n  The role of the courts in enforcement of this amendment ought to be \nresolved now, not sometime later. This is when we send it out to the \nStates, not later.\n  Mr. President, this entire debate over the balanced budget amendment \nhas become somewhat troubling. We seem to be rushing the proposal \nthrough to meet an arbitrary deadline that was originally set up as a \ncampaigning proposition. There has been little serious debate over the \nwords of the proposed constitutional amendment. We are constantly \ndiverted from any real discussion of the problems that should be \naddressed before this language is placed in the Constitution to a \ngeneralized discussion of Federal deficits and their impact on the \nnational economy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that for a moment we set aside these \ngeneralities and focus on the language of the balanced budget amendment \nthat we are considering, and specifically the role of the courts. I \nstrongly urge the supporters of the amendment to consider the Johnston \namendment on the merits and not just vote it down again because of some \nprearranged agreement to defeat any and all amendments. That is not \nappropriate when we are talking about the most fundamental issue of the \nseparation of powers that this country is founded upon. It is not \nappropriate, not in the U.S. Senate.\n  This is a constitutional amendment we are debating and we may well be \nsending on to the States. We better take the time to ensure that we \nhave not created unintended consequences by careless wording of the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the ratification of the balanced budget amendment \nwithout the Johnston amendment will result in judicial involvement in \nits implementation. I think that is virtually without question.\n  The Constitution of the United States has been amended only 27 times \nin over 2 centuries. Ten of those amendments comprise the Bill of \nRights. Three others, the 13th, 14th, and 15th, arose out of the Civil \nWar.\n  Our Founding Fathers made it difficult to amend our great national \ncharter, and rightly so.\n  A constitution is designed to endure for the ages, not merely reflect \nthe passing issues of the day.\n  Once altered, it is very difficult to change.\n  For example, the 18th amendment, Prohibition, was ratified in 1919. \nIt was a mistake. It inserted government into the private lives of \ncitizens. It was widely flaunted and bred disrespect for the law. It \nwas not repealed until 1933 by the 21st amendment. It took 14 years to \nundo that error.\n  An amendment to the Constitution is not like any ordinary legislative \nmatter that we can change next year when we find out that it does not \nwork exactly as intended.\n  The Constitution is not something we can tinker with and adjust from \none Congress to the next.\n  If the 104th Congress is intent upon adding the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, then we better do \nit right.\n  We better take the time to ensure that we have not created unintended \nconsequences by careless wording of the amendment.\n  Let us not allow legitimate frustrations over the Federal deficit \ninadvertently lead to a radical restructuring of our entire system of \ngovernance.\n  Mr. President, that ratification of the balanced budget amendment \nwithout the Johnston amendment will result in judicial involvement in \nits implementation is virtually without question.\n  Legal scholars from left to right agree that the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment will force the courts into potentially endless \nlitigation over its enforcement.\n  Former Solicitor General and Federal Judge Robert Bork said,\n\n       The result . . . would likely be hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of lawsuits around the country, many of them on \n     inconsistent theories and providing inconsistent results.\n\n  Kathleen Sullivan, professor of law at Stanford University similarly \nobserved,\n\n       . . . enforcement of the Balanced Budget Amendment would \n     inevitably wind up on the doorsteps of the state and federal \n     courts, and ultimately at the Supreme Court.\n\n  She further testified,\n\n       . . . the possibilities for litigation over balanced budget \n     compliance are staggering. Judges [might be asked] to enforce \n     balanced budgets either by enjoining excess spending or by \n     ordering tax increases, the latter possibility no mere \n     phantom after recent decisions by the Supreme Court upholding \n     . . . federal judicial power to require the levy of a tax.\n\n  Yale University professor of law, Burke Marshall, had this to say:\n\n       I have little doubt that the courts ultimately would, \n     however reluctantly, exercise the power of judicial review \n     over such questions as the meaning of the language [used in \n     the Amendment].\n\n  Although some may hope that the dictates of the amendment would be \nself-enforcing and self-policing by the Congress, there is little basis \nfor such speculation. There is a virtual endless list of situations \nwhere litigation is likely to result from efforts to interpret or \nenforce the amendment.\n  Courts will be asked to interpret the language of the amendment, \nincluding such questions as what constitutes total outlays and total \nrevenues. These terms are not self-evident and are not likely to be \nself-evident to future generations.\n  Litigation will surely ensue to determine what activities are or are \nnot covered by the amendment.\n  Almost unbelievably, the Judiciary Committee report, for example, \nmakes the remarkable observation that the electrical power program of \none quasi-public entity, the Tennessee Valley Authority, would not be \ncovered by the amendment since its operations are entirely the \nresponsibility of the electric ratepayers. Not only is the naming of \nthis one agency remarkable, it clearly opens the door to many other \nquasi-public entities seeking similar status. As the author of \nlegislation introduced on January 4, S. 43, to terminate some of the \npublic funding of TVA programs and develop privatization plans for this \nentity, because I wanted to identify and show where I would create the \nbalanced budget. I am both intrigued and perplexed by the decision to \nspecifically exempt the Tennessee Valley Authority as a part of this \nbalanced budget amendment process that supposedly is neutral as to what \nwould and would not be included.\n  Courts will be asked to hear challenges to the executive branch \nefforts to carry out the constitutional mandates. For example, if \noutlays exceed revenues in any fiscal year, the President could argue \non constitutional grounds that it is necessary to impound funds and \ntake other actions unilaterally to meet the requirements of balanced \nbudget amendment. As \n [[Page S2709]] Presidents test these powers, surely those affected \nwill seek judicial review.\n  For example, during the 1970's there was substantial litigation over \nthe Presidential assertion of impoundment authority. Roughly 80 cases \nwere decided by the courts on impoundment questions, generally against \nthe broad interpretation of such power advanced by the Nixon \nadministration. Passage of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 brought \nthat litigation to rest.\n  Yet, backed by a new constitutional balanced budget amendment, many \nbelieve that the President would have not only the authority to impound \nappropriated funds, but would have an obligation to do so under the \nconstitutional mandate.\n  Surely, individuals whose retirement checks are withheld or Federal \nemployees whose salaries are reduced by executive fiat would very \nlikely have standing to sue under this amendment.\n  Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Services noted in \ntestimony to the Senate Appropriations Committee that the experience in \nthe States indicates that courts could well be asked to monitor \nspending, taxing, and indebtedness actions.\n  Mr. Fisher observed, ``If state actions are a guide, judges will not \nbe shy about tackling budgetary and fiscal questions, no matter how \ncomplex.''\n  Former Solicitor General Charles Fried also testified before the \nAppropriations Committee that ``[t]he experience of state court \nadjudication under state constitutional provisions that require \nbalanced budgets and impose debt limitations * * * shows that courts \ncan get intimately involved in the budget process and that they almost \ncertainly will.''\n  Cases will also arise when Members of Congress seek to challenge the \nactions of the executive branch.\n  One of my former professors, Prof. Archibald Cox, observed, ``There \nis * * * substantial likelihood that the Federal courts will be drawn \nin by congressional suits.''\n  The Supreme Court has recently assumed that either House has standing \nto sue to enjoin action rendering its vote ineffectual, Burke versus \nBarnes (1987).\n  Thus, if the President impounded funds appropriated by Congress on \nthe grounds that anticipated revenues had fallen short of projections, \neither House might challenge such action and, again, as the Senator \nfrom Louisiana so well points out, we have the strong likelihood of the \ncourts being involved. Although the question of when individual Members \nof Congress might have standing to pursue such actions remains open, \nthe standing of Congress itself to assert its prerogatives seems \nclearly established.\n  Finally, there are strong arguments to be made that individual \ntaxpayers could have standing to bring suit to challenge a failure to \nenforce the amendment.\n  Harvard Law Prof. Archibald Cox observed in his testimony before the \nAppropriations Committee last year that if the Supreme Court's \nformulation of standing in Flast versus Cohen, the seminal taxpayer \nstanding case, is taken at face value, a Federal taxpayer would surely \nhave standing to challenge an expenditure under the proposed amendment \nupon the allegation that it had resulted or would result in a violation \nof the specific limitation imposed by section 1 of the amendment.\n  Certainly, taxpayer suits in the State courts are well-known, and the \namendment does not restrict litigation to the Federal court system. \nAbsent a provision placing exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal court \nsystem, the issue of State court litigation remains a viable option.\n  This nightmare of litigation will likely have three major results.\n  First, it will insert judges into policymaking functions that are \nunprecedented, for which they have no experience or judicially \nmanageable standards to guide their decisions. That courts would take \non such tasks as levying taxes is not mere speculation; the 1990 \ndecision of the Supreme Court in Missouri versus Jenkins, upholding a \ndistrict court decision directing a local school district to levy a tax \nin order to support a target school required in a desegregation order \nmakes it clear that this is a very real possibility.\n  Second, it would entail a radical and fundamental transformation of \nroles assigned to the different branches of government in this country.\n  As Nicholas Katzenbach testified,\n\n       * * * to open up even the possibility that judges appointed \n     for life might end up making the most fundamental of all \n     political decision is not only an unprecedented shift of \n     constitutional roles and responsibilities but one that should \n     be totally unacceptable in a democratic society.\n\n  Third, and equally important, this shift in power to the judiciary \ncould do incalculable damage to the judiciary itself. As Federal courts \ntake on the task of enjoining the expenditure of funds appropriated by \nCongress or requiring the levy of specific taxes, the backlash toward \njudicial fiats could be enormous. Ultimately, the very effectiveness of \nthe courts in preserving constitutional rights and liberties of \ncitizens could be undermined.\n  The answer to these concerns which has been made by the opponents of \nthis amendment has been singularly unsatisfactory. Repeatedly, we are \ntold, ``we will deal with the problem in the implementing \nlegislation.''\n  Well, Mr. President, the short answer is what if Congress fails to \nagree on implementing legislation?\n  What if the President vetoes any implementing legislation passed by \nCongress and Congress lacks the two-thirds majority needed to override \nsuch a veto?\n  Is there any serious doubt that the judicial branch has the ability \nto enforce a constitutional mandate even in the absence of implementing \nlegislation?\n  It is hornbook law that the Federal courts have the duty to enforce \nconstitutional requirements.\n  There is no implementing legislation for the first amendment, or the \nfourth amendment or the sixth amendment. The power of the courts to \nenforce the constitution arises from the constitution itself, as was \nheld in Marbury versus Madison, very early in our country's history.\n  As Assistant Attorney General and former Duke Law School Professor \nWalter Dellinger testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nmonth,\n\n       Section 6 of the Balanced Budget Amendment does give \n     Congress affirmative authority to legislate implementing \n     legislation. But unless that authority is deemed exclusive, \n     it does not oust the courts of jurisdiction to act without \n     any implementing legislation, just as the courts are able to \n     act under section 1 of the 14th Amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, let me address one last argument, \nthe political question argument, advanced by proponents of the \namendment who belive that judicial intervention into the budget process \nis not likely to follow ratification of the amendment. The proponents \nargue that the courts are likely to use the political question doctrine \nto duck deeper involvement into budgetary decision making. The \nconstitutional scholars, pointed out before the committee that the \nquestions which are likely to arise under the balanced budget amendment \nsimply do not meet the criteria established under Baker versus Carr \n(1962), which lays out the political question doctrine. Moreover, \nrecent cases have suggested a narrowing of the political question \ndoctrine.\n  In light of the legislative history of this amendment and the \npresumption by both proponents and opponents that the courts will have \nsome powers to hear cases involving its implementation, there is little \nlikelihood that the political question doctrine will shield the \namendment from judicial review.\n  Mr. President, in the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton warned \nthat ``there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated \nfrom the legislative and executive powers.''\n  If the Johnston amendment is not adopted, we run the grave risk of \ncreating precisely the kind of peril against which Hamilton warned: and \nthe peril is allowing unelected judges to decide policy questions that \nhave heretofore been dealt with by the legislative and executive \nbranches of our Government.\n  To embark in that direction is the height of foolishness.\n  Those on the other side of this debate who call themselves \nconservatives ought to be among the first to cosponsor and applaud the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Why leave this important issue of whether unelected judges should \nhave \n [[Page S2710]] the authority to make economic decisions unresolved?\n  Why would the Senate abdicate its responsibility? I have authored a \nlot of amendments here, Mr. President. I may have more. I care about \nthem all--middle-class tax cut, tax expenditures, issues having to do \nwith how this amendment is set up. I would happily drop all those \namendments if we could just solve this fundamental problem and if we \ncould just resolve, through the Johnston amendment, the question of \nwhether we are going to turn over this Government to the unelected \njudges or whether we are going to maintain our right and our \nresponsibility to uphold the Constitution and deal with budgetary \nmatters.\n  Mr. President, there is no question, of any amendment, this is the \none that should be adopted.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania? Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does the Senator have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The question I have is, given everything the Senator \nsays will happen--all these suits occurring, et cetera--is there not \nspecific authority in section 6 of this amendment for Congress to pass \nimplementing legislation wherein we can specifically limit the ability \nof taxpayers, Members of Congress and others to sue on this amendment? \nIs that not the ability of the Congress to do even prior to maybe even \nratification by the States? Could we not have legislation moving \nthrough the process to do that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Surely there is a possibility we could try to pass that \nlanguage and that would help. What I am suggesting here is, under the \nbalanced budget amendment and under the inherent powers of the court to \nenforce the balanced budget amendment, that that may well be overridden \nby the power of the courts to take those suits and these folks would \nhave standing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I did not understand, what would be overridden by the \ncourts, our implementing legislation?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting that simply barring those particular \nlawsuits, or attempting to, may not be consistent with the court's \nruling of his inherent powers in this situation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is suggesting the Congress cannot limit \nsuits? That is not within our ability to redress to the courts----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting in the situation where the budget is \nnot balanced, where there is a problem with the entire balanced budget \namendment and the balancing of the budget, that the courts are going to \nhave a certain amount of inherent power to enforce the amendment. I do \nnot deny Congress certainly has some power.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Could we not limit them to simply declaratory judgment? \nIs the Senator saying the courts could go beyond that even though \nCongress limits them to simply declaratory judgment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is that the Senator's intent?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we did that in the implementing legislation, to \nlimit them to declaratory judgment, is the Senator suggesting the \ncourts can ignore that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting it is possible that subsequently the \nU.S. Supreme Court could rule that the balanced budget amendment, that \nwould derogate from the balanced budget amendment and take away the \npower of the people to have a balanced budget by taking away the right \nto enforce it. If you do not include in the constitutional amendment \nitself, if you do not specify in the Constitution that statutory \nprovision cannot necessarily be interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court \nto derogate to the balanced budget amendment. I am not convinced of \nthat at all.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I can read to the Senator, if he would like, example \nafter example--I would like to submit it for the Record--of where the \nCongress has specifically limited the powers of the courts dealing with \nthese kinds of matters.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is under the current Constitution; this is under a \nnew Constitution, one with a balanced budget amendment in it. The \ncourts do not currently have a balanced budget amendment to deal with.\n  What I am suggesting is, if you have a balanced budget amendment, and \nlater on you decide that you want to have a statute, it is not certain \nthat the court would rule that that limitation----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It may be unconstitutional.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself some time \nto address this issue.\n  Section 6 of the constitutional amendment which we are discussing, \nthe balanced budget amendment, specifically states that Congress has \nthe ability to pass implementing legislation. In that legislation we \ncan limit the authority of the courts----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To address this question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Even assuming the worst case, assuming that the sky \nwill fall down----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have the ability here in this Chamber and across the \naisle to deal with this issue, and in fact I suspect that as we do pass \nimplementing legislation, which I am sure we will, we will be back on \nthis floor and I think that is the arena for this discussion as to what \nthe appropriate remedies should be.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would ask the Senator's reaction to the statement of \nSolicitor General Freed with regard to this issue where he said that if \nCongress attempted to pass legislation pursuant to section 6 to \neliminate Federal court jurisdiction of questions arising in the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, that limitation itself might \nvery well be unconstitutional.\n  That is my point. You may want to pass legislation afterwards. You \nmay hope that the court will accept it. But there is no certainty \nwhatsoever that the court will not say, I am sorry. This is merely a \nstatute. And my question is, how does the Senator react to the \nquestion?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I disagree. It has been law in this country for as far \nas I know. The only situation where that could be a problem is if all \ndue process, all other court access is denied. If we provide for some \ncourt access, which I am sure we will, if we provide for some court \naccess, then I think it is very clear that they will not have other \nrecourse--as long as we provide an avenue to the courts. We have the \npower to do that, to direct what avenue they take.\n  If we say in the implementing legislation that there will be no \naccess, I think the Senator might have a point. But I do not think we \nare going to do that. But I think that is a discussion for another day, \nnot to insert in the Constitution in this amendment a complete \nprohibition of all court activity because I think that overreaches.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will briefly yield and then I wish to respond to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think the Senator brings up an important and close \npoint and that is whether the phrasing in section 6, where Congress \nshall enforce and implement the article, whether a denial of \njurisdiction, a denial of all remedies would be considered to be \nenforcing and implementing. This same kind of language is in section 5 \nof the 14th amendment. I am quite familiar with this because I had an \namendment here which I passed twice in the Senate, invoked cloture \ntwice on it, to \n [[Page S2711]] limit busing under the 14th amendment, and the question \nwas addressed by the then Attorney General as to whether that \nlimitation was implementing the 14th amendment, and the decision of the \nAttorney General was not altogether satisfactory. Suffice it to say, \nthere would be a real question as to whether that would be implementing \nand enforcing if you denied all jurisdiction. But it seems to me that \nis not the important----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can take my time back, I would agree with the \nSenator that I think we could run into problems if we denied every \naccess to the courts. I am suggesting that I do not believe that will \nbe the case. I think there will be some sort of relief provided for in \nthe implementing legislation. And if we did not, I think we would have \nsome sort of constitutional question. But I am saying that is an issue \nwe should bring to the floor and discuss, but we should not do a \ncomplete ban on any kind of redress to the courts. I think it is unwise \njust from a policy perspective. But I think it does not have a place in \nthe Constitution as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield just for one statement----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Which is that under my amendment we do not prohibit the \nCongress from acting. To the contrary, we say that the court shall have \nno jurisdiction except to the extent that Congress specifically acts. \nSo we allow that. We contemplate it. We encourage it. And Congress \nought to act. On that the Senator and I agree.\n  The question is if Congress does not act, what is the inherent power \nof the Court? And we wish to make it clear that they have no inherent \npower except to the extent we give it to them.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All I would suggest is that implementing legislation \ncertainly must follow. It is a certainty that it will follow this \nlegislation, and I think we will provide, I know we will provide some \nremedies therein to provide for redress of this grievance with respect \nto the question that the Senator from Michigan brought up. It is a good \nquestion. The question is whether a citizen or someone would have \nstanding to bring here.\n  Standing is one issue. Whether they would be successful is another \nissue. Standing is the first hurdle that someone must pass.\n  With respect to that question, there is a three-part test that is \nused, that has been used for quite some time, and number one, the \ncitizen must show injury in fact. I think that is a very high hurdle, \nfor one individual to show a personal injury due to the fact that we \nhave an unbalanced budget, and in fact we have cases that are very \nclear on that: Frothingham versus Mellon, a very old Supreme Court case \nstill in effect, a 1923 case, says that allegations that amount to \ngeneralized grievance are not justiciable.\n  That to me is a pretty clear indication that you have a high burden \nupon just the first leg of this three-part test to cover.\n  No. 2, you have to show that one particular piece of legislation \ncaused the unbalancing. Well, which one caused the unbalancing? How do \nyou go about attacking that one as the one that did it? I think that \nalso raises a very difficult question.\n  And finally--and we have talked about this briefly--whether it is a \nredressable grievance. What can the Court do to solve this problem? And \nyou run into the political question doctrine and a whole lot of other \nthings about whether the Court can reach over into article I and impose \ntaxes under a balanced budget amendment. I think that is a very tall \norder, for the courts to say that they have that kind of power in that \nbranch of the Government when it is very clear that article I says that \nCongress has the power to tax and to spend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator allow a response to that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I promised the Senator from Illinois I would yield him \nsome time, so I will yield to the Senator from Illinois 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me just make a few observations. First--and I do not question the \nsincerity of my colleague from Louisiana at all on this; I know he is \nsincere--some who attack this are going to attack it no matter what. \nOne former Member of this body was attacking this because the courts \nwere going to intervene, and then we adopted the Danforth amendment, \nand he attacked it because it was toothless and it was unenforceable. \nIt is kind of a no-win situation for some of the opponents.\n  Second, in terms of a precedent for what you are talking about, court \nintervention, the only real precedent is the Jenkins case in Missouri \nwhere you are dealing with individual rights and something that is not \nreal clear. Here you are talking about an institutional situation where \nwe can precisely measure what has happened. I think on balance the risk \nis very small. And I would quote from former Attorney General Barr.\n\n       I see little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micro- management or superintendence of the \n     Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, \n     moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that courts will \n     play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, \n     that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed [vastly \n     outweighed] by the benefits of such an amendment.\n\n  We clearly have the ability to determine who has standing. Now, \nobviously--and I heard my friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, quote \nCongressman Schaefer. I differ with Congressman Schaefer in terms of \nwhat our implementing legislation should be, and I think the majority \nin the House and Senate will.\n  I think standing ought to be limited to, perhaps, 10 Senators, 30 \nHouse Members, 3 Governors--something along that line--and limited \nsolely to the Federal courts. I think we can pass something like that \nso there is not going to be, in any event, just a huge amount of \nlitigation even if you try stretching your imagination.\n  I point out, also, we can avoid all of this by building small \nsurpluses, as Alan Greenspan, Fred Bergsten, and other economists have \nrecommended that we do. If we do not have surpluses, if we have a \nsituation, with a 60 percent vote, we can have a deficit. And it takes \na 60 percent vote to add to the debt. These are very precise \nmeasurements. We are not talking about individual rights where there \nmay be strong disagreements.\n  I point out also, and my colleague from Colorado, Senator Brown, \npointed this out in committee when we had the hearing, that States have \nsomewhat similar provisions, 48 of the 50 States, in their State \nconstitutions. There has been almost no litigation on this. So the \nhistory of States suggests this will not happen. Senator Brown \nmentioned in the history of Colorado's provision, there has been no \nlitigation on this question.\n  Does that mean the courts cannot ever get involved? The answer is, if \nwe blatantly ignore the Constitution, then there is a narrow window for \nthe courts to get involved. That window, I think, should remain open. I \ndo not think we should close that window. I think it is unlikely that \nwill ever be a problem. But who knows who will be in Congress 50 years \nfrom now? Some Congress may decide we just want to ignore the \nConstitution. I cannot imagine that, but it is possible.\n  In that kind of case, the courts can intervene. But I think the \nhistory of State provisions, the provision that says the Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, makes it \nvery clear we are not going to have a massive amount of litigation.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield me some additional \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Louisiana yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have been speaking to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, particularly Senators Brown and Gorton. I \nbelieve we have an agreement as to at least what we could agree to. If \nmy colleagues on this side of the aisle would have no objection to this \nlanguage, \n [[Page S2712]] then I will propose to modify my amendment accordingly.\n  The language is a combination of language originally proposed by \nSenator Gorton back in 1982, and with the Brown suggestion about \nsection 2. It would read as follows. I am not asking at this point to \nmodify the amendment, but I would like to discuss it before I do.\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article except for \n     section 2 hereof or as may be specifically authorized in \n     implementing legislation pursuant to this section.\n\n  Section 2, my colleagues will recall, as Senator Brown talked about, \nprovides that:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  As Senator Brown pointed out, that is a powerful way to enforce the \namendment. That would be exempted from the--in other words, the court \nwould have jurisdiction under section 2, but otherwise would not have \njurisdiction--would not--the judicial power would not extend, except as \nspecifically authorized by Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana will yield for a \nquestion, a clarification, on this?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As far as I am concerned, any clarification is an \nimprovement because we now, as the Senator so eloquently pointed out, \nhave an ambiguity which is unacceptable in a provision. Whether people \nfavor the provision otherwise or oppose it otherwise, we ought to seek \nclarity in what we are doing.\n  As I understand the language the Senator has just read, it would say \nthat basically a court could enforce the section 2 limit on the debt. \nThat limit on the debt held by the public would still have to be \ndefined by Congress, since there is no existing statute that sets that \ndebt held by the public, and that is confirmed by letter from the \nAttorney General which I put in the Record.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I believe that is also in the committee report. They \nsay the debt is a creature of legislation and would be subject to that \ndefinition by Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But my question of the Senator from Louisiana is this. Is \nthe Senator saying that, in the event that the Congress did not adopt a \nlimit on the debt of the United States held by the public--and there is \nno such statutory limit now, the statutory limit now is on the debt, \nnot just the debt which is held by the public which is part of the \nnational debt--if the Congress did not set such a limit as provided for \nin section 2, that this language that the Senator just read would \nauthorize a court to legislate that limit?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. No. The court would have--the judicial power of the \nUnited States would extend to that case or controversy, however it \narose and whatever remedies the court would feel were appropriate. We \ndo not know what remedies those might be.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering though, if I could clarify this question. \nIs it the intention of this language--and I think it is important that \nlanguage be before this body for more than a few minutes so people can \nstudy it. This is a critical question. My good friend from Washington \nhas been deeply involved in this question over many, many versions of \nthe constitutional amendment and is really an expert on the subject. So \nI think this language should be before the body for more than a few \nminutes.\n  My question, however, is: Is it intended that a court could order a \nspecific limit on the debt ``held by the public,'' in the event that \nCongress did not adopt a statute defining such a publicly held----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is a limit on the debt now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the importance of the letter from the Attorney \nGeneral. With the permission of my friend from Louisiana, I would like \nto read it. It is a short letter.\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcall vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n\n  I cannot say it any more clearly than the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. There is no statutory limit on the ``debt of the United \nStates held by the public'' in current law. It would require a future \nCongress to establish such a new kind of debt limit, which would \nexclude debt held, for instance, by the Social Security Administration.\n  My question, then, is whether or not it is the intention of the \nframers of this new language that a court could order a Congress, or \nadopt itself, language which would define ``debt of the United States \nheld by the public,'' since there is no such debt in current law?\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This amendment has the judicial power of the United \nStates to extend to that case or controversy. I can imagine the number \nof things the court could do. The court can do what they want to \nbecause they are omnipotent. They can say that the public debt, as \npresently set by limit, was meant to be the same thing as this. But \nfrom my standpoint, if the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from \nWashington would like to redefine that term in light of this letter, \nthat would be suitable with me. But I would say that it is improbable \nthat a court would be able itself to set a limit on the public debt.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer the Senator from Louisiana has given to the \nSenator from Michigan is accurate insofar as it goes. But I think the \nmore fundamental answer to the Senator from Michigan is that this \nparticular part of the proposed revision does not change the basic \nbalanced budget amendment with respect to section 2 at all. Right now \nthe thrust of the argument of the question raised by the Senator from \nMichigan is just as valid in the present unamended form to the balanced \nbudget amendment as it would be if this modification were passed. This \nSenator, as each of the Senators knows, was greatly disturbed by this \nparticular question of judicial review 13 years ago, in 1982, and \nproposed an amendment to essentially cause these questions to be \npolitical questions at that time.\n  This Senator is very sympathetic with the direction of the amendment \nSenator Johnston has put forward and would prefer that it be phrased \nslightly differently, but, nonetheless, I feel that I do not wish to \nexpand the judicial power of the United States to writing budget for \nthe United States. When I proposed that, without the exception for \nsection 2, the Senator from Colorado and others expressed to me a deep \nconcern about a form of violation of the Constitution that I think will \nnever take place. Their comments were directed at our comments, which \nwould simply defy the plain requirements of section 2 and pass a debt \nlimit increase with 55 percent of the votes in the Senate or 55 percent \nof the votes in the House and just simply flat out ignore the \nConstitution. They wished to see to it that the courts would have \njurisdiction to prevent that blatant violation of the Constitution. I \ndo not believe that it is even remotely conceivable that would ever \nhappen.\n  The reason I sympathize with the general direction of what the \nSenator from Louisiana wants to do, what I fear is going to happen \nunder this constitutional amendment is that Congress is going to pass a \nbudget and the President is going to sign a budget, under the same \ncircumstances which happens today, that is invalid according to the \nestimates by the CBO and the like and that someone or some group will \nhave standing to go into court and say, ``No; the CBO estimates \n [[Page S2713]] are wrong. We have to get the estimates,'' and that \nsome court which desires to get into this business is going to say, \n``Yes, you are right. Your estimates are better than Congress,'' and \norder the rewriting of a budget. I do not believe anyone, I say to the \nSenator from Michigan, who was asked this question, believes we are \ngoing to get cases under section 2. But, in any event, we are not going \nto get any more cases under section 2 with this revised amendment than \nwe will get without any amendment at all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Washington yield? I thank him for \nhis clarification. As I understand it, it would be his intention as one \nof the co-authors of this language, I gather, that the Senator from \nLouisiana has described, that the jurisdiction is referred to the \ncourt, pursuant to section 2, to enforce the 60-vote requirement in \nthat amendment, not to define words that a legislature or Congress \nwould ordinarily be required to define.\n  Mr. GORTON. Clearly, any controversy arising under section 2 would in \nfact be justiciable under the modification of the draft working with \nthe Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Louisiana. But the point \nis that it is true with the original balanced budget amendment, we are \nnot changing that by proposing this. This modification, just as Senator \nJohnston's original amendment limits the jurisdiction of the courts of \nthe United States, modifies it in this fashion. It does not do it quite \nas much because it does not limit it with respect to section 2. It just \nlimits with respect to the other section, but nothing, in my view, \ngiven the Supreme Court, by this modification that is not there in the \npresent form of the balanced budget amendment that we have been \ndebating for 3 weeks.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Technically the Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I agree with the Senator from Washington. Moreover, \nthere is a legislative limit today on the debt of the United States. So \nCongress must act, plus act every year to increase the debt. They may \nact to increase the debt as defined by statute now. But, if you can do \nthat, chances are you will be able to do it to increase it pursuant to \nthe terms of this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. As I understand, that was in the letter from the \nAttorney General. I must say it sounds like chopped logic to me. We \nhave a statute under the deficit now which uses words slightly \ndifferent from those of section 2 in House Joint Resolution 1.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is slightly different. If the Senator will yield, the \nquestion is whether or not to include debt held by the Social Security \nAdministration. That is not a slight difference.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am convinced that the simplest of all implementing \nlegislation for this kind of constitutional amendment, should it become \npart of the Constitution, will define the debt in a way which is \ntotally consistent with section 2. So as a practical matter, I do not \nthink such a case of controversy will ever arise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could ask the Senator from Louisiana this \nquestion, the same question, now that we have the letter from the \nAttorney General. It is the intent, as I understand it, that under the \nlanguages which you read that the court could enforce the requirement \nof 60 votes, and that is the principal purpose of the language.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not mean to be evasive. I am just saying that the \njudicial power of the United States would extend to cases and \ncontroversies arising under section 2. The court can do what it thinks \nis proper, if it finds standing, if it finds there is a justiciable \nquestion and it extends to such powers as the court thinks are proper.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Since what the Senator from Louisiana has read is in the \nhandwriting of the Senator from Washington, the answer of the Senator \nfrom Washington to the Senator from Michigan is yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  If no other Senator is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of \na quorum and ask unanimous consent that it be equally divided.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will withhold, I will address a question \nto the Senator from Washington. It has to do with the purpose of this \nlanguage which I have heard and have not had a chance to read. As I \nunderstand it, this would deprive the courts of jurisdiction except \nwith regard to section 2.\n  Mr. GORTON. The amendment that is before the body now, the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana, does not deprive the court of \njurisdiction. The court has no jurisdiction at the present time on a \nconstitutional amendment. It says, in essence, that the court will not \nhave jurisdiction over cases arising out of the balanced budget \namendment, except with respect to its enabling legislation. That is the \nproposal of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  While this modification has some slight language differences from his \noriginal point, its only substantive change in the proposal before the \nbody right now is to allow the court to deal with cases and \ncontroversies arising under section 2. The purpose of it, I may say--\nsince while I was the draftsman, I am not the person who thought it \nup--the purpose of it was to deal with the sincere concerns of the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Brown, that Congress, without such \njurisdiction, literally could define the plain language of section 2 \nand pass a debt limit increase by less than a 60-percent supermajority \nvote.\n  As I have said, I cannot conceive of Members of Congress so blatantly \nviolating their oaths of office under such circumstances. As a \nconsequence, I was perfectly willing to go along with the Senator from \nColorado because I do not think any such case or controversy will ever \narise. But the purpose is to carve out from the general exemption--\nwhich is Senator Johnston's amendment--section 2.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. So while there is an exemption under the Senator's \namendment with regard to enabling legislation, this exemption would \napply to part of the language of the constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, plus enabling legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, and that is section 2. Does the Senator consider \nthat if such amended language was agreed to, that might obviate the \nargument that the courts did not have jurisdiction with regard to \nsection 2? In other words, as I heard the debate here a short time ago, \nI think very strong arguments were made with regard to the amendment \nitself, the totality of the amendment, that there were serious \nquestions with regard to the justiciable issue regarding political \nquestions and all of that, with regard to the amendment in totality, \nincluding section 2.\n  I wonder whether or not, if such language were agreed to, this would \nbe an open invitation to the courts that in fact we are inviting you to \ntake on anything that could be a part of section 2 and might in fact go \nagainst the intent of the proponents of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana?\n  Mr. GORTON. I say to the Senator from Tennessee that he is a shrewd \nreader of legislative constitutional language, because I think in this \ncase he is precisely correct. The paradox, in my opinion, this year, \nlast year, and in 1982, when we debated this subject, is that those who \nhave opposed adding this kind of judicial review section to a balanced \nbudget amendment have made two totally inconsistent, opposite arguments \nagainst including such a section. One is that the courts would never \ntake cases or controversies under this. They do not have any such \njurisdiction, and they would not exercise any such jurisdiction. The \nother argument is that we certainly want the courts to enforce it if \nCongress violates these constitutional provisions.\n  I did not understand those arguments in 1982; I did not understand \nthem in 1986; I did not understand them last year; and I do not \nunderstand them now. I think those who oppose adding something like the \nJohnston amendment at least ought to pick one side of that argument or \nthe other. If their sole reason for not wishing to add something like \nthe Johnston amendment is that it is unnecessary because the courts \nwill never, under any circumstances, deal with a case or controversy \narising under the balanced \n [[Page S2714]] budget amendment, then under those circumstances, we \nhave actually created a cause of action by this particular modification \nwith respect to section 2. I think that is the utter logical \nconclusion.\n  My own view on the subject is that the fundamental argument is \nflawed. I am convinced that the courts would in fact exercise \njurisdiction under cases or controversies arising under this entire \namendment. There is no way in the world we can guarantee that the \nSupreme Court next year, much less 100 years from now, is not going to \ndecide it wants to write a budget and override our estimate.\n  My deep concern is not a case or controversy that is going to arise \nunder section 2 as to whether we have invalidly increased the debt \nlimit, or many other sections here; I believe that the history of the \nFederal courts of the United States clearly indicates that we will be \nfaced very soon--maybe in the first budget that passes after this \nconstitutional amendment becomes a part of the Constitution--with a \nCongress and a President who have passed what they consider to be a \nbalanced budget, using Congressional Budget Office estimates of \nrevenues, for example, and Joint Tax Committee estimates of receipts, \nand that some individual withstanding will sue and say the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates are off, they are phony, this is \nCongress' own creation, they have fixed the figures, and we think there \nis a much better estimate of expenditures and those expenditures are a \nlot higher than the Congressional Budget Office has said and we, \ntherefore, order the Congress either to use our estimates, the \nestimates of the court, to rewrite the budget, or we will impose a 5-\npercent surcharge on the income tax this year to bring it into balance.\n  It is that kind of judicial activism, in my opinion, which has \nplagued the United States in many respects for the last 50 years, with \ncourts running prisons and school systems and shelters for the homeless \nand the like, and acting in a legislative fashion. And for anybody, \nparticularly somebody conservative, to state with assurance that the \ncourts will not involve themselves in this field I just think is a \nfaulty argument.\n  If the argument, on the other hand, is the courts ought to be in this \nfield, I can see someone arguing that they like judicial activism and \nwant courts involved in this field. I just disagree with them. If I \nthought the courts were going to be in this field, I would not want \nanything to do with the balanced budget amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor and a very, very strong supporter. Under those cases, they \nwould probably rather have it in section 2 than not to have it at all. \nPersonally, I would prefer we not have it at all. Personally, I also \nwant to get something accomplished here, and I do not think this \nexception for section 2, in my view, is ever going to come up at all.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer to the question of the Senator from Tennessee \nis that he is absolutely right. It settles that first argument with \nrespect to section 2 and makes it invalid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls the time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I wonder if the Senator would not agree with me that \nsection 2 involves, really, a yes or no proposition--that is, that the \nlimit on the debt of the U.S. public shall not be increased except by a \nthree-fifths vote. It is subject only really to a yes or no \nproposition. That is, you either had the three-fifths or you did not \nhave it. It does not get into all the fiscal questions that might flow \nfrom that; rather, it is a yes or no proposition.\n  So I wonder if the Senator from Washington does not agree that really \nabout all the court could do on that is say, yes or no, you did or you \ndid not, and if you did not, it is not valid and the President could \nnot sign it anyway if it violates the Constitution.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is certainly the thrust of what the Senator from \nColorado was himself concerned with.\n  Again, it is very important, as the Senator from Michigan said, when \nwe deal with the Constitution that we be as clear as we possibly can in \nwhat we say. And it is certainly possible, in the absence of any \nstatute on this subject, that a case or controversy could arise under \nother provisions in section 2. But, as I said, the first thing we will \ndo will be to make the slight definitional changes that are necessary \nto use the phrase in this Constitution and the debt limit legislation \nwhich we have at the present time.\n  So, as a practical matter, I think the only time the question would \never come up is the way the Senator from Louisiana states it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I share the concern of both the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and the Senator from Washington concerning judicial \nactivism. As the Senator from Washington puts it, on one hand, he is \nconcerned about it, and, on the other, he is concerned about the notion \nthat the courts should indeed be involved.\n  I think there is probably a middle ground here that many people are \nstruggling with. I think a very good case can be made for the \nproposition that, indeed, it is unlikely--I am talking about under the \noriginal amendment--that it is unlikely that the court would involve \nitself in the detailed budgeting process of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Now, can anybody say that will not happen with certainty? Absolutely \nnot. We all know that it can happen. It is a possibility.\n  The question is: What is the likelihood? It has never been done \nbefore. You look at what has happened on the State level. You look at \nwhat has happened on the Federal level.\n  I remember the lawsuit against President Nixon back in 1974. The \ncourt dealt with a little different situation there, but they were \ndealing with the powers of the executive branch. If you read that case, \nyou will see how reluctant the Supreme Court is to get into the \noperations of and put limitations on the power of the other branches of \nGovernment.\n  That case came down requiring the President to give up his tapes, but \nin doing so really they raised the threshold very substantially as far \nas any future similar actions against a President. You had to have \neyewitnesses in that case, eyewitnesses, in effect, saying the \nPresident was involved in criminal activity or very possibly could have \nbeen. So they decided against the President in that case. But by their \nlanguage, they were struggling mightily with it and it had to be very \nfact specific and it had to be an egregious case by that language for \nthem to step into the affairs of the President of the United States.\n  I think in all probability that is the way it will be with Congress. \nMy own guess is--and I assume that is all we can acknowledge, that is \nbasically all we are doing here--my own guess is that, absent some \negregious case that the Senator from Washington says he does not think \nwill ever happen, and I agree, but absent some very egregious case \nwhere the Congress of the United States just blatantly and openly \ndisregards the Constitution, I do not think the Supreme Court would \ninvolve itself, even the Supreme Court as we know it today, which too \noften gets into too many things, as we all know.\n  I think many of us simply share the concern that if there is no \nenforcing mechanism at all, if there is no possibility, if we foreclose \nany possibility under any circumstances that the court cannot decide \nthis, that a future Congress would use that and circumvent the intent \nof the balanced budget amendment.\n  So it gets back to how badly do you think our fiscal crisis is; how \nbadly do we need this balanced budget amendment? And I think pretty \nbadly.\n  We have heard the debate here for many, many days. We are headed down \nthe wrong road at breakneck speed. We are bankrupting the next \ngeneration by any objective standard. By any bipartisan analysis that \nhas been made of it, we are in serious, serious circumstances here and \nwe are kind of fiddling around here while Rome is burning and missing \nthe central point that we better keep in mind, and that is we better \nget our fiscal house in order.\n  The balanced budget amendment, without being cluttered with a lot of \ncontroversial amendments designed \n [[Page S2715]] primarily by some to kill it and not to improve the \namendment so that they could support it, instead of doing that, we \nought to refocus and pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  I intend at this stage of the game to say, let us pass it without \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 272, as Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we have had this discussion.\n  At this point, I wish to modify my amendment by inserting, in lieu of \nthe present language, the following language, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right, and the amendment \nis so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       At the end of Section 6, add the following: ``The judicial \n     power of the United States shall not extend to any case or \n     controversy arising under this article except for section 2 \n     hereof, or as may be specifically authorized in implementing \n     legislation pursuant to this section.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for two additional questions?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One of the questions I think it would be valuable for us \nto perk a bit so that others, including members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, could look at the language is a very important change--\nagain, whether you favor or oppose the amendment on other grounds, it \nis important that we clarify the amendment, and the Senator from \nLouisiana has done very, very important work in achieving this \nclarification. I would like to pursue it because there is still some \nambiguity.\n  I have two questions. One is the judicial power of the United States \nrefers to Federal courts. State courts also implement the Constitution \nand enforce the Constitution. I am wondering whether or not it is the \nintention of this language that State as well as Federal courts would \nbe prohibited from enforcing this provision except as specifically \nauthorized in implementation legislation? Is that the intent of the \nauthors of this language?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is not the intent of this language to give State \ncourts the power. I do not believe they would have the power to order a \ntax increase or give a declaratory judgment or cut a Federal program. I \nbelieve that that judicial power adheres only in the United States.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have to say to the Senator from Michigan, the \nConstitution of the United States, as it is presently formulated, or \nformulated here, makes no statements with respect to the jurisdiction \nof State courts. In a very real sense, State courts interpret the \nConstitution, but State courts cannot order the Congress of the United \nStates to do anything. They have no such jurisdiction.\n  So, just as is in the rest of the Constitution, the balanced budget \namendment and the debt limit legislation are silent as to the \njurisdiction of State courts, which is exactly what they are ought to \nbe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand it, however, it is the intent of the \nSenator from Louisiana that, to the extent that this gives any \nauthority at all under section 2 or otherwise, that section 2 authority \nexclusively goes to the Federal courts.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. The phrase in the Constitution, of course, is the \njudicial power of the United States. That is the Federal Government.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question is, the language here as it authorizes section \n2 implementation refers only to Federal courts.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The other question relates to a question I have asked the \nsponsors of the legislation. I sent them a whole list of questions as \nto the enforcement provisions under section 6, because it raises a \nwhole question as to whether or not there is an enforcement mechanism \nfor this constitutional amendment or whether or not it is just a \nstatement of intent and then has no teeth in it. But that is a \ndifferent issue for a different argument.\n  My question, though, is this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Could we answer the questions on the other side's time, \nbecause I think we are about to run out?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Washington yield for this question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana controls the time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Washington ask for a minute or two \nof time in order to respond to the question of the Senator from \nMichigan?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator does not have time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, we \nhave a limited amount of time remaining, and we have speakers that we \nhave to accommodate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the questions \nwhich I forwarded to the Senators from Utah and Illinois, including \nsection 17 be inserted in the Record and specifically any response to \nsection 17 that is obtained today be inserted in the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Balanced Budget Amendment Questions\n\n       1. What exactly is the definition of receipts? For example, \n     do receipts include the receipts from Postal Service stamp \n     sales and TVA power sales? Do they include Medicare premium \n     payments? Do they include the receipts of government \n     corporations and quasi-federal agencies which deposit money \n     in non-Treasury accounts? Who will make this determination?\n       2. What exactly is the definition of outlays? For example, \n     do outlays include federal loans and federally-guaranteed \n     loans? Do they include spending by government corporations \n     and quasi-federal agencies which pay for their activities out \n     of user fees instead of out of Treasury accounts? Who will \n     make this determination?\n       3. Will estimates or actual levels be used for receipts and \n     outlays? In an instance in which the OMB and the CBO disagree \n     with each other on what outlays or receipts are, how will the \n     dispute be resolved so that it can be determined whether or \n     not outlays exceed receipts?\n       4. Who will determine whether a bill is `a bill to increase \n     revenues?' For example, what happens if OMB says the bill is \n     revenue neutral, and CBO says the bill will result in a net \n     increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? How will \n     the dispute be resolved?\n       5. At what point will it be determined that outlays will in \n     fact exceed receipts, triggering remedial action? August 1? \n     September 15? Who will make that determination--OMB or CBO?\n       6. At whatever point it is determined that outlays do or \n     will exceed receipts, will automatic spending cuts or tax \n     increases be triggered? When would that happen, and who would \n     be responsible for making it happen? Will cuts affect all \n     programs equally across-the-board, or will certain programs \n     be exempt?\n       7. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a budget \n     resolution that is not balanced?\n       8. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     increase spending from some base level without off-setting \n     spending cuts or revenue increases? would it matter whether \n     this was the last appropriations bill of the year, and would \n     result total appropriations exceeding expected receipts? If \n     not, how will we ensure that Congress does not increase \n     spending without paying for it?\n       9. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     cut taxes without off-setting spending cuts or revenue \n     increases? If not, how will we ensure that Congress does not \n     cut taxes without paying for it?\n       10. What happens if Congress passes a budget resolution \n     which is in balance, and enacts appropriations bills on the \n     basis of that resolution, but part way through the year it \n     appears that outlays will exceed receipts? Would Congress be \n     required to vote separately on whether to authorize or \n     eliminate the excess, even though it voted for budget and \n     appropriation bills in the belief that the budget would be \n     balanced? What mechanism would be created to ensure that such \n     a bill would be considered?\n       11. At what point during the fiscal year would Congress be \n     required to vote to authorize an excess of outlays or to \n     eliminate that excess? What would happen if Congress did not \n     approve either such measure?\n       12. Would the amendment be enforced through sequestration \n     or impoundment? If so, when and how would that action take \n     place?\n       [[Page S2716]] 13. What happens if Congress approves a \n     specific excess of outlays over receipts by the required \n     three-fifths vote of each House, but the projection turns out \n     to be wrong--the deficit is greater than expected. Would a \n     second vote be required to approve the revised estimate of \n     the deficit? Who determines the dollar amount of excess that \n     Congress will vote on in each case? Who determines that the \n     estimated excess was wrong? How often would such \n     determinations be made, and such votes be required? Who \n     determines when the votes must take place?\n       14. The resolution requires that three-fifths of each House \n     vote to approve an excess ``by law''. Does this mean that the \n     President must sign a bill to approve an excess? What happens \n     if three-fifths of the Members of each House approve a \n     deficit, but the President vetoes the bill? On the other \n     hand, what happens if Congress passes a reconciliation bill \n     to balance the budget and the President vetoes it and there \n     are insufficient votes to override the veto? For example, \n     what if Congress votes to increase taxes to eliminate the \n     deficit and the President says he prefers spending cuts and \n     vetoes the bill. If there are insufficient votes to override \n     the veto, who has violated the Constitution--the Congress or \n     the President?\n       15. Could Congress shift receipts or outlays from one year \n     to another to meet balanced budget requirements? For example, \n     could paydays for government employees be put off a few days \n     into the next fiscal year to achieve a balance between \n     receipts and outlays? What mechanisms will prevent this type \n     of abuse?\n       16. Section 2 of the resolution provides that ``the limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public shall not \n     be increased'' without a three-fifths vote. What is the \n     current statutory ``limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public'', if any? If there is currently no such \n     limit, how will such a limit be established?\n       17. What does the debt of the United States held by the \n     public include? Specifically, does it include the debt of \n     wholly-owned government corporations (like the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation and the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation)? Does it include the debt of mixed-ownership \n     government corporations (like Amtrak and the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation)? Does it include loans guaranteed by \n     the federal government, such as guaranteed student loans, \n     guaranteed agriculture and export loans, or Mexican loan \n     guarantees? If not, could additional government corporations \n     and quasi-governmental agencies be created to conduct federal \n     programs off-budget to evade the amendment? Could new \n     government guaranteed lending programs replace government \n     spending? How would this be prevented?\n       18. May the President transmit a proposed budget which is \n     not in balance in addition to his balanced budget proposal? \n     May the President transmit a balanced budget, but recommends \n     against its adoption? Can he submit the balanced budget at \n     any time before the fiscal year begins?\n       19. The Committee report states that the words ``bill to \n     increase revenue'' covers ``those measures whose intended and \n     anticipated effect will be to increase revenues to the \n     Federal Government.'' Does this mean net revenue? Over what \n     period of time would this be judged?\n       Would the revenue provision apply to a bill that increases \n     revenues for three years and reduces revenues for the \n     following three years, with a net change of zero over the \n     six-year period? What happens if the amendment is repealed \n     after three years, because it would result in a deficit?\n       Would a bill to increase the capital gains tax be exempt, \n     since many argue would have the effect of reducing revenue in \n     at least the early years after enactment?\n       20. Does ``revenue'' include fees? How do we tell the \n     difference between a revenue measure increasing fees and a \n     spending measure decreasing outlays by requiring users to pay \n     for services provided to them instead of funding the services \n     out of tax revenues?\n       What about a bill to raise the federal share of receipts \n     from concessions in our national parks?\n       What if the bill simply required regular competition for \n     national park concessions? Would that be a bill to increase \n     revenue, since it would have the ``intended and anticipated \n     effect'' of increasing the federal share?\n       21. Does revenue include tariffs? Would a trade measure \n     which authorizes use of retaliatory tariffs in certain cases \n     be considered a ``revenue measure'', since it would arguably \n     have the ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing \n     revenues? Who will make this determination?\n       22. Does revenue include civil and criminal penalties? \n     Would a bill that establishes a new civil or criminal penalty \n     be considered a ``revenue'' measure? How about a bill that \n     indexes certain penalties for inflation? How about a measure \n     to toughen enforcement of criminal or civil penalties? Would \n     a bill to tighten enforcement of the tax laws or provide more \n     personnel to the IRS be covered, since it would have the \n     ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing revenues? \n     Who will decide what is covered by this provision?\n       23. Would a statute that requires a new, lower measure for \n     inflation, be considered a bill to increase revenue, since by \n     slowing the adjustment of tax brackets it would have the \n     ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing taxes? \n     Would the elimination of a special, targeted tax break be \n     covered by this provision? Would it cover a bill authorizing \n     the sale of buildings or land?\n       24. Sponsors of the amendment have said that the social \n     security trust funds will be protected in implementing \n     legislation and that the budget will not be balanced at the \n     expense of the States. How will this result be ensured?\n       25. The term ``fiscal year'' is not defined in the \n     amendment. The report indicates that Congress has the power \n     to define the term ``fiscal year.'' Does this mean that \n     Congress could change the effective date of the amendment by \n     legislation, passed by majority vote, which changes the \n     statutory time at which a fiscal year begins and ends?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a comment about the \npractical effect that the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana will \nhave on the process once the balanced budget amendment passes.\n  I think this may be the serious constitutional infirmities that this \namendment could have, and when I say ``constitutional infirmities,'' \nwhat I believe the Senator's amendment will do is, by denying access, \nby denying access to the courts in this constitutional amendment, in a \nsense what we are doing is modifying the fifth amendment due process \nclause. You are saying we have no redress to this act--none--until \nCongress acts.\n  Now, I think the practical effect of that will be--and I think we are \nseeing within this body a lot of support for the courts keeping hands \noff, not reaching in--so what may happen, what I think there is high \nprobability of happening, is we will leave that alone. We, in fact, \nwill not implement. We will not provide. There is no requirement for \nMembers to do so. There is no reason for the Senate now to provide \naccess when, in fact, we have stated constitutionally they have no \naccess.\n  On the other side, if we do not have the Johnston amendment in place, \nit is incumbent upon Members to act because I think the Senator is \nright, we have left a big open question here. Now, it is our duty to \ndefine what avenues the court will have to address this constitutional \namendment.\n  I think what we have done here is take the Congress off the hook of \nhaving to come back, look at this question, debate it, find out \nspecifically what areas we are going to deal with or provide for the \ncitizenry, for Members of Congress, to address this issue in the \ncourts.\n  By this amendment we will, in fact, foreclose that discussion. I \nbelieve that discussion will not occur, or if it does occur, will not \nprevail, that we will feel most comfortable leaving the courts \ncompletely out of it. It has been passed in the constitutional \namendment. There will be no reason for Members to come here because we \nhave taken care of this issue.\n  If we leave it open, the issue will arise again. And I believe the \nSenator is absolutely right. There is such a question here. We will be \ndriven to provide specifically for that kind of redress in the court.\n  I think not only do we have a limitation of the due process clause of \nthe 5th amendment as a result of the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana, which I think is a red flag, No. 1. No. 2, we have in a \nsense decided this issue now maybe for a long period of time and \neliminated any prospect of judicial review for this legislation.\n  I do not think we are prepared to do that. I think we are prepared, \nat least what I hope most Members are prepared to do, is say, ``Let's \nleave this question open for us to go and then provide specific \nredresses in the implementing legislation to deal with this question. \nLet's be precise about it. Let's be limited about it but have a full \nand open discussion about it, not foreclose and slam the door for any \npossibilities of judicial overview,'' whatever limited amount it may \nbe.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Very briefly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What appropriate role would the Senator think the \ncourts ought to have?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think that is a discussion that we \nneed to have. I think that is a discussion that has to be talked about \nfar beyond the few hours of debate we have here on the Senate floor. We \nneed to look at whether we should limit it to declaratory judgment or \nwhether we should grant injunctive relief. All those kind of avenues. \nWho should we give standing to move these suits forward. All of those \ndiscussions, the particulars, need \n [[Page S2717]] to be dealt with in the implementing legislation.\n  If we pass the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana, I do not \nbelieve we will get there. I do not believe we get there because we \nhave already settled the issue and the courts do not have a role.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We say the courts do have a role to the extent we \nspecify.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But there is no incentive as a result of your amendment \nto specify. We have now kept them out of our affairs. There is no \nreason for Members to come back and give them access, where, if we did \nnot pass the amendment, it would be a broad open question as to what \nextent they could get involved.\n  It could be incumbent upon the Senate to protect our own viability as \na body, for the Senate to specifically chart out where they would. I \nthink any kind of implementing legislation--I think the Senator from \nWisconsin was right on this. If we, through implementing legislation, \nsaid they have no access, I think we would have constitutional problems \nwith that. We would have to provide some sort of limited access for \nsuit. Your amendment does not do that.\n  I think you run into very severe limitation on the due process \nclause. We are telling every citizen of this country that you cannot \nredress your Government through a constitutional amendment. I think \nthat is a real problem. I think that is one of the reasons I would be \nopposed to it.\n  The second is, I think it forecloses any future discussion on this \nmatter. I would be happy at this point to yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the hullabaloo is about the \nmodification of the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana applying \nonly to section 2, because the claim is the budgetary language is \ndifferent from the constitutional amendment language.\n  To me, that is such a trivialization of the debate that it is not \nfunny. If we have 67 people who will pass this amendment, we are \ncertainly going to have 51 votes to change any budgetary language we \nhave to in the implementing legislation.\n  Why should we get into a big scholastic--and by ``scholastic,'' we \nwill call it scholasticism -- how-many-angels-stand- on-head-of-a-pin \nargument in the debate over the constitutional amendment over that \nissue?\n  Now, if Members of Congress believe that the issue of standing and \nthe separation of powers and political question are not well defined by \nthe courts and well defined by better than a century of law on this \nsubject, then I can see where they might want to support the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana and his amendment here.\n  The law is so well defined and it is so clear in those areas. I think \nwe made the case earlier in the day that it is clear that I do not need \nto repeat it again at this particular point. I am hoping all Senators \nwill vote against this amendment. It is a mischievous amendment. It is \noffered to try to scuttle the balanced budget amendment, knowing that \nthere can always be made some argument about any term in any balanced \nbudget amendment or any amendment to the Constitution that others might \nagree or disagree on.\n  What we are talking about here is an amendment passed by 300 Members \nof the House of Representatives, the two-thirds-plus vote, for the \nfirst time in history. In my opinion, we simply cannot amend it further \nbecause of that historic vote and the fact that it is a bipartisan \nconsensus amendment by Democrats and Republicans that will work. These \nfrightful occurrences are not going to occur and everybody knows it.\n  The whole purpose of this amendment is, of course, to try to amend \nthis constitutional amendment which puts Members through the whole \nprocess again. Now the original amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana said, ``No court shall have the power to issue relief \npursuant to any case or controversy arising out of this article except \nas may be specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \nto this section.''\n  The modification, as I understand it, would add on to section 6 the \nfollowing:\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising out of this article except \n     for section 2 hereof, or as may be specifically authorized in \n     implementing legislation pursuant to this section.\n\n  We do not need to have litigation for section 2. We do not need to \nhave litigation for any aspect of it. I think under the rules of law \nthat have existed for well upward of a century, this is a false issue, \nand we should vote to table this particular amendment. I hope our \nSenators will do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am indebted to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] and the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] for helping work out this modification which I \nthink achieves very well the purposes that most Senators want to \nachieve on this floor, which is to ensure that the real biting \nenforcement and sanction of section 2 is preserved in this amendment so \nthat, as the Senator from Colorado said, section 2 is the real guts of \nthe enforcement and that remains here with the power of the court to \nenforce it.\n  But other than that, Mr. President, this amendment will provide that \nthe courts may not raise taxes and may not substitute their judgment \nfor that of the U.S. Congress.\n  It is to me an amazing circularity of logic that the opponents of the \namendment as modified have. They say, on the one hand, this is \nabsolutely clear, we know there is no standing to sue, we know there is \nno justiciable question; this is a political question which the courts \ncannot get into. But, on the other hand, there may be some cases where \nsome people will need to go to court and enforce this. But, on the \nother hand, it is absolutely clear. But, on the other hand, if we pass \nthis amendment, the Congress will never act because then it will be \nclear.\n  Well, Mr. President, it either is clear or it is not clear, and we \nknow what the real answer to that question is: It is intentionally \nambiguous, and in that ambiguity, we have mischief, because while what \nJudge Bork says is thousands of cases matriculating up through the \ndistrict courts and the courts of appeal of this country, while we are \nwaiting for those to be decided, the capital markets of this country, \nthe bond markets, the very fiscal essence of the country will be held \nin limbo while the court decides such arcane questions as whether this \nis a political question, whether there is standing to sue, or whether \nit is a justiciable issue.\n  We have the power to decide that issue now, to make it clear and \nunambiguous, which is, the courts do not have authority, except to the \nextent we give them authority.\n  Mr. President, we have between now and 2002--2002--to act to \nimplement this article. Section 6 says:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  If this Senate and this Congress can pass a constitutional amendment \nby a two-thirds vote, by 67 votes, surely it could pass simple \nimplementing legislation which requires only a simple majority. Why \nwould Congress ignore section 6, ignore its duty when it takes only a \nmajority vote, when we feel so strongly today that we are giving a two-\nthirds vote to the constitutional amendment? It does not make sense, \nand it does not add up.\n  If any Member believes, as I believe, that what the courts would \nreally do if they took jurisdiction is order a tax increase and then \nmaybe say, ``Congress, this will go into effect 60 days from now or 4 \nmonths from now unless you act''--I think that is what they would do \nbecause that is the only thing they have expertise to do. They do not \nhave the expertise to cut budgets, to decide between competing claims \nin a budget, but they sure do know how to order an income tax increase, \nbecause it takes no expertise. This amendment would prevent that; it \nwould deprive the courts of the ability to meddle in this \nconstitutional duty, which is properly the Congress', except to the \nextent that we authorize them to do so.\n  Mr. President, it clears up an intentional ambiguity. It loses no \nvotes. I believe this gets votes for this amendment, and it certainly \nmakes a better \n [[Page S2718]] amendment. I hope my colleagues will go along with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would be interested in whether it will \nget the vote of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana if this \namendment passes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I can tell the Senator from Utah what my \nconcern is about this amendment. There was a Treasury study which \nshowed that my State was more heavily impacted than any other State. It \nmade certain assumptions. It made the assumptions that defense would \nnot be cut, as the contract calls for; that Social Security would not \nbe cut, as everyone promised. It was a nationwide study, and it \ndetermined, as I recall, the cuts to Louisiana were something like $3 \nto $4 billion.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask the Senator to comment on his time?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Until I know what makes up the cuts, I cannot vote for \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have been through that argument already, \nand that is, we have never been able to tell where the cuts are up to \nnow. Until we get this into the Constitution, we never will. That is \nwhy we have to get it in the Constitution.\n  This is a bigger issue than any of our individual States. All of us \nare concerned about our States, all of us are concerned about what cuts \nor tax increases, but all of us need to be concerned about the future \nof this Nation, the future of our children and our grandchildren.\n  We have a Federal Government that is running away from us; it is out \nof control. We can debate these things forever. But under the Johnston \namendment, allowing suits under section 2 may allow the courts to relax \nthe standing rules that they have. It would be the exact opposite of \nwhat everybody in this body would like to see happen. It would be an \nindication to them we want them to relax standing rules. Presently, \ncourts will not allow standing to give relief that interferes with \nbudgetary processes, and I do not know anybody who would rebut that \nstatement.\n  Ironically, the Johnston amendment may allow the very thing he fears. \nI frankly do not know why anybody would want to vote for it who \nunderstands the implications of it, but let me just summarize our \nposition on this.\n  Senator Johnston's amendment would deny all judicial review to \nenforce the balanced budget amendment, except for section 2 which may \ngive an indication to the courts that they should relax the standing \nrequirements which means even more litigation all over this society, \nmore than ever before, and there would be no way you could stop it.\n  I believe it is an overreaction to a problem that simply does not \nexist, and to apply what happens in States--and there have not been \nmany suits in States--to apply that to this just is inapposite.\n  The ghost that haunts opponents of the balanced budget amendment is \nthat the judiciary will usurp Congress' power delegated to it by the \nConstitution over spending, borrowing, and taxing matters.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would----\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not have enough time or I would yield.\n  That horrible phantom will place the budgetary process under judicial \nreceivership, through its equitable powers, cut spending programs, and \neven order the raising of taxes, they say. But the apparition is simply \nmake believe; it is a bad dream. The courts simply do not have the \nauthority to usurp Congress' role in the budgetary process.\n  That unfounded phobia has its antidote in the time-honored precept of \nstanding and the political question and separation of powers doctrines. \nAs I said, these jurisprudential doctrines stand as impenetrable \nbarriers to the courts commandeering of the democratic process.\n  Besides, it is just wrong to think that Congress cannot and will not \nprotect its institutional prerogatives. The framers of the Constitution \ndesigned a constitutional system whereby each branch of government \nwould have the power to check the zeal of the other branches. In James \nMadison's words in the Federalist No. 51:\n\n       [T]he great security against a gradual concentration of the \n     several powers in the same department, consists in giving to \n     those who administer each department, the necessary \n     constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist \n     encroachments of others. The provision for defence must in \n     this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the \n     danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract \n     ambition.\n\n  Frankly, I find it utterly inconceivable, as a practical matter, that \nthe chairmen of congressional Appropriations, Budget, and Finance \nCommittees and subcommittees, and Congress as a whole, will stand idly \nby if some district court judge somewhere exceeds his or her authority \nand allows a case implicating this institution's budget and tax and \nspending prerogatives to proceed. Why, it defies belief that these \nSenators like Mark Hatfield, Robert Byrd, Pete Domenici, Jim Exon, and \nleaders like Robert Dole and Tom Daschle, and their counterparts in the \nother body, or any of us, would allow a court to tamper with \ncongressional prerogatives. Congress would do what it would have to do \nand moot any such case which even hinted at success. Does anyone doubt \nthis?\n  Moreover, to resist the ambition of the courts, the framers gave to \nCongress in article III of the Constitution the authority to limit the \njurisdiction of the courts and the type of remedies the courts may \nrender. If Congress truly fears certain courts may decide to ignore law \nand precedent, Congress--if it finds it necessary--may, through \nimplementing legislation pursuant to section 6 of House Joint \nResolution 1, forbid courts the use of their injunctive powers \naltogether. Or, Congress could create an exclusive cause of action or \ntribunal with carefully limited powers, satisfactory to Congress, to \ndeal with balanced budget complaints.\n  But Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nproposes, cutoff all judicial review. I believe that House Joint \nResolution 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial review. By \nremaining silent about judicial review in the amendment itself, its \nauthors have refused to establish congressional sanction for the \nFederal courts to involve themselves in fundamental macroeconomic and \nbudgetary questions. At the same time, this balanced budget amendment \ndoes not undermine the court's equally fundamental obligation, as first \nstated in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), to ``say what \nthe law is'' in those cases where standing exists and the separation of \npowers and political question doctrines do not bar the courts from \nproceeding. After all, while I am confident that courts will not be \nable to interfere with our budgetary prerogatives, I am frank to say I \ncannot predict every conceivable lawsuit which might arise under this \namendment, and which does not implicate these budgetary prerogatives. A \nlitigant, in such narrow circumstances, if he or she can demonstrate \nstanding, ought to be able to have their case heard.\n\n\n                          judicial enforcement\n\n  Nonetheless, I must underscore that keeping open the courthouse door \nto a litigant who is not seeking to interfere with the spending and \ntaxing powers of\n Congress, does not license the judiciary to interfere with budgetary \ndecisions. Because this issue is of great importance to my colleagues, \nI would like at some length to address the concern of some that under \nthe balanced budget amendment courts will become superlegislatures. \nIndeed, opponents march out a veritable judicial parade of horribles \nwhere courts strike down spending measures, put the budgetary process \nunder judicial receivership, and like Charles I of England, raise taxes \nwithout the consent of the people's representatives. All of this is a \n  gross exaggeration. This parade has no permit.I whole-heartedly agree \nwith former Attorney General William P. Barr who stated that if House \nJoint Resolution 1 is ratified there is ``little risk that the \namendment will become the basis for judicial micromanagement or \nsuperintendence of the federal budget process. Furthermore, to the \nextent such judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \nCongress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, moreover, \nwhatever remote risk there may be that courts will play an overly \nintrusive role in enforcing the amendment, that risk is, in my opinion, \nvastly outweighed by the benefits of such an amendment.''\n [[Page S2719]] standing, separation of powers, and political questions\n\n  There exists three basic constraints which prevent the courts from \ninterfering in the budgetary process: First, limitations on Federal \ncourts contained in article III of the Constitution, primarily the \ndoctrine of standing, particularly as enunciated by the Supreme Court \nin Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992); Second, the \ndeference courts owe to Congress under both the political question \ndoctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself, which confers \nenforcement authority in Congress; third, the limits on judicial \nremedies which can be imposed on a coordinate branch of government--in \nthis case, of course, the legislative branch. These are limitations on \nremedies that are self-imposed by courts and that, in appropriate \ncircumstances, may be imposed on the courts by Congress. These \nlimitations, such as the doctrine of separation of powers, prohibit \ncourts from raising taxes, a power exclusively delegated to Congress by \nthe Constitution and not altered by the balanced budget amendment. \nConsequently, contrary to the contention of opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, separation of power concerns further the purpose of \nthe amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance the budget \nfalls squarely on the shoulders of Congress--which is consistent with \nthe intent of the framers of the Constitution that all budgetary \nmatters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n  Concerning the doctrine of standing, it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must first demonstrate standing to \nsue. To demonstrate article III standing, a litigant at a minimum must \nmeet three requirements: First, injury in fact--that the litigant \nsuffered some concrete and particularized injury; second, \ntraceability--that the concrete injury was both caused by and is \ntraceable to the unlawful conduct; and third, redressibility--that the \nrelief sought will redress the alleged injury. This is the test \nenunciated by the Supreme Court in the fairly recent and seminal case \nof Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992). [See, \ne.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982).] In challenging \nmeasures enacted by Congress under a balanced budget regime, it would \nbe an extremely difficult hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate the \ninjury-in-fact requirement, that is, something more concrete than a \ngeneralized grievance and burden shared by all citizens and taxpayers. \nI want to emphasize that this is hardly a new concept. See Frothingham \nv. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923). Furthermore, courts are not going \nto overrule this doctrine since standing has been held to be an Article \nIII requirement. See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. \n26, 41 n.22 (1976).\n  Even in the vastly improbable case where an injury in fact was \nestablished, a litigant would find it nearly impossible to establish \nthe traceability and\n redressibility requirements of the article III standing test. \nLitigants would have a difficult time in showing that any alleged \nunlawful conduct--the unbalancing of the budget or the shattering of \nthe debt ceiling--caused or is traceable to a particular spending \nmeasure that harmed them. After all, there will be hundreds and \nhundreds of Federal spending programs even after Federal spending is \nbrought under control. Furthermore, because the Congress would have \nnumerous options to achieve balanced budget compliance, there would be \nno legitimate basis for a court to nullify or modify a specific \nspending measure objected to by the litigant.\n\n  As to the redressibility prong, this requirement would be difficult \nto meet simply because courts are wary of becoming involved in the \nbudget process--which is legislative in nature--and separation of power \nconcerns will prevent courts from specifying adjustments to any Federal \nprogram or expenditures. Thus, for this reason, Missouri v. Jenkins, \n495 U.S. 33 (1990), where the Supreme Court upheld a district court's \npower to order a local school district to levy taxes to support a \ndesegregation plan, is inapposite because it is a 14th amendment case \nnot involving, as the Court noted, ``an instance of one branch of the \nFederal Government invading the province of another.'' [Jenkins at 67.] \nPlainly put, the Jenkins case is not applicable to the balanced budget \namendment because section 1 of the 14th amendment--from which the \njudiciary derives its power to rule against the States in equal \nprotection claims--does not apply to the Federal Government and because \nthe separation of powers doctrine prevents judicial encroachments on \nCongress' bailiwick. Courts simply will not have the authority to order \nCongress to raise taxes.\n  Furthermore, the well-established political question and \njusticiability doctrines will mandate that courts give the greatest \ndeference to congressional budgetary measures, particularly since \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress \nthe responsibility of enforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows \nCongress to ``rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' See Baker v. \nCarr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962). Under these circumstances, it is \nextremely unlikely that a court would substitute its judgment for that \nof Congress.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the taxpayer standing case, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83 (1968), is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. First, the Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court \nto establishment clause cases. This has been made clear by the Supreme \nCourt in Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 480. Second, by \nits terms, Flast is limited to cases challenging legislation \npromulgated under Congress' constitutional tax and spend powers when \nthe expenditure of the tax was made for an illicit purpose. Sections 1 \nand 2 of House Joint Resolution 1, limit Congress' borrowing power and \nthe amendment contains no restriction on the purposes of the \nexpenditures. Finally, in subsequent cases, particularly the Lujan \ncase, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the need for a litigant to \ndemonstrate particularized injury, thus casting doubt on the vitality \nof Flast. [See Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2136.]\n  I also believe that there would be no so-called congressional \nstanding for Members of Congress to commence actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Although the Supreme Court has never addressed the \nquestion of congressional standing, the D.C. circuit has recognized \ncongressional standing, but only in the following circumstances: First, \nthe traditional standing tests of the Supreme Court are met, second, \nthere must be a deprivation within the zone of interest protected by \nthe Constitution or a statute--generally, the right to vote on a given \nissue or the protection of the efficacy of a vote, and third, \nsubstantial relief cannot be obtained from fellow legislators through \nthe enactment, repeal, or amendment of a statute--the so-called \nequitable discretion doctrine. See Melcher v. Open Market Comm., 836 \nF.2d 561 (D.C. Cir 1987); Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, 656 \nF.2d 873 (D.C.\n Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981). Because Members of Congress \nwould not be able to demonstrate that they were harmed in fact by any \ndilution or nullification of their vote--and because under the doctrine \nof equitable discretion, Members would not be able to show that \nsubstantial relief could not otherwise be obtained from fellow \nlegislators through the enactment, repeal or amendment of a statute--it \nis hardly likely that Members of Congress would have standing to \n challenge actions under the balanced budget amendment.the fourteenth \n              amendment and the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Furthermore, some of my colleagues contend that because section 6 of \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, the section that mandates that Congress \nenforce the amendment through implementing legislation, is similar to \nsection 5 of the 14th amendment, which permits Congress to enforce that \namendment, courts will also be able to enforce the balanced budget \namendment to the extent courts enforce the 14th amendment.\n  This analogy is misleading. First, courts may only enforce an \namendment when legislation or executive actions violate the amendment \nor when Congress creates a cause of action to enforce the amendment. An \nexample of the latter is 42 U.S.C., section 1983, the 1871 Civil Rights \nAct that implements section 1 of the 14th amendment. Of \n [[Page S2720]] course, Congress has not created, and need not create, \nan analogous cause of action under section 6 of the balanced budget \namendment, so there is no direct judicial enforcement provision in \nexistence similar to section 1983.\n  Second, as to the judicial nullification of legislation or executive \naction that is allegedly inconsistent with a constitutional amendment, \nthe case-or-controversy provision of article III requires that a \nlitigant demonstrate standing. As I have stated at great length already \nduring this debate, it is very improbable that a litigant could \ndemonstrate standing under the balanced budget amendment--that the \nlitigant could demonstrate a particularized injury, different from the \ngeneralized harm facing any citizen or taxpayer. Contrast this with \ncases under the 14th amendment where standing was found because a \nlitigant could demonstrate a particular, individualized, and concrete \nharm, as in the one man, one vote case. See Reynolds v. Sims, 369 U.S. \n186 (1962).\n  Third, in this circumstance, as I previously explained, under the \nseparation of powers doctrine, courts will not entertain a suit where \nthey cannot supply relief to the litigant. Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992). The Constitution under article I \ndelegates to Congress taxing, spending, and borrowing powers. These are \nplenary powers that exclusively and historically have been recognized \nas belonging to Congress. The balanced budget amendment does not alter \nthis. Courts, consequently, will be loathe to interfere with Congress' \nbudgetary powers. It is simply an exaggeration to contend that courts \nwill place the budgetary process under receivership or cut spending \nprograms.\n  Fourth, as I also explained, the political question doctrine will \ndeter courts from enforcing the balanced budget amendment. Budgetary \nmatters--such as where to cut programs or how to raise revenues--are\n prototypically a political matter best left to the political branches \nof government to resolve. Courts, under the political question \ndoctrine, will leave these matters to Congress.\n\n\n                 congress' power to restrain the courts\n\n  Finally, it is simply wrong to assume that Congress would just sit by \nin the unlikely event that a court would commit some overreaching act. \nBelieve me, Congress knows how to defend itself. Congress knows how to \nrestrict the jurisdiction of courts or limit the scope of judicial \nremedies. But I do not think this necessary. Lower courts follow \nprecedents, and the precepts of standing, separation of powers, and the \npolitical question doctrine, effectively limit the ability of courts to \ninterfere in the budgetary process.\n  Nevertheless, if necessary, a shield against judicial interference is \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 itself. Under this section, \nCongress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any purported \nbudgetary shortfall, such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency fund. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear \nthat Congress, if it finds it necessary, could limit the type of \nremedies a court may grant or limit courts' jurisdiction in some other \nmanner to proscribe judicial overreaching. This is nothing new. \nCongress has adopted such limitations in other circumstances pursuant \nto its article III authority. Here are a few: First, the Norris-\nLaGuardia Act, [29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101-115], where the courts were \ndenied the use of injunctive powers to restrain labor disputes; Second, \nthe Federal Tax Injunction Act, [28 U.S.C. sec. 2283], which contains a \nprohibition on Federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings; \nand third, the tax Injunction Act, [26 U.S.C. sec 7421(a)], where \nFederal courts were prohibited from enjoining the collection of taxes.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit judicial review of particular \nspecial tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. For instance, \nthe Supreme Court in Yakus v. United States, [319 U.S. 182 (1943)], \nupheld the constitutionality of a special emergency court of appeals \nvested with exclusive authority to determine the validity of claims \nunder the World War II Emergency Price Control Act. In more recent \ntimes, the Supreme Court, in Dames & Moore v. Reagan, [453 U.S. 654 \n(1981)], upheld the legality of the Iranian-United States Claims \nTribunal as the exclusive forum to settle claims to Iranian assets.\n  Beyond which, as I have mentioned earlier, in the virtually \nimpossible scenario where these safeguards fail, Congress can take \nwhatever action it must to moot any case in which a risk of judicial \noverreaching becomes real.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that the enforcement concerns \nabout the balanced budget amendment do not amount to a hill of beans. \nThe fear of the demon of judicial interference is exorcised by the \nreality of over a century of constitutional doctrines that prevent \nunelected courts from interfering with the power of the democratic \nbranch of government and that bestow Congress with the means to protect \nits prerogatives.\n  Mr. President, it is very clear. I do not think we should amend this \namendment, certainly not with the language the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana has brought forth here, which will lead us to more \nlitigation than ever before in worse ways than ever before, and a \nreduction in the amount of Congress' power that currently exists, \nespecially when we can easily change it in the implementing legislation \nwithout any problems.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute, just simply to \nreply to the argument that somehow this language would do away with the \nrequirement for standing.\n  Mr. President, all this language says is that the judicial power of \nthe United States shall not extend to a case in controversy under this \narticle except for section 2.\n  Now, I invite a comparison with the present language of the \nConstitution which says:\n\n       The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and \n     equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the \n     United States, and treaties made.\n\n  Now, under the language of the Constitution which says the judicial \npower shall extend to cases, controversies, et cetera, the court has \nrequired standing. It is the same language that we have in this \namendment. Whatever requirement the court will find for standing under \nthis amendment is the same language that inheres under the \nConstitution. And so, Mr. President, there is no expansion of standing \nunder section 2 under our amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. It seems to me the argument of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Utah comes down to a very simple set of inconsistent propositions. \nProposition No. 1, courts are not going to get involved in enforcing \nthis amendment. Proposition No. 2, we ought to have the courts involved \nin enforcing this amendment.\n  I just simply do not believe that Members can have it both ways. If, \nin fact, courts are going to stay out by reason of standing or other \nvarious doctrines which are not themselves contained in the \nConstitution, then it certainly does no harm to see to it that that is \nthe result.\n  If, in fact, it is the proposition of the proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment, some of the proponents because I am one of \nthem, that courts should be involved, then it seems to me they are \ndoing something in this field that almost without exception they \ndeprecate in other fields. Judicial activism should not be invited into \nthe process of writing budgets of the United States. That is a \nlegislative and executive function.\n  The reason for the amendment is that the Senator from Louisiana, \ntogether with this Senator, wants to make certain that this remains \nsolely a function of Congress and of the executive branch of \nGovernment. And all Members who feel that the courts may very well be \ntoo active today in many social and political issues should vote in \nfavor of the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n   [[Page S2721]] Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I \nthank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding 2 minutes to me.\n  Mr. President, very quickly, I want to commend my friend from \nLouisiana, Senator Johnston, for offering this amendment this \nafternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the most important \namendments and one of the most critical decisions that we will make \nduring the debate on the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to have and to require a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I want to make two quick points. First, I think if the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana is defeated by this body this \nafternoon, two things are going to happen. I think the first thing is \nthat this is going to be seen by the courts as an actual invitation to \ncome forward and start implementing the balanced budget to the \nConstitution of the United States, assuming that two-thirds of the \nSenators agree and that three-fourths of the States support the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The second thing, Mr. President, I say in all due respect, that I \nthink is going to happen, is that the courts will look at the defeat of \nthe Johnston amendment that we are now considering and are about to \nvote on, as having established legislative intent--should we defeat \nthis amendment. And I only assume that the courts would ultimately \ndeclare that the Senate had decided, through the process of \nestablishing legislative intent, that the courts would be the proper \nimplementing authority to implement the balanced budget clause of the \nConstitution of the United States; the balanced budget amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So I see two very bad things coming as a result, Mr. President.\n  If I could have 1 additional minute, Mr. President?\n  I thank my friend from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I see two very bad things happening if we turn down the \nJohnston amendment. I think the Johnston amendment is sound. I think if \nyou could take a poll of the country today and ask the people if they \nwant the courts to implement a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, if they want an unelected lifetime \nappointed Federal district judge from wherever to raise the taxes \nnecessary to implement a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nor in the Constitution, most people would say no. I say that if we fail \nto support, this afternoon, the very fine, clarifying amendment offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana, there could be a disastrous effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 17 minutes. The \nSenator from Utah has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Louisiana and \nthe Senator from Washington. These are two Senators who have different \npositions on the underlying amendment but who have come in very strong \nagreement on the need to clarify an ambiguity. Whatever side of the \nissue we are on, the underlying issue, we cannot in good conscience \nessentially leave a critical ambiguity in the Constitution as to how it \nis going to be enforced and whether or not the courts are going to be \nable to enforce this document.\n  The Senator from Utah, in whom I have a great deal of confidence and \ntrust as a person of honor, says that it is very clear the courts \ncannot interfere with the budgetary process. And that is his intent. \nWhen he says it, as he has a number of times, I accept this as being \nhis intent.\n  The difficulty is the lead sponsor of this language in the House \nseems to have a very different intent. So we are caught in an \nambiguity. The ambiguity is not just between law professors. The \nambiguity is between the language of the sponsor of this amendment that \nis before us in the House and the lead sponsor in the Senate, on the \nvery important questions of standing to sue and what a court can do.\n  Representative Schaefer, in a formal answer for the Record--not a \ncasual comment but a formal answer for the Record--he says the courts \ncould invalidate individual appropriation or tax acts. I read this \nearlier this afternoon. I had it blown up so we could all see exactly \nwhat it is that he has said. ``The courts could make only a limited \nrange of decisions on a limited number of issues.''\n  What are they? ``They could invalidate an individual appropriation or \ntax act. They could rule as to whether a given act of Congress or \naction by the executive violated the requirements of this amendment.'' \nPerhaps he describes that as a limited range of decisions but surely \nthat is a major intrusion in the budgetary processes of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  I wish the intention were clear. I wish it were clear for the sake of \na constitutional amendment which may be adopted.\n  For many other reasons I hope it will not be. I am one of those who \nopposes it for a number of reasons. But whatever side of the \nconstitutional amendment issue we are on, it is incumbent on us to have \nlanguage which is clear as to the heart of the matter, which is the \nenforcement of it. Over and over again we have stated the intention to \nbalance the budget. The heart of the matter is can it be enforced and, \nif so, how will it be enforced? What is the mechanism to enforce it? \nThe Johnston amendment clarifies the question of whether courts will \ntake over legislative functions, such as individual appropriation acts \nor tax acts.\n  This is not a casual comment by one person who is voting for the \namendment in the other body. This is a formal statement for the \nRecord--one of many, by the way, which differs from the sponsors here--\nfor instance on questions of standing. It is----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does it not follow, if you have the power to invalidate \na tax act, that you also have a power to order a tax?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that may well follow. But if you can invalidate an \nappropriation act or a tax act you are deep in the budgetary process.\n  Representative Schaefer has said that a Member of Congress, \n``probably would have standing to file suit.'' That is a formal answer \nto a formal question, ``probably would have standing.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to if I have time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just one sentence. Congressman Schaefer, as sincere as he \nwas, is not a lawyer. His life's work has been in public relations. He \nwas simply wrong. I do not see anybody--I do not know anybody who would \nargue that they can invalidate individual appropriations or tax acts. \nHe may have been very sincere making that statement. He was simply \nwrong.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe the Senator from Idaho put the exact same \nanswers in the Record on this side, in the Congressional Record.\n  This is not a casual answer in a colloquy during a debate. These are \nformal answers, the questions and answers for the Record by the chief \nsponsor of the constitutional amendment that we are voting on. This was \nnot something he threw off on his way to a press conference. This is \nformal. I am reading the Congressional Record in the House, on page \n8754 here, and I am reading it precisely. It is--this is a long \ndocument of questions and answers for the Record.\n\n       The courts could invalidate an individual appropriation or \n     tax act.\n\n  On the question of standing, if we could get the other quote up here \non the question of standing--this is what Representative Schaefer said.\n\n       A Member of Congress or an appropriate administration \n     official probably would have standing to file suit.\n\n  The Senator from Utah--and I take his word. I know--it is not his \nintent. \n [[Page S2722]] When he looks me in the eye and he tells me what his \nintent is, no question, I accept it. I know him well. But it is very \ndifferent from what Representative Schaefer, who is the prime sponsor \nof this amendment, is telling us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I have one minute? I am out of time. I do not know if \nthe Senator from Utah wants to ask me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could. I do not know Representative Schaefer very \nwell. But I do know his experience in these matters is somewhat \nlimited. The fact that somebody puts something in the Record, albeit as \nsponsor of the amendment--this amendment has been around a long time. \nHe was cosponsor of it. That does not mean he, or anyone else, wrote \nit.\n  But let us just talk in terms of what is really involved here.\n  The contention, for instance, that the balanced budget amendment \nwould allow Federal courts to offer the raising of taxes is absolutely \nwithout merit. It is based on a misunderstanding of the case of \nMissouri versus Jenkins, which was a 14th amendment case.\n  In that case the Supreme Court in essence approved, by a 5-to-4 vote, \na lower court remedial order directing State or county political \nsubdivisions to raise taxes to support a court-ordered school \ndesegregation order. The lower court had previously found that the \nschool district had engaged in intentional segregation, in violation of \nthe 14th amendment's equal protection clause.\n  The concern that the balanced budget amendment would allow a Federal \ncourt to order Congress to raise taxes to reduce the deficit is plainly \nwithout merit. Why? Because Jenkins is a 14th amendment case. Under the \n14th amendment jurisprudence, Federal courts may perhaps issue this \ntype of remedial relief to force the equal protection clause against \nthe States, but certainly not against Congress, a coequal branch of \nGovernment. The 14th amendment, of course, does not apply to the \nFederal Government.\n  No. 2, separation-of-powers concerns would prohibit the judiciary \nfrom interfering with the budgetary, taxing, borrowing, and spending \npowers that are exclusively delegated to Congress by the Constitution.\n  And, three, Congress simply cannot be made a party-defendant. To \norder taxes to be raised, Congress would have to be named a defendant. \nPresumably, suits to enforce the balanced budget amendment would arise \nwhen an official or an agency of the executive branch seeks to enforce \nor administer a statute whose funding is in question in light of the \namendment. In the case of Riegle versus Federal Open Market Committee, \nthe court noted that ``when a plaintiff alleges injury by \nunconstitutional actions taken pursuant to a statute, his proper \ndefendants are those acting under the law * * * and not the legislature \nwhich enacted the statute.''\n  So, I respect Congressman Schaefer, but he just simply is wrong on \nthose statements, and the law says he is wrong.\n  Mr. President, let me just switch for a minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Biden be recognized to offer an amendment on \ncapital budgeting following the disposition of Senator Johnston's \namendment and Senator Byrd be recognized to offer an amendment \nfollowing the disposition of Senator Biden's amendment. I also ask \nunanimous consent that there be a time limit on the Biden amendment \nprior to a motion to table as follows: 90 minutes under Senator Biden's \ncontrol, 20 minutes under Senator Hatch's control; and, that at the \nconclusion or yielding of time, the majority leader or his designee be \nrecognized to offer a motion to table the Biden amendment and that no \nother amendments be in order prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat it not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania 5 minutes.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 7 seconds.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had asked the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana to yield me time because the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, asked me if I could get time. I have \nnot made up my mind yet on the matter, but I wanted to express my \nconcerns about the pending issue's repealability and have some ideas \nfrom the manager as to where the issue stood.\n  While this floor debate has been in process, the Judiciary Committee \nhas been meeting in the Antitrust Subcommittee on the baseball issue. \nThe pending amendment makes it plain that there will not be Federal \ncourt jurisdiction, that the judicial power of the United States shall \nnot extend in any case or controversy arising under this article except \nsection 2 here, which may be specifically authorized in implementing \nlegislation pursuant to this section.\n But I inquire of the Senator from Louisiana what the exception for \n  section 2 refers to.Mr. JOHNSTON. Section 2 provides that the limit \non the debt of the United States held by the public shall not be \nincreased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall \nprovide for that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. That is very limited exception. \nThere is no jurisdiction. The issue of jurisdiction concerns me \ngreatly. Earlier this year, I argued a case at the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States involving the Base Closure Commission. The issue was \nwhether Federal courts had jurisdiction of the matter. I had the \noccasion to do very extensive research on the jurisdictional question. \nIt is my view that there ought not to be jurisdiction in the Federal \ncourts on the compliance with the constitutional amendment. This is a \nduty on the Congress.\n  There is the possibility of extensive litigation, and we ought to \nmake our position clear on that in one way or another.\n  If I may have the attention of the Senator from Utah. I understand \nthe concerns the Senator from Utah has in not wanting to have \namendments added to the bill because that subjects the issue to \nconference, but the question I have of the managers of the measure is \nwhat is the import of the absence of this amendment? Will there be \njurisdiction of the Federal courts, I first inquire of my colleague \nfrom Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, first of all, it is not just the concern about going \nto conference, it is a concern about the House wanting to pass the \nbalanced budget again with this amendment in it. We are not sure where \neverybody is there. Second, if we do go to conference, we are not sure \nwe can hold on to it. Even so, third, the amendment now, as modified, \nsays, ``The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any \ncase or controversy arising under this article except for section 2 \nhereof.'' That has now been put into the amendment, which worries us.\n  If section 2 is opened up for litigation, then the courts may take \nthat as an implication that we will permit their lessening of the \nstanding requirements and other requirements. So we think that makes it \neven worse and that would create even more litigation than the Senator \nis talking about.\n  Last but not least, we are very concerned that if you cut off \nlitigation rights for cases, which I personally cannot conceive of at \nthis point, but as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nunderstands, with his experience in the law, there may be real rights \nthat may have to be brought in the courts for particularized injuries \nto individuals. Those are the reasons.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask my colleague from Utah, if the language exception \nas to section 2 were removed, would the amendment be agreeable?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, it still would not be because of the other reasons. It \nstill \n [[Page S2723]] would not be agreeable because we believe it is a false \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator wish another minute?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It depends on how long Senator Hatch's answer is.\n  Mr. HATCH. It will be at least a minute. We do not believe that we \nhave to fear the courts in this matter, because of the principle of \nstanding, and the doctrines of justiciability, the political question \nand separation of powers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if I may have 30 seconds more, is it the view of \nmy colleague from Utah, the manager of the measure, that there would be \nno Federal jurisdiction, no jurisdiction in the Federal courts even \nwithout this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not sure I understand the question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if this amendment is defeated, could the U.S. \ncourts entertain jurisdiction in a suit that is brought challenging the \nfollowing or compliance with the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget?\n  Mr. HATCH. Only if the court is extremely activist and not willing to \nfollow the law.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Only if the court is----\n  Mr. HATCH. There may be jurisdiction, but there will not be any \nstanding. That is the difference. It would take a very activist judge, \nwho I think would be slapped down very quickly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If you are going to rely on standing, the vagaries of \nthat issue, or a defense that may be advanced to stop somebody from \ngoing into court, that is very perilous ground. I think it is advisable \nfor this body to face the jurisdictional issue squarely. I think we \nought to say whether or not we wish the Federal courts to have \njurisdiction over compliance with the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has \none of the best legal minds in this body, has put his finger directly \non the question. It is not clear whether there would be standing, \njusticiability, or whether it would be a political question. But the \nmajority of the opinions I have seen indicate that there would be such \nstanding. The Harvard Law Review demonstrates, however, that taxpayers \nprobably would have standing to challenge. Professor Tribe, Judge Bork, \nand on and on, Mr. President. The better view is that there probably is \nstanding that the courts would interfere, but it is not clear and it \nought to be cleared up. That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Louisiana has \n4\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from Utah has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I ask the date of that law review article?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Harvard Law Review, 1983.\n  Mr. HATCH. That preceded the Lujan case. The law review articles \nprecede that case and are not applicable.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it not \nbe charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the Johnston amendment because \nit is unnecessary and based on false premises. Under the constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment before us, the Congress will have the \nauthority to enforce the balanced budget amendment. All issues \nregarding the implementation and enforcement of the amendment will be \nresolved through implementing legislation.\n  A constitutional amendment necessarily is limited to general \nprinciples. It cannot spell out all issues that could arise under that \namendment. Many constitutional amendments provide that Congress can \nenforce the provision through appropriate legislation. House Joint \nResolution 1 follows in that tradition.\n  I agree that any litigation that might be brought under this \namendment should be resolved expeditiously. But the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana is not necessary to achieve that result. \nCongress can set the appropriate jurisdiction of the Federal courts. \nCongress can pass implementing legislation that provides for Federal \ncourt actions only. And it can provide for expedited review of lower \ncourt decisions and set forth the available relief.\n  However, Congress cannot adopt the suggestion of the Senator from \nLouisiana that Congress could give the Supreme Court original \njurisdiction to hear a case under the balanced budget amendment. The \nSupreme Court ruled in Marbury versus Madison that Congress cannot \nexpand the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\n  Only litigants with standing to challenge governmental action under \nthe amendment would be able to file a lawsuit under the requirements of \narticle III. Some few individuals might have standing. Even these \nindividuals, however, would not be able to require a judicial \nresolution of their cases if the Court concludes that the case raises a \npolitical question.\n  Under the political question doctrine, courts will not decide cases \nraising issues that appropriately fall within the authority of the \nother two branches. For example, the Constitution guarantees a \nRepublican form of government.\n  But the courts have refused to issue decisions in cases raising that \nconstitutional provision because its enforcement appropriately lies \nwithin the authority of the political branches. Similarly, courts have \nrefused to intervene in challenges to the President's authority over \nforeign affairs.\n  Many of the questions raised under this amendment would also be \npolitical ones that courts would not rule on.\n  All the supporters of the balanced budget amendment are concerned \nwith the idea of courts potentially making tax and spending decisions. \nWe intend that courts not do that. And we will pass implementing \nlegislation to address the process by which any litigation can be \nbrought. There is no need to preclude judicial enforcement pending the \nenactment of that implementing legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Johnston \namendment.\n  I am not a lawyer, but legal and constitutional experts I trust and \nrespect have convinced me that the supposed problem with judicial \nreview is, at best, no problem at all; and, at worst, it is a red \nherring that may give some Senators an excuse to vote no on the BBA.\n  I start with Senator Hatch, an outstanding constitutional lawyer. If \nthere were a risk of judicial intrusion into legislative matters, he \nwould be the down here arguing for an amendment to restrict the power \nof the courts.\n  I am convinced that there is no risk of improper court action. \nOtherwise, I would be the first Senator down here supporting a limit on \njudicial review.\n  I am persuaded by the testimony of former Attorney General William \nBarr. To summarize what he said:\n  There is a remote risk of judicial micromanagement; if judicial \nintrusion arose, Congress could correct it by statute;\n  The remote, correctable risk was far outweighed by the need for, and \nthe benefits of the balanced budget amendment;\n  There would rarely--if ever--be standing to sue;\n  The Constitution, the balanced budget amendment itself, and long-\nestablished judicial and constitutional doctrines all require the \ncourts to pay great deference to Congress' handling of legislative \nbusiness, especially when Congress acts affirmatively to establish \nstatutory processes to enforce and implement the amendment.\n  Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a Democrat from the Carter \nadministration appeared before the Judiciary Committee this year to \nstrongly endorse the balanced budget amendment.\n  In a 1992 memo to Representative L.F. Payne on this subject, the \nLincoln Legal Foundation said this:\n\n       [[Page S2724]] (T)here is virtually no danger that the \n     constitutional balanced budget amendment . . . would cede the \n     power of the purse to a runaway judiciary. To the contrary, \n     it would eliminate certain authorities that courts currently \n     have to order the disbursement of federal funds without \n     appropriations.\n\n  Last year, in testimony, attorney John C. Armor told the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n  The balanced budget amendment a suitable addition to the \nConstitution;\n  Limited judicial review was appropriate;\n  Congress is already empowered in the Constitution to limit judicial \nintrusion appropriately through statute.\n  Finally, I refer to an excellent brief memo by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce that summarizes how judicial action will be limited \nappropriately.\n  I am tired of opponents to the balanced budget amendment citing the \nMissouri v. Jenkins case.\n  I agree that Missouri v. Jenkins was decided wrongly; but that case \nhas nothing to do with the legal or constitutional considerations \naround this amendment.\n  That was a case of Federal pre-emption. That was a case of the \nFederal courts enforcing Federal law on a local school district.\n  Let us look at our Constitution:\n  Article I says, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States * * *''\n  Raising taxes is a legislative power.\n  Writing budgets and setting priorities is a legislative power.\n  Article III says: ``* * * the Supreme Court shall have appellate \njurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under \nsuch regulations as the Congress shall make.''\n  Let us look at the amendment itself:\n  Section 6 says Congress will enforce and implemented the BBA;\n  Section 6, by expressly allowing good faith reliance on reasonable \nestimates, allows Congress reasonable flexibility and reduces the \nlikelihood of second-guessing by the courts;\n  Section 2, by subjecting Congress to 3/5 votes on the limit on\n   debt held by the public, makes the amendment essentially self-\nenforcing and locates that self-enforcement squarely in Congress.\n\n  No other amendment to the Constitution removes the courts from the \nprocess of enforcement.\n  In fact, the very, very slight chance that some case may come before \nthe courts is a good thing; it will motivate Congress to make sure we \ncomply with the amendment and stay out of court. It will reassure \nAmerican people that the same branches of Government that built up a \n$4.7 trillion debt, will at least have the legality of their actions \nsubject to fair and impartial interpretation.\n  At the same time, judicial involvement will be limited to, in the \nwords of Marbury versus Madison, ``saying what the law is.'' They may \nstrike down a piece of budget legislation--we may be told to go back \nand start over. They may rule whether an action by the President is or \nis not contrary to the amendment.\n  It does not mean the courts can write a budget or raise taxes. But \ninterpreting the law is the job of the courts. Congress can enact \nreasonable limitations on judicial review. All of which is appropriate, \nlimited, and balanced.\n  As Senator Brown has pointed out, the experience of the States with \nthat flood of lawsuits has never materialized.\n  Finally, as Senator Simon has said, if we balance the budget, if we \nrun small surpluses, if we take care to vote on the issues the \namendment says to vote on, we will never be hauled into court.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the various documents that I have just \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n   Statement of William P. Barr, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n       Hearings on the Balanced Budget Amendment, January 5, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee: I \n     am honored to have been invited today to testify on the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       You have asked me to discuss whether judicial enforcement \n     of the Amendment would result in undue interference by the \n     federal courts in the budget process.\n       In my view, though it is always difficult to predict the \n     course of future constitutional law development, the courts' \n     role in enforcing the Balanced Budget Amendment will be quite \n     limited. I see little risk that the Amendment will become the \n     basis for judicial micromanagement or superintendence of the \n     federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the Amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, \n     moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that courts will \n     play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, \n     that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by the \n     benefits of such an Amendment.\n       I believe there are three basic constraints that will tend \n     to prevent the courts from becoming unduly involved in the \n     budgetary process: (1) the limitations on the power of \n     federal courts contained in Article III of the Constitution--\n     primarily the requirement of standing; (2) the deference \n     courts would owe to Congress, both under existing \n     constitutional doctrines, and particularly under section 6 of \n     the amendment itself, which expressly confers enforcement \n     responsibility on Congress; and (3) the limits on judicial \n     remedies running against coordinate branches of government, \n     both that the courts have imposed upon themselves and that, \n     in appropriate circumstances, Congress may impose on the \n     courts.\n       I will discuss each of these constraints in turn. Before I \n     do, however, let me note that my remarks will focus on \n     sections 1 and 2 of the Amendment. It is these provisions \n     that would create new limits on Congress' power to borrow and \n     to expend borrowed funds, and those new limits may \n     potentially give rise to new opportunities for courts to \n     intrude themselves into the budgetary process in ways they \n     currently cannot. Section 4 of the Amendment, in contrast, \n     presents no such new opportunity or risk for judicial \n     interference in the budgetary process. Section 4 merely adds \n     further procedural requirements for the passage of revenue \n     bills, and courts today already may entertain claims that \n     revenue bills (either taxes or user fees) do not comply with \n     clear constitutional procedures.\n\n\n                       i. article iii limitations\n\n       Article III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction \n     of the federal courts to ``Cases'' or ``Controversies.'' As \n     an essential part of this case-or-controversy limitation, any \n     plaintiff who hopes to invoke the judicial power of the \n     federal courts must demonstrate sufficient ``standing.''\n       Although the Court has not been completely consistent is \n     defining this doctrine, its fundamental principles remain \n     clear. At an irreducible minimum, a plaintiff must show three \n     things to satisfy the standing requirement: (1) ``injury in \n     fact''--that he personally has suffered some concrete and \n     particularized injury; (2) ``traceability''--that the \n     particularized injury was caused by, and is fairly traceable \n     to, the allegedly illegal conduct; and (3) \n     ``redressibility''--that the relief sought will likely \n     redress the plaintiff's injury. E.g., Lujan v. Defenders of \n     Wildlife, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992); Valley Forge \n     Christian College v. Americans United For Separation of \n     Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982); Simon v. \n     Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, \n     38, 41 (1976).\n       Basically, we can anticipate two kinds of court challenges \n     relating to sections 1 and 2 of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment: (1) a claim that a particular budgetary action \n     (such as a spending or borrowing measure) violates the \n     Amendment or its implementing statutes by ``unbalancing'' the \n     budget or by exceeding the applicable debt limit, or (2) a \n     claim that one of the implementing mechanisms enacted by \n     Congress pursuant to section 6 of the Amendment is itself in \n     violation of section 1 or 2. In either case, I believe, few \n     plaintiffs would be able to establish the requisite standing \n     to invoke federal court review.\n    \n    \n       The ``injury in fact'' requirement alone would be an \n     imposing hurdle. It is fundamental that, to establish \n     ``injury in fact,'' a plaintiff cannot rely on generalized \n     grievances and burdens shared by all citizens and taxpayers, \n     but rather must be able to show a particularized injury that \n     he has distinctively sustained. No private citizen or group \n     would have standing to obtain judicial enforcement of the \n     Amendment solely by virtue of their status as a citizen or \n     taxpayer. Their supposed injury--the burden of deficit \n     spending and increased debt--is shared by all taxpayers and \n     is precisely the kind of ``generalized grievance'' to which \n     the judicial power does not extend. As the Supreme Court \n     recently reiterated: ``As an ordinary matter, suits premised \n     on federal taxpayer status are not cognizable in the federal \n     courts because a taxpayer's `interest in the moneys of the \n     Treasury . . . is shared with millions of others, is \n     comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon \n     future taxation, or any payments out of the funds, so remote, \n     fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for \n     [judicial intervention].''' Asarco, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. \n     605, 613 (1989) (quoting Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, \n     487 (1923)).\n       Moreover, even in the case where a plaintiff could \n     establish ``injury in fact''--by showing, for example, that a \n     specific budgetary action causes particularized and distinct \n     harm to him--it would still be difficult for that plaintiff \n     to satisfy the remaining two elements of Article III \n     standing--the traceability and redressibility requirements. \n     Given the myriad components of any budget, most plaintiffs \n     would be unable to show that the putatively illegal conduct--\n     the \n      [[Page S2725]] unbalancing of the budget or the breaking of \n     the debt ceiling--was ``caused'' by, and hence is fairly \n     traceable to, the particular spending measure that has \n     allegedly harmed them. Moreover, a plaintiff would be hard \n     put to demonstrate redressibility because the political \n     branches would have numerous ways to achieve compliance with \n     the Amendment--other than by eliminating the specific measure \n     harming the plaintiff. There would thus be no legitimate \n     basis for a court to single out and strike down the specific \n     spending measure to which the plaintiff objects.\n    \n    \n       I should for a moment address the case of Flast v. Cohen, \n     392 U.S. 83 (1968), where the Supreme Court, 27 years ago, \n     allowed a taxpayer to mount an Establishment Clause challenge \n     against federal aid to parochial schools. Flast is the only \n     instance where the Court has departed from its rigorous \n     restriction on taxpayer standing. Flast plainly has no \n     application to the present context and would not authorize \n     general taxpayer standing to seek judicial enforcement of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. First, the Court has never \n     identified any constitutional restriction on the powers of \n     Congress other than the Establishment Clause that might \n     support an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer \n     standing. Moreover, by its terms, Flast is limited to cases \n     challenging congressional action taken under its tax-and-\n     spending power (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1 of the Constitution) \n     when the expenditure of tax revenue is made for an illicit \n     purpose. In contrast, sections 1 and 2 of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment limit Congress' borrowing power (a separate power, \n     enumerated in Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 2) and contains no \n     restriction on the purposes of congressional expenditures. \n     The Court has expressly declined to extend Flast beyond the \n     exercise of Congress' power under Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1 to \n     other fiscal provisions. See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian \n     College, 454 U.S. at 480. And finally, in subsequent cases, \n     the Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed to need for all \n     plaintiffs to demonstrate particularized injury, thus casting \n     doubt on the continued vitality of Flast. I cannot see the \n     Court resurrecting and extending Flast in the context of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       There remains the question whether, by virtue of their \n     office, Members of Congress can establish standing where a \n     private citizen could not. The Supreme Court has never \n     recognized congressional standing, and forceful arguments \n     have been advanced against it. See Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d \n     21, 41-51 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Bork, J., dissenting), vacated as \n     moot sub nom. Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361 (1987). Those \n     lower courts that have allowed congressional standing have \n     limited it in ways that would greatly restrict its use in \n     efforts to enforce the Balanced Budget Amendment. First, \n     Members must demonstrate that they have suffered injury in \n     fact by dilution or nullification of their congressional \n     voting power. In addition, Members must still satisfy the \n     other requirements of Article III standing, including the \n     traceability and redressibility requirements. And finally, \n     under the doctrine of ``equitable discretion,'' recognized by \n     the D.C. Circuit, Members must show that substantial relief \n     could not otherwise be obtained from fellow legislators \n     through the enactment, repeal or amendment of a statute. See \n     Melcher v. Federal Open Market Comm., 836 F.2d 561, 563 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1987).\n       Even if the legitimacy of congressional standing, in \n     principle, were ultimately accepted by the Supreme Court, I \n     would expect that doctrine would have narrow application in \n     the context of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Even if a \n     circumstance arose where a Member could meet the first two \n     requirements, it seems that, absent a serious and clear \n     abuse, the equitable discretion doctrine would militate \n     strongly against allowing congressional standing. This is not \n     like the Pocket Veto cases where the Executive has allegedly \n     ``nullified'' a Member's vote; here it is Congress itself \n     that is taking the challenged action. If the doctrine of \n     ``equitable discretion'' has any force, it should apply to \n     limit judicial actions by individual Members who wish to \n     challenge enforcement of the Congress' own budgetary \n     decisions, since the real grievance of the congressional \n     plaintiffs in such a case would be the failure to persuade \n     their fellow legislators of the correctness of their point of \n     view. See Moore v. United States House of Representatives, \n     733 F.2d 946, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. \n     1106 (1985); Riegle v. Federal Open Market Comm., 656 F.2d \n     873, 881 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1082 (1981).\n    \n    \n       It is obvious from this discussion that I view Article \n     III's standing requirement as a principal safeguard against \n     undue judicial activism in this area. But I would be the last \n     to say that the standing doctrine is an ironclad shield \n     against judicial activism. The doctrine is malleable and it \n     has been manipulated by the courts in the past. There is a \n     clear trend, however, toward narrowing the parameters of \n     constitutional standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n     supra; Valley Forge Christian College, supra. Furthermore, we \n     can anticipate that the congressional budgetary process is \n     not likely to be a field where the courts would be eager to \n     stretch the doctrine. The federal budget and the public debt \n     limits do not typically implicate sensitive individual \n     rights, and thus there may be less temptation for courts to \n     apply the standing requirements more loosely. In addition, \n     courts are not expert at fathoming the ins and outs of \n     budgetary arcana, and there is no reason to think they would \n     be so inclined to enter that thicket as to manipulate \n     standing principles to do so. Nevertheless, the possibility \n     remains. One way to minimize the risk of such judicial \n     activism is for Congress to take care in the wording of any \n     particular statutes that are enacted in implementing the \n     Amendment so as not to give rise to colorable claims of \n     standing or private rights of action.\n       Before moving on, I should also point out for the Committee \n     one area that I believe does hold some potential for mischief \n     and that Congress may wish to address. That is the area of \n     state court review. The constraints of Article III do not, of \n     course, apply to state courts, which are courts of general \n     jurisdiction. State courts are not bound by the ``case or \n     controversy'' requirement or the other justiciability \n     principles, even when deciding issues of federal law, \n     including the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. \n     Asarco, Inc., 490 U.S. at 617. Accordingly, it is possible \n     that a state court could entertain a challenge to a federal \n     statute under the Balanced Budget Amendment despite the fact \n     that the plaintiffs would not satisfy the requirements for \n     standing in federal court. Absent an applicable provision in \n     federal law for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts, \n     the state court in such a circumstance would have the \n     authority to render a binding legal judgment. Ibid. The only \n     avenue for federal review would be by certiorari to the \n     Supreme Court, which has held that it may exercise its \n     discretionary jurisdiction in such cases ``if the judgment of \n     the state court causes direct, specific, and concrete injury \n     to the parties who petition for * * * review, where the \n     requisites of a case or controversy are also met.'' Id. at \n     623-24.\n       To avoid the possibility that a federal statute or the \n     federal budgetary process itself might be entangled in such a \n     state court challenge, I would suggest that Congress include \n     a provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction in any \n     implementing legislation enacted pursuant to section 6 of the \n     Amendment. Such a provision should be carefully worded so as \n     not to create inadvertently any implied right of judicial \n     review in federal court and so as not to affect any of the \n     otherwise applicable limitations on justiciability discussed \n     in this statement.\n\n\n                         ii. judicial deference\n\n       Let me now turn to the second factor that will constrain \n     judicial overreaching. In those cases where standing is \n     established and the court proceeds to review the merits of a \n     claim under the Balanced Budget Amendment, there is no reason \n     to believe that the court would readily second-guess \n     decisions made by the political branches. On the contrary, \n     following long-established doctrine, as well as the \n     Amendment's own explicit dictates, a reviewing court is \n     likely to accord the utmost deference to the choices made by \n     Congress in carrying out its responsibilities under the \n     Amendment.\n       This judicial deference would be strongest in cases \n     challenging the implementing mechanisms adopted by Congress. \n     The Balanced Budget Amendment, in essence, mandates certain \n     results (balanced budgets and capped debt) and leaves it to \n     Congress to put in place mechanisms to achieve those results. \n     It is well-established that where the Constitution requires a \n     certain ``end,'' Congress will be given the widest latitude \n     in selecting ``means'' to achieve that end. Thus, for \n     example, the courts have accorded broad deference to Congress \n     in its selection of appropriate enforcement mechanisms under \n     section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Katzenbach v. \n     Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966). And in the context of the \n     apportionment process, where the Constitution mandates in \n     fairly precise terms that Representatives shall be \n     apportioned among the several States ``according to their \n     respective Numbers'' (Art. I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3), the Supreme \n     Court has deferred to Congress' choice of the method for \n     apportionment, even though a State adversely affected could \n     demonstrate that another method might yield a more accurate \n     result. See U.S. Dep't of Commerce v. Montana, 112 S. Ct. \n     1415, 1429 (1992).\n       The need for deference would be even more compelling in \n     cases under the Balanced Budget Amendment, since the language \n     of the Amendment explicitly confers on Congress, in mandatory \n     terms, the responsibility for implementing the Amendment and \n     specifically allows Congress in so doing to ``rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts'' (emphasis added). Unless \n     the implementing and enforcement provisions adopted by \n     Congress are plainly incompatible with the Amendment, it is \n     unlikely a court would substitute its judgment for choices \n     made by Congress.\n       Even in challenges to specific budgetary actions--for \n     example, a claim that a particular spending measure threatens \n     to unbalanced the budget--the courts would tend to defer to \n     the judgments of the political branches, except where a \n     constitutional violation is clear. Not only do courts start \n     with the general presumption that Congress has acted \n     constitutionally, see Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. \n     Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 729 (1984), but that general rule \n     of deference is substantially reinforced by the Amendment's \n     explicit assignment of implementation responsibility to \n     Congress in section 6, including the express recognition that \n     Congress may rely on estimates--a process \n      [[Page S2726]] that inherently involves discretionary and \n     expert judgments. It is precisely when reviewing these kinds \n     of technical fiscal issues--matters uniquely within the \n     province and expertise of the political branches--where the \n     courts are most inclined to defer to the sound judgment of \n     the Congress and the Executive.\n       In sum, then, even where the courts reach the merits of a \n     claim under the Balanced Budget Amendment, we are far more \n     likely to see deference to Congress than heavy-handed second-\n     guessing by the courts. This is not to say that courts will \n     ignore clear instances of abuse; however, it is precisely in \n     such cases--in which the violations are not arguable but \n     palpable--where judicial intervention is most appropriate.\n\n\n                  ii. limitations on judicial remedies\n\n       For the reason outlined above, I am confident the courts \n     will entertain very few suits challenging congressional \n     actions under the Balanced Budget Amendment, and that, when \n     and if they do, the courts will be inclined to defer to the \n     judgments of Congress and the\n      Executive in the budget area. Assuming, however, that a \n     court might entertain such a suit and might declare a \n     particular budgetary action unconstitutional as a \n     violation of the Amendment, there are still further \n     judicial constraints making it unlikely a court will order \n     intrusive remedies in such a case. As I see it, these \n     constraints fall into two categories: prudential \n     considerations that will limit a court's exercise of its \n     remedial powers and limitations created by section 6 of \n     the Amendment itself.\n       First, courts are appropriately wary of becoming too deeply \n     involved in superintending decisions and processes that are \n     essentially legislative in character, and for that reason, \n     any court--most certainly the Supreme Court--will hesitate to \n     impose remedies that could embroil it in the supervision of \n     the budgetary process. Indeed, in the context of the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment, the choice of any specific remedy--for \n     example, an order specifying a particular adjustment of \n     expenditures to bring the federal budget back into compliance \n     with the Amendment--would invariably require the court to \n     displace Congress by making a policy decision that is \n     inherently legislative and therefore inappropriate for the \n     courts. I believe it far more likely that a court faced with \n     a violation of the Amendment would take the less intrusive \n     route of simply declaring the particular action at issue \n     unconstitutional and leaving it to Congress to choose the \n     appropriate remedy.\n    \n    \n       There are plenty of cases in which the Supreme Court has \n     followed this route. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 \n     U.S. 1 (1976), the Court declared the composition of the \n     Federal Election Commission unconstitutional as a violation \n     of the Appointments Clause, but stayed the Court's judgment \n     to ``afford Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the \n     Commission by law or to adopt other valid enforcement \n     mechanisms'' that would remedy the violation. Id. at 143. And \n     recently, in Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 113 S. Ct. \n     2510 (1993), where the Court refused to order refund of the \n     amounts improperly collected and held instead that the \n     fashioning of an appropriate remedy was properly left to \n     state authorities. See id. 2519-20.\n       Even in cases where there has been a proven violation of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court has required the same \n     respect for a legislature's ability to devise remedies \n     involving the exercise of the legislature's taxing authority. \n     In Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), the Court \n     confirmed that ``the imposition of a tax increase by a \n     federal court,'' even as a remedy for racial segregation by a \n     state school district, must be ``an extraordinary event.'' \n     Id. at 51. ``In assuming for itself the fundamental and \n     delicate power of taxation,'' the Court held, ``the District \n     Court not only intruded on local authority but circumvented \n     it altogether. Before taking such a drastic step the District \n     Court was obliged to assure itself that no permissible \n     alternative would have accomplished the required task.'' \n     Ibid. According to the Court, ``the very complexity of the \n     problems of financing and managing a * * * public school \n     system suggests that * * * the legislature's efforts to \n     tackle the problems should be entitled to respect'' and that \n     ``local officials should at least have the opportunity to \n     devise their own solutions to these problems.'' Id. at 52 \n     (internal quotation marks removed). The Court in Jenkins \n     upheld the district court's power to order a local school \n     district to levy its own taxes because such a levy was the \n     only means by which the school district could raise funds \n     adequate to comply with the court's desegration order. See \n     id. at 55-58. That could never be the case with any potential \n     violation of the Balanced Budget Amendment, which imposes a \n     cap on spending and the public debt, rather than an \n     obligation to raise revenues. There will always be a myriad \n     of policy choices available to Congress for avoiding \n     infringement of the budget cap.\n       Jenkins is also readily distinguishable from the context of \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment on the ground that Jenkins did \n     not involve ``an instance of one branch of the Federal \n     Government invading the province of another,'' but instead \n     involved a court order ``that brings the weight of federal \n     authority upon a local government and a State.'' Id. at 67 \n     (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \n     judgment). The distinction is critical because under Article \n     I, Section 1, ``[a]ll legislative Powers'' granted under the \n     Federal Constitution are vested in Congress, and the \n     enumeration of legislative powers begins by providing that \n     ``[t]he Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes'' \n     (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1). Based on these provisions, the Court \n     has stated that ``[t]axation is a legislative function, and \n     Congress * * * is the sole organ for levying taxes.'' \n     National Cable Television Ass'n v. United States, 415 U.S.C. \n     336, 340 (1974). See Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. at 67 \n     (Kennedy, J.).\n       A second source of limitations on the courts' exercise of \n     their remedial powers is found in the Amendment itself. Under \n     section 6, which provides that ``[t]he Congress shall enforce \n     and implement this article by appropriate legislation,'' \n     Congress will have the authority to adopt remedies for any \n     purported violation of the Amendment. Congress, for example, \n     could provide for correcting a threatened budget imbalance or \n     overspending through sequestration, rescission or other \n     devices. In addition, section 6 logically gives Congress the \n     power to limit the types of remedies that might be ordered by \n     a court. This power is consistent with Article III's \n     delegation of authority to Congress to define and limit the \n     jurisdiction of the federal courts, and would allow Congress, \n     for example, to deny courts the ability to order injunctive \n     relief for violations of the Amendment. Congress has adopted \n     such limitations in other contexts. See, e.g., Norris-\n     LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101-115 (prohibiting \n     courts from entering injunctions in labor disputes); Federal \n     Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2283 (prohibiting federal \n     courts from enjoining state court proceedings); Tax \n     Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7421(a) (prohibiting suits to \n     restrain the assessment or collection of taxes).\n       These powers given to Congress will compound the courts' \n     self-imposed prudential concerns, with the result that the \n     courts will be even more hesitant to order intrusive remedies \n     for ostensible violations of the Amendment. Courts regularly \n     defer to remedies that have been crafted by Congress. This \n     deference is shown even in cases involving the vindication of \n     individual rights. The Supreme Court, for example, has held \n     that Congress may adopt procedures limiting the remedies \n     available in so-called Bivens actions, which are actions \n     brought against federal officials for the violation of an \n     individual's constitutional rights. See Bush v. Lucas, 462 \n     U.S. 367, 388-90 (1983). Similarly, in devising a judge-made \n     remedy for violations of the Fifth Amendment privilege \n     against self-incrimination in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. \n     436 (1966), the Court recognized that ``Congress and the \n     States are free to develop their own safeguards'' to redress \n     violations of the privilege and that such alternative \n     remedies woud be respected by the courts. See id. at 490. \n     Moreover, even if Congress does not exercise the authority \n     granted to it under section 6, the courts will undoubtedly be \n     aware of Congress' ability to limit the relief that courts \n     may grant, and this awareness in and of itself will likely \n     check any tendency on the part of the courts to develop their \n     own creative remedies for violation of the balanced budget \n     requirement.\n\n\n                      IV. The Amendment's Efficacy\n\n       Some have suggested that the federal courts' limited role \n     in enforcing the Balanced Budget Amendment makes the \n     Amendment a ``paper tiger.'' Their premise is that, unless \n     the courts are there to coerce compliance at every turn, the \n     political banches will flout their constitutional \n     responsibilities. These critics do not argue for a greater \n     role for the courts so much as they dismiss the Amendment as \n     a feckless exercise. In my view, this critique is mistaken: \n     it is based on a distorted view of the Constitution and \n     ignores the practical experience of over two centuries.\n       First, of course, the point is not that the courts will \n     never be there; it is that we need not fear an avalanche of \n     litigation, with the courts regularly reviewing fiscal \n     decisions and effectively usurping the proper functions of \n     the political branches. Where the judicial power can properly \n     be invoked, it will most likely be reserved to address \n     serious and clearcut violations.\n       More importantly, Members of Congress and Presidents seek \n     to conform their actions to constitutional norms, not because \n     of external threats of judicial coercion, but primarily \n     because of their own difelity to constitutional prinicples. \n     After all, it is not only judges who must take an oath of \n     allegiance to the Constitution. Just as the vast majority of \n     citizens obey the law because they wanted to--not because \n     they fear the police--so too those who serve in the political \n     branches feel constrained by constitutional requirements and \n     strive to obey them, whether backed by judicial sanction or \n     not. Congress, for example, has dutifully provided for a \n     census every ten years since the 1790s, as required by the \n     Constitution, without court order. Even in an area as \n     unreviewable and murky as the War Powers, the political \n     branches strive to comply with constitutional norms. And the \n     Senate has always administered responsibly its sole power to \n     try cases of impeachment, without allowing such trials to \n     degenerate into Kangaroo courts, even though the exercise of \n     that power is not subject to the check of judicial review. \n     See Nixon v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 732 (1993). As Judge \n     Williams put it in the Nixon case:\n       ``If the Senate should ever be ready to abdicate its \n     responsibilities to schoolchildren, or, moved by Caligula's \n     appointment of his horse as senator, to an elephant from the \n     National Zoo, the republic will have sunk to \n      [[Page S2727]] depths from which no court could rescue it. \n     And if the senators try to ignore the clear requirement of a \n     two-thirds vote for conviction, they will have to contend \n     with public outrage that will ultimately impose its sanction \n     at the ballot box. Absent judicial review, the Senate takes \n     sole responsibility for its impeachment procedures as a full-\n     fledged constitutional actor, just as the framers intended.'' \n     Nixon v. United States, 938 F.2d 239, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1991) \n     (footnote omitted), aff'd, 113 S. Ct. 732 (1993).\n       For over 200 years, day after day, the business of \n     government has gone forward in prescribed channels, with \n     judicial enforcement the exception, not the rule. The \n     Balanced Budget Amendment will be effective without judges \n     hovering at Congress' elbow; the Congress will carry it out \n     and it will achieve its intended results.\n       Finally, we can rest assured that the Amendment will be \n     policed through the most effective enforcement mechanism of \n     all--the watchfulness and wrath of the American people. After \n     all, the requirements of the Balanced Budget Amendment are \n     not like those of the Appointments Clause or the Emoluments, \n     Clause, which could be violated with virtually no political \n     fallout. Rather, they touch upon one of the core political \n     concerns of the people. Does anyone seriously maintain that \n     Congress could thumb its nose at a constitutional balanced \n     budget requirement with impunity? Or play fast-and-loose with \n     it and escape political retribution? It is precisely in areas \n     like this, where the political check is so potent, that we \n     can safely trust in its efficacy.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Statement of Griffin B. Bell, Senate Judiciary Committee, Balanced \n         Budget Amendment to the Constitution, January 5, 1995\n\n       The missing element in our constitutional system is the \n     absence of a provision requiring a balanced budget, provided \n     reasonable safeguards are in place to protect the national \n     defense and to assure the national interest in the event of a \n     depression.\n       Almost all the states have a balanced budget requirement in \n     their respective State Constitutions. This is the safeguard \n     which assures State financing only for services which are \n     within the states' abilities to pay.\n       The federal government completely controls the money \n     machine in the sense that it can borrow funds without limit. \n     There is no inherent self-discipline built into the system. \n     The only limit on federal spending is in the collective will \n     of the Congress and the President. The federal debt is now so \n     high that the country is, in effect, under normal rules, in \n     bankruptcy. But the federal government does not have to \n     declare bankruptcy. It can continue to borrow money to pay \n     the interest on the debt and to continue to borrow money over \n     and above the principal amount already owed. We long ago \n     began using Social Security taxes as a part of the general \n     fund to support this debt load, contrary to the belief of \n     most Americans that Social Security taxes were being put into \n     a trust fund for their future needs.\n       Without a constitutional restraint, there is no hope \n     whatever of paying off the present debt, much less for \n     stopping the creation of additional debt. We should be \n     thankful for today's low interest rates, else we would have a \n     greater economic crisis on our hands.\n       In the famous letters between Lord McCaulay of England and \n     Henry Stevens Randall, the first Jefferson biographer, and in \n     particularly the letter dated May 23, 1857, Lord McCaulay \n     expressed concerns about the lack of controls on the fisc.\n       He said, and I quote: ``I seriously apprehend that you \n     will, in [a] season of adversity . . . do things which will \n     prevent prosperity from returning; that you will act like \n     people who [would], in a year of scarcity, devour all the \n     seed corn, and thus make the next year a year, not of \n     scarcity, but of absolute famine. There will be, I fear, \n     spoilation. The spoilation will increase the distress. The \n     distress will produce fresh spoilation. There is nothing to \n     stop you. Your Constitution is all sail and no anchor.''\n       McCaulay was correct. Without a constitutional amendment \n     requiring a balanced budget, our Constitution truly is all \n     sail and no anchor. The lack of an anchor has placed our \n     country in the peril that it is now in because of our \n     monstrous and increasing debt and ever escalating \n     entitlements.\n       I have never heard anyone suggest that we begin to pay off \n     our debt. It would not be out of reason to set the debt aside \n     and retire it on a sinking fund basis, just as is done with \n     state and municipal bonds at the present time. The debt could \n     be gradually reduced once the budget is balanced by including \n     a payment on the principal of the debt, thus reducing \n     interest payments which make up a large part of our federal \n     budget.\n       In this way, we would pay the debt of our own generation, \n     rather than transferring it to our children and \n     grandchildren.\n       The other example of lack of discipline on the part of our \n     law makers is the cost-of-living index and its impact on the \n     debt. The cost-of-living index is a self-fulfilling prophecy \n     for annual inflation, particularly when the cost-of-living \n     index seems to produce a figure which is always higher as to \n     most people than actual inflation. The Congress can revamp \n     the cost-of-living index to make it the same or less than the \n     actual rate of inflation. This alone would go a long way \n     toward bringing the budget in balance over a few years.\n       There is something sinister about basing entitlements of \n     all kinds on an automatic cost-of-living index, particularly \n     when the index is higher than the actual inflation. This is a \n     giveaway scheme of the worst sort and exceeds any reasonable \n     basis of governing.\n       Thus, a combination of a balanced budget amendment to our \n     Constitution, with savings on interest over time and with a \n     gradual reduction in debt principal, coupled with an \n     adjustment of the cost-of-living index will restore fiscal \n     sanity to our government.\n       We must begin to speak in plain English when referring to \n     our debt. It will not do to speak of mere reductions in the \n     deficits as savings.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 The Lincoln Legal Foundation,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 5, 1992.\n     Hon. L.F. Payne,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Payne: On behalf of the Lincoln Legal Foundation, \n     let me extend my thanks to you for providing this opportunity \n     to comment on the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment outlined \n     in H.J. Res. 290. We at the Foundation take pride in serving \n     as advocates for the broad public interest in defending \n     liberty, free enterprise, and the separation of powers. It is \n     in this capacity that we have undertaken our evaluation of \n     the proposed Amendment.\n       We have confined our remarks to the prospects for judicial \n     enforcement of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Critics have \n     charged that the Amendment will unleash an avalanche of \n     litigation, thereby paving the way for the micro-management \n     of budgetary policy by the federal judiciary. As defenders of \n     the Madisonian system of checks and balances, we at the \n     Foundation take such charges seriously and have scrutinized \n     them in light of the relevant case law.\n       We begin with a brief overview of standing doctrine and its \n     impact on the justiciability of the proposed Amendment. We \n     then consider the political question doctrine and the \n     barriers it creates to judicial review. We conclude with our \n     recommendations for refining and implementing the Amendment.\n\n\n            i. standing under the balanced budget amendment\n\n       Standing refers to a plaintiff's interest in the issue \n     being litigated. Generally speaking, in order to have \n     standing a plaintiff must have a direct, individualized \n     interest in the outcome of the controversy at hand. Persons \n     airing generalized grievances, common to the public at large, \n     invariably lack standing.\n       Limitations on standing stem from two sources. Article III \n     Section II of the Constitution restricts the jurisdiction of \n     the federal judiciary to ``cases'' and ``controversies.'' As \n     a result, only plaintiffs with a personal stake in the \n     outcome of a particular case have standing to litigate. The \n     general prohibition against advisory opinions also can be \n     traced to Article III.\n       In addition to Article III restrictions, federal courts \n     have outlined certain ``prudential'' restrictions on \n     standing, premised on non-constitutional policy judgments \n     regarding the proper role of the judiciary Unlike Article III \n     restrictions on standing, prudential restrictions may be \n     altered or overridden by Congress.\n       Standing requirements under the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will vary according to the type of litigant. \n     Potential litigants fall into three categories: (1) Members \n     of Congress, (2) Aggrieved Persons (e.g. persons whose \n     government benefits are reduced or eliminated by operation of \n     the Amendment), and (3) Taxpayers.\n\n                         A. Members of Congress\n\n       The federal courts by and large have denied standing to \n     members of Congress to litigate issues relating to their role \n     as legislators.\\1\\ Only when an executive action has deprived \n     members of their constitutional right to vote on a \n     legislative matter has standing been granted.\\2\\\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n       Accordingly, Members of Congress are unlikely to have \n     standing under the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment, unless \n     they can claim to have been disenfranchised in their \n     legislative capacity. Assuming that Congress does not ignore \n     the procedural requirements set forth in the Amendment, the \n     potential for such disenfranchisement seems remote.\n\n                          B. Aggrieved persons\n\n       Standing also seems doubtful for persons whose government \n     benefits or other payments from the Treasury are affected by \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment. In order to attain standing, \n     such persons must meet the following Article III \n     requirements: (1) They must have sustained an actual or \n     threatened injury; (2) Their injury must be traceable to the \n     governmental action in question; and (3) The federal courts \n     must be capable of redressing the injury.\\3\\\n       Assuming a plaintiff could meet the first two requirements, \n     he still must show that the federal courts are capable of \n     dispensing a remedy. Judicial relief could take the form of \n     either a declaratory judgment or an injunction. A declaratory \n     judgment, stating that Congress has acted in an \n     unconstitutional manner, would do little to redress the \n     plaintiff's injury. On the other hand, injunctive relief \n     could pose a serious threat to the separation of powers.\n       For example, an injunction ordering Congress to reinstate \n     funding for a particular program would substantially infringe \n     upon \n      [[Page S2728]] Congress's legislative authority. Similarly, \n     an injunction ordering all government agencies to reduce \n     their expenditures by a uniform percentage - would undermine \n     the independence of the Executive Branch. It is unlikely that \n     the present Supreme Court would uphold a remedy that so \n     blatantly exceeds the scope of judicial authority outlined in \n     Article III.\n\n                              C. Taxpayers\n\n       Taxpayers may have a better chance of attaining standing \n     under the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment. Traditionally, \n     the federal courts refused to recognize taxpayer standing. \n     However, in 1968 the Warren Court held in Flast v. Cohen that \n     a taxpayer plaintiff does have standing to challenge \n     Congress's taxing and spending decisions if the plaintiff can \n     establish a logical nexus between his status as a taxpayer \n     and his legal claim.\\4\\\n       The logical nexus text consists of two distinct elements. \n     First, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the congressional \n     action in question was taken pursuant to the Taxing and \n     Spending Clause of Article I Section 8 of the Constitution. \n     Second, the plaintiff must show that the statute in question \n     violates a specific constitutional restraint on Congress's \n     taxing and spending power.\\5\\\n       Taxpayers suing under the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment probably could meet both prongs of the logical \n     nexus test.\\6\\ In order to satisfy the first prong, potential \n     litigants would have to tailor their complaint to challenge \n     the unconstitutional enactment of a law by Congress (e.g. an \n     appropriations bill), not the unconstitutional execution of a \n     law by the Executive. Litigants could satisfy the second \n     prong by demonstrating that the statute in question violates \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment, an express restriction on \n     Congress's taxing and spending power.\n       Even if a taxpayer satisfies Flast's logical nexus test, \n     more recent opinions like Valley Forge suggest that the \n     Supreme Court also would expect taxpayer plaintiffs to \n     fulfill the Article III standing requirements. In other \n     words, in order to have standing, a taxpayer would have to \n     demonstrate that he has sustained an actual or threatened \n     injury traceable to a specific congressional action.\n       In theory, a taxpayer could claim that excess spending in \n     violation of the Balanced Budget Amendment will harm him by \n     undermining the national economy or by increasing the \n     national debt. However, a majority of the Supreme Court \n     probably would find the connection between the excess \n     spending and the alleged injuries too tenuous to grant \n     standing. As a result, standing would be limited to taxpayers \n     with concrete injuries, stemming directly from the \n     congressional action in question.\n         ii. the amendment and the political question doctrine\n\n       Even if a litigant attained standing under the proposed \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, a federal court could refuse to \n     hear the case on the grounds that it raises a political \n     question. The leading case with respect to political \n     questions remains Baker v. Carr.\\7\\ In Baker, the Supreme \n     court held that the constitutionality of a state legislative \n     apportionment scheme did not raise a political question. In \n     doing so, the Court identified a number of contexts in which \n     political questions may arise.\n       Foremost among these are situations in which the text of \n     the Constitution expressly commits the resolution of a \n     particular issue to a coordinate branch of government. The \n     Judicial Branch will refrain from adjudicating an issue in \n     such circumstances. However, this textual constraint would \n     not preclude judicial review of the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, since H.J. Res. 290 does not assign responsibility \n     for enforcing the Amendment to either the President or the \n     Congress.\n       The Baker court also identified the following prudential \n     consideration in deciding whether to invoke the political \n     question doctrine as a bar to judicial review:\\8\\\n       (A) Is there a lack of discernable or manageable judicial \n     standards for resolving the issue?\n       (B) Can the court resolve the issue without making an \n     initial policy determination that falls outside the scope of \n     judicial authority?\n       (C) Can the court resolve the issue without expressing a \n     lack of respect for the coordinate branches of government?\n       (D) Will judicial intervention result in multifarious \n     pronouncements on the same issue from different branches of \n     government?\n       Each of these considerations creates an impediment to \n     judicial review of the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment. In \n     particular, courts may find the fiscal subject matter of the \n     Amendment difficult to administer. For example, what happens \n     if ``estimated receipts'' fall short of projections halfway \n     through a fiscal year? On what data and accounting methods \n     would the courts be expected to rely? Given the lack of \n     concrete standards, apparently rudimentary determinations \n     (e.g. When do ``total outlays'' exceed ``estimated \n     receipts''?) may prove beyond the competence of the \n     judiciary.\n       Moreover, the potential judicial remedies for violations of \n     the Amendment may undermine the separation of powers. As \n     discussed above, various forms of injunctive relief almost \n     certainly would infringe upon the prerogatives of Congress \n     and the Executive Branch. Given the Supreme Court's \n     structuralistic adherence to the separation of powers \n     doctrine in cases like I.N.S. v. Chadha\\9\\ and Bowsher v. \n     Synar,\\10\\ it is almost impossible to imagine a majority of \n     the justices on the present, or a future, Court jumping at \n     the opportunity to become embroiled in a partisan wrangle \n     over the size and scope of the federal budget. Instead, one \n     would expect the Court to make every effort to avoid such an \n     intrusion.\n\n\n                            iii. conclusions\n\n       The constraints imposed by standing requirements and the \n     political question doctrine by no means preclude judicial \n     review of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Nevertheless, they \n     do place substantial barriers to litigation. In light of \n     these impediments, the Foundation believes that the prospects \n     for a flood of new litigation and the specter of budgeting by \n     judicial fiat have been greatly exaggerated.\n       The Amendment proposed in H.J. Res. 290 would clearly \n     invite judicial review of any spending or taxing legislation \n     purportedly enacted in violation of the formal requirements \n     (e.g. a supermajority for increasing the debt limit, a full \n     majority on recorded for a tax increase) set forth in the \n     text. This is no different from the status quo, for even now \n     we would expect a court to strike down an act that was \n     somehow enrolled on the statute books without having properly \n     cleared the requisite legislative process of votes, \n     presentment, and the like.\n       What the Amendment would not do is to confer upon the \n     judiciary an authority to substitute its own judgment as to \n     the accuracy of the revenue estimates, the needfulness of \n     taxes, or the prudence of a debt limit. The courts would \n     merely police the formal aspects of the work of the political \n     branches: Did they enact a law devoted solely to an estimate \n     of receipts? Are all outlays held below that estimate? Were \n     measures passed by requisite majorities voting, when \n     required, on the record?\n       Sections 2 and 4 of the proposed amendment clearly invite \n     only limited judicial scrutiny of this kind, and then only of \n     the process, and not of the substance, by which the political \n     branches have acted?\n       Section 3 seems to be purely hortatory, and probably \n     provides no predicate at all for judicial action. Whatever \n     the political ramifications of a failure on the part of a \n     President to propose a balanced budget in any given year may \n     be, there appear to be no legal implications whatsoever. No \n     act of law-making depends in any constitutional sense upon \n     the President's compliance with this requirement, let alone \n     upon the substance that any such proposal may contain.\\11\\\n       Section 1 is the crucial text, then, but even here the \n     boundaries of justiciability would be tightly limited. A \n     purported enactment might be struck down by the courts if it \n     provided for outlays of funds in excess of the level of \n     estimated receipts established for the year in the annual \n     estimates law, or if it called for such an excessive outlay \n     without having been passed on a roll-call vote by the \n     required super-majority, or if it attempted to avoid the \n     balanced budget limit applicable to the fiscal year of its \n     enactment by purporting to be within the limits of receipts \n     estimated for another year, past or future.\n       But there is no basis in the text of Section 1 for a court \n     to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions on \n     any basis. That is, the proposed amendment would confer no \n     authority on the judiciary to choose which appropriations \n     would be satisfied from the Treasury and which would not, but \n     only to say that once outlays had reached the level \n     established in the estimates law then the officials of the \n     Treasury must cease disbursing any additional funds.\n       Because Section 6 of the proposed amendment would define \n     ``total outlays'' to ``include all outlays of the United \n     States Government except for those for repayment of debt \n     principal,'' the amendment would abolish permanent indefinite \n     appropriations, revolving funds, and the funds, such as the \n     Judgment Fund, from which they are disbursed.\\12\\ This would \n     decisively prevent the courts from invading the Federal fisc \n     in the guise of damages awards against the United States \n     Government. Upon effectuation of this amendment, damages \n     awards against the Government in all cases (except for \n     repayment of debt principal) would have to be part of the \n     outlays voted each year by Congress, and the current \n     congressional practice of waiving the sovereign immunity of \n     the United States on a blanket basis in the adjudication of \n     various kinds of damages against the Government would have to \n     end.\n       In short, it is our view that there is virtually no danger \n     that the constitutional balanced budget amendment \n     contemplated by H.J. Res. 290 would cede the power of the \n     purse to a runaway judiciary. To the contrary, it would \n     eliminate certain authorities that courts currently have to \n     order the disbursement of Federal funds without \n     appropriations. If ratified and made part of the \n     Constitution, the balanced budget amendment would return \n     responsibility and accountability for all Federal outlays \n     squarely to the Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Joseph A.

But the practice, even with the constitutional \n     sanction that H.J. Res. 290 would give it, in no way \n     derogates from the responsibility of Congress to account for \n     the power of the purse or from the procedural rules adopted \n     by the Framers for safeguarding the separation of powers \n     respecting the fisc, such as the requirement that bills for \n     raising revenue originate in the House of Representatives. \n     The President would now have a constitutional duty to propose \n     an annual balanced budget, but his submission would be only a \n     proposal, and the existing groundrules of Articles I and II \n     would continue to define the procedures by which laws are \n     made and the separation of powers maintained.\n     \\11\\It is our view that this would also abolish other \n     permanent indefinite appropriations arrangements and \n     revolving funds as they now stand, including those for the \n     Social Security, Medicare, and Civil Service Retirement \n     Systems. They all involve ``outlays'' within the \n     comprehensive meaning of Section 6, and so would all require \n     affirmative congressional action for each year's \n     disbursements. Congress could continue to provide that \n     outlays be made on formulaic bases (e.g., as ``formula \n     payments''), but they would be subject to the total annual \n     ceiling on outlays and mere qualification of an individual to \n     receive a payment would no longer automatically work to raise \n     the spending limit.\n     \\13\\I would like to thank Charles H.

Armor, Esq., Before the Constitution Subcommittee \n          of the Senate Judiciary Committee, February 16, 1994\n\n       It is always a privilege to testify before a Committee of \n     Congress, but especially so today on this subject before this \n     Subcommittee. The reason is that after almost two decades of \n     effort, the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution now \n     seems on the cusp of success before the Senate, and the BBA \n     is the focus of this hearing. I am not here today on behalf \n     of a client, but on my own.\n       I am John Armor, a constitutional lawyer who practices \n     before the Supreme Court, a former Professor of Political \n     Science, and author of several books and many articles, \n     usually on political science or constitutional law. Most \n     germane to today's hearing, I have testified for 17\\1/2\\ \n     years now before committees of state legislatures, and \n     occasionally before Congressional Committees, on legal \n     aspects of the BBA.\n       I will address three subjects, two of them briefly because \n     others will cover them in far more detail, and one at some \n     length, because others are unlikely to address it and it is \n     most important now as the Amendment seems close to passage. \n     The subjects are: the need for the BBA, the appropriateness \n     of constitutional provisions which are economic in nature, \n     and the problems and solutions on the questions of judicial \n     review under the BBA.\n\n\n               The Need for the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       All but one of the 50 states have some form of balanced \n     budget provisions in their laws. Forty-seven have provisions \n     in their constitutions; two have statutory provisions (ones \n     that they abide by, contrary to some statutory solutions \n     which Congress has tried, beginning in 1974); and one state, \n     Vermont, has no such provision. The exception proves the \n     rule; Vermont is not known as a hotbed of wild spending, \n     promoted by representatives of the tour bus and maple syrup \n     industries.\n       In all the other states, the operation of their various \n     balanced budget provisions demonstrate anew the importance of \n     institutional restraints to guide legislative behavior. \n     Madison, Hamilton and Jay put the issue most succinctly in \n     The Federalist over 200 years ago in arguing for adoption of \n     the Constitution. At that time, only the House of \n     Representatives was popularly elected. Writing about the \n     House, they said it would, ``balance the willingness to spend \n     against the reluctance to tax.''\n       There is a great deal of political and constitutional \n     wisdom in that short phrase, that Congress (no longer just \n     the House) should ``balance the willingness to spend against \n     the reluctance to tax.'' That is exactly what the balanced \n     budget amendments in the states accomplish for them. \n     Legislators are free to vote for whatever programs they \n     believe are in the interest of their constituents. But, at \n     the same time, they are obligated to impose the taxes to pay \n     for those programs.\n       Therefore, state legislators every year, or every two years \n     in Kentucky, create two sets of priorities. First are \n     priorities among spending programs--those at the bottom of \n     the list will not be approved, even through in the abstract \n     they might seem to be good ideas. Second are priorities among \n     taxation plans. The ones which are the least desirable and \n     most likely to provoke strong opposition will not be \n     approved, even though in the abstract they could raise \n     substantial funds for worthwhile programs.\n       In short, legislators become mindful of what the great \n     French Minister, Tallyrand, is credited with saying, ``The \n     art of taxation is like plucking a goose, the object is to \n     get the most feathers with the least amount of hissing.''\n       This balancing act between what legislators might want to \n     spend, and what taxes they are willing to impose, all things \n     considered, is continuous in the states. The same balancing \n     act used to be carried out annually by Congress. For 150 \n     years we operated under an unwritten constitutional standard. \n     Spending would not exceed taxes except during time of war or \n     during national emergencies amounting to what we now call \n     ``recessions'' or ``depressions.'' Once the emergency was \n     over, taxes would be used to pay down the public debt to \n     zero, or close to it.\n       We abandoned this standard fifty years ago. The \n     ``willingness to spend'' was disconnected from the \n     ``reluctance to tax'' in a process that has accelerated in \n     recent years of massive deficit\n      spending every year, not just during wars or emergencies. \n     There is no reason to blame any particular President or \n     Congress. With $4 trillion in known debt, and more than \n     that amount in unfunded, future commitments, there is \n     ample blame for all parties concerned. Ending that process \n     and restoring the connection between taxing and spending \n     is the central purpose of the BBA.\n       A major argument advanced against the BBA is that there \n     will be attempts to avoid or evade its provisions, no matter \n     how carefully they are drafted. That is absolutely true. \n     History has shown dozens of examples at the state level where \n     creative bookkeeping has been used to bail out state \n     governments which are strapped for funds but find necessary \n     choices among spending on one side and taxation on the other, \n     politically impossible. Sometimes, judicial enforcement \n     applied at the state level.\n       I urge you not to confuse the question of whether the BBA \n     will work perfectly, with the question of whether it will \n     work substantially. Consider the magnificent guarantees in \n     the First Amendment--freedom of religion, of speech, of the \n     press, and of political activity. Every one of those has been \n     repeatedly assaulted by various laws and ordinances at the \n     federal, state and local level, right from the beginnings of \n     the Republic. There were many individual failures. We once \n     had laws under which newspaper editors were jailed for \n     printing their opinions, until Jefferson became President. We \n     once had established churches supported directly by state \n     funds, until well into the 19th century.\n       I could run a long list of occasional failures of the First \n     Amendment in all four of its areas of protection. The proper \n     question about the First Amendment is not whether many \n     interests, many times, on many issues, sought to violate it. \n     It is whether the nation is much the better because it has \n     the First Amendment. By analogy, this is also the proper \n     question to ask about the BBA. Will it provide benefits to \n     the nation for the foreseeable future? If you answer that \n     question yes, then you should support it.\n       One last point. We have the example of another unwritten \n     constitutional provision that we lived by for 150 years. Once \n     it was broken, however, we wrote it into the Constitution. \n     George Washington was responsible for the fact that no limits \n     on Presidential terms were placed in the Constitution. But, \n     he was also the creator of the tradition that Presidents \n     voluntarily leave office after serving two terms. Once that \n     tradition was abrogated by FDR, we placed it in the \n     Constitution as the 22nd Amendment.\n       The same can apply to the Balanced Budget Amendment. Now \n     that the tradition has been abrogated, it can be written into \n     the language of the Constitution.\n\n\n       appropriateness of economic provisions in the constitution\n\n       The claim has often been made that the Constitution is \n     intended for broad and lofty purposes, that provisions for \n     economic programs have no place in that document. This slogan \n     sounds like it might have merit; it has superficial appeal. \n     However, as soon as one delves into the Constitution, it is \n     clear the Framers included ``economic'' provisions, whenever \n     and wherever they considered them appropriate as a matter of \n     public policy.\n       Article I, Section 2, chose to forbid taxes other than per \n     capita. We chose to reverse that decision by the 16th \n     Amendment which permitted income taxes. Article I, Section 8, \n     contains many ``economic'' clauses: the Commerce Clause, \n     gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and \n     bars the states from taxing or regulating it. (This clause \n     created the first ``common market'' among sovereign entities \n     in the history of the world. It was magnificently \n     successful.) Clauses 1 and 4, provide the right to borrow \n     money and the regulation of the value of money, with a \n     prohibition against the states minting their own money. (Many \n     states were printing their own money, prior to the adoption \n     of the Constitution. Some just ran the presses and devalued \n     their currency exactly as\n      Congress did with paper money during the American \n     Revolution, giving rise to the phrase, ``not worth a \n       Continental.'')Article VI, clause 1, is also economic, \n     providing that all debts contracted under the \n      [[Page S2730]] Confederation would remain ``valid against \n     the United States.'' Preserving the nation's reputation as \n     well as its financial stability were reasons for this clause, \n     which was hotly debated at the Philadelphia Convention of \n     1787.\n       My favorite clause to demonstrate the point is the one \n     invented by Dr. Benjamin Franklin as a result of his \n     experiences in Europe, given to James Madison, and inserted \n     in the Constitution with almost no discussion. Franklin had \n     observed that inventions and books were freely copied in \n     Europe, thereby denying those who had created them both the \n     benefits of their labors and the incentives to create more. \n     To solve that problem, Franklin invented clause 7, to secure \n     ``for limited Times to Authors and Inventors exclusive Right \n     to their respective Writings and Discoveries.''\n       There is no question that this is an ``economic'' \n     provision. Given the two century experience of the United \n     States leading the world in discoveries, inventions and \n     intellectual property, there is little doubt this clause in \n     the Constitution lies at the heart of the American economic \n     success story.\n       So, I suggest that whenever anyone claims that economic \n     provisions do not belong in the Constitution, the reply \n     should be to cite these and other provisions and reject that \n     claim out of hand. The question is not whether economic \n     provisions belong in the Constitution; it is whether the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment is a wise policy at this time in \n     our history, to be written into the Constitution.\n\n\n            judicial review of the balanced budget amendment\n\n       The subject of judicial review of the BBA has hardly been \n     addressed in the continuing public debate over the BBA. When \n     there was little chance that the Amendment would be adopted \n     any time soon, there was little reason to discuss this \n     particular consequence. The situation having changed, it is \n     now time to address this in detail.\n       Where the Constitution and applicable statutes are silent \n     about judicial review, it is left to the Supreme Court to \n     decide whether judicial review exists, and if so, what \n     remedies may the courts apply for any violations. Not only \n     can the Court set its own standards, it is also free to \n     reverse them. Witness Baker v. Carr, 369 US 186 (1962). Until \n     that case, the courts had refused to take up the ``political \n     questions'' of mal-apportioned state legislatures. In Baker, \n     it reversed itself, the consequence was 30 years and counting \n     of court orders that legislatures, city and county councils \n     reapportion themselves.\n       You could bet either, or both, of these results, if you \n     remain silent on the subject of judicial review of the BBA.\n       This discussion is based on five assumptions about the \n     results that this Committee, the whole Senate, and the whole \n     Congress may have in mind about judicial review of the BBA. \n     If any of my assumptions are incorrect, I trust I will \n     promptly stand corrected. The assumptions are:\n       1. There should be judicial review of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment.\n       2. It should be brought about by a single set of \n     responsible parties.\n       3. Enforcement should be extremely swift.\n       4. Courts should not be involved in choosing between \n     different government programs in enforcing the Amendment. All \n     such policy judgments should be left to Congress.\n       5. Courts should be prohibited from enforcing the BBA by \n     judicial imposition of new taxes.\n       Under both Article III, Section I, and under the enabling \n     clause that has been added to the BBA. Congress has the power \n     by legislation to remove, create, or shape the Supreme \n     Court's jurisdiction for review of the BBA. This is a process \n     well known to this Subcommittee; its heritage\n      traces back to the Judiciary Act of 1789. Only the original \n     jurisdiction of the Court as declared in Article III, \n     clause 2 is outside this statutory authority of Congress.\n       So, you can pass a statute which states what the judicial \n     review of the BBA shall be, and what remedies can be applied. \n     By making those exclusive, you can rule out any other forms \n     of judicial review or remedies. The process of judicial \n     review of the BBA and remedies applied will then be exactly \n     what you say it should be--no more, no less.\n       To assure only one case, brought by responsible parties, \n     you could provide that any six Senators, or any 25 \n     Representatives, or any three Governors, could bring an \n     action in the Supreme Court if they felt that the BBA had \n     been violated, or was about to be violated if no budget was \n     passed by the first day of the new fiscal year. On the filing \n     of the case, all other Senators, Representatives and \n     Governors would be informed and would be welcome to join the \n     case on either side as they deemed fit.\n       You do not want thousands of citizens represented by \n     thousands of tin horn lawyers, rushing into courts across the \n     nation to bring their disparate cases to enforce the BBA. By \n     this mechanism you can prevent that. The minimum numbers of \n     Senators, Representatives or Governors to bring the action \n     should be a significant number but a minority, similar to \n     provisions in the Rules of both Houses that protect the \n     interests of minorities, but not necessarily minorities of \n     one.\n       Placing the case in the Supreme Court, plus providing that \n     the Court must hear the case in 30 days and issue its \n     decision not more than 15 days thereafter, would assure \n     expeditious consideration. The Court would be free, as it has \n     in many of the previous 200 original jurisdiction cases, to \n     appoint Special Masters for fact-finding purposes, with their \n     conclusions subject to challenge before the whole Court.\n       In order to prevent either judicially-ordered taxes or \n     Court selection between competing programs and public \n     policies, the remedies from the Court could be restricted as \n     follows: (A) The Court could determine only that the budget \n     was, or was not, in balance, and (B) the exact dollar amount \n     of the projected year's income, assuming there is no \n     declaration of war, and Congress has not acted by the supra-\n     majority to remove the budget from the scope of the \n     Amendment. (C) The Court could then order only an across-the-\n     board cut in all programs without exception in the percentage \n     required. In other words, if the Court found that the budget \n     was out of balance by 3.4%, its only remedy would be to order \n     a 3.4% cut in all programs.\n       This point is extremely important. Having spent 17 years \n     talking with Members of Congress and with members of state \n     legislators on the subject of the BBA, I believe there is an \n     overwhelming feeling that the Supreme Court should not be \n     involved in choosing between closing down an Air Force base \n     or cutting Aunt Tilly's social security check. That sort of \n     policy judgment should always be made by elected \n     representatives of the people in each level of government.\n       Once the Court had ordered an across-the-board cut, \n     Congress would then have 20 days to act by statute to adjust \n     the cuts on a policy basis, making greater cuts in some \n     programs, less in others, by staying within the total dollar \n     amount declared by the Court. If Congress fails to act, or if \n     it acts but violates the Amendment a second time, then the \n     Court-ordered across-the-board cuts would be final for that \n     fiscal year.\n       Congress should have one bite at the apple to make those \n     policy judgments between competing programs, after a \n     declaration of violation of the BBA. But, it should be only \n     one bite, otherwise, every budget could be wrapped up in \n     eternal litigation, every year.\n       Lastly, what happens if Congress fails to pass a budget by \n     the first day of the fiscal year? Then the Court should have \n     the power to examine the taxes then in effect, and determine \n     the dollar amount that those taxes would raise in the coming \n     year. The amount would be the cap. All programs would be \n     presumed to continue at their current levels of funding \n     (exactly what Congress\n      itself does in Continuing Resolutions). The Court would \n     determine whether that did, or did not, result in balance. \n     Again, Congress would have 20 days to make policy-based \n       adjustments.I am deliberately not trying to write or offer \n     precise language. You and your staff are far better able to \n     do that. However, approaches such as those outlined could \n     accomplish all the basic purposes that are covered in the \n     assumptions, stated above.\n       One last point about when such statutory provisions should \n     be passed. Most of my time on this subject over the last 17 \n     years has been spent with state legislators, both in hearings \n     and often in far-reaching, challenging conversations about \n     ramifications of the BBA. If you intend to establish by \n     statute the parameters of judicial review and remedies, you \n     should pass that statute at the same time you pass the BBA \n     and send it out for ratification.\n       Some of the more far-sighted state legislators are engaging \n     in the same process you are, asking themselves what might the \n     Supreme Court do, or not do, to enforce the BBA. They are \n     especially concerned with two areas--judicially-imposed \n     taxes, and judicially-made choices between different policies \n     and programs. If you pass the statute now, or very soon after \n     you promulgate the BBA for ratification, you will satisfy \n     state legislators, first, that judicial review will occur, \n     and second, that judicial enforcement will not get into \n     either of these areas of grave concern.\n       If you do not pass such a statute within a few months of \n     promulgating the Amendment, you will engender serious \n     concerns among the state legislators about whether you will \n     ultimately do that, and if so, what provisions you will \n     choose to include. Recalling that ratification requires the \n     approval of 38 state legislatures, or ratifying conventions \n     elected in 38 states under the other Article V method, you \n     will endanger the ratification of the BBA if you do not \n     provide review statute so state legislators can read it side \n     by side with the text of your BBA.\n       There may be other aspects of enabling legislation that you \n     may want, but do not choose to address until and unless the \n     states ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. Your own \n     considerations and reflections, together with the responses \n     of the states as they ratify, might be valuable in writing \n     that legislation. However, on judicial review itself, I \n     strongly urge you to consider, write and pass that \n     legislation as soon as possible, once you decide to pass the \n     BBA itself.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       You have 200 years of history at the state and local level \n     about the importance of making the tough decisions about \n     taxing and spending, about ``balancing the willingness to \n     spend against the reluctance to tax.'' You also have 150 \n     years of experience here in Congress on the same point. If \n     that satisfies you that the nation needs the BBA in the \n     Constitution, now is the time to act.\n        [[Page S2731]] You should not be reluctant to act on the \n     grounds that this is an ``economic'' provision. The \n     Constitution has many other provisions intended to effect the \n     economy of the United States, ones which in the fullness of \n     world history have been proven to be basic in the \n     organization of any competent national economy. Consider the \n     fact that Dr. Franklin's invention of the Patents and \n     Trademark clause has become regional through NAFTA, and may \n     shortly become global through GATT. Economic provisions \n     belong in our Constitution, provided they are the right ones \n     for the nation at the right time in our history-whether the \n     year is 1787 or 1994.\n       Lastly, you should be concerned with judicial enforcement \n     of the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it is correct to place \n     the Amendment in the Constitution, it is also correct to \n     guarantee both that if will be enforced, and to prevent forms \n     of enforcement that would undercut the essential purposes of \n     Congress, namely decisions on taxation and on competing \n     public policies. Fortunately, the Constitution gives Congress \n     the power to shape judicial enforcement to accomplish both \n     purposes.\n       I welcome your questions on this complex subject with \n     complex ramifications.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, DC]\n\n           Balanced Budget Amendment: The Role of the Courts\n\n       Some lawmakers and commentators have raised questions about \n     the enforcement of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution. A primary concern is that Congressional efforts \n     to meet the balanced budget requirement would be challenged \n     in the courts, and the judiciary would be thrust into a non-\n     judicial role of weighing policy demands, slashing programs \n     and increasing taxes.\n       On the other hand, there is a legitimate and necessary role \n     for the courts in ensuring compliance with the amendment. \n     Congress could potentially circumvent balanced budget \n     requirements through unrealistic revenue estimates, emergency \n     designations, off-budget accounts, unfunded mandates, and \n     other gimmickry. Certainly, the track record of the \n     institution under the spending targets of Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings and other statutory provisions is no cause for \n     optimism.\n       It is our view that the need to proscribe judicial \n     policymaking can be reconciled with a constructive role for \n     the courts in maintaining the integrity of the balanced \n     budget requirement. Congress is expected to address technical \n     issues such as accounting standards, budget procedures and \n     judicial enforcement in followup implementing legislation. By \n     drawing on the existing legal principles of ``mootness,'' \n     ``standing'' and ``non- judiciability,'' implementing \n     legislation can define an appropriate role for the courts in \n     making the amendment work. The net effect can be to prevent \n     judicial assumption of legislative functions such as \n     selecting program cuts, while allowing the courts to police a \n     framework of accounting standards and budget procedures.\n\n\n              Traditional Limits on Judicial Intervention\n\n       In general, the courts have shown an unwillingness to \n     interject themselves into the fray of budgetary politics. The \n     New Jersey Superior Court observed that ``it is a rare case .  \n     .  . in which the judiciary has any proper constitutional \n     role in making budget allocation decisions.''\\1\\ The \n     judiciary has remained clear of most budget controversies \n     through the principles of ``mootness'' and ``standing,'' as \n     well as the ``political question'' doctrine.\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A case is considered moot, and can be rejected by the \n     court, if the matter in controversy is no longer current. In \n     Bishop v. Governor, 281 Md. 521 (1977), taxpayers and \n     Maryland legislators claimed that the governor's proposed \n     budget violated the state's balanced budget law, because $95 \n     million was contingent upon enactment of separate federal and \n     state legislation. The Maryland Court of Appeals dismissed \n     the case as moot because by that time the separate \n     legislation had been\n      approved, and the relevant fiscal year had elapsed. Mootness \n     will be a factor in many potential challenges to \n     Congressional action under a federal Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, particularly those based on unplanned \n     expenditures or flawed revenue estimates which become \n     apparent near the end of the fiscal year.\n       The doctrine of standing limits judicial access to parties \n     who can shoe a direct injury over and above that incurred by \n     the general public. The logic is that the grievances of the \n     public (or substantial segments thereof) are the proper \n     domain of the legislature.\\2\\ The U.S. Supreme Court has \n     generally held that status as a taxpayer does not confer \n     standing to a challenge federal actions\\3\\, and has barred \n     taxpayer challenges of budget and revenue policies in the \n     absence of special injuries to the plaintiffs.\\4\\ A state \n     cannot sue the federal government on behalf of its \n     citizens,\\5\\ and it is doubtful that Members of Congress have \n     standing to challenge federal actions in court.\\6\\\n       The political question doctrine is a related principle that \n     the courts should remain out of such matters which the \n     Constitution has committed to another branch of government. \n     The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a ``political question'' \n     exists when a case would require ``nonjudicial \n     discretion.''\\7\\ This would be the case with many budgetary \n     controversies, such as the choice to cur particular programs, \n     which by their nature require ideological choices and the \n     balancing of competing needs. In theory, at least, Congress \n     brings to this task a ``full knowledge of political, social \n     and economic conditions...,'' as well as the legitimacy of \n     elected representation.\\8\\ The New Jersey Supreme Court \n     recognized this in a case where local governments challenged \n     funding decisions made by the governor and legislature, \n     holding that the allocation of state funds among competing \n     constituent groups was a political question, to be decided by \n     the legislature and not the judiciary.\\9\\ The Michigan \n     Supreme Court has likewise held that program cutting \n     decisions are a non-judicial function.\\10\\\n\n\n                         a role for the courts\n\n       The courts have asserted jurisdiction over politically \n     tinged controversies where they find ``discoverable and \n     manageable standards'' for resolving them. In Baker v. Carr, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that objective criteria guide \n     judicial decisonmaking and limit the opportunity for \n     overreaching. In the balanced budget context, the \n     ``discoverable and manageable standards'' principle can help \n     demarcate lines between impermissible judicial policymaking, \n     and the needed enforcement of accounting rules and budget \n     procedures.\n       In all likelihood, a strong framework of accounting \n     guidelines will emerge from implementing legislation. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee has interpreted Section 6 of the \n     bill to impose ``a positive obligation on the part of \n     Congress to enact appropriate legislation'' regarding this \n     complex issue.\\11\\ Judiciary Committee staff on both the \n     House and Senate side have indicated their intention that \n     implementing legislation embrace stringent accounting \n     standards that will minimize the potential for litigation. \n     Should legitimate questions arise concerning the methods by \n     which Congress ``balances'' the budget, these standards will \n     also provide objective criteria which meet constitutional \n     standards for judicial intervention.\n       The implementing package is also likely to establish \n     guidelines for judicial involvement defining what issues are \n     judiciable and which parties have standing to challenge \n     Congressional decisions. Where Congress has defined standing \n     within the relevant statue, the courts have generally \n     deferred to this request for judicial input, and entertained \n     suitable cases.\\12\\ This approach has the advantage of \n     defining appropriate controversies and plaintiffs more \n     precisely. In the Balanced Budget context, the right to raise \n     particular arguments could be delegated to specific public \n     officials. State budget officers, for example, could be given \n     standing to contest unfunded federal mandates.\n       We are satisfied that such enforcement procedures, coupled \n     with budget process and accounting guidelines, will operate \n     against a backdrop of traditional legal principles to \n     rationally limit judicial action. The effect should be to \n     prevent judicial overreaching into legislative functions \n     while providing a check on Congressional attempts to evade \n     the requirements of the BBA through procedural and numerical \n     gimmickry.\n                               footnotes\n\n     1.

Mr. President, I am going to vote against the motion \nto table the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. President, in my view, courts should not be allowed to enforce \nthe balanced budget amendment by raising taxes, cutting benefits, or \notherwise involving themselves in Federal budgetary policy. We live in \na democracy. And the power to tax and spend should be granted only to \nthose who are accountable to the public.\n  Our Nation was founded on the principle of no taxation without \nrepresentation. It is not time to turn back now.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, unless amended, the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution that is before us today threatens to give \nthe courts unlimited power to raise taxes and cut \n [[Page S2732]] spending when necessary to ensure a balanced budget. \nThe Johnston amendment would ensure that this power could be exercised \nonly if explicitly authorized by the Congress.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not even think that Congress should be \nallowed to give courts the power to increase taxes as a means of \nenforcing this constitutional amendment. Decisions about taxing and \nspending should be made by elected officials, and those officials \nshould not be allowed to avoid accountability for those decisions by \ndelegating that power to the judiciary.\n  So, Mr. President, I seriously considered voting to table the \nJohnston amendment because it does not go far enough to limit judicial \npower, and I suspect that some of my colleagues will vote to table the \nJohnston amendment on that basis. However, I have decided to vote \nagainst the motion to table since, although the Johnston amendment does \nnot go far enough, it at least would put some limits on the judiciary's \ntaxing and spending powers under the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I believe I am prepared to summarize in \n1 minute and I will yield back the balance. Mr. President, I yield \nmyself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, this amendment as worked out with the distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] and the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] deprives the courts of judicial power to raise \ntaxes, to cut budgets, to be involved in fiscal affairs of this \nCongress except to the extent that the Congress specifically authorizes \nthat in authorizing legislation.\n  It is the duty of Congress to implement and enforce this article by \nauthorizing legislation. Section 6 so states, and there is also an \nexemption made for section 2. That is, the judicial power of the courts \ncan extend to the enforcement of section 2 which in return requires 60 \nvotes to raise the debt of the United States.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what the sponsors of this \nconstitutional amendment have said the amendment does. They have stated \nthat the courts may not enforce this amendment. This makes it clear \nthat the courts may not enforce the amendment except in the case of \nsection 2 or unless the Congress specifically authorizes them to do so.\n  Mr. President, it is unthinkable to have the kind of ambiguity in the \nConstitution of the United States that is inherent in this amendment \nunless the Johnston amendment is agreed to.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I believe we are ready to yield back the balance of our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to table the Johnston amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 248 for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 248.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 9 through 11, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     the later of the following:\n       ``(1) fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(2) the second fiscal year beginning after its \n     ratification; or\n       ``(3) the end of the first continuous seven-year period \n     starting after the adoption of the joint resolution of \n     Congress proposing this article during which period there is \n     not in effect any statute, rule, or other provision that \n     requires more than a majority of a quorum in either House of \n     Congress to approve either revenue increases or spending \n     cuts.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment \ncontemplates a 7-year period during which we would go from where we now \nare--that is, about a $200 billion annual deficit--to a zero deficit. \nThis chart makes the point very obviously that, from 1996 to the year \n2002, we need to make substantial progress in getting from where we are \nto that zero deficit.\n  My amendment tries to assure that during those 7 years--not after the \n7 years--but during those 7 years we can actually reach this goal of a \nbalanced budget. My amendment says that during those 7 years you cannot \nhave a requirement for a supermajority either to cut spending or to \nraise taxes in either House of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the balanced budget amendment before, and \nI can honestly say that the intent of the amendment's proponents in \nthose previous debates here on the Senate floor seems to me different \nfrom what is their apparent intent this time. In the previous \nCongresses the amendment was offered as a mechanism to help achieve \nresponsible fiscal policy. It was to be a prod to keep us focused on \ndeficit reduction; an assist to us in pursuing sound fiscal policy. \nSince I agreed that more discipline was needed, I was willing to \nsupport the amendment.\n  This time the amendment comes to us in a different context, supported \nby some different arguments. Now, the proponents do not just want \ndeficit reduction and sound fiscal policy. They also want that deficit \nreduction achieved in their preferred way and in a way which most \nheavily benefits those they desire to benefit. That is a new and a \ndisturbing aspect of this year's debate, Mr. President.\n  This year, the amendment comes from the House of Representatives \nafter the House has already amended its own rules to require a three-\nfifths supermajority for any increase in income tax rates. Other taxes \ncan still be raised with a simple majority. Of course, spending cuts \ncan still be accomplished with a simple majority, but \n[[Page S2680]] income tax rates cannot be raised without a three-fifths \nvote, according to the House rule.\n  Some argue that this is just a House rule and that we in the Senate \ndo not need to concern ourselves with it. But under the Constitution, \nall revenue measures must originate in the House, so if the House has a \nrule that biases deficit reduction against changes in the income tax, \nthat restricts the options available to the entire Congress, not just \nthe House.\n  Mr. President, this change of rules undermines genuine efforts at \ndeficit reduction, and it undermines our ability to achieve sound \nfiscal policy. The purpose of the House rule is to advance a \nconservative political agenda of less taxation for certain taxpayers \nwithout regard for and in spite of the consequences for the deficit.\n  The purposes of the rule are to protect individuals and corporations \nin the upper tax brackets and to accomplish any increase in revenue by \nraising regressive taxes that affect middle-income individuals and \nfamilies, taxes such as the gas tax, Social Security taxes, sales and \nexcise taxes.\n  Supermajority requirements like the House rule make deficit reduction \nover the next 7 years even more different than it already is. But more \nimportantly, they drastically alter the fundamental fairness of the way \nwe will allocate the pain of deficit reduction during those 7 years.\n  The supermajority requirement shifts the burden away from wealthy \nindividuals and corporations and onto the backs of low- and middle-\nincome working families. For under the House rule, it is the working \nfamilies of America, not the wealthy and the corporations, who will \nfeel the spending cuts. It is those working families who will pay the \ngas taxes and the social insurance taxes and the excise taxes which \nmust get us to a zero deficit.\n  Never before have the proponents of this balanced budget amendment \nargued that it is right for middle-income families to pay to balance \nthe budget but not right for the wealthy and the corporations to pay.\n  So my amendment restores the fundamental fairness of previous \nbalanced budget amendment discussions. It restores the ground rules to \nwhat they were during previous balanced budget amendment debates here \non the floor by establishing this 7-year period in which to get to a \nzero deficit without unfair supermajority requirements in either House \nwith regard either to particular spending cuts or particular tax \nincreases.\n  Now, looking at the second of these charts, it makes a very serious \npoint which I am sure everyone knows here in the Senate and perhaps \nneeds to be repeated. Deficit reduction is not rocket science. It is \nnot difficult to know what to do. It is difficult to have the courage \nto do it.\n  Deficit reduction can be accomplished in two ways. You can cut \nspending or you can increase revenue. Either one of those works. Both \nof them help get you to a zero deficit and a balanced budget. As the \nbottom part of the chart shows, my amendment merely says that during \nthe 7 years leading up to 2002 we cannot have supermajority votes \nrequired either for spending cuts or for revenue increases.\n  Our past experience and simple economic sense leads me to conclude \nthat if we are going to seriously approach accomplishing a balanced \nbudget, we will have to look at both spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to get from here to where we need to go.\n  If we look at history and look at what we have actually done in the \nlast 15 years by way of deficit reduction, we can see the point I am \ntrying to make. There have been five serious efforts at deficit \nreduction during the 1980's and the first half of the 1990's--under \nRepublican Presidents and under Democratic Presidents I point out.\n  In 1982, there was a significant deficit reduction effort. The total \ndeficit reduction there was $116 billion. That was, of course, under \nPresident Reagan. He signed that bill and approved it. Most of the \ndeficit reduction there was accomplished by revenue increases--not by \nspending cuts. People need to recognize that in each of the five cases \nhere we have had both revenue increases and spending cuts.\n  The second serious reduction was when President Reagan was in the \nWhite House in 1987, and again we had substantial revenue increases: \n$75 billion in revenue increases and $118 billion in spending cuts. So \nthere was clearly a combination of the two in that case.\n  In 1989, under President Bush, we had a deficit reduction effort \nwhich was about equally balanced between revenue increases and spending \ncuts.\n  In 1990, we had a very major deficit reduction package when President \nBush was in the White House. There was more in spending cuts, nearly \ntwice as much in spending cuts or a little over twice as much in \nspending cuts as there were in revenue increases. But still there was a \ncombination of the two.\n  Then 2 years ago, in 1993, of course, we had President Clinton's \ndeficit reduction package which involved both spending cuts and revenue \nincreases, totaling, according to the CBO, $433 billion as originally \nproposed. I think the estimates are that that has increased since.\n  I think it is interesting to note when we look at this history of how \nwe have actually tried to accomplish deficit reduction, in four of the \nfive deficit reduction efforts that were made in the 1980's and so far \nin the 1990's we did not have the three-fifths vote necessary in the \nHouse which would be required by this House rule. So these packages, \nfour of the five, could not have passed under the House rule as it now \nstands. Not only does history indicate that serious deficit reduction \nwill require both spending cuts and tax increases, but common sense \nindicates that it will as well.\n  Now, looking at the next chart, that chart shows the Federal budget \nand shows what is available when we start to cut spending. Many \nprevious speakers in the last couple of weeks have pointed to this \nchart or similar versions of this chart to make the very obvious point \nthat the majority of the Federal budget is so-called mandatory \nspending, spending not readily available for cuts. Clearly we can \nchange the eligibility requirements for Social Security or Medicare or \nMedicaid and get savings, but this is mandatory in the sense that it \nwill take a change in the substantive law that we have had on the books \nfor some time in order to bring that about.\n  Interest accounts for about 15 percent of the debt. There is no way \nto dodge that. We have to pay that each year. We cannot make up \nspending cuts there. Medicare and Medicaid is about 17 percent, and as \nfar as I know somebody is talking about cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. \nAll they are talking about is whether we will restrain the rate of \nincrease in those areas.\n  Social Security, we have had votes in the last 2 or 3 days where \neverybody has gone on record, both Democrat and Republican, as not \nwanting to see Social Security counted as part of the way we get to \ndeficit reduction to get to a balanced budget.\n  And other mandatory spending, other entitlement programs, makes up \nabout 10 percent. The areas that are discretionary are defense, which \nis about 18 percent of the Federal budget. The proposal I have heard \naround the Capitol in recent months is not to cut defense. It is added \nto what the President himself has proposed as increases in defense \nduring the next 5 years.\n  Of course, some people think we can balance the budget by cutting out \ninternational foreign aid. That is 1.4 percent of the Federal budget. I \nsuggest that if we eliminate it entirely, we still would have a long \nway to go to get to a balanced budget.\n  Domestic discretionary, 16.5 percent. That is where the cuts will \ncome. I think everybody knows that when we get around to cutting \nspending, the cuts are going to come in domestic discretionary \nspending. That is law enforcement funding, that is education funding, \nthat is public health funding, that is funding of a whole variety of \nthings which generally keep the Government running.\n  While virtually all experts agree that to get to a balanced budget, \nwe will have to both cut spending and raise revenue, the House of \nRepresentatives by rule has made it very difficult for us to raise that \nadditional revenue, at least to raise that additional revenue from the \nincome tax.\n  We are spending a great deal of time in the Congress this year, Mr. \nPresident, talking about the Contract With America. I read that \ncontract, and part \n[[Page S2681]] of it did contain a promise to the American people not \nto raise taxes. The contract does not just contain a promise not to \nraise taxes, it has a promise to require a supermajority to raise \ntaxes. The contract, in fact, proposed to include that supermajority \nrequirement for tax increases in the balanced budget amendment itself.\n  When the Speaker and the majority in the House finally started \nlooking at their votes, they decided they did not have the votes to \npass the balanced budget amendment in that form, but that they did have \nthe votes to put in place a rule which would have the same effect; that \nis, a rule which would say that you have to have not a majority but you \nhave to have three-fifths of the House voting for any kind of change in \nincome tax rates in order to increase those rates.\n  Not only has the Republican leadership in the House made good on \ntheir promise to require a supermajority to raise taxes and to put it \nin the rules, they have also committed to a major tax cut this year.\n  We had quite a debate yesterday about whether or not it was wise to \nproceed with a tax cut. I believe myself that the 1981 tax cut was not \nresponsible in light of the Federal deficit we faced then. It seems \nequally clear to me that this proposed tax cut, which is called for in \nthe Contract With America, is also not responsible.\n  Mr. President, I regret that President Clinton has chosen to advocate \ntax cuts at this particular time, although his proposal is much more \nreasonable in size and it is targeted toward families attempting to \nimprove their own education or their children's education.\n  This is the context in which we are considering a commitment to reach \na balanced budget amendment in the next 7 years. The results, in my \nview, are two:\n  First, the chances are overwhelming that if we keep this \nsupermajority requirement in the House rules, we will not reach the \ngoals set out in the amendment of a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  And second, that if we keep this supermajority requirement in the \nHouse rules, whatever steps we take to reach the goal are going to fall \nhardest on working families.\n  My amendment tries to ensure a good faith effort by all to reach the \ngoal of a balanced budget. It eliminates all the preconditions, it \neliminates all the artificial barriers. No group, and certainly not the \nwealthy, could assume that it would be spared from sharing in the pain \nof deficit reduction.\n  There would be no prohibition against cuts and particular types of \nspending; there would be no prohibition against increases and \nparticular types of taxes. The House rules requiring three-fifths to \nchange income tax rates would have to either be dropped or judged \ninvalid by the Supreme Court.\n  I point out to my colleagues that there is pending today in the court \na suit brought by the League of Women Voters and 15 House Members \nchallenging the constitutionality of the House rule.\n  Mr. President, this is essentially a back-to-reality amendment. It is \nalso a basic fairness amendment. I believe it is an important amendment \ndealing with this issue of a supermajority requirement, particularly as \nit has been manifested in this House rule.\n  Let me look at one final chart to make that last point about the \nimportance of the amendment. We have looked at where the spending \noccurs in Government. Let us look at where the revenue comes from to \nsee what we are taking off the table by adopting that House rule.\n  The income tax, of course, is our most progressive tax. Here you can \nsee the individual taxes account for 43 percent of the revenue that the \nGovernment receives each year, and corporate taxes account for an \nadditional 11 percent. So you add those two together and you have 54 \npercent of the revenue that comes to the Federal Government by way of \ntaxes.\n  We are saying if you want to change the amount of revenue you receive \nfrom those taxes, if you want to get anymore revenue from those taxes, \nyou have to have three-fifths under the House rule.\n  That is a major amount. That is a major source of revenue to be \nbuilding a supermajority requirement around. When you look at where \nelse can we raise revenue, if we are not able to get the three-fifths \nnecessary there, as we have not been able to get the three-fifths \nnecessary in four of the last five major deficit reduction efforts in \nthe Congress, where else can you get those?\n  Social Security taxes, 37 percent; 37 percent of the total revenue \ncoming into the Federal Government comes from Social Security taxes. So \nyou can raise Social Security taxes. Excise taxes, 4 percent, and other \ntaxes, 5 percent. That is things like the gasoline tax and other \nmatters. I point out that the Social Security tax, excise tax, and \ngasoline taxes are regressive. That means that they fall most heavily \non low- and moderate-income individuals. The income tax is the \nprogressive tax. It is the tax that has higher rates that you are \nrequired to pay as your income goes up. So when you say you will not \nchange the income tax, you are clearly looking out for those people \nwith the high incomes.\n  When we say a supermajority is required to raise rates in that tax \nbut not in others, we are protecting those who are relatively \ndisadvantaged by the progressive rate structure of the income tax, and \nthose are clearly the wealthy in our society.\n  The people most affected by taxes, other than the income tax, are not \nprotected. Those are the working families, poor families, the elderly. \nThose other taxes are still available as sources of income. The \ngasoline tax is there, available, excise taxes. Some of my colleagues \nhave an interest in beer and wine and tobacco taxes and other excise \ntaxes as well. The main other source of income for the Federal \nGovernment is the Social Security tax. That accounts for 37 percent of \nall the revenue we receive.\n  In addition to these sources of revenue to get from here to a \nbalanced budget, we also, of course, have areas of spending that can be \ntargeted for reduction. And the area of spending which we all know is \nmost likely to be cut is domestic discretionary spending. That category \nincludes programs that primarily go to benefit the average working \npeople in the country--education grants, loans, health care, health \nclinics in our rural areas, nutrition, school lunch programs, law \nenforcement, funds needed to make good on the promises that were in \nlast year's crime bill.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, this amendment that I am offering today \nlets us go into this 7-year period with ground rules that do not make \nit virtually impossible to get from here to a balanced budget.\n  They also let us go into this 7-year period with ground rules that do \nnot require most of the pain--that is, a disproportionate amount of the \npain--of deficit reduction to be borne by working families.\n  In my view, this is a good amendment. I urge all Senators who are \nseriously committed to deficit reduction and to fairness in the way \nthat we achieve that deficit reduction to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are now in our 17th day under our balanced budget \namendment debt tracker of the increase in the debt as we debate. While \nwe are debating this--this is our 17th day of debate, or 17th day since \nwe started this debate--we can see in this far chart the red line at \nthe bottom is the $4.8 trillion debt that we started with at the \nbeginning of this year. The green lines show how it is going up every \nday $829 million of additional debt on the backs of our children and \nour grandchildren. Today, the 17th day, we are now up to, as you can \neasily see here, $14,100,480,000--in additional debt just while we \ndebate this.\n  The reason we are doing this is so the American people can understand \nthat this is serious business. For 17 days this has been delayed, a \nfull 3 weeks of Senate floor time, 3 weeks on something that a vast \nmajority of Senators are for, and we believe 67 of us will vote for it \nin the end because it is the only chance we have to get spending under \ncontrol, the only chance we have. It is the first time in history that \nthe House of Representatives has passed a balanced budget amendment.\n  [[Page S2682]] Now they have sent it to us. It is the amendment we \nhave been working on now for my whole 19 years in the Senate, and I \nhave to say it is a bipartisan consensus, Democrat-Republican \namendment. It is not perfect, but it is the best we can do, and it is \nmuch better than anything I have seen in all the time we have debated \nit. It will put a mechanism in the Constitution that will help us in \nthe Congress to do that which we should have been doing all these years \nanyway, and that is to live within our means.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is very sincere. He does \nnot like the three-fifths vote over in the House that they have on a \nstatutory basis. It can be changed anytime by a mere 51 percent vote. \nWhen they get a majority over there that can do it, they will change \nit. But that has nothing to do, in my opinion, with whether or not we \nshould pass the balanced budget amendment in the Senate.\n  I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico. The Bingaman amendment, while seemingly aimed at supermajority \nvoting requirements to raise revenues or cut spending, would in fact \nkill the balanced budget amendment, not merely delay its \nimplementation. As I will explain in a few moments, the Bingaman \namendment, if adopted, would render the balanced budget amendment \ninherently contradictory and never, ever capable of going into effect.\n  The Bingaman amendment would ostensibly delay the effective date of \nthe balanced budget amendment until the end of the 7-year period after \nCongress adopts it, ``during which period there is not in effect any \nstatute, rule or other provision that requires more than a majority of \na quorum in either House of Congress to approve either revenue \nincreases or spending cuts.''\n  Now, it may seem that this amendment is aimed at the other body's \nrecent rule that Federal income tax increases are effective only if \nthey receive a three-fifths vote, but it hits the balanced budget \namendment right in the heart. And this is not an errant, leftover arrow \nfrom Cupid's quiver. This is a poisoned dart.\n  Section 4 of House Joint Resolution 1 states that ``no bill to \nincrease revenue shall become law unless approved by a majority of the \nwhole number of each House by a rollcall vote.'' That means at least 51 \nSenators and 218 Members of the House of Representatives must be \nrecorded in favor of any revenue increase. In other words, it is a \nconstitutional majority that our amendment requires.\n  If we adopt the Bingaman amendment into House Joint Resolution 1, \nhowever, then House Joint Resolution 1 can never, ever go into effect. \nThe Bingaman proposal says that House Joint Resolution 1 cannot go into \neffect so long as a provision such as section 4 is law. After all, the \nBingaman proposal says that a majority of a quorum can raise taxes. \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 says that only a majority of the whole number \nof both Houses can raise taxes. You cannot put the two provisions in \nthe same constitutional amendment, at least not if you are really \ntrying to enact that constitutional amendment into law.\n  So the Bingaman amendment is about much more than raising the \nsupermajority requirement for revenue increases or spending cuts. It is \nabout killing the balanced budget amendment by making it incapable of \never going into effect.\n  I might point out that had this section 4 provision been in effect in \n1993, then President Clinton's huge tax increase in 1993 would not have \nbecome law. That tax increase only garnered 50 votes in the Senate and \nneeded Vice President Gore's tie breaker in order to be sent to the \nPresident. But while the Vice President is President of the Senate, he \nis not a Member of the Senate. Accordingly, the 1993 tax increase would \nhave been killed by the 50-50 vote of the Senators under the pending \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  There are other serious problems with the Bingaman amendment. If \nCongress wants to adopt supermajority requirements for raising taxes \nand does so in a constitutional manner, I think that it will be \nperfectly appropriate protection for the taxpayers. I wish we could get \nthe votes to pass the balanced budget amendment with such a \nrequirement, but we cannot. I certainly do not believe that we should, \nin our fundamental charter, put in a provision that explicitly says as \nfew as 26 Senators out of 100 can raise taxes. I think it is a terrible \nidea to write that explicitly into the Constitution. As I say, we \nshould put into our Constitution stronger protections against tax \nraises.\n  While section 4 is not as strong as some would prefer it, certainly \nin the House, it is better than the status quo. The Bingaman amendment, \nin contrast, would make the status quo an explicit part of our \nConstitution.\n  Now, my colleagues should bear in mind that a vote for the Bingaman \namendment is a vote in favor of stating right in the Constitution \nitself that as few as 26 Senators can pass tax raises. Statutory or \ninternal congressional rules seeking to impose a higher hurdle for tax \nincreases would be, on their face, invalid. Today at least we have a \nfighting chance to have such statutory or internal congressional rules \nimposing higher voting requirements for tax increases upheld.\n  Moreover, if Congress adopts House Joint Resolution 1 and sends it to \nthe States with the Bingaman language, even aside from the fatal flaw \nthat I mentioned earlier, take a look at the hurdles House Joint \nResolution 1 would have to go through, even within the terms of the \nBingaman amendment itself. If the other body does not repeal its three-\nfifths rule on tax increases, its statutory rule, for, say, 2 years, \nthen House Joint Resolution 1 would have to wait 7 more years after \nsuch repeal before it can be effective under the Bingaman language. \nThat puts us into the year 2004. We cannot wait that long for the \ndiscipline of the balanced budget amendment to go into effect.\n  President Clinton's proposed budgets would add another $400 billion \nto the national debt in those 2 years alone, even under optimistic \nassumptions, and $1.8 trillion over that period to the year 2004.\n  If my friend from New Mexico does not like the other body's rules on \ntax increases, I say with all respect that concern should not be \naddressed by tampering with the effective date of this badly needed \nconstitutional mandate to balance the budget.\n  Frankly, America cannot wait any longer than the balanced budget \namendment already provides for the Congress to be placed under such a \nmandate. I certainly believe the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nis sincere, but I think these arguments against it are overwhelming, \nand I hope our fellow Senators will vote down the Bingaman amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond to some of the \npoints my friend and colleague from Utah has made.\n  He suggests that the amendment I am offering would make the balanced \nbudget amendment internally contradictory, because of section 4, as I \nunderstand his argument. I do not see it that way, and let me explain \nmy view of it.\n  As I understand the procedure that the balanced budget amendment \ncontemplates, there is a 7-year period during which we try to get to a \nbalanced budget. Section 8 says, ``This article shall take effect \nbeginning with fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year \nbeginning after its ratification, whichever is later.'' So there is a \n7-year period from where we are to the balanced budget. Then the \nbalanced budget amendment, including section 4, takes effect.\n  He is correct, section 4 says, ``No bill to increase revenue shall \nbecome law unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \nHouse by a rollcall vote.'' My amendment does not affect that. What my \namendment says is during the first 7 years, during the time we are \ntrying to get to the balanced budget, we should not have supermajority \nrequirements. Once we have a balanced budget, section 4 says you have \nto have a majority of the whole number of each House to raise revenue, \nand I am not challenging that. My amendment does not challenge that. I \ndo not know that it is great policy but my amendment does not challenge \nthat.\n  So I do not see anything inconsistent between my amendment, which \ndeals with the first 7 years, from now until \n[[Page S2683]] the time we get to a balanced budget, and section 4, \nwhich deals with the time from the effective date of the balanced \nbudget amendment, 7 years down the road, from then on in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  So I do not see there is any inconsistency. If I am missing something \nin the argument I would be anxious to hear the response of the Senator \nfrom Utah on that. But I do not believe I am missing anything. I \nbelieve my amendment would improve the balanced budget amendment as it \nnow stands before the Senate and would not build in any internal \ncontradiction into it.\n  The second point he makes is that if we were to invalidate the House \nrule, we would in fact be allowing as few as 26 Senators--we could be \nputting in the Constitution a provision which says that as few as 26 \nSenators can raise taxes. I would just point out that is what the \nConstitution provides. That is what the Constitution has provided for \n206 years, that as few as 26, a majority of a quorum, is all that is \nrequired by both Houses to either raise taxes or cut spending. That is \nnot changed.\n  I do not see anything terrible about us putting a sentence in saying \nthat is what the Constitution provides because that is what the \nConstitution provides. That is what it has always provided.\n  This is not just a casual result. There was a great debate at the \ntime the Constitution was being written about whether a supermajority \nshould be required. In fact, one of the most famous of the Federalist \nPapers, No. 58, written by James Madison, dealt with this specific \nsubject. I understand the Speaker of the House of Representatives has \nassigned this as one of the books he is requiring all House Members to \nread. So I am sure they are all familiar with this, but maybe some of \nmy colleagues here in the Senate are not. Let me just read a short \npassage from the Federalist No. 58. This is James Madison writing. He \nwrote:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum; and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision. That \n     some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution \n     cannot be denied. It might have been an additional shield to \n     some particular interests, and another obstacle generally to \n     hasty, impartial measures. But these considerations are \n     outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale. In \n     all cases where justice or the general good might require new \n     laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the \n     fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. \n     It would be no longer the majority that would rule: The power \n     would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  That is James Madison's explanation for why the drafters of the \nConstitution did not put in there a requirement for a supermajority. \nThey did not permit rules to exist such as the rule in the House. And \nwe need to clarify that rules such as the rule in the House would not \nbe permitted during this 7-year period while we get to a balanced \nbudget. So I think it is clear that the argument for maintaining the \nright of the majority to rule is a strong argument. It is not a new \nargument in our democratic system. It is a strong argument we should \nstick with.\n  The Senator from Utah made one final point. He said if my amendment \nwere adopted we could delay the time that we are required to have a \nbalanced budget by 2 years, or whatever period until the House decided \nto change its rule.\n  I would point out the House could meet this afternoon and change its \nrule. There is nothing in my amendment which in any way prevents the \nHouse from changing its rule or any court--and we do have a court case \npending on this--from determining that that rule is unconstitutional \nand invalid. As soon as that happens the 7 years begins to run.\n  So if the concern is we cannot get the 7 years running fast enough, I \nwould say there is a ready remedy for that, once my amendment is \nadopted, and that is a repeal of the rule.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the arguments of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico and I appreciate his sincerity. I \njust do not think it refutes what we said earlier.\n  Could I ask the remaining time? On both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes and it \nlooks like 52 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 17 minutes and \n22 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if \nthe Senator from New Mexico is.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have been advised by the Cloakroom \nthat there are certain Senators who expect to have this vote at 10:30. \nI do not need to keep all my time but perhaps we should check on that \nbefore I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we both yield back our time I will move to table, get \nthe yeas and nays, and then we will put it into a quorum call until \nthen?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me also check to see if Senator Bumpers is coming \nto the floor. Let me also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bumpers \nand Senator Dorgan as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nwe charge it equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains for the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not believe I shall use the entire \ntime. I want to stand in support of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] this morning.\n  I find it interesting that those who most loudly profess to want a \nbalanced budget find ways to try to provide handcuffs on those who \nultimately want to achieve a balanced budget. I do not remember who it \nwas who said it, but someone once said, ``The louder they boast of \ntheir honor, the faster I count my spoons.'' I sort of sense that is \nthe situation here.\n  We have a lot of people who say, ``Gee, we want to get to a balanced \nbudget.'' Then they put into law these notions about supermajorities in \norder to do one thing or another. The other body now has a \nsupermajority on raising revenue. What if you have a circumstance where \nthe revenue system is out of kilter and you have one group of people, \nlet us say wealthiest group, that are substantially underpaying what \nthey ought to pay and we feel the need to raise rates on that group, \nand maybe use the money to provide partial benefits to somebody else \nwho is overpaying. You would not be able to do that because it would \ntake a supermajority. That does not make any sense.\n  Why do we prejudge the answer on any taxing or spending issue to \nreach a balanced budget amendment? Some say we do not want anybody to \nincrease taxes. I do not, either. In fact, sign me up for a zero tax \nrate for my constituents. That is what I want. No taxes. But the fact \nis, we have roads, we have schools, we have law enforcement, and we \nhave defense to pay for, the defense of this country. So we have to pay \nfor the things that we spend in the public sector.\n  The question is, Who pays? How do they pay? We can construct a tax \nsystem to do that. Nobody likes it, but it is necessary. It is part of \nour life in this country. We spend money. We raise taxes. Should we cut \nspending? Yes. We should, and we will. Should we raise taxes? Probably \nnot. But is it necessary in some instances probably to do that? We \nfound in 1993 that we had to raise some taxes. I voted for it. I did \nnot like it. The medicine does not taste good, but I was willing to do \nit because I felt it contributed to reducing the Federal deficit.\n  But to allow either body of Congress to prejudge what is necessary to \nachieve a balanced budget is wrong. Senator Bingaman is saying during \nthe 7-year period, you cannot do that. You cannot create \nsupermajorities to try to prejudge those kinds of choices that we \n[[Page S2684]] must take in both the House and the Senate to try to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  I do not ever question motives with respect to Members of Congress. I \nthink some feel very strongly that we ought to have this balanced \nbudget amendment. Others feel equally strongly that we should not. All \nthe Senator from New Mexico is saying is that if you feel strongly that \nwe ought to have a balanced budget amendment or a balanced budget, \neither through an amendment or without an amendment, then you ought not \nput handcuffs on either the revenue or the spending side so that in the \nnext 7 years, freethinking people of good will serving in the House and \nthe Senate can decide on a range of items, on a menu of issues, on how \nto achieve that goal. It is much more important to achieve the goal of \ngetting our fiscal house in order than it is to preach ideology about \ntaxes.\n  The goal is important. Those who crow on the floor of the Senate and \nthe House about the balanced budget amendment are the ones who now say \nto us, yes, we want a balanced budget but we also want to straitjacket \npeople by creating goofy rules. And the Senator from New Mexico says \nlet us all be honest about these things. Let us decide if we are going \nto do this. We will do it the right way.\n  I am happy to cosponsor this. I am pleased to speak for it. I hope \nthat my colleagues who believe that we should balance the budget in \nthis country, who agree with me that we ought to balance the budget to \nget our fiscal house in order, will understand that this is a necessary \ningredient in doing so.\n  I compliment the Senator from New Mexico for offering it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise in support of what I believe is a \nvery well-crafted and thoughtful amendment by the Senator from New \nMexico. If this is going to be a permanent arrangement, then the House \ncould legitimately say you have no business interfering with House \nrules. After all, we hate your 67-vote filibuster rule.\n But that is not what this amendment says. People should not confuse it \nwith any Senate rules. This amendment is crafted to help the people who \nreally believe in this amendment, and especially the people who have \nsigned on to the Contract With America and promised the American people \nthat they will balance the budget by the year 2002. In my opinion, a \nHouse rule that requires a 60-percent majority to raise only one kind \nof tax does not keep you from raising the gasoline tax, does not keep \nyou from raising user fees, excise taxes, does not keep you from \nraising Social Security taxes. What the House has done is say that for \nnow and ever you cannot raise taxes--income taxes only--without a 60-\nvote majority. The Senator from New Mexico is simply saying that this \ncannot go until the House backs off of that for this 7-year period.\n\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if \nthis passes or if this does not pass, I will continue to cooperate with \nevery soul in this body who is genuinely concerned about deficit \nspending and trying to balance the budget. I will help you cut \nspending. I might even help raise taxes if they are properly targeted. \nI will do anything to keep from ending my career in the Senate without \nhaving addressed this most crucial problem facing this Nation. But you \ncannot--the Republicans voted yesterday, and a few Democrats, who said \nyou cannot take Social Security off the table. It has to be a part of \nthis whole plan to balance the budget. Yet, the House says income taxes \nare off the table.\n  What kind of logic is that, to say that the most regressive taxes, \nsales taxes--and we may go with a value added tax here, we may raise \ngasoline taxes, excise taxes, user fees and, yes, even the FICA tax \nthat pays for Social Security. But if you say income taxes are off the \ntable, you are saying the only progressive tax that the Congress might \nwant to use to balance the budget is off the table. Only the regressive \ntaxes that fall heaviest on the people who can least afford it, that is \nwhere you must find it.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to be preaching about this, but that is \nnonsense and it is not fair. It is not fair to the elderly. It is not \nfair to the working people of this country. The people who applaud this \nare the wealthiest people in America, because they pay an inordinately \nsmall part of their incomes for these regressive taxes like gasoline \ntaxes and so on. There are people in my hometown of Charleston, AR, who \ncommute 50 miles to Fort Smith to work. We are sort of a suburb to Fort \nSmith, and most people work in Fort Smith. They drive their cars as \nmuch as I do every year and pay the same tax on that gasoline that I \npay. And I make $133,000 or $135,000 a year--I forget which--and they \nare working for $25,000 a year or less, and we are saying that is just \nJakey, and we may raise taxes on you some more, but we will not raise \nthe taxes on the wealthiest people in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute from the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield an additional minute to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My administrative assistant and I were having a \ndiscussion on the way to work this morning, not just about this \namendment but about the Senate. I said, ``You know, I feel so strongly \nabout the balanced budget amendment and I am so adamantly opposed to it \nbecause I think it guarantees utter chaos.'' It is going to, at some \npoint, absolutely render the U.S. Congress a eunuch. We are not going \nto be able to deal with it under that amendment. I said, ``I do not \nlike to speak unless I feel strongly about something.'' I have a \ntendency to speak on maybe too many amendments. You can wear your \nwelcome out around here by talking too much. So I try to choose \ncarefully. It is very difficult for me because I detest this amendment \nso much. It is difficult to be as choosy about what I talk about. But I \nwant you to know that the Senator from New Mexico is on to something \nvery, very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just say to my colleagues that I have \nnot seen the debate change a vote since the third battle of Manassas in \n1988. People walk on the floor, and they may listen to it in their \noffices, but most do not even do that. So the debate does not change \nit. I daresay that when people walk in here on both sides, they are \ngoing to say, ``What is our vote?'' without realizing the deadly \nconsequences of what the House has done.\n  Senator Bingaman and I and Senator Dorgan, want to help Republicans \nkeep their commitment to balance the budget by the year 2002. I think \nit is utterly and wholly implausible and impossible. But I promise my \ncooperation in helping in any way I can. But to say the one thing you \ncannot do is to raise taxes that are progressive, but you can raise all \nthe regressive taxes you want to to deal with this when we all know \nthat working people in this country are having a terrible struggle just \nkeeping their head above water.\n  So I applaud the Senator from New Mexico. I am pleased he asked me to \nspeak on this because I do feel strongly about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully before they vote on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Is there additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:\n               [[Page S2685]] [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kassebaum\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 248) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feingold, Senator \nBradley and myself, I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the \nBudget Committee with instructions to report back forthwith, House \nJoint Resolution 1 in status quo, and at the earliest date possible to \nissue a report. I send my motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Bradley, moves to refer.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 in status quo and at the earliest date \n     possible, to issue a report, the text of which shall be the \n     following:\n       The Committee finds that--\n       (1) Congress is considering a proposed amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States which will require a \n     balanced budget by the year 2002, or the second fiscal year \n     after its ratification, whichever is later;\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, using \n     current baselines, that between 1996 and 2002, Congress would \n     have to enact some combination of spending cuts and revenue \n     increases totalling more than $1 trillion to achieve a \n     balanced budget;\n       (3) some taxpayers now receive preferential tax treatment \n     and tax subsidies through such things as special industry-\n     specific exemptions, exclusions, deductions, credits, \n     allowances, deferrals or depreciations which are not \n     available to other taxpayers;\n       (4) some special industry-specific tax preferences do not \n     serve any compelling public purposes, but simply favor some \n     industries over others and serve to distort investment and \n     other economic decisionmaking;\n       (5) certain of these tax preferences, which serve no \n     compelling public purpose, are special exceptions to the \n     general rules of the tax law to which most Americans are \n     required to adhere;\n       (6) the costs of such tax preferences are borne in part by \n     middle-income taxpayers who pay at higher tax rates than they \n     would otherwise;\n       (7) special tax treatment and tax subsidies constitute a \n     form of tax expenditures which should be subjected to the \n     same level of scrutiny in deficit reduction efforts as that \n     applied to direct spending programs, and\n       (8) it is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     that tax expenditures, particularly industry-specific \n     preferential treatment, should be subjected to the same level \n     of scrutiny in the budget as direct spending programs.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to yield myself such time as I \nmay consume but before doing so, I would like to defer for a moment to \nthe Senator from Washington who I know has another engagement. The \nSenator wanted to speak, I think, in opposition to this amendment, but \nI would like to give him the opportunity to do so since he will not \nhave any time later on.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. First, Mr. President, I would like to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Minnesota for giving me the courtesy and \nreferring me this time. It is, of course, appropriate for the maker of \nthe motion to speak first. It is very nice of him to allow this.\n  It does, however, seem to me that this motion is very closely related \nto the debate that we have had earlier on the proposition that there \nshould be a condition which takes place before or during the time that \nthe constitutional amendment is submitted to the States relating to the \nmethods by which we are to meet the requirement of a balanced budget.\n  In this case, I gather, most of the motion refers to tax \nexpenditures.\n The bottom line, however, Mr. President, is that these motions and the \namendments which have been proposed heretofore have almost, without \nexception, come from those who oppose amending the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget, and they are designed to inhibit or to slow \n  down either its passage by this body or its ratification by the States.\nMost of those Members, I am certain, including the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, do speak of their devotion to fiscal \nresponsibility and to a balanced budget. It seems to me that under \nthose circumstances, the thrust, the duty to explain what they will do \nto deal with the terrible $200 billion-a-year budget deficits from now \nto eternity rests on them, those who feel that the status quo is \nperfectly all right; that we should not change the rules relating to \nbudget deficits; that the way we have dealt with them in the past is \nthe way we should deal with them in the future. It is they, Mr. \nPresident, who ought to explain to us precisely how it is that they \nwould change either our spending processes or our taxing programs to \nbring the deficit of the United States into balance.\n  Those of us who favor the passage of this constitutional amendment \nunadorned are those who feel that the system is broken, that the system \nis not working, that 25 consecutive years of mounting budget deficits \nand a $4 to $5 trillion debt require a drastic and a fundamental change \nin the way in which it would work and are doing so because we observe \nthe history of those 25 years. We have observed all of the unsuccessful \nattempts to reach a degree of fiscal sanity and fiscal responsibility, \nand we have observed that those alternate methods have not worked and \nthat it is unlikely that they will work in the future.\n  We propose a constitutional amendment because a constitutional \namendment will bring everyone into the fold. Presidents, liberal \nMembers, conservative Members, Democrats and Republicans will be forced \nby the constraints of the Constitution to deal with budget deficits in \nthe future in a way in which they have refused to deal with them in the \npast.\n  The latest example of this failure, of course, is the President's \nbudget itself, a budget which simply gives up on dealing with the \ndeficit, which calls for no significant reductions in the deficit, not \njust for the 5 years that it covers but for 10-year projections out \nfrom today. It is a confession of failure. But more than a confession \nof failure, it is a confession of failure coupled with the proposition \nthat there will be no attempt to cure that failure, to do better at any \ntime in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that the best thing, the desirable \nthing, for us to do in the Senate is to recognize that the system is \nbroken, that the system needs fixing, that the only fix that is likely \nto be successful is a constitutional amendment, that we should pass it \nand begin the process by which the States can consider its ratification \nas quickly as possible.\n  But in the alternative, it seems to me that it is up to those who \noppose this constitutional amendment to tell us how they are going to \ncure the problem operating under exactly the system which has created \nthe problem in the first place.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota very, very much for yielding to \nme. I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S2686]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Douglas \nJohnson and Mark Miller be given the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just to be very, very clear because I \nbelieve that all of us, Democrats and Republicans, should be clear \nabout what we are voting on, this amendment does not in any way, shape \nor form have any kind of conditions vis-a-vis the balanced budget \namendment. There is not any language in this amendment that so states.\n  What this amendment says is:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in enacting the policy \n     changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion in \n     deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     that tax expenditures, particularly industry-specific \n     preferential treatment, should be subject to the same level \n     of scrutiny in the budget as direct spending programs.\n\n  It just simply says that since we know we are going to be involved in \na serious effort on deficit reduction and since we know we all share \nthe common goal of balancing the budget, though we may not agree a \nconstitutional amendment is the way to do so, that we ought to make \nsure that tax expenditures, which Senator Feingold and I are going to \nexplain at some length during the course of this debate, be on the \ntable; that that be part of what we look at; that we look at certain \nbreaks, loopholes, and certain deductions. That is all. There is no \ncondition vis-a-vis the balanced budget amendment. The Senator from \nWashington is wrong on that point.\n  Second, I might add, that procedurally, this is really identical to \nthe motion of the majority leader dealing with Social Security. It is \nidentical, and I believe that motion was passed by over 80 Senators. So \nthis has nothing to do with your position on the balanced budget \namendment one way or the other.\n  Let me go on and explain.\n  Mr. President, this motion will put the Senate on record saying that \nin our effort to balance the budget, in our effort to go forward with \ndeficit reduction--whether it be by a balanced budget constitutional \namendment or otherwise; we are all aiming in the same direction--that \nwe will scrutinize all Federal spending not just, Mr. President, cuts \nof least resistance.\n  What I am worried about, speaking for myself, and I look forward to \nhearing the remarks of the Senator from Wisconsin, is that when it \ncomes to deficit reduction or when it comes to balancing the budget, \nwhat we will do is make cuts according to the path of least political \nresistance. That is to say, when it comes to ordinary citizens who do \nnot have the clout, who do not have the lobbyists, who do not make the \nlarge contributions, they will be called upon to sacrifice.\n  I think most people in the country are willing to sacrifice. We just \nwant to make sure that there is a standard of fairness and that large \ninterests, large corporations, financial interests, wealthy people, and \nothers who, as a matter of fact, benefit disproportionately by some of \nthe tax breaks which cause other people to pay more in taxes, also are \ncalled upon to pay their fair share or to sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, in all of the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nin all of the debate about how we are going to essentially have budget \ncuts of $1.4 trillion or thereabouts there is an enormous credibility \ngap. Because so far all I have heard on the Republican side is \nproposals for budget cuts of $277 billion. There is a big difference \nbetween $277 billion and $1.481 trillion.\n  In all of the debate so far, whether it be right to know vis-a-vis \nStates saying that the people back in our States ought to have a right \nto know what the impact would be on them or, for that matter, whether \nit is our right to know, I still believe that the most important \nprinciple of all is that Senators ought to have the right to know what \nthey are voting on, where the cuts will take place, and how they will \naffect the people.\n  There has not been a word uttered about one particular kind of \nspending that enjoys a special status within the Federal budget. I am \ntalking about tax breaks for special classes or categories of \ntaxpayers, many of whose benefits go largely to large corporations or \nthe other wealthy interests in our society.\n  I remind you, Mr. President, that when we have these tax breaks and \nwhen we have these deductions and loopholes and when certain citizens \nor certain large interests are forgiven from having to pay their fair \nshare, all of the rest of us end up paying more.\n  Let me make a simple point here that is often overlooked. We can \nspend money just as easily through the Tax Code through what are called \ntax expenditures as we can through the normal appropriations process. \nSpending is spending, whether it comes in the form of a government \ncheck or in the form of a tax break for some special purpose, like a \nsubsidy, a credit, a deduction, or accelerated depreciation for a type \nof investment that is made. These tax expenditures--in some cases they \nare tax loopholes--allow some taxpayers to escape paying their fair \nshare and thus they make everyone else pay at higher rates.\n  The Congressional Joint Tax Committee has estimated that these tax \nexpenditures cost the U.S. Treasury $420 billion every single year. \nThese loopholes, these deductions cause the U.S. Treasury to lose $420 \nbillion every single year, and this amount will grow on present course \nby $60 billion to over $485 billion by 1999.\n  Mr. President, these tax expenditures, often they are tax dodges, \nshould be on the table along with other spending as we look for places \nto cut the deficit. That is our point. That is, by any standard of \nfairness, what we should do. Just because certain people have a \ntremendous amount of political clout does not mean they should not be \nasked also to be a part of this sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, when we begin to weigh, for example, scaling back \nspecial treatment, depreciation allowance for the oil and gas \nindustry--and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \neliminating this tax break would generate $3.4 billion over the next 5 \nyears--when we start to compare and measure tax breaks for oil \ncompanies compared to cuts we are going to be making in food and \nnutrition programs for hungry children, we might have a very different \nanswer.\n  We have to make tough choices. And what Senator Feingold, myself, and \nSenator Bradley want to make sure of is that all of the options are on \nthe table, and that when we make these choices, and we do the painful \ndeficit reduction, we do it according to some basic standard of \nfairness.\n  What this motion does is simply state the sense of the Senate that we \nwill carefully examine tax expenditures when the Budget Committee makes \nrecommendations as to how we are going to continue on this path of \ndeficit reduction and how we are going to balance the budget. At the \nmoment, these tax expenditures are unexamined. They are hidden. They \nare untouchable. And, essentially, these are the real entitlements \nbecause we do not even examine any of these large subsidies.\n  What we are saying in this amendment is that we ought to at least \nexamine these tax expenditures, we ought to at least examine these \nsubsidies. This motion does not specify what specific subsidies might \nbe eliminated. It just says tax expenditures ought to be a part of our \nprocess here in the Congress as we make these decisions about where we \nare going to make the cuts.\n  As I have listened to this debate--and again I am struck by this \nfigure of $1.4 trillion worth of cuts that would have to be made by \n2002 to balance the budget--I must say that I have heard little \ndiscussion, first of all, about where we are going to make the cuts, \nand second of all, I have heard little discussion about any sacrifice \nfrom large corporations and special interests who have \ndisproportionately enjoyed all of these breaks, all of these benefits, \nall of these preferences, all of these deductions that many, many \nmiddle-class Americans do not enjoy.\n  And so that is why we offer this motion to refer this amendment to \nthe Budget Committee with instructions to report back a sense of the \nSenate that these breaks and preferences should be put that on the \ntable when we are talking about how we do our deficit reduction.\n  Now, Mr. President, not all of these tax expenditures are bad. Let me \nbe \n[[Page S2687]] clear. Not all of them should be eliminated. Some of \nthem serve a real public purpose, providing incentives to investment, \nbolstering the nonprofit sector, enabling people to purchase a home. \nThat is very important. However, some of them are simply tax dodges \nthat can no longer be justified, but we do not even examine them. What \nwe are saying in this amendment is, let us at least examine these tax \nexpenditures and especially let us get strict and rigorous when we are \nlooking at some of these tax dodges.\n  Mr. President, this motion simply states that if we are going to move \ntoward balancing the budget, tax expenditures that provide this \npreferential treatment to certain taxpayers should be subject to the \nsame scrutiny as all direct spending programs. That is all we are \nsaying. This is really a matter of accountability.\n  I think it is also, Mr. President, a simple question of fairness. If \nwe are going to make all of these cuts, then we should make sure that \nthe wealthy interests in our society, those who have the political \nclout, those who hire the lobbyists, those who make the large \ncontributions, those who we call the big players are also asked to \nsacrifice as much as regular middle-class folks in Minnesota and in \nWisconsin; they should be asked to sacrifice as much as anybody else, \nespecially when we know there are going to be deep and severe cuts in \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid, veterans programs, and education.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report last year. It is titled \n``Tax Policy--Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny.'' I commend it to \nmy colleagues' attention. I really think that my colleagues ought to \nread it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an executive summary of the report be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The GAO report of 1993 makes a compelling case for \nsubjecting these tax expenditures to greater congressional and \nadministration scrutiny just as direct spending is scrutinized. The GAO \nnotes that most of these tax expenditures currently in the Tax Code are \nnot subject to any annual reauthorization or any kind of periodic \nreview. And they observe that many of these special tax breaks were \nenacted in response to economic conditions that no longer exist. In \nfact, they found that of the 124 tax expenditures identified by the \ncommittee in 1993, half of these tax expenditures, half of these \nspecial breaks were enacted before 1950.\n  Now, that does not automatically call them into question, and our \namendment does not talk about any specific tax expenditure that should \nbe eliminated. But it does illustrate the problem of not annually \nreviewing these tax expenditures. These tax expenditures should not be \ntreated as entitlements. They should not go on year after year and \ndecade after decade without there being any careful examination. There \nhas been no systematic review of these expenditures.\n  Indeed, the GAO reports that most of the revenue losses through tax \nexpenditures come from provisions enacted during the years 1909 to \n1919. Let me repeat that. Most of the revenue lost from these tax \nbreaks--some of them necessary but many of them just blatant tax \ndodges--must be made up by either regular taxpayers through higher \ntaxes or revenue not there for deficit reduction, comes about from \nprovisions enacted during the years 1909 to 1919.\n  When I looked at the Republican Contract With America, I did not see \none single sentence, not one single word in this Contract With America \nthat called upon any large financial interest or any large corporation \nor, wealthy citizens, to be a part of this sacrifice. Let me just \nfinish up by listing a few provisions, to give a sense of where we \ncould have it. And, again, we call for no specific elimination of any \nspecific tax expenditure.\n  Mr. President, I think actually what I will do for the moment is \nyield myself the rest of the time I might need but defer to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for a moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        [From GAO Report 94-122]\n\n Tax Policy--Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny--Executive Summary\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       At a time when the federal government faces hard choices to \n     reduce the deficit and use available resources wisely, no \n     federal expenditure or subsidy, whether it involves outlays \n     (i.e., discretionary or direct spending) or tax revenues \n     forgone, should escape careful examination. Congressional and \n     executive branch processes do not subject existing tax \n     expenditures to the same controls that apply to programs \n     receiving appropriated funds.\n       Congressman William J. Coyne was concerned that a lack of \n     attention to income tax expenditures has allowed them to \n     increase and was interested in how they could be controlled. \n     GAO examined a wide range of alternatives for the review and \n     control of income tax expenditures. This report describes the \n     size of increases in tax expenditures; examines whether tax \n     expenditures need increased scrutiny; and identifies options \n     that could be used to increase the scrutiny of and/or control \n     the growth of tax expenditures, discussing the advantages and \n     disadvantages of each.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Tax expenditures are reductions in tax liabilities that \n     result from preferential provisions in the tax code, such as \n     exemptions and exclusions from taxation, deductions, credits, \n     deferrals, and preferential tax rates. Many tax expenditures \n     are subsidies to encourage certain behaviors, such as \n     charitable giving. A few tax expenditures exist, at least in \n     part, to adjust for differences in individuals' ability to \n     pay taxes, such as deductions for catastrophic medical \n     expenses. Some tax expenditures may also compensate for other \n     parts of the tax system. For example, some argue the special \n     tax treatment of capital gains may in part offset the \n     increased taxes on capital income that result from such gains \n     not being indexed for inflation. Congress sometimes reviews \n     tax expenditures and has limited some tax expenditures by \n     various means, such as by limiting the benefits as taxpayers' \n     incomes increase.\n       Although widely used to describe preferential provisions in \n     the tax code, the term tax ``expenditures'' is not \n     universally accepted. Some observers believe that labeling \n     these provisions tax ``expenditures'' implies that all forms \n     of income inherently belong to the government. However, the \n     concept was developed to show that certain tax provisions are \n     analogous to programs on the outlay side of the budget, and \n     it was intended to promote better informed decisions about \n     how to achieve federal\n      objectives. In using this term, GAO is recognizing that, as \n     a practical matter, tax expenditures are part of the \n     federal budget, and Congress already uses the tax \n     expenditure concept to a limited extent in budgetary \n     processes.\n       Currently, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Senate Committee on Finance have jurisdiction over both new \n     and existing tax expenditures. These Committees propose the \n     mix of tax rates and tax expenditures to be used to obtain a \n     specified amount of revenue. In reviewing tax expenditures, \n     these Committees have used several techniques to limit \n     individual tax expenditures or groups of them. These reviews, \n     however, are not conducted systematically and may not \n     explicitly consider possible trade-offs between tax \n     expenditures and federal outlay programs and mandates.\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       Tax expenditures can be a valid means for achieving certain \n     federal objectives. However, studies by GAO and others have \n     raised concerns about the effectiveness, efficiency, or \n     equity of some tax expenditures. Substantial revenues are \n     forgone through tax expenditures but they do not overtly \n     compete in the annual budget process, and most are not \n     subject to reauthorization. As a result, policymakers have \n     few opportunities to make explicit comparisons or trade-offs \n     between tax expenditures and federal spending programs. The \n     growing revenues forgone through tax expenditures reduce the \n     resources available to fund other programs or reduce the \n     deficit and force tax rates to be higher to obtain a given \n     amount of revenue.\n       The three options discussed in this report may help \n     increase attention paid to tax expenditures and reduce their \n     revenue losses where appropriate. First, greater scrutiny \n     could be achieved with little or no change in congressional \n     processes and jurisdictions by strengthening or extending \n     techniques currently used to control tax expenditures. \n     Ceilings and floors on eligibility, better highlighting of \n     information, or setting a schedule for periodic review of \n     some tax expenditures are some possibilities under this \n     option. If controlling tax expenditures through the current \n     framework is considered insufficient, Congress could change \n     its processes to exert more control over them.\n       The second option is for Congress to further integrate tax \n     expenditures into the budget process. One feasible approach \n     would be for Congress to decide whether savings in tax \n     expenditures are desirable and, if so, to set\n      in annual budget resolutions specific savings targets. \n     Savings could be enforced through existing reconciliation \n       processes.A third option is to integrate reviews of tax \n     expenditures with functionally related outlay programs, which \n     could make the government's overall funding effort more \n     efficient. Such integrated reviews could be done by the \n     executive or legislative branches, or both.\n       [[Page S2688]] Under the Government Performance and Results \n     Act of 1993 (GPRA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n     plans to report information on program goals and key \n     indicators for both outlays and tax expenditures. In January \n     1994, OMB designated 53 performance measurement pilot \n     projects to begin in 1994. Implementation of GPRA provides a \n     promising opportunity to increase the usefulness and \n     visibility of outcome-oriented performance data.\n\n\n                             GAO's Analysis\n\n       Tax expenditures can be a useful part of federal policy. \n     But in some cases tax expenditures may not be the most \n     effective, efficient, or equitable approach for providing \n     government subsidies. For example, it might be less expensive \n     for the federal government to provide assistance to state and \n     local governments through direct payments than through tax-\n     exempt bonds. Because tax expenditures represent a \n     significant part of the total federal effort to reallocate \n     resources, choosing the best methods for achieving \n     objectives, including the most effective tax expenditure \n     designs, could have significant results. (See pp. 23-32).\n\n    Tax expenditures have been growing but are difficult to measure\n\n       GAO primarily used Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) \n     estimates to analyze the size and growth of tax expenditures. \n     According to these data, tax expenditures totaled about $400 \n     billion in 1993. Their average annual percent increase in \n     real terms for the period from 1974 to 1993 was about 4 \n     percent, which compares to an average annual real increase \n     for gross domestic product of about 2.5 percent. Tax \n     expenditures are expected to continue growing; however, the \n     rate of growth is uncertain.\n       As experts note, tax expenditure revenue loss estimates are \n     not as informative as the revenue estimates made for proposed \n     changes to the tax code. Whereas revenue estimates \n     incorporate the changes in taxpayer behavior that are \n     anticipated to occur as a result of the change, tax \n     expenditure revenue loss estimates do not incorporate any \n     behavioral effects. Furthermore, summing tax expenditure \n     revenue losses ignores\n      interaction effects among tax code provisions. Because of \n     interactions with other parts of the tax code, the revenue \n     loss from the elimination of several tax expenditures \n     together may be greater or smaller than the sum of the \n     revenue losses for each tax expenditure measured alone. \n     Nevertheless, GAO believes tax expenditure revenue loss \n     totals represent a useful gauge of the general magnitude \n     of government subsidies carried out through the tax code.\n       When trends in these totals are looked at, however, care \n     must be taken to consider the possible underlying causes. \n     Aggregate tax expenditure magnitudes are affected by changes \n     in tax rates, in economic activity, and in the number of tax \n     preferences. An overall growth in aggregate tax expenditures \n     may be due to rapid growth of a few tax expenditures--and \n     some point to the rapid growth of health-related expenditures \n     as a current example. However, no process currently prompts \n     Congress to address these trends and decide whether they \n     warrant policymaking actions.\n       JCT and the Department of the Treasury devote limited \n     resources to estimating tax expenditure revenue losses \n     because decisions are not based routinely on this \n     information. GAO did not attempt to verify either JCT's or \n     Treasury's tax expenditure estimates. (See pp. 33-38.)\n\n      Processes do not highlight tax expenditures for policymakers\n\n       Despite their significance, existing tax expenditures do \n     not compete overtly in the annual budget process. Under \n     budget processes, new tax expenditures must be funded as they \n     are created. However, except for a few that are subject to \n     reauthorization, existing tax expenditures, like most \n     entitlement programs, can grow without congressional review. \n     These tax expenditures are indirectly controlled primarily to \n     the extent that revenue targets allocated to the tax \n     committees under the budget process create pressure to \n     decrease their growth. Although tax expenditures are listed \n     separately in the president's budget each year, the lists are \n     not used for making tax expenditure allocations or for \n     comparisons with outlay programs. As a result, policymakers \n     have few opportunities to make explicit comparisons or trade-\n     offs between tax expenditures and federal spending programs. \n     (See pp. 30-32.)\n\n                      Options for greater scrutiny\n\n       Increased congressional review of or control over tax \n     expenditures could be achieved under three general options, \n     each consisting of several alternative approaches:\n       Option 1: This option involves methods currently within the \n     purview of congressional tax-writing committees. It includes \n     ``program'' reviews of individual tax expenditures that may \n     lead to the redesign or elimination of some that are deemed \n     inefficient or outmoded. Currently available control \n     techniques include placing ceilings or floors on eligibility \n     for tax expenditure benefits, structuring tax expenditures as \n     credits rather than exclusion or deductions, limiting the \n     value of itemized deductions to the lowest marginal tax rate, \n     and limiting the value of deductions and exclusions for high-\n     income taxpayers. To promote debate on tax expenditures, \n     additional information on them could also be highlighted \n     using current processes. For instance, they could be merged \n     into budget presentations with related outlay programs. The \n     methods currently used to review and control tax expenditures \n     also could be used in conjunction with the following two \n     options that would alter somewhat the existing congressional \n     procedures for overseeing tax expenditures. (See pp. 39-56.)\n       Option 2: This option involves further integrating tax \n     expenditures into budget rules. This could limit existing tax \n     expenditures and encourage closer reviews of performance. One \n     approach to further integration that GAO examined--placing an \n     aggregate cap on forgone revenue--probably would not work \n     because technical problems would be difficult to overcome. A \n     second approach--in the form of a tax expenditure savings \n     target--is feasible. Under this approach, in years that it \n     wishes, Congress could specify a fixed amount of reduction in \n     forgone revenue from tax expenditures in the budget \n     resolution, which would be enforced through existing \n     reconciliation processes. To promote greater public \n     accountability, Congress could be prompted to explain in the \n     annual budget resolution the reasons for its decision to \n     either adopt or not adopt a savings target.\n       Definitional and measurement problems, which are \n     exacerbated by an aggregate cap, could be lessened \n     substantially under a savings target. Technical problems \n     would be reduced because--as is now the case in \n     reconciliation--revenue estimates are required only for the \n     subset of tax expenditure provisions under consideration. \n     However, requiring a specific amount of base broadening \n     through the budget process would involve more actors in tax \n     policymaking, especially with respect to expanding the \n     authority of the budget committees. (See pp. 57-70.)\n       Option 3: Joint reviews of federal spending programs and \n     related tax expenditures could be adopted to improve \n     coordination and reduce overlap or duplication among outlay \n     and tax expenditure programs. Joint reviews could be done in \n     both the legislative and executive branches. Joint\n      review of spending programs and related tax expenditures \n     could be accomplished by having program committees hold joint \n     hearings with tax committees. More formally, Congress could \n     adopt sequential jurisdiction for tax expenditure subsidy \n     ``programs'' or establish joint committees in functional \n     areas. Because fewer jurisdictional hurdles would arise, the \n     executive branch annual budget preparation process may offer \n     a more expeditious opportunity to implement such reviews. \n  (See pp. 71-92.)Recent legislation promises better tax expenditure \n                              information\n\n       According to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     report on GPRA, OMB is expected to describe a framework for \n     undertaking periodic analyses of the effects of tax \n     expenditures in achieving performance goals in a May 1, 1997, \n     report to the President and Congress. GPRA thus presents an \n     opportunity to develop better information about tax \n     expenditure performance and to use that information to \n     stimulate discussion and oversight as well as to make \n     determinations as to how the government can best achieve its \n     objectives, OMB indicates that initial discussions have been \n     held on developing output measures for key tax expenditures \n     and that reviews or related tax expenditures and outlays will \n     be done in the future. (See pp. 90-92.)\n\n\n               recommendation to congressional committees\n\n       GAO recommends that the tax-writing committees explore, \n     within the existing framework, opportunities to exercise more \n     scrutiny over indirect ``spending'' through tax expenditures.\n\n\n                matters for congressional consideration\n\n       Should Congress wish to view tax expenditure efforts in a \n     broader context of the allocation of federal resources, it \n     could consider the options of further integrating them into \n     the budget process or instituting some form of integrated \n     functional reviews.\n\n\n                         agency recommendations\n\n       GAO makes several recommendations to the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget intended to encourage a more \n     informed debate about tax expenditures among executive and \n     legislative policymakers and to stimulate joint review within \n     the executive branch of tax expenditures and related spending \n     programs. These recommendations should result in more \n     informed decisions, by Congress and by the public, about the \n     most appropriate means of achieving federal objectives. GAO \n     envisions that in carrying out these recommendations, OMB \n     would consult as appropriate with the Department of the \n     Treasury and other federal agencies.\n\n\n                            agency comments\n\n       In written comments on a draft of this report, OMB and \n     Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) expressed support for \n     expanded federal review of tax expenditures by the executive \n     branch or Congress. More specifically, OMB agreed, with \n     certain caveats, that GAO's recommendations to it were \n     reasonable and indicated that the recommendations were \n     consistent with efforts OMB has already begun. Regarding the \n     three options for improved oversight of tax expenditures, OMB \n     agreed that improved information on tax expenditures was \n     desirable and that integrated comparisons of outlay programs \n     and related tax expenditures may provide useful insights. In \n     its recently announced reorganization, OMB promised to \n     undertake joint reviews of related spending and tax \n     expenditure programs during upcoming budget cycles.\n       OMB and Treasury were concerned that the integration of tax \n     expenditures into the \n     [[Page S2689]] budget process might not produce better \n     outcomes than current processes. Treasury also expressed \n     reservations about whether joint reviews of related spending \n     and tax expenditure programs would provide the benefits \n     anticipated.\n       OMB and Treasury's comments are discussed at the end of \n     chapter 6. (See pp. 99-108.) OMB also suggested a number of \n     useful technical changes, which were included.\n       OMB also obtained reactions on its draft report from JCT, \n     the Congressional Budget Office, and two individuals \n     knowledgeable about the issues discussed in the report. These \n     organizations and individuals made observations on the report \n     message, which are discussed at the end of chapter 6, and \n     offered technical suggestions, which were included as \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my particular thanks to the senior \nSenator from Minnesota, who is doing a wonderful job of raising this \nissue of tax expenditures. I have enjoyed, both here in the U.S. Senate \nand especially back in the Wisconsin State Senate, just trying to point \nout when you spend money on a tax loophole and give people a special \ntax break, that is spending, too. It is taking the hard-earned tax \ndollar of the American people, putting it into a package and sending it \nout just to a few people. It is an awful lot like a spending program.\n  Our point here today is that often it does not get treated that way. \nIt gets treated like somehow it is just a tax break for everybody, \nwhich, of course, it is not. If we are going to solve the Federal \ndeficit and really have a balanced budget amendment, the Senator from \nMinnesota and I are saying this obviously has to be on the table. This \nhas to be considered, too.\n  So I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Minnesota in \noffering this motion which is designed to put the Senate on record, \ninsisting that when we get around to actually trying to balance the \nFederal budget we have to subject these tax expenditures--many of them \ninappropriate tax loopholes--to the same kind of scrutiny we will use \nto examine direct spending programs.\n  I feel I need to respond to the comments of the Senator from \nWashington, who spoke earlier today. He suggested all the Senator from \nMinnesota and I were doing was proposing an amendment designed to \ninhibit the balanced budget amendment itself. That is just not the \ncase. I think those watching, everybody involved in this, should know \nthat is really an unfortunate argument since the mechanism we are \nusing, a motion to refer, is the very same mechanism that the majority \nleader used to get himself on record on Social Security. It does not \ndelay the process at all. It just is a statement about the fact that \ncertain things ought to be considered when we balance the budget.\n  It strikes me as a little bit unfair to attack the motives of those \nbehind this amendment. There is no possibility that this will upend the \nbalanced budget amendment. Whether it has the votes or not, even though \nI like this amendment a lot I do not think the Senator from Minnesota \nor I have any belief at all this will stop the balanced budget \namendment. It is just another attempt to have some honesty and some \ncandor with the American people about what is going on here. And, in \nparticular, to identify where the money is, why we have such a huge \nFederal deficit. One of the big reasons is tax loopholes that have not \nbeen covered, that have not been fixed, and that cost us a fortune.\n  Mr. President, no one should mistake the difficult job that lies \nahead in seeking to achieve a balanced budget, with or without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has already told us, using current \nbaselines, that between 1996 and 2002, Congress will have to enact some \ncombination of spending cuts and revenue increases totaling more than \n$1 trillion to achieve a balanced budget.\n  There is strong sentiment, which I share, that we need to cut Federal \nspending, and that much of the deficit reduction achieved over the next \nseveral years will be as a result of cut backs in direct spending \nprograms.\n  That will happen. I am very enthusiastic about being part of that \nprocess, as I have been for the last 2 years--identifying specific \nprograms that do not make sense anymore and that can and should be \neliminated. That is very important to this process. But I also believe \nit is vitally important that in looking for ways to reduce the Federal \ndeficit and bring the Federal budget into balance that we subject tax \nexpenditures to the same kind of scrutiny applied to direct spending \nprograms. That sounds simple, but in the land of the lobbyist inside \nthe beltway of D.C., it is not so simple. Tax expenditures, tax \nloopholes get treated very differently. They are special. They are off \nthe table. They are protected.\n  Tax expenditures generally refer to preferential Tax Code provisions \nwhich give special treatment to specific industries or provide tax \nsubsidies to consumers of particular products.\n  Last year, the General Accounting Office issued a report, ``Tax \nPolicy: Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny,'' which focused upon \nthe need to subject tax expenditures to the same type of scrutiny \napplied to direct spending programs.\n  The GAO report noted that most tax expenditures are not subject to \nreauthorization or any type of systematic review.\n Once they are in, they are in. They have a life of their own. They \nhave immortality, in effect, in a way that spending programs do not. \nOnce enacted these provisions are enshrined in the Tax Code and they \n  are very, very difficult to dislodge.GAO noted many were originally \nenacted to address economic conditions that at the time were important. \nBut many of the economic conditions that these tax expenditures were \nmeant to address just do not exist anymore. But they keep on going, \nlike the Energizer tax expenditures--it does not matter. They can be \ncompletely irrelevant. Once they are in the Tax Code they are there and \nyou are paying for it. We are all paying for these in higher taxes--or, \nat this point, in higher deficits and higher payment on interest to pay \nfor those deficits.\n  For example, the GAO found of the 124 tax expenditures identified by \nthe Joint Tax Committee in 1993, about half were enacted before 1950 \nsomething that the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out very \npersuasively. A lot of these are real old. They were not just enacted \nin the last 2 or 3 years. For example some of the tax allowances \navailable to specific industries to recover certain costs of acquiring \nmineral deposits were enacted during World War I. Without an expiration \ndate there is just very little impetus and no real trigger to review \nwhether these provisions still make sense.\n  It reminds me a lot of some of the programs we have talked about and \nboth parties seem willing to eliminate, such as the helium program. I \nhave authored a bill to eliminate the old helium program that had to do \nwith providing helium for blimps. It is an old program from the earlier \npart of the century. The President said we should get rid of it. \nRepublicans in the other body say we should get rid of it. Those are \nheld up to scrutiny, those are held up to ridicule sometimes, as the \nwool and mohair program, the Tea Testing Board, the search for \nextraterrestrial intelligence--these get held up in the light of the \nday. Everybody laughs at them. They are prime time because they are \nspending programs. But if it is the same kind of thing for special \ninterests in the Tax Code nobody talks about them. It is a nice, quiet \nthing to sweep under the rug and make the American people pay a ton of \nmoney to keep these tax expenditures going. Let me give a couple of \nexamples.\n  Since 1943, the Tax Code has allowed U.S. civilian employees who work \nabroad certain special allowances for things like housing and \neducation, travel, and special cost-of-living allowances. As a result, \nemployees who receive a large part of their incomes through these \nallowances rather than through direct salaries receive preferential \ntreatment--a better deal than the rest of the American people.\n  I became aware of these special allowances when I was involved in \ntrying to accomplish another cut last session which we did achieve, a \nsubstantial spending cut in direct spending in overseas broadcasts. We \nfound out in the last Congress that to curb some of the excessive \nsalaries and allowances paid to employees of Radio Free Europe and \nRadio Liberty, to the Board of International Broadcasting, would \ninvolve dealing with one of these tax expenditures. As the Senator from \nMinnesota has said, some of these exemptions may be justifiable. \nHowever, I do know they can be abused and manipulated to \n[[Page S2690]] get around salary caps that Congress has put in place \nfor all the other Federal agencies. For these folks there is a special \ndeal. It gets no review.\n  Another example, Citizens for Tax Justice noted in a recent report \nthat interest income earned by foreign nationals on loans to American \ncompanies or the U.S. Government was exempted from the U.S. tax since \n1984. In other words each of us pays taxes on our interest income but a \nforeign national does not pay any U.S. tax on that income, according to \nthe Citizen's for Tax Justice. And this is again an unfair deal, in my \nview. When this exemption was passed a decade ago maybe there was some \njustification for it. But we ought to have some kind of review of this \ntype of tax preference to see if it is still appropriate. Has it had \nsome beneficial impact in terms of inducing foreign nationals to make \nloans to U.S. entities? Maybe so. Or is it just a windfall that is \nstuck in the Tax Code and that we cannot get rid of? We need to ask \nwhether in today's international climate our foreign investment \ndecisions are made more on projections regarding political and economic \nstability or on these kind of breaks.\n  A third example, and the Senator from Minnesota alluded to this.\n  Since 1916, the gas and oil industry has had special expensing rules \nfor exploration and development costs.\n  A compendium of background material on individual tax expenditure \nprovisions that was compiled by the Senate Budget Committee last \nDecember described these provisions as having ``very little, if any, \neconomic justification.''\n  This report goes on to say that many economists believe that these \nprovisions are a ``costly and inefficient way to increase oil and gas \noutput and enhance energy security.''\n  Again, Mr. President, we are not raising this example alone because \nwe have reached a final conclusion as to the merits of this special tax \npreference that is provided to one industry; rather, a tax preference \nestablished in 1916 simply ought to be carefully reconsidered in 1995 \nand thereafter, and the burden, Mr. President, should be on the \nproponents of the special preference to justify it because, by having \nthis special preference, we all have to pay more.\n  If tax expenditures were subjected to reauthorization and sunset \nrules like direct spending programs, they might not fare as well as \nthey do today.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is interested in \nspeaking again. Let me just add a few other quick comments.\n  There are other cases. I just mentioned some larger items. Although \nthe revenue loss to the Treasury over time is actually significant, it \ndoes not look like so much in any particular year. The Joint Tax \nCommittee only lists preferential Tax Code provisions that have a \nprojected total revenue loss of over $50 million or more in a 5-year \nperiod.\n  So these are regarded as small tax court provisions and again, even \nthough they amount to quite a bit over time, they escape scrutiny year \nafter year in the budget process. In contrast, you can be sure, Mr. \nPresident, that a direct spending program that would cost $10 million \nper year for 5 years would certainly be subject to review by both an \nauthorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee on a regular \nbasis.\n  But to try to put it simply, what the Senator from Minnesota and I \nare talking about is this: He said, if you have the political clout and \nthe influence to stick a special tax exemption in the House Ways and \nMeans Committee or in the Finance Committee in the Senate, you are all \nset. That thing is in there forever. It is protected. It is not talked \nabout. It is not considered spending. It is not considered part of the \ndeficit. It is not considered part of the debt. It is not considered \npart of the burden on our children and grandchildren. But it is money. \nIt is real money. But if you are an older person who wants a meal at an \nelderly nutrition site, or a child who is in Head Start, or somebody \nwho wants to see an Amtrak train in your State so people can get to \nwork without polluting the environment, you are scrutinized. You have \nto defend and stand and undergo the tremendous pressure that this \ndeficit has created, and, in part, that deficit is because of these tax \nloopholes.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, there are a number of reasons why tax \nexpenditures should be subjected to the same scrutiny as direct \nspending programs. First, it is an equity issue. When some taxpayers \nreceive special preference, the burden shifts to those who do not have \nlobbyists to win special breaks to pick up the difference. Giving \nspecial tax breaks to some industry means other industries will have \nthe higher tax rates to get the same revenue. It also means the \ntaxpayers with similar income and expenses end up having to pay \ndifferent rates of taxes depending on whether they engage in the tax \nsubsidization activity. Many tax expenditures make sense, and they \naccomplish important policy goals. But it is important that all such \nexpenditures receive regular review, and they ought to be measured \nagainst each other, perhaps a more important policy goal.\n  So to conclude, Mr. President, the Senator from Washington says it is \na confession of failure to attack the balanced budget amendment. This \nis a continued attempt to try to level with the American people just as \nthe right-to-know amendment was. They talk about middle-class tax cuts. \nThis is a huge pot of money that we need to balance the budget. It \nshould be on the table. And the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota \nwould put the Senate on record that we are not going to hold this \nimmune while everyone else has to suffer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I \nwant to respond to some of his comments. But I would like to ask how \nmuch time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my friend from Utah that I would assume that \nhe and others might want to respond to our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from you Utah has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. First, I would like to extend my thanks to the \ndistinguished colleague from Utah for bringing the balanced budget \namendment to the floor for a full debate and vote because I believe, \nmore than any other legislation, passage of the balanced budget \namendment means keeping the promises that we made to the American \npeople last November.\n  I also want to congratulate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nfor his efforts to bring this legislation to the floor.\n  I also want to thank the American voters for sending a clear message \nthat they expect and that they also deserve fiscal responsibility from \nCongress, and that they expect it now.\n  It is my understanding, however, that, like me, the distinguished \nSenator from Utah also supports the three-fifths vote, or the \nsupermajority, amending the Constitution to make it a little more \nresponsible in rating taxes. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. There are a lot of us who would like to do that. On the \nother hand, a constitutional majority would provide for it here, a \nsupermajority tax limiting device as well. But there are a lot of those \nwho would like to have the three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. GRAMS. When we are talking about the balanced budget amendment, I \nthink the goal that we have is to make sure that the Government lives \nwithin its own means, or not being able to spend more dollars than it \ncan take in. So I would like to believe that the balanced budget \namendment is an attempt to reduce really the growth or irresponsible \nspending of the Federal Government rather than as a device or an excuse \nsometime in the future to raise taxes to cover these debts.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator makes a very good point.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I also believe it should be more difficult for Congress to \nbe able to raise taxes or take tax dollars from hard-working Americans \nand to \n[[Page S2691]] make it harder for them to spend their hard-earned tax \ndollars. I also believe that the Federal Government has a budget \ndeficit because spending is too high, not that taxes are too low. Does \nthe Senator from Utah agree with me on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. Boy, do I ever. I certainly do. I think that is one of the \nreasons for this balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Is the Senator from Utah aware that in the country there \nare nine States that have a supermajority vote in order for their \nlegislators to raise taxes? In those States, a portion of personal \nincome has decreased on average by about 2-percent. So it does have the \neffect of not being able to raise--or reduce--the amount of taxes. \nAcross the country, if you applied that 2 percent formula, you would \nsave about $30 billion a year in taxes for hard-working Americans. That \nsounds like a good scenario.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it does. I am a firm believer that the right tax \nrate reduction, especially marginal tax rate reductions, actually leads \nto more revenues as it increases more savings, investment, creation of \njobs, and people working and people paying into the system.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Because of the sentiments expressed by the Senator from \nUtah and by thousands of Minnesotans that I have met over the last 2 \nyears, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 22, a balanced budget \namendment which requires a three-fifths supermajority vote to increase \ntaxes. Because I believe that Congress must pass the balanced budget \namendment this month and because I do not want the taxpayer protection \nclause to be used as a cynical device to derail passage of the balanced \nbudget amendment, I have decided not to offer this legislation as a \nsubstitute to the legislation currently pending on the floor. But as \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives has scheduled a vote for a \ntaxpayer protection amendment to the Constitution on April 15 of next \nyear, I believe that the Senate should take a similar step in \nscheduling a similar vote for next year.\n  Would the Senator from Utah agree with that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would have no problem with that, if that is what the \nmajority leader decides to do.\n  Mr. GRAMS. For that reason, I will be introducing a constitutional \namendment requiring a three-fifths supermajority vote to increase taxes \nas separate legislation shortly in the Senate. I hope that the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah will support this measure and also help \nus get it to the floor for a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I commend the Senator for being willing to stand up on the \nthree-fifths vote and be against further tax increases on an already \nburdened populace.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee if he would \nbe willing to hold hearings of this legislation yet later this year.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be willing to do so. I think they are worthy of \nhearings because so many people in the House, and the Senator from \nMinnesota, feels so strongly about it. I would be willing to hold a \nhearing at least.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator for his assurance that we will have a \nhearing and also a markup on my legislation to protect taxpayers from \nhigher taxes. I thank him for his efforts on behalf of all taxpayers, \nour children and grandchildren, to bring the balanced budget amendment \nto the floor of the Senate for a vote. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis measure without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota and I \nappreciate his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may say a few words about the suggestion of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Wisconsin. \nThe Senators from Minnesota and Wisconsin, I believe, continue to \nconfuse the distinction between a debate of constitutional language and \nprinciple and a debate of implementing legislation. We are here to \naffirm the principle of Government that we should not spend excessively \nand should not leave excessive debt for our children. But this motion \ndoes not deal with the timeless principles of Government of broad \napplication. It deals with a subsection of our tax policy.\n  I, once again, invite my dear colleagues to bring this and similar \nideas back during the budget debate, or the debate over the \nimplementing legislation, which we are going to have to go through \nfollowing passage of the balanced budget amendment. That would be the \nappropriate time to do that. Self-declared opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment continue their attempt to shift this debate from the \nappropriate focus on constitutional principles to an inappropriate \nfocus on the details of tax policy or some other minutia of \nimplementation.\n  My attitude is, let us do first things first. I think we have to \ntable this motion and pass the balanced budget amendment, and then let \nus face these problems that they are sincerely raising on the \nimplementing legislation and do what has to be done. If we can, that \nwill be the way to do it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say I \nappreciate the colloquy. What we are trying to focus on at the moment \nis how we are going to cut $1.481 trillion, between now and the year \n2002. That is the credibility gap.\n  I came on the floor earlier, several weeks ago, with an amendment \nthat came right from the State of Minnesota, where the State senate \nunanimously--the house of delegates was three votes short of \nunanimous--and the Republican Governor all signed a resolution saying: \nBefore you send the balanced budget amendment to Minnesota, Wisconsin, \nor any State, please specify where the cuts are going to take place, \nand how it will affect our States. Let us do the planning. What kinds \nof people are going to be affected by this? Step up to the plate and \ntell us what you are going to do.\n  I still do not hear any of my colleagues on the other side or, for \nthat matter, on this side, that are for this balanced budget amendment \nspecifying how in fact we are going to reach this goal.\n  But, Mr. President, this amendment today is identical to the majority \nleader's motion to refer. It does not have any real connection to the \nbalanced budget amendment in terms of any conditionality at all. We are \nsimply saying, given the focus on balancing the budget and on deficit \nreduction, do not take all of these tax expenditures--$420 billion \nworth--off the table. The motion is very general. It does not target \nspecific tax breaks because we do not think that would be appropriate \non a constitutional amendment. The Senator from Wisconsin made that \nclear and I have made it clear. We simply want to express the sense of \nthe Senate that tax expenditures will undergo the same scrutiny that \nall other spending goes through. We do not eliminate any expenditures. \nWe do not specify what should be eliminated. We leave that to another \nday, when we get to the specifics of the budget and the budget \nreconciliation process.\n  This is a statement of principle today, that as we continue this \nbudget debate in the Congress and in future Congresses, we intend to \nsubject these $420 billion worth of tax expenditures--all too many of \nthem tax dodges--to much closer scrutiny than in the past.\n  My colleague from Utah wants to separate out this notion, this \nprinciple, from a debate on balancing the budget. You cannot. This is a \nbasic standard of fairness. I think in many ways this amendment really \nis a litmus test, because what people in Minnesota and around the \ncountry are saying is we want to know where the cuts are going to take \nplace.\n  People are for the balanced budget amendment in the abstract, but \nwhen you get into specifics and people hear about draconian cuts, cuts \nin Medicare, Medicaid, higher education, people say, ``Wait a minute.'' \nEven if we all understand that we need to continue to invest in people \nand communities, but we also need to continue down the path of deficit \nreduction, what we are saying is that the Senate go on record saying we \nshould evaluate these tax expenditures, \n[[Page S2692]] all of these different expenditures, some of which may \nbe necessary but many of which, some say in the General Accounting \nOffice, are outdated, inefficient, unnecessary--and I add, about the \nhuge dodges.\n  Why should regular Minnesotans be asked to pay more in taxes, be \nasked to sacrifice? I have not heard anybody on the other side--my \ncolleague from Minnesota came out, but there was no response to this \namendment. Nor have I really heard a response from my colleague from \nUtah. Should the Senate go on record that as we evaluate how we are \ngoing to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, that we are going \nto call upon all Americans to be part of the sacrifice? Large \ncorporations, large financial institutions, the wealthiest of the \nwealthy people in our country, are we not going to ask them to be part \nof the sacrifice?\n  I will tell you something, Mr. President. I think the Senate ought to \ngo on record that each and every citizen and each and every interest, \nall interests, ought to be asked to be a part of the sacrifice. \nEverybody should be asked to sacrifice. There should be some standard \nof fairness. That is one of the reasons I have so much trouble with the \nlast 2 weeks of this debate. We are asked to vote for a balanced budget \namendment without specifying what you are going to do.\n  If I thought there was some standard of fairness, if I was not so \nsure that there are just going to be cuts that are going to affect the \nmost vulnerable citizens, if I was not sure about what this is going to \ndo to higher education and health care, if I really thought we were \ngoing to go after $420 billion worth of tax expenditures and put that \non the table, and that we were also going to scrutinize the Pentagon \nbudget and we were going to cut where we should cut, that is exactly \nthe path I want to go down. That is what this amendment says. Subject \nthese expenditures to the same scrutiny that we are putting a whole lot \nof other programs and expenditures under.\n  How much time do I have, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he \nnoticed in his State the same thing I have in my State in recent weeks: \nThat there is a heightened level of anxiety around our States about \nwhat is going to happen when we balance this budget.\n  I am hearing people who are concerned about the elderly nutrition \nprogram, people that are concerned about what is going to happen with \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting. So far, there does not seem to \nbe much talk about the so-called tax loopholes as a way to solve the \nproblem. That is one of the reasons I want to bring this up. I am \nwondering whether the Senator is experiencing this sort of discrepancy \nbetween direct spending programs versus not talking about the tax \nloopholes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, just this \npast Saturday, I was in southwest Minnesota in a meeting with a group \nof citizens that are really worried that Pioneer Public Television--\nwhich, in the rural area, is so important; it is a pool of information; \neconomic development, citizenship--is going to be eliminated. They are \nvery worried about that for very good reasons. Certainly when I meet \nwith the elderly or I meet with children or advocates for children, \npeople who work in schools and universities, everybody was very worried \nabout this.\n  What people say to me in cafes is, ``Look, we understand that we have \nto continue down the path of deficit reduction; we have to be fiscally \nresponsible. We also know that there are crying needs in our community. \nWe want to make sure children have opportunity, that we have to invest \nin education in our communities. We know it is not done by waving a \nmagic wand, but there has to be some standard of fairness.''\n  That is what I think we are talking about here today. Absolutely.\n  I would say to my colleague, I would be interested in his response. \nLet me just put a question to him.\n  I really fell like if we are not willing to go on record today on \nthis motion to refer, which just puts the Senate on record as saying we \nshould just look at tax expenditures and consider whether they should \nbe part of what should be cut. We see cynicism in people in Wisconsin \nand Minnesota who will say, ``Yeah, of course they will vote against \nthis. Unlike those folks, we don't have the big bucks. We do not lobby \neverybody. Who do they represent? They don't represent us.''\n  I think we have to consider these tax expenditures to have \ncredibility.\n  I will ask the Senator from Wisconsin what his view is about it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is exactly my concern. We are out here talking \nabout the big picture, in terms of we have to balance the budget, we \nare talking about direct spending programs, but we have an obligation \nto talk about everything that is spent out here.\n  I find in Wisconsin, and I am sure you do in Minnesota, that people \ndo not know about some of these oil and gas deals. They do not know, \nnecessarily, that foreign nationals get the special deals on tax \nbreaks. We talk about it. We do a heck of a job in telling people about \nwhere this item of pork--you know, the Lawrence Welk issue, the \nsteamboat issue--and we should, and we made some progress on this.\n  But back home people are being prevented from finding out--because we \nwill not talk about it--that there is worse stuff a lot of times stuck \nin the Ways and Means Committee and in the Finance Committee that never \ncomes up to public scrutiny.\n  That is why it is particularly unfair, when these other programs are \nthreatened that really help people and they may have to take some cuts, \nthat they are on the chopping block and the American people are not \neven told the truth. No one is telling the people about the tax \nloopholes; in effect, a conspiracy not to talk about it.\n  I think that is a very serious injustice to the people that you have \ndescribed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I interrupt my colleague to ask \nhim a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is not also true that there is a very direct \ncorrelation--and, unfortunately, it is a hidden correlation, unless we \nare willing to be accountable and open and honest about this--between \nour failure to even look at--which is all we are asking for today--\nthese tax expenditures and the kinds of cuts that are going to take \nplace in some of these programs that are so important to people? And, \nin addition, is it not also true that regular taxpayers end up paying \nmore?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Exactly.\n  If I may respond to the Senator from Minnesota, let us just think \nabout, if you happen to be a supporter of the balanced budget \namendment, your goal out of all of this is, of course, is that the \nStates would ratify the balanced budget amendment. What do the \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment think is going to happen \nback in our home States when the people that are concerned about these \nprograms find out the following: when they find out that defense \nspending is going up; when they find out that we are going to give out \na big tax break across the board to everybody in the country; when they \nfind out we would not even talk about tax loopholes?\n  It is not going to take too long before some of those State \nlegislatures figure out, ``Wait a minute. What is this coming out of?''\n  It is coming out of the local programs and the tax dollars, the \nproperty taxes, of hard-working people of places like Minnesota and \nWisconsin.\n  So I would think you would be concerned that not laying it out for \nthe American people and putting tax expenditures off the table--as \nthis, in effect, does if we do not put it in the sense of the Senate--I \nwould think you would be concerned and I think the Senator from \nMinnesota is right on target.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to my colleague, if I was a proponent of \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which I am not, I \nwould vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Because once people understand that some of the \nprograms that have been most important \n[[Page S2693]] to them and their communities, be it Medicare, be it \nMedicaid, be it Pell grants, be it nutrition programs for children, be \nit veterans' programs, you name it--are going to be cut and cut \ndeeply--but the Pentagon budget is going up; and, you have all of these \nloopholes which are flowing disproportionately to large corporations \nand financial institutions in America with all the clout, without their \nbeing asked to sacrifice at all, there is going to be a huge amount of \nanger.\n  And I would say to my colleague, that is why I think the Senate must \ngo on record today on this.\n  I would say to my colleague from Wisconsin we have a little under a \nminute left. I would be pleased if he would just conclude for us. It \nhas been a joy working with him and I hope we get a good strong vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. We will visit this \nsubject again many times, both of us, and I know we will have support \nfrom others.\n  But what it really comes down to, this is not an attempt to delay on \nthe balanced budget amendment. What we are doing here is to try to \npoint out there are certain special interests that are being protected \nby tax expenditures and that those tax expenditures should be on the \ntable. And, in large part, this is true because these tax expenditures \nhave been a big part of the reason why this mess was created in the \nfirst place; one of the big reasons we have this deficit.\n  So why in the world should not that be on the table with all the \nother things?\n  That is our message and that is why we would urge the adoption of \nthis motion to refer.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time, if the \ndistinguished Senators are prepared to yield back their time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Utah. I am prepared to yield \nback my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the motion and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Utah to table the motion of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone]. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 70 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kassebaum\n       \n  So the motion was rejected.\n                       MOTION INTENDED TO BE MADE\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \na motion to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee, \nwhich I intend to make, be printed in the Record for the information of \nSenators.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Proposed motion to be made by Mr. Bumpers:\n       I move to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 and issue a report, at the earliest \n     possible date, which shall include the following:\n       ``Section 1. Prohibition on Budget Resolutions That Fail To \n     Set Forth a Balanced Budget.--Section 301 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting at \n     the end thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) Congressional Enforcement of a Balanced Budget.--\n     Beginning in 2001, it shall not be in order to consider any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget (or amendment, motion, or \n     conference report thereon) that sets forth a level of outlays \n     for fiscal year 2002 or any subsequent fiscal year that \n     exceeds the level of revenues for that fiscal year.''\n       ``Sec. 2.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding.\n  He is about to lay down an amendment that is a very important \namendment to this issue that I think both sides are very concerned \nabout and want ample time to debate. I would like to see if we could \nnot arrive at a unanimous consent agreement here. Is it acceptable to \nthe Senator from Louisiana if we look at 4 hours equally divided?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, that is acceptable.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I hope that if we can get a unanimous consent on that, we \nwould both try to yield back as much as possible of the unused time and \nso encourage our colleagues.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Certainly. Mr. President, there is no intent at all to \ndelay. All amendments are important. But this is one that I hope will \npass and that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will accede \nto. But in any event, we will yield back to the extent we do not use \nthe time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I then ask unanimous consent for 4 hours \nequally divided on the Johnston amendment, prior to a motion to table, \nand that no amendments to the Johnston amendment be in order.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I certainly do not plan any second-\ndegree amendments. I do not see any of my colleagues who do. So that \nwould be suitable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the \namendment by Mr. Johnston, I be recognized to call up an amendment. If \nthis request is not agreed to, I will be here and seek recognition in \nmy own right. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold that for just \na \n[[Page S2694]] minute and let me talk to him about that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was my request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator have a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. That upon the disposition of the amendment that is being \noffered by Mr. Johnston, I be recognized to call up an amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. And I will not object, would the Senator from West \nVirginia mind discussing with us at this time the amendment he plans to \noffer following this amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I stated to the Senator in private what it was.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator mind for the Record saying so?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will say so when I get ready.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I see. Let me say for the Record, because I do not want to \nobject to proceedings here, the three-fourths amendment in section 1, \nit is my understanding the Senator from West Virginia plans to offer an \namendment to it?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is, but I have not reached the point yet that I feel I \nam under obligation to announce what my amendment does before I call it \nup.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this is not an issue here. The Senator \nknows the rules of the Senate as do I, and certainly he is not under \nthat obligation. I was only asking for a courtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I told the Senator in private out of courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n(Purpose: To provide that no court shall have the power to order relief \n pursuant to any case or controversy arising under the balanced budget \n     constitutional amendment, except as provided in implementing \n                              legislation)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], for himself, Mr. \n     Bumpers, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Pryor, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 272.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Section 6, add the following: ``No court \n     shall have the power to order relief pursuant to any case or \n     controversy arising under this article, except as may be \n     specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \n     to this section.''\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is \nessentially the 1994 Danforth amendment which was adopted by this body \nwithout dissent.\n  What it says is that no court shall have the power to order relief \npursuant to any case or controversy arising under this article except \nas may be specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \nto this section--no court jurisdiction unless specifically authorized \nby the Congress. That is virtually identical to the amendment which was \nadopted last year.\n  Why do we propose this? On January 31, we had an extended debate here \non the question of whether or not this amendment is enforceable, and if \nso, how it is enforceable. I opined that the way it would be likely \nenforced would be to have the Supreme Court order an income tax \nsurcharge, because the Court is particularly ill qualified to make \nchoices between various spending programs, to choose between the B-2 \nbomber and the F/A-18, or to choose between Social Security and \nMedicare, or to determine what the effects of these budget cuts would \nbe. The thing they would be able to do is to order an income tax \nsurcharge. It would not change any of the rules. It would simply say \nyou add on to the present income tax, using those rules, a surcharge, \nwhich they would order the Treasury to collect.\n  In response to that argument, I had an extended colloquy with my \nfriend from Utah, Mr. Hatch. Mr. Hatch stated that he did not see any \nway the courts would find standing or justiciability, that only the \nCongress had power to enforce this amendment. Mr. Hatch made very clear \nthat it is the intent of the majority party that this amendment not be \nenforceable by the courts.\n  I then asked, ``If that is the intent, why did you not spell it out \nas we did in the Danforth amendment the previous year?''\n  To that, Mr. Hatch replied, in effect, that, ``Frankly, there are \nthose on the other side who I think will argue the courts ought to have \nsome control. We just want to avoid that particular argument.''\n  So in effect what we have is an intentional ambiguity fashioned in \norder to appeal to both sides of this argument. There are some who \nthink the courts ought to be involved. There are some who think the \ncourts should not be involved. Mr. Hatch thinks the courts are not \ninvolved. So, therefore, it is left intentionally ambiguous.\n  Mr. President, I would first like to submit to my colleagues that \nthis is not at all clear. As a matter of fact, I believe the majority \nlegal opinion would be that jurisdiction does lie. Quoting from a \nHarvard Law Review article of May 1983, they state:\n\n       Doctrinal analysis demonstrates, however, that taxpayers \n     probably would have standing to challenge alleged violation \n     of either the deficit spending prohibition or the tax \n     limitation provision.\n\n  Harvard Law Review says when you analyze all the cases, they probably \nwould have standing.\n  Assistant Attorney General Dellinger testified before the committee. \nAssistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger stated as follows:\n\n       Moreover, it is possible that courts would hold that either \n     taxpayers or other litigants would have standing to \n     adjudicate various aspects of the budget process under the \n     balanced budget amendment. Even if taxpayers and Members of \n     Congress were not granted standing, a criminal defendant \n     prosecuted or sentenced under an omnibus crime bill that \n     improved tax enforcement or authorized fines or forfeitures \n     could argue that the bill ``increased revenues'' within the \n     meaning of section 4.\n\n  Or take the distinguished professor, Harvard law professor Laurence \nTribe. Mr. Tribe says:\n\n       So that one way or another, Members of Congress, a House of \n     Congress, someone who has been cut off from a program, a \n     taxpayer--these people will be able to go to court. No \n     question about it.\n\n  I have a whole folder of cases and experts who say that taxpayers \ncould go to court, that there would be jurisdiction in the courts, that \nit would be enforceable. Others say it is a question to be determined \nby the courts.\n  Suffice it to say, in my judgment, no one can seriously rise to his \nfeet on the floor of this Senate and say that this is a clear question; \nthat what Mr. Hatch says is correct, that is, that there is clearly no \nstanding or jurisdiction to enforce this amendment. It simply is not \nso. As I have just quoted from Professor Tribe, from Professor \nDellinger--Professor Fried says the same thing--Harvard Law Review--on \nand on. It is not clear what the limits of court jurisdiction would be.\n  I ask my colleagues this question, which is a fundamental question. \nIs there advantage in ambiguity? Is there some reason that we in this \nU.S. Senate, understanding the ambiguity of court jurisdiction, would \nwant to leave it ambiguous? I think the answer is--which Mr. Hatch \ngave--that some of our people think they ought to have jurisdiction and \nsome think they should not have jurisdiction so, therefore, we leave it \nambiguous and hope to get the votes of both sides.\n  I submit that as a political matter on the floor of this Senate that \nis likely to do you more harm than good. There are some on this side of \nthe Senate who, just as recently as 10 minutes ago, said the outcome of \nthe Johnston amendment will influence their vote on this matter. There \nmay be some on the other side of the aisle who feel differently.\n  [[Page S2695]] I suggest if it is a political calculation that my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who are supporting this \namendment check with their Members and see how many you lose by making \nclear the most fundamental question in this amendment. Are there really \npeople in this Senate who would vote against the amendment because you \ncleared up an ambiguity? I do not believe so. But there may be some on \nthis side of the aisle who recognize the pernicious, difficult effect \nof this amendment--no less authority than former Solicitor General, \nJudge Robert Bork, said the following, in a 1983 article:\n\n       The result would likely be hundreds, if not thousands, of \n     lawsuits around the country, many of them on inconsistent \n     theories and providing inconsistent results. By the time the \n     Supreme Court straightened the whole matter out, the budget \n     question would at least be 4 years out of date and lawsuits \n     involving the next 3 fiscal years would be slowly climbing \n     toward the Supreme Court.\n\n  Judge Bork is giving nothing but common sense. Everything the Federal \nGovernment would do would be subject to litigation. And, as Judge Bork \nsays, thousands of lawsuits matriculating their way up to the Supreme \nCourt, inconsistent results, and in the meantime what happens to this \ncountry? There would be bond issues which are subject to doubt. What \nattorney would issue an opinion on a bond issue that was clouded by a \nSupreme Court or by a district court case? There are so many other \nthings that this Congress does with respect to issuing debts, making \ncontracts--all would be unclear because we would not know what the \njurisdiction of the court was.\n  To those who say that the court needs to be involved, I say the \nCongress, under this amendment, has that power. To the extent that \nCongress specifically gives to the court the power to get involved in \nthe balanced budget amendment, we have the ability to do so. And we may \nwish to do so. We may, for example, wish to limit them to declaratory \njudgments. We might wish to limit them to interpreting the words of the \nConstitution, determining what an outlay is, what a receipt is, et \ncetera. We may want to give them injunctive power. We may want to limit \ntheir ability to raise taxes. In fact, on the Republican side of this \naisle, there is a lot of feeling against raising any taxes, whether by \nCongress--there was one amendment proposed which required 60 votes to \nraise taxes, as part of this amendment. But you would give that power \nto an unelected court.\n  So the power to raise taxes is clearly, Mr. President, something that \nought to be cleared up. Or, on the other hand, we may wish to say that \nthe Supreme Court has original jurisdiction for the purpose of \nconsidering the balanced budget amendment. In other words, we may think \nthat the matter is so important and it requires such expeditious \nrelief, considering the uncertainties in the bond market, the \nuncertainties in contractual rights, that we need to expedite that \nconsideration by providing that original jurisdiction in the Supreme \nCourt. The Congress under this amendment would have that power. We \nwould be able to define those limits, provide for that expediency, and \nprovide whatever jurisdiction or limits on that jurisdiction that we \nwish under this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask why not do that? Why not clear up that American \nambiguity? Why not make this constitutional amendment so far as we can \nfree from litigation?\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Idaho, for whom I have great \nrespect and affection, first of all, if he agrees with me that this is \na matter which is at least ambiguous and that the weight of authority \nis probably on the side of saying the court has jurisdiction. Would my \ncolleague agree with that statement?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator, I too have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Louisiana and admire the fact that \nhe is bringing this sort of discussion to this issue. But really I \nwould defer from responding to that because I think the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee would be more appropriate who is grounded in this \nfield and aspect of it to respond to you so you get the meaningful \ndialogue and exchange that really this issue merits.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator agree with me that, if it is a matter \nof ambiguity--and we will let Senator Hatch respond to that--then it \nought to be an ambiguity that could be cleared up?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I think when you have ambiguity, I do not know why we \nwould want to proceed down the road of solidifying ambiguity.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator. In his usual candor, he I think \nreinforces the point.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Utah coming onto the floor. I \nwonder if I could engage with him in a colloquy on this matter.\n  I thank my friend from Utah. My question was this: I had just quoted \nfrom the Harvard Law Review a number of professors who have stated that \nin their view there would be standing, justiciability and the matter \nwould be handled by the court, although there are doubts about the \nlimits about it. Will the Senator from Utah agree with me that it is at \nleast a matter of ambiguity as to what the jurisdiction of the court \nwould be?\n  Mr. HATCH. I really do not agree. I really do not think that you can \nfind standing across the board. I do not think you can find standing. \nThere may be some isolated cases where a person's peculiar interests \nhave been affected. I cannot think of any right offhand. But I am \ncertainly not ruling that out. But I really do not think you can find \nall three of those conditions to exist with regard to the balanced \nbudget amendment. I will be happy to address that in greater detail \nwhen it comes my time to say a few words about it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did the Senator have an opportunity to hear me quote \nAssistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger who said that it is \npossible that the courts would hold that either taxpayers or other \nlitigants would have standing to adjudicate various aspects of the \nbudget process?\n  Mr. HATCH. I was there when he said that and he backpedaled off that \nin the middle of the hearings and had to admit that there is not much \nbasis for that statement. I might add that was in the face of a former \nAttorney General and a whole raft of other witnesses who said that just \nis not true.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What Attorney General?\n  Mr. HATCH. Attorney General Barr was there.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You understand Attorney General Barr, to quote Attorney \nGeneral Barr:\n\n       I do believe Congress should consider including language in \n     the amendment that would expressly limit judicial review to \n     actions for declaratory judgments. If, however, such a \n     provision would prove to be politically unpopular, I believe \n     for the reasons detailed in my written statement that \n     Congress can safely pass the amendment in its current form \n     without undue concern that the courts will entertain large \n     numbers of suits challenging Congress' actions under the \n     amendment or that, even if the courts do entertain some \n     suits, they will order intrusive injunctive remedies.\n\n  General Barr says we ought to clear up the ambiguity because \naccording to him, he says they--I mean the obverse. He says they will \nnot entertain large numbers of suits. I do not know what large numbers \nare to him, and I do not know what intrusive injunctive remedies are.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I was there. He did say that as \na political matter, if it helps you to pass a bill and dispose of \namendments, that you might want to put a provision in with regard to \ndeclaratory judgments. We did that when we lost the last amendment. He \nsaid it is just a matter of political judgment. His opinion was that \nyou are not going to----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I just quoted his opinion.\n  Mr. HATCH. No. No. That is what he said, not in his written \nstatement. He was making a point in front of the committee that, if \npolitically that helps you to pass the balanced budget amendment, you \ncould live with that type of a provision. But his main points were that \nhe did not see any reason to involve courts in the amendment either \nway.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am quoting Attorney General Barr in a written answer \nto a posthearing statement in which he says ``I do believe''--do \nbelieve--``Congress should consider including language in the amendment \nthat would \n[[Page S2696]] expressly limit judicial review to actions for \ndeclaratory judgment.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. That is what we did in last year's debate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In the Danforth amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. But that has nothing to do withstanding, nothing to do \nwith justiciability. The fact of the matter is----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of course it does.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me make my point. Declaratory relief in the eyes of \nmany--and I think most authorities--can be as intrusive as injunctive \nrelief. Take Justice Frankfurter in Coalgrave v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, \npage 552, a 1946 case, and he opined that declaratory relief should not \nbe granted in situations where injunctions are inappropriate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just finish, maybe I can help clarify. Let me \nfinish. I only have two more comments to make.\n  Thus declaratory relief would be limited by the standing political \nquestions of separation of powers doctrines.\n  Finally, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nwould be construed, if it passes, to grant the courts broad declaratory \nrelief despite the standing in the political question of doctrine,\n and I might add the separation of powers doctrine. We think that is a \n  mistake.Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may correct the Senator at that point, my \namendment precludes any judicial order of relief, except to the extent \nexpressly authorized by the Congress and, unlike the Danforth \namendment, does not include declaratory relief.\n  What I was saying about Judge Barr was that Judge Barr says you ought \nto limit this at least to declaratory relief, but he goes on to point \nout that it is probable that you would have some suits entertained. The \ndistinguished Harvard law professor, Laurence Tribe, says:\n\n       So that one way or another, Members of Congress, a House of \n     Congress, someone who has been cut off from a program, a \n     taxpayer, these people will be able to go to court; no \n     question about it.\n\n  We could go on here quoting from cases, quoting from other experts. I \nhave not come across any expert who says it is clear that there is no \njurisdiction, not one. I would welcome that statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact that we leave it open says there may be \njurisdictions. It does not mean the courts will grant it. I do not \nthink they will. Let me read----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Wait. We are on my time now. Let me make my point \nfirst, and the Senator may respond. There is not one expert--not one--\nthat I have come across who says the matter of justiciability, the \nmatter of standing, or the matter of being a political question, which \nare the three bases on which my friend from Utah relied in our January \n31 debate, not one expert says that that is a clear question. On the \nother hand, Professor Tribe says it is clear they would have standing. \nMr. Dellinger says he believes they would have standing. Judge Barr \nsays you ought to limit that because there may be some lawsuits and \nthey may order some judicial relief, and no one that I can find \ndisagrees with that.\n  What I am saying is that it is at best an ambiguity--at best--and a \nprobability of court jurisdiction, a probability of court intrusiveness \nhere. How can my friend from Utah say it is not a matter of ambiguity \nin the face of the Harvard Law Review and distinguished professors, \nincluding his own, who say otherwise?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because there is little or no chance that is going to \nhappen. Let me, if I can, just go back to the written remarks----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Can the Senator give me one single expert who agrees \nwith him?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to give it to you right now. Let me just go \nback--if you want to enshrine the word ambiguity, I am not going to do \nthat for you. I can say that I cannot rule out that there might be some \noddball case where somebody might have standing. I cannot rule that \nout. But I do believe we can rule it out on the basis of just \nreasonability that some oddball is not going to have an oddball case \nthat affects everybody in the country because they are not going to be \nable to meet those three requirements.\n  Here is what General Barr said in his written comments: ``In my view, \nthough it is always difficult to predict the course of future \nconstitutional law development''--from that standpoint, I have to grant \nthe point that who knows whether some crackpots who occasionally do get \nto the courts, if we believe that is what is going to happen to the \nSupreme Court, who knows, you cannot say that anything is absolute in \nthis world. Here is what he said:\n\n       In my view, though it is always difficult to predict the \n     course of future constitutional law development, the courts' \n     role in enforcing the balanced budget amendment will be quite \n     limiting.\n\n  I see little risk that the amendment will become the basis for \njudicial micromangement or superintendence of the Federal budget \nprocess.\n  Furthermore, to the extent such judicial intrusion does arise, the \namendment itself equips Congress to correct the problem by statute. On \nbalance, moreover, whatever remote risks there may be that courts will \nplay an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, that risk is, \nin my opinion, vastly outweighed by the benefits of such an amendment.\n  Then he says:\n\n       I believe there are three basic constraints that will tend \n     to prevent the courts from becoming unduly involved in the \n     budgetary process. One, the limitation on the power of the \n     Federal courts contained in article III of the Constitution, \n     primarily the requirement of standing; two, the deference the \n     courts will owe to Congress, both under existing \n     constitutional doctrines and particularly under section 6 of \n     the amendment itself, which expressly confers enforcement \n     responsibility on Congress; and three, the limits on judicial \n     remedies running against coordinate branches of Government, \n     both that the courts have imposed upon themselves and that in \n     appropriate circumstances Congress may impose on the courts.\n\n  When the Senator cites Laurence Tribe of Harvard to me and Walter \nDellinger of Duke, they are both ardent advocates against the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let us quote from Mr. Barr, who says in that same \nstatement on page 8:\n\n       But I would be the last to say that the standing doctrine \n     is an ironclad shield against judicial activism. The doctrine \n     is malleable and it has been manipulated by the courts in the \n     past.\n\n  The one expert that my friend from Utah quotes to say that this \nmatter is clear himself says it is unclear, and he says you cannot \npredict what the court will do, and himself urges that you limit the \njurisdiction of the court. That is what he says.\n  I ask my friend, why do we not clear it up?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because we do not have to. Even though he says that there \nis no absolute in the law, because you can always find, or you may find \nin the future, some judicial activist who will ignore what the law \nsays, we do have all kinds of checks and balances in this country, not \njust the courts, but in the other branches of Government as well. Even \nin the courts we have checks and balances. That is why we have nine \nJustices on the Supreme Court. What he is saying is there is little or \nno likelihood that anybody is going to be able to go to court and meet \nthose three requisites under current law or under the law as he \nenvisions it to be.\n  If you ask him, well, assuming that there are no absolutes, and you \nwant to be absolutely sure that the courts can never intrude, what \nwould you do? Naturally, he would say I think you can have declaratory \njudgment relief if you want to write that into the amendment. We do not \nwant to do that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What harm does it do, to clear up this matter, to say \nthat there is no jurisdiction, no power for the courts to grant \njudicial relief except to the extent we authorize it in the Congress; \nwhat harm does it do?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the harm is that if the Senator writes the courts \nout of the Constitution, or out of this balanced budget amendment, he \nwill be writing people out that we cannot foresee at this time--I do \nnot know--who may have some legitimate, particularized injury to \nthemselves that will enable them to have standing and a right to sue. \nThat is a far cry from giving a broad, generalized right to the public \nat large.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator understand what he just said? He has \njust been saying that this matter is clear that there is no \njurisdiction, but \n[[Page S2697]] we better not say there is no jurisdiction because there \nare some people we cannot foresee who may have jurisdiction and may \nwant to sue, and the courts ought to be enforcing their rights.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is a difference between a general right to sue for \nall citizens and a particularized injury to one individual which I \ncannot foresee right now. I do not believe there are any instances I \ncan come up with, but there may be.\n  Let me give you an illustration. Suppose Congress--this is not to say \nthis is going to happen--but suppose Congress passes legislation \ncutting spending programs only to Jewish people. That will not happen, \nbut let us give that as a bizarre illustration.\n   In this case, should they not have a right to sue?Mr. JOHNSTON. \nWell, now, tell me, would the court's power to order relief be limited \nor could the court say you have not balanced the budget and therefore \nwe order an income tax surcharge?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think the court can do that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Where does my friend find such limitations on the \ncourt's power? If somebody has standing to sue, then they have standing \nto ask for whatever relief is appropriate.\n  Mr. HATCH. We deal with judicial restraints, judicial powers, every \nday in our lives. And one of the reasons why the law develops year \nafter year after year is because of ingenious people who find ways to \ndevelop it.\n  All I am saying is this: We do not want to take away anybody's rights \nthat may develop sometime in the future. We do not want a generalized \nright to sue and we do not believe anybody can make a good case that \nthey will have that right.\n  I do not think Professor Tribe did it or Walter Dellinger did it in \nfront of the committee.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do you know what Robert Bork said?\n  Mr. HATCH. And on the courts raising taxes, it is a question of \nredressability. You know, it is a separation of powers of doctrine.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Judge Bork says:\n\n       The result would be hundreds, it not thousands, of lawsuits \n     around the country, many of them on inconsistent theories and \n     providing inconsistent results.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. And Judge Bork has very good reason to feel that way with \nthe way he was treated. His legal contentions are based on \noverexaggerated fears of judicial activists. Actually, the post-Warren \nSupreme Court has tightened the standing and justiciability doctrines \nto such a degree that balanced budget enforcement suits would probably \nbe dismissed on those grounds alone.\n  And I cite the Lujan versus the Defenders of Wildlife case in 1992.\n  In fact, Bork admits----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may interrupt--and I do not like to interrupt.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may just finish.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Are we proceeding on my time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to make this response on my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. In fact, to make my case a little more clear, Bork admits, \non page 2 of the letter he wrote, that standing would probably be \ndenied. That is what most real constitutional experts would say. The \nsubstance of the legal argument is to speculate on the consequences of \nwhat if courts assumed jurisdiction. Well, what if courts decided to \nraise taxes? What if they decide to send armies to war? What if \njudicial activists decide to do anything that is outside of their \njurisdiction and their range? I suspect we could conjure up any kind of \na scare tactic, any kind of bizarre situation.\n  What we have to rely on is what is the law. And it is very tough \nunder current law and under the laws that existed for a long time, to \ncome up with standing, with the requisites to meet the standing, \njusticiability, and the political question doctrine and some separation \nof powers doctrine in order to do what the distinguished Senator is \nsuggesting Tribe and Dellinger say can be done.\n  Mr. Dellinger back-pedaled quite a bit at that hearing. We did not \nhave a lot of time to question him, and if we had, I think he would \nhave back-pedaled a lot more. Neither Tribe nor Dellinger are \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment.\n  And I have found, as the excellent lawyers they are, and they are \nreally excellent lawyers, that they can come up, as law professors--and \nboth of these are law professors, although Dellinger, Professor \nDellinger, and I do not mean to denigrate him; Professor Dellinger is \nnow down at the Justice Department--both of them can come up with \nalternatives on everything.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. Barr is a supporter.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, Mr. Barr is not a supporter. I listened to the \ntestimony, and in speculating about it and hypothesizing about it, he \nsays, ``Well, if you want to do this, you can do it.'' But Barr \nbasically says you should not have to do it; the law is such that you \nshould not have to do it.\n  And Bork is just saying it because he fears judicial activists. Bork \nis saying that, you know, well, his comments are based on what I \nconsider to be, and I think many others, exaggerated fears of judicial \nactivists.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You do understand that Mr. Barr said:\n\n       I do believe Congress should consider including language in \n     the amendment that would expressly limit judicial review.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I was there. I believe I was there when he said it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, this was in the posthearing answer to written \nquestions. That is the last word from Mr. Barr.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did he ever back up on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think if Mr. Barr, if General Barr, was asked what his \nopinion is, he would say, ``Don't clutter up the Constitution.'' \nBecause every time you add a provision like this into to, every time \nyou add that kind of provision or any kind of provision, you have a \nwhole myriad of problems that arise from there.\n  Now we have people in both bodies who want the courts involved. We \nhave people who do not want the courts involved. I think there is \nlittle or no likelihood that the courts are going to be involved on \nthis amendment as it is written.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is that not the real answer; that some of your Members \nare for it and some are against it, and you want to please both sides, \nso you leave it ambiguous?\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, I do not think it is really ambiguous. \nNothing is absolute, so I guess you can claim ambiguity on any \nproposition you make.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I just read to you the most distinguished professors in \nthe country, including Mr. Bork, and you have not one single expert, \nnot one, who supports your position. Name me one. I mean, you do not \nlike Judge Bork; you do not like----\n  Mr. HATCH. I love Judge Bork. And I do not disregard Professor Tribe \nand Professor Dellinger.\n  What I am saying is this: The Senator is partially correct. We are \ndealing here with a constitutional amendment of general application. We \nare dealing with one of the most difficult debates in the history of \nthe country. We are dealing with consensus problems. We are dealing \nwith Republicans and Democrats. We are dealing with 38 years of trying \nto get this to the floor--38 years; really, better than 200 years of \ngetting the House to vote on this. Thirty-eight years of trying to get \nit to the floor, nineteen years in my life of trying to do it, having \nbrought it to the floor in 1982, where we passed it in the Senate \nwithout that language, having brought it three other times to the \nfloor, and this is the fourth time, and trying to bring people together \nwho have a mixture of viewpoints.\n  We are doing the best we can. Now, can we satisfy everybody's urge, \nincluding Professor Tribe's or Professor Dellinger's? Can we satisfy \neverybody's demand or desire for their own wording in this amendment? \nCan we satisfy those who do not want the courts involved in this to the \nexclusion of those who do? There are not many who do, but there are \nsome who do.\n  Or do we do what we have to do, and that is, get a consensus on this \nmatter and fight for it as hard as we can and do the best we can? Well, \nthat is what we are doing.\n   [[Page S2698]] Mr. JOHNSTON. If I could ask my colleague at that \npoint, I disagree not just with the legal calculus, but with the \npolitical calculus, as well.\n  The Danforth amendment was virtually identical to this amendment and \nwas passed without opposition. Is there really opposition on your side? \nAre there Senators who on your side would say, I will not support this \namendment unless it has the right of the courts to order relief?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe there are. I believe there are some on your \nside. In fact, I think there are as many, if not more, on your side.\n  So what I am saying is we are trying to do the art of the doable \nhere. Personally, I do not like courts involved--in certain aspects of \nthis, I would not want them involved at all--and I do not believe they \nwill be, or I would be arguing for the Senator's position. I might add \nthat some do like the courts involved in some of these areas, but I do \nnot know many who do.\n  But let me just say that what we are trying to do is bring Senators \ntogether and reach a 67-vote total. We are one or two votes away from \nthat. Some think we are there, but I do not ever count that until the \nfinal vote. We are one or two votes away from being there. And we are \ntrying to keep the amendment intact.\n  And keep in mind, we have 300 people in the House of Representatives \nwho voted for this amendment. If we add anything to it, it has to go \nback to them.\n  These are considerations the distinguished Senator from Illinois and \nI have to meet.\n  Now, as I recall, just to name two experts, Griffin Bell, former \nAttorney General of the United States, upholds this position. Professor \nVan Alstein, from Duke, who was Walter Dellinger's partner down there, \nupholds this position, as far as I know.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Who say this is a matter that has no ambiguity.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who say there is little or no likelihood that people can \ngenerally sue on behalf of all Senators under this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is a huge amount of difference between ``little \nlikelihood'' and ``clear.''\n  See, the difference is that we would have this litigation going \nthrough the courts. As Judge Bork said, thousands of cases with \ninconsistent results. Bond issues, contracts, subject to lack of \nclarity.\n  It is not too much to say that the capital markets of this country \ncould, during the pending litigation, be put into complete chaos.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think those are scare tactics myself. Let me say a few \nthings, and maybe I can clarify to a degree.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is a fine-tuned law. It \nmanages to strike the delicate balance between reviewability by the \ncourts and the limitations on the courts' ability to interfere with \ncongressional authority.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the former Attorney General William B. \nBarr, who stated that if House Joint Resolution 1 is ratified there is,\n\n       * * * little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micromanagement or superintendence of the \n     Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute.\n\n  In other words, we can correct any problem that does arise. ``On \nbalance,'' he goes on to say, ``whatever remote risk there may be the \ncourt will play an overtly intrusive role in forcing the amendment, \nthat risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by the benefits of such \namendment.''\n  In regard to Congress' power to restrain the courts, which I think is \nan important point, I think the Senator from Louisiana does the Senate \na service in raising the issue.\n  In order to resist the ambition of the courts, the framers gave to \nthe Congress in article III of the Constitution the authority to limit \nthe jurisdiction of the courts, the type of remedies the courts may \nremedy, if Congress truly fears certain courts may decide to ignore the \nlaw and the precedence. If Congress finds it necessary, through \nimplementing legislation, it may forbid courts the use of their \ninjunctive powers already. And the Congress has done that from time to \ntime.\n  Or Congress could create an exclusive cause of action or tribunal \nwhich carefully limits power satisfactory for Congress to deal with the \nbalanced budget components or complaints.\n  But Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nproposes, cut off all judicial review. I believe that House Joint \nResolution 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial review. By \nremaining silent about judicial review in the amendment itself, its \nauthors have refused to establish congressional sanction for the \nFederal courts to involve themselves in fundamental, macroeconomic, and \nbudgetary issues in question.\n  At the same time, this balanced budget amendment does not undermine \nthe courts' equally fundamental obligation, as first stated in Marbury \nversus Madison, to say what the law is. After all, while I am confident \nthat courts will not be able to interfere with our budgetary \nprerogatives, I am frank enough to say I cannot predict every \nconceivable lawsuit--nobody can--which might arise under this amendment \nand which does not implicate these budgetary prerogatives.\n  A litigant in such a narrow circumstance, if he or she can \ndemonstrate standing, ought to be heard. They ought to have their case \nheard. It is simply wrong to assume that Congress would just sit by in \nthe unlikely event that a court would commit some overreaching end. \nBelieve me, Congress knows how to defend itself. Congress knows how to \nrestrict the jurisdiction of courts or limit the scope of judicial \nremedies where the courts get completely out of line as they would have \nto be in this situation.\n  I do not think it is necessary. Lower courts by and large, and really \nalmost always, follow precedent. The precepts of separation of powers \nand the political question doctrine effectively limit the ability of \ncourts to interfere in the budgetary process. Nevertheless, if \nnecessary, a shield against judicial interference is section 6 of House \nJoint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment itself. Under this \nsection Congress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any \npurported budgetary shortfall such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear that \nCongress if it finds it necessary, could limit the type of remedies the \ncourt may grant or limit the courts' jurisdiction in some other manner \nto proscribe judicial overreaching. This is not at all a new device nor \nis it at all a new constitutional device. Congress has adopted such \nlimitations in other circumstances pursuant to its article III \nauthority.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit standing, judicial review, \nparticular special tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. \nSuch a tribunal was set up recently as the Reagan administration needed \na special claims tribunal to settle claims on Iranian assets. Beyond \nwhich, in the virtually impossible scenario where these safeguards \nfail, Congress can take whatever action it must to moot any case in \nwhich a risk of judicial overreaching becomes something real.\n  Now, these standing, separation of powers, and political question \nissues are restraints. I might add, there is a distinction between \nremedies court can give and the ability to bring relief. Courts cannot \ninterfere with the budgetary process. It is a political question. It \nwould violate the separation of powers doctrine.\n  These three restraints--these are basic constraints--prevent the \ncourts from interfering in the budgetary process.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish this, I would like it to be \nuninterrupted. Then I would be happy to yield.\n  First, limitations on Federal courts contained in article III of the \nConstitution, primarily the doctrine of standing. That is not one.\n  Second, the deference the courts owe to Congress under both the \npolitical question doctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself, \nwhich confers enforcement authority in Congress--not in the courts, in \nCongress--specifically. I think a court would really have to overreach \nand overreach badly to try to go around that.\n  Third, the limits on judicial remedies which can be imposed on a \ncoordinate \n [[Page S2699]] branch of government; in this case, the legislative \nbranch.\n  These are limitations on remedies self-imposed by courts and that, in \nappropriate circumstances, may be imposed on the courts by Congress. \nThese limitations such as the doctrine of separation of powers \nprohibits courts from raising taxes--that is a power exclusively \ndelegated to Congress by the Constitution--and it is not altered in any \nway, shape or form by the balanced budget amendment that we are \noffering here today.\n  Consequently, contrary to the contention of the opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment, separation-of-power concerns further the \npurpose of the amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance \nthe budget falls squarely on the shoulders of Congress, which is \nconsistent, as I see it, with the Framers of the Constitution that all \nbudgetary matters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n  Concerning the doctrine of standing, it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must further demonstrate the \nstanding to sue. To demonstrate article III standing, a litigant at a \nminimum must meet three requirements: No. 1, injury, in fact, that the \nlitigant suffered some concrete and particularized injury.\n  No. 2, traceability\n   --that the concrete injury, not only is the injury in fact because \nthe litigants suffer some concrete or particularized injury, but \ntraceability means that the concrete injury was both caused by and is \n  traceable to the unlawful conduct.And No. 3, redressability--that the \nrelief sought will redress the alleged injury.\n  That is a large hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate that injury in \nfact requirement. That is something more concrete than a generalized \ngrievance and burden shared by all citizens and taxpayers.\n  I do not know anybody who is an authority on this subject who would \ndisagree with that. They might not like that, but that is what the law \nis. Even in the vastly improbable case where an injury in fact was \nestablished, a litigant would find it nearly impossible to establish \nthe traceability and redressability requirement of the article III \nstanding test. After all, there will be hundreds and hundreds of \nFederal spending programs even after Federal spending is brought under \ncontrol.\n  Furthermore, because the Congress would have numerous options to \nachieve balanced budget compliance, there would be no legitimate basis \nfor a court to nullify or modify a specific spending measure objected \nto by the litigant.\n  Now as to the redressability problem, this requirement would be \ndifficult to meet because courts are wary of becoming involved in the \nbudget process. They always have been, which they admit is legislative \nin nature, and separation of powers concerns will prevent courts from \nspecifying adjustments of any Federal program or expenditures.\n  Thus, for this reason, Missouri versus Jenkins, the 1990 case that is \noften cited, where the Supreme Court upheld a district court's power to \norder a local school district to levy taxes to support a desegregation \nplan is inapposite. Plainly put, the Jenkins case is not applicable to \nthe balanced budget amendment because section 1 of the 14th amendment, \nfrom which the judiciary derives its power to rule against the States \nin equal protection claims, does not apply to the Federal Government \nand because the separation of powers doctrine prevents judicial \nencroachments on Congress' bailiwick. Courts simply will not have the \nauthority to order Congress to raise taxes. It is just that simple. And \nanybody who argues the Jenkins case just does not understand its 14th \namendment implications.\n  Now on the political question, and these are important points, and I \napologize to my colleague for making him wait until I make these points \nbut I think they need to be made in order, and then, of course, I will \nbe glad to discuss it with him.\n  The well-established political question doctrine and justiciability \ndoctrine will mandate that the courts give the greatest deference to \ncongressional budgetary measures, particularly since section 6 of House \nJoint Resolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress the responsibility of \nenforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows Congress to ``rely on \nestimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  Under these circumstances, it is extremely and all but unlikely that \na court will substitute its judgment for that of Congress. I just \ncannot conceive of it, other than some future country that does not \nabide by its laws.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the taxpayer standing case, Flast versus Cohen, in \n1968, is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. The Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court to \nestablishment clause cases. Also, Flast is, by its own terms, limited \nto challenging cases for an illicit purpose.\n  I also believe there would be no so-called congressional standing for \nMembers of Congress to commence actions under the balanced budget \namendment because Members of Congress would not be able to demonstrate \nthat they were harmed in fact by any dilution or nullification of their \nvote, and because under the doctrine of equitable discretion, Members \nwould not be able to show that substantial relief could not otherwise \nbe obtained from fellow legislators, through the enactment, repeal or \nenforcement or amendment of a statute, it is hardly likely that Members \nof Congress would have standing to challenge actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Highly unlikely.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that the enforcement concerns \nabout the balanced budget amendment do not amount to a hill of beans. \nThe fear of the demon of judicial interference is exorcised by the \nreality of over a century of constitutional doctrines to prevent \nunelected courts from interfering with the power of the democratically \nelected branch of Government and to bestow Congress with the means to \nprotect its prerogatives.\n  I think that even though you can always say there are ambiguities in \nthe law, there always are. That does not negate the fact that this \nbalanced budget amendment does not need to be amended to take care of \nsomething that is the most highly unlikely set of occurrences that \ncould happen.\n  I will be happy to interchange with my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. On \nthis question of justiciability and standing, the Senator is, I \nbelieve, familiar with the fact that many States have balanced budget \namendments and there is a plethora of litigation in which State courts \nhave taken jurisdiction.\n  In New York, in the 1977 fiscal crisis where they had a loan of $250 \nmillion, the court declared that that was permissible; took \njurisdiction.\n  In the State of Georgia, a lease by development authority, the \nquestion whether that constituted indebtedness under that State's \nconstitution.\n  In Wisconsin, whether a lease-purchase agreement constituted \nindebtedness.\n  In 1981 in Illinois, the legislature closed the schools early in \npursuit of the balanced budget amendment of that State. The court took \njurisdiction and, by the way, they said it was permissible but they \ntook jurisdiction and made the decision.\n  In California, the employees' retirement system challenged the action \nof the State legislature which, in turn, passed fiscal emergency \nlegislation to suspend funding to the State employees' retirement \nsystem, and the court took jurisdiction in that case and was able to \norder. They do so all across the country.\n  In my State, the courts specifically have stated they have \njurisdiction. In the face of all of these State courts, in the face of \nJudge Bork, Attorney General Dellinger, in the face of Laurence Tribe \nof the Harvard Law Review and all of these others who say you probably \nwould have standing, jurisdiction, justiciability, how it can be said--\nand I ask my colleague--how it can be said that there is no standing \njusticiability or that this is a political question escapes me.\n  Does the Senator desire to respond to that, or may I make one other \npoint? Is he ready to respond to that? I see my colleague from Utah is \nnot here.\n  Mr. BROWN. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana may want to go \n [[Page S2700]] ahead and complete his points before we respond.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator from Utah also said the Congress would have \nthe power if there were courts who began to meddle in this, accepted \njurisdiction, that the Congress would then have the power, I guess by \ngetting 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, in order to limit that \njurisdiction of a case already started.\n  I just wonder at what point the Congress would feel constrained to \nact. Would it be after the district court had issued an injunction, \nafter the court of appeals had ordered taxes increased or after the \nSupreme Court had acted? Why do we not fix that in advance so the court \nwill not exercise this jurisdiction, will not exercise that power, \nexcept to the extent that the Congress specifically authorizes it? That \nis my question, and then I will yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nhas raised some concerns. My hope is that I can offer at least some \ncomments that will be helpful to a portion of his concerns.\n  The issue of whether or not this provides ``a plethora of \nlitigation''--I think those are the words that were stated--is a fair \nquestion to ask, and I think it is reasonable to bring it before the \nbody. I asked that question specifically of the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral when he came before the Judiciary Committee.\n  The point of the administration was that this could lead to a flood \nof litigation. I noted that a large number of our States, the vast \nmajority of our States have similar balanced budget amendments. The one \nin Colorado is, of course, very strict, much stricter than this. This \nis the softest form of a balanced budget amendment that I know of. I \nthink Americans that watch this debate will be shocked to find how weak \na version it is because it can be waived by simply 60 votes.\n  However, the allegation that this would lead to a large amount of \nlitigation already is a question that has been faced by this country \nbecause the vast majority of our States have constitutional amendments \nthat require a balanced budget, and they are much tougher than anything \nwe are talking about.\n  I asked the Assistant Attorney General to name for me the cases that \nhe was worried about, this flood of litigation. He could not name one \nsingle case. Mr. President, let me repeat that because the Attorney \nGeneral who had made that allegation was unable to name a single \nsolitary case. And when pressed on it, he came up with the name of \nseveral cases that, indeed, involved States but did not involve the \nbalanced budget amendment that those States had.\n  Now, what is the fact? Colorado has a balanced budget amendment. The \nlast litigation we had----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield on the question of what the \nAttorney General said?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Quoting from Mr. Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General \nDellinger's testimony on page 137 of the hearings, he stated as \nfollows:\n\n       There is as yet nothing in this amendment proposal that \n     would preclude the courts of getting involved in issues of \n     taxation. Recall Missouri v. Jenkins from 1990, where the \n     Supreme Court held that while a Federal district court had \n     abused its discretion in directly imposing a tax increase to \n     fund a school desegregation program, that the modifications \n     made in that case by the Court of Appeals satisfied equitable \n     and constitutional principles.\n       If we have an amendment that for the first time \n     constitutionalizes the taxing and spending process and \n     creates a constitutional mandate which the courts are sworn \n     on oath to uphold, there is simply no way that we can rule \n     out the possibility that tax increases or spending cuts would \n     be ordered by the judiciary.\n\n  The Senator asked what was the case Mr. Dellinger was concerned \nabout. That is it--taxing being ordered by the courts or spending cuts \nbeing ordered by the courts. That is page 137 of last year's hearing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to place in \nthe Record at this point Mr. Dellinger's testimony.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt From Hearing on Senate Joint Resolution 41--Balanced Budget \n                               Amendment\n\n       Mr. DELLINGER. Mr. Chairman, thank you.\n       Two hundred and seven years ago this summer, the framers of \n     the Constitution met in Philadelphia. Their goal, as one of \n     the founders put it, was to design a system of government \n     that would ensure the grandeur and importance of America \n     until time shall be no more.\n       The coming together of the American Colonies into a single \n     Nation was more difficult than we can easily now imagine. \n     John Adams wrote home from the Continental Congress in 1775 \n     to the remarkable Abigail Adams, and he spoke of 50 gentlemen \n     meeting together, all strangers, not acquainted with each \n     others' ideas, views, language, designs. We are, he said, \n     timid, skittish, jealous.\n       They came as representatives of legislative democracies \n     that had some independence from England and had engaged in \n     self-government, in many instances, for more than a century. \n     They took enormous risk to create, in that summer of 1787, \n     between the first day, May 25, and the last day, September \n     17, 1787, a system of government that has lasted longer and \n     served better as a foundation for free government than any \n     other constitution yet written.\n       It was the government designed to create a great republic, \n     the kind of republic that John Marshall could then imagine as \n     a young Chief Justice; where, from the St. Croix to the Gulf \n     of Mexico, revenue was to be collected and expended, armies \n     are to be marched and supported. To this end, Marshall wrote, \n     all the sword and the purse, all the external relations and \n     no inconsiderable portion of the industry of the Nation are \n     entrusted to this Government.\n       This Government, under this system of government, as you \n     know as the great historian of this body, the Senate, has \n     provided an extraordinary basis for the achievement of the \n     grandeur and importance of the American Nation.\n       I think we are considering today an amendment to that \n     document that poses great risk. For that amendment is \n     profoundly anticonstitutional, not unconstitutional--no \n     amendment ratified in due course could rightly be called \n     unconstitutional--but anti- constitutional in the \n     sense that it goes against the basic spirit, the basic \n     essence of some of the most profound aspects of the \n     Constitution.\n       The Constitution, as written by the framers, did not \n     constrain choices, It, rather, empowers the people to enact \n     choices, except in those few instances, such as the freedom \n     of speech and the press and of religion, that are ruled out \n     of bounds altogether. This\n      amendment is inconsistent with that goal, by seeking to \n       shackle government.It is a Constitution in which the \n     principle of majority rule is so fundamental, so essential, \n     that it literally goes without saying. There is no need even \n     to mention that decisions are made by majority rule. And yet, \n     here is an amendment that would, for the first time, allow 40 \n     percent to hold hostage a majority of the Government with \n     respect to a matter--the passage of a budget--that must be \n     done.\n       We have, and will hear in the judiciary subcommittee today \n     and yesterday, discussions to the fact that there are other \n     supermajority provisions of the Constitution--and so, there \n     are. But notice how different this proposal is. Each of the \n     other supermajority provisions of the Constitution--the \n     ratification of treaties, conviction of a President on \n     charges of impeachment, the override of a veto, the expulsion \n     of a Member or proposing an amendment to the Constitution--\n     each of those calls for a supermajority in circumstances in \n     which the default, the status quo, is perfectly acceptable \n     and can remain if no action is taken.\n       If we do not propose a constitutional amendment because \n     there is no supermajority, the Constitution we have remains \n     as it is. We can go without a treaty. We can decline to \n     impeach a President. We can decline to override the \n     President's veto. But we must pass a budget. There is no \n     underlying status quo of no budget that is acceptable. So \n     that, in this unusual event, we would distort and challenge \n     the basic notion of majority rule.\n       Some have noted that, indeed--and you would know this \n     better than I--such a provision could, in fact, worsen budget \n     deficits. I would certainly defer to your judgment, Mr. \n     Chairman, on this, but I could easily imagine circumstances \n     in which a majority and a minority leader thought it a lot \n     more difficult to assemble 50 votes for a stringent budget \n     vastly increasing taxes and cutting cherished programs than \n     it would be to outbid each other to assemble 60 votes, where, \n     if you achieve 60 votes through a bidding war, there is \n     simply no limit on how large the deficit may be under this \n     amendment.\n       So, you have this odd distortion between the votes \n     necessary to pass a budget and one which could work in quite \n     unexpected ways.\n       But those, Mr. Chairman, are just introductory remarks to \n     what I think is the central concern that would be appropriate \n     for the Department of Justice to represent to you today. And \n     that is the implications of this amendment for the basic \n     structure of our constitutional government and to the status \n     of our Constitution as positive law.\n       [[Page S2701]] Yesterday, one of the thoughtful supporters \n     of this amendment described it as a necessary, quote, \n     mechanism of discipline for our budget situations. And yet, \n     the very flaw of this proposal is that it has no mechanism. \n     And it is that absence of a mechanism of enforcement that \n     makes this amendment such a threat to our basic \n     constitutional values.\n       The central problem is that this proposed amendment \n     promises a balanced budget without providing any mechanism \n     for accomplishing that goal. It simply declares that outlays \n     shall not exceed expenditures, without ever explaining how \n     this desirable state of\n      affairs shall come about, and without specifying who among \n     our Government officials shall be empowered to ensure that \n     the amendment is not violated or, if violated, the Nation \n     is brought into compliance.\n       Some have said that Congress will feel duty bound to comply \n     with the requirements of this constitutional amendment. And I \n     agree that each Member of Congress would properly consider \n     himself or herself individually bound to comply with the \n     amendment. The difficulty is that the amendment does not \n     provide any mechanism by which those individual Members of \n     Congress can coordinate their separate constitutional \n     obligation to support a balanced budget.\n       Each Member of the Senate and House might conscientiously \n     set about to comply with the amendment. One Senator might \n     vote to cut military spending; another to reduce retirement \n     or other entitlement benefits; a third to raise taxes. Each \n     would have been faithful to his or her oath of office. But \n     each of the measures may fail to gain a majority support and, \n     therefore, the amendment would not be, and the requirements \n     of the amendment would not be, met.\n       Or, of course, Congress might simply, by 55 votes, pass an \n     amendment that does not, in fact, produce a situation in \n     which outlays do not exceed receipts.\n       What are we then left with? What would the senior advisors \n     to the President tell the President would be the case if this \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States was not \n     being complied with by the functioning and processes of \n     Government?\n       I think we would certainly expect a vast array of \n     litigation to ensure. One of the first matters to be \n     litigated would be whether the President was obligated or \n     entitled to make his own unilateral cuts in budget or \n     otherwise, unilaterally, to raise revenues. This would be a \n     very difficult question. I would imagine that different \n     courts would resolve the issue differently.\n       Some would say that the President alone would be in a \n     position simply to order a cut, even where the law required \n     otherwise, because now he had the higher obligation to ensure \n     that the Constitution was complied with.\n       Others would argue that it would be extraordinary to infer \n     from the silence of this amendment such a sweeping and \n     radical change in the allocation authority among the branches \n     of Government. And yet, the issue would be resolved by judges \n     and courts.\n       Surely the most alarming aspect of the amendment is that by \n     constitutionalizing the budget process, the amendment appears \n     to mandate an extraordinary expansion of judicial authority. \n     Both State and Federal judges may well be required to make \n     fundamental decisions about taxing and spending--issues that \n     they clearly lack the institutional capacity to resolve in \n     any remotely satisfactory manner.\n       One would hope that the judiciary would consider these \n     questions political and beyond their scope. This political \n     question doctrine, simply put, is the doctrine that is \n     designed to restrain the judiciary from inappropriate \n     interference in the business of the other branches of \n     Government.\n       On its face, that basic doctrine would appear to constrain \n     the court's review of a balanced budget amendment. And yet, \n     the most recent decisions of the Supreme Court suggest that \n     the court would be prepared to resolve questions that might \n     once have been considered political.\n       We have the example of United States v. Munoz-Flores from \n     1990, in which the court adjudicated a claim that an \n     assessment was unconstitutional because it failed to comply \n     with the provision that it originate in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       I would have thought before Munoz-Flores that the court \n     would decline to adjudicate and would accept the \n     authentication of Congress. And I would have been wrong.\n       In 1992, the court considered the congressional resolution \n     of how one goes about apportioning the last seat for the \n     House of Representatives, what formula to choose when \n     Congress decides which State gets that last 435th seat in \n     Congress. The losing State challenged--Montana--the \n     Department of Commerce. And I would have assumed that the \n     court would have considered this, too, a political question, \n     left for the final resolution of the Congress. And, again, I \n     was wrong in that assumption. Because the court did go to the \n     merits, did consider it judiciable, and did pass judgment on \n     this question.\n       So I think that however wise or unwise it may be for the \n     courts to be involved in these issues--and I tend to think it \n     is unwise--it is nonetheless the case that no one can provide \n     any assurances that once this amendment constitutionalizes \n     the budget process the court will not consider itself \n     obligated to resolve issues that arise under that amendment.\n       Let me mention, for example, one that I noted just last \n     evening where I could readily imagine a justiciable case \n     where the party has standing and a declaration invalidating a \n     major act of Congress, if this amendment were law today.\n       Section 4 of Senate Joint Resolution 41 provides that no \n     bill to increase revenue shall become law--no bill shall \n     become law if it increases revenue--unless approved by a \n     majority of the whole number of each House on a rollcall \n     vote. It is often the case that there are major pieces of \n     legislation, like the crime bill, that contain provisions \n     which a litigant might later argue, increase revenue, by \n     providing more effective enforcement mechanisms, by providing \n     forfeiture provisions.\n       A criminal defendant would surely have standing, prosecuted \n     or sentenced under omnibus crime legislation, to say that \n     this bill contains a provision which would increase revenues, \n     and, therefore, it falls under section 4 of this amendment \n     and is unconstitutional unless Congress had been alert to \n     ensure that its approval was by a majority of the whole \n     number of each House on a rollcall vote. Once you \n     constitutionalize an area you take the resolution of critical \n     questions, critical concerns, out of the hands of the elected \n     representatives of the people and leave them in the hands of \n     courts that now would be under a mandate to resolve these \n     issues.\n       There are others who might have standing. Taxpayers, to be \n     sure. I have never, myself, fully been reconciled to Flast v. \n     Cohen, but it remains the law. Many of the provisions of this \n     amendment appear to be an express or specific limitation on \n     the tax against\n      spending power which would generate standing in taxpayers to \n     litigate. Certainly, if the President took action to cut \n     benefits, if he, say, cut Social Security across the board \n     by 9 percent in order to comply with the amendment, a \n     beneficiary would challenge the President's authority to \n     do that, and that issue would wind up in litigation.\n       There is as yet nothing in this amendment proposal that \n     would preclude the courts of getting involved in issues of \n     taxation. Recall Missouri v. Jenkins from 1990, where the \n     Supreme Court held that while a Federal district court had \n     abused its discretion in directly imposing a tax increase to \n     fund a school desegregation program, that the modifications \n     made in that case by the Court of Appeals satisfied equitable \n     and constitutional principles. Those modifications included \n     leaving the details of the mandate to increase taxes to State \n     authorities, while nonetheless imposing a mandate that must \n     have been met.\n       If we have an amendment that for the first time \n     constitutionalizes the taxing and spending process and \n     creates a constitutional mandate which the courts are sworn \n     on oath to uphold, there is simply no way that we can rule \n     out the possibility that tax increases or spending cuts would \n     be ordered by the judiciary. And I think we would all agree \n     that that is a profound change in our constitutional system.\n       I believe it was in the 48th Federalist that Madison \n     assured those who were about to vote on whether to ratify or \n     reject the proposed Constitution, Madison assured them that \n     the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of \n     the people. That is a theme which is carried forward by \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy in his dissent in Missouri v. \n     Jenkins, where he writes of how jarring it is to our \n     constitutional system to have unelected life tenure judges \n     involved in the process of taxation. Justice Kennedy wrote, \n     ``It is not surprising that imposition of taxes by an \n     authority so insulated from public comment and control can \n     lead to deep feelings of frustration, powerlessness, and \n     anger on the part of taxpaying citizens.'' We would not, I \n     think--you would not want lightly to have put out a provision \n     that so radically restructured the fundamental nature of our \n     constitutional system in the face of such limited discussion \n     about how these enforcement mechanisms would work.\n       Chairman Byrd. Mr. Dellinger, what was the vote in that \n     case? The Supreme Court vote?\n       Mr. Dellinger. I believe it was five to four. But I have \n     not checked the vote. I believe it was five to four. I am \n     seeing one of your very helpful staff members nodding behind \n     you and assuring me. So it is a very close case, and I think \n     the constitutional proposition set forth in section 1 would \n     provide for many justices a more sound basis for being \n     engaged in taxing and spending, where it says total outlays \n     for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts. This is \n     no longer part of the Pledge of Allegiance or a Fourth of \n     July speech. We are talking about making this a part of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my friend for raising that point, and it proves \nprecisely the point that I want to make. That case was not based on a \nbalanced budget amendment. That case was based on the 14th amendment.\n  I might mention that the constitutional amendment before this body \ndoes not repeal the 14th amendment. The 14th amendment is in the \nConstitution. The cases are going to come up about the 14th amendment \nall the time. That was the whole point. The Assistant Attorney General \nhad brought this specter of floods of litigation and his prime example \nwas one \n [[Page S2702]] that dealt not with the balanced budget amendment but \ndealt with the 14th amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. He was saying that under the balanced budget amendment \nthey would have the authority, that nothing would prevent the same \nauthority exercised as in Missouri versus Jenkins.\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the point here is that the case he cited to \nexpress his concern was one that did not deal with the balanced budget \namendment, and there are many of them that exist across the country.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, but it dealt with the power of Federal courts to \norder taxation, which was what his concern was, which is what my \nconcern is, and my amendment would prevent that. And why not do that?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me suggest, the Senator's amendment deals not with the \n14th amendment. It deals with appeals to courts and deals with appeals \nto courts on this amendment.\n  Now, the question is clearly this: Is the passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment going to lead to a flood of litigation? When the \nAssistant Attorney General was asked to name a case, one case where you \nhave had appeals to the courts and litigation in the courts about the \nnumerous balanced budget amendments around the country, he was unable \nto name a single solitary case.\n  Now, Mr. President, those cases do exist. Colorado has had a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget in its constitution for \nover 100 years. We have had litigation on it. And the last litigation \nin Colorado on our balanced budget amendment was in 1933. It dealt with \na peripheral case.\n  Now, this flood of litigation that the Assistant Attorney General is \nforecasting has not reared its head in the State of Colorado for over a \nhalf century, not a single case in over a half century. And the one \nthat came up literally 60 years ago was one that did not deal directly \nwith the issue of the balanced budget. It dealt with a peripheral \nissue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Perhaps my friend did not hear the cases which I cited \nfrom around the country where courts have gotten involved in this. \nLooking to my own State of Louisiana, for example, in 1987, the court \nof appeals case, just to quote briefly, says:\n\n       Defendants contend that there exists no justiciable issues \n     in this case because the courts should not ``step in and \n     substitute their judgment for that of the legislature and \n     executive branches'' in the budget process. We disagree. The \n     determination of whether the legislature has acted within \n     rather than outside its constitutional authority must rest \n     with the judicial branch of government.\n\n  That is from Bruno v. Edwards, 517 So. 2d 818, a 1987 case. It is all \nover the country that this is done. I do not know what they have done \nin Colorado. They have done it in my State. They have done it in New \nYork. They have done it in Georgia. They have done it in Wisconsin, \nCalifornia. All across the country they have taken balanced budget \namendments, and there has been standing found and the courts have found \nthose issues to be justiciable and indeed in a 14th-amendment case, \nMissouri versus Jenkins they ordered up taxes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me reclaim my time, if I could.\n  Mr. President, the statement that I made was not that it is \nimpossible that you would ever have litigation. That certainly has \nnever been my position, and it is not now. And if the Senator's point \nis that it is possible that you could have litigation over this \nquestion, I would certainly indicate to him I think he is right. It is \npossible you could have litigation come up.\n  What we are dealing with here, though, is a question of whether or \nnot this is going to engender a flood of litigation, a plethora of \nlitigation, as has been indicated. That simply is not an accurate \nstatement if you look at what has happened in the States of our \ncountry. It is simply inaccurate, and the proof--I have given proof in \nmy State. We have not had a case in 60 years, and the one we did have \n60 years ago dealt with a side issue.\n  Now, the Missouri versus Jenkins case that was referred to was a \nState action, and it dealt with the 14th amendment. It was not a \nbalanced budget amendment case. So you can raise all sorts of specters, \nbut let me suggest a test for all of these. Many Members honestly and \nsincerely think it is a mistake to have a limitation on spending. That \nis a difference between men and women of good spirit. While I am one \nwho thinks the record shows that this country is not going to survive \nwithout a change in the way we appropriate money, while I am one who \nbelieves that some control on spending is essential to this Nation \nproviding leadership in a world economy in the next century, I \nrecognize that people of good spirit and good intentions may not share \nthat view.\n  But when the question is put, if this amendment is passed will people \nwho currently oppose the amendment to the Constitution then vote in \nfavor of the constitutional amendment, my understanding is that they \nwill not. I think you have to ask yourself, is this amendment put \nforward to improve the constitutional amendment to balance the budget? \nI believe that is the intent of the Senator from Louisiana. It is a \nsincere effort to deal with a problem of excessive court involvement. I \nknow he is sincere about that. I think the purpose of his amendment is, \nindeed, to improve this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield briefly on that point?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will in just a moment.\n  I think it is important to note that there does not appear to be \nanyone who is coming forward and saying look, if this amendment is \nadopted, we are willing to sign on and agree with you; limitations are \nimportant.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I just want to point out, right before \nthis debate started there were, I believe, two Members who are \nundecided, on our side, who said in my presence right here that this \namendment may determine how they vote. They will have to speak for \nthemselves.\n  I will tell my colleague privately who they were. I do not think I \nshould use their names. They can speak for themselves. My question is, \nare there those on your side of the aisle whose votes you lose by \nmaking clear the jurisdiction of the court? My guess is you do not, \nbecause this is almost identical to the Danforth amendment which was \npassed in the last Congress without objection.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is a fair and appropriate question. I suspect I have \na responsibility to check on that.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana would be \nwilling to respond to a question of mine?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. BROWN. I guess the question that occurs to me is, would it be the \nSenator's intent, if this constitutional amendment is passed and if \nCongress refuses to abide by that constitutional amendment, to preclude \nany enforcement of it through the courts?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. As a matter of fact, the amendment very \nspecifically allows the Congress to implement the--to authorize \njudicial relief. But only to the extent that Congress specifically \nauthorizes it.\n  As I mentioned, the Congress may well want to, for example, say the \ncourt shall have declaratory relief; may be able to cut spending but \nnot raise taxes; or you may want to have direct jurisdiction in the \nSupreme Court--original jurisdiction there, so as to expedite the \nhearings. There are all kinds of things we may want to do that would \nhelp clear up, for example, what happens in the bond market while these \ncases are moving through ever so slowly from all around the country. We \nought to be able to deal with that in congressional legislation. I not \nonly do not preclude that, I specifically authorize it in this \namendment.\n  The difference between that and the way we are now is it is unclear \nwhether or not the courts have that inherent authority. If the Congress \ndoes not act, then it is my belief, along with Laurence Tribe and \nRobert Bork and Professor Dellinger, et cetera, that they would \nprobably have that jurisdiction. I say: Make it clear.\n  Mr. BROWN. At least my understanding is that Congress does have the \nability to deal with that now.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Congress does have the ability under, I believe it \nis section 5--section 6, to do that. That is clear.\n  However, upon failure to act by the Congress, then the courts would \nprobably have this jurisdiction anyway. The difference between section \n6 of the amendment as presently stated and \n [[Page S2703]] under my amendment, my amendment says that unless \nCongress specifically acts, there is no jurisdiction in the court. \nWhereas section 6 says the Congress may act, but in the meantime it is \nunclear what the authority of the courts is.\n  Mr. BROWN. I wonder if the Senator has thought about spelling out in \nhis amendment the kinds of appeals that he would have in mind? I think \npart of the concern as we look at the amendment is the concern that \nthis could well end up sabotaging the balanced budget amendment, in \nthat if the Senator spelled out the kinds of appeals he had in mind, it \nmight go a long way toward generating support on it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What Senator Hatch has stated is that the court would \nhave no jurisdiction. He says that is clear. I think it is demonstrably \nunclear.\n  I think the question of how you spell out the jurisdiction and \nremedies ought really to take up some serious time of the Judiciary \nCommittee: Bring in the legal experts, talk about whether you want to \nlimit it to injunctive relief, whether you want to limit the power to \nenact taxes. All of those are very close and difficult legal questions \nthat I think take a lot of thought, which are beyond my ability to \nspell out.\n  I think you can spell out the broad constitutional terms right here. \nThe court shall or shall not have power. But we would preserve that \npower of the Congress to do that. The real question is: Should the \ncourt have the power to order taxes, provide injunctive relief, make \ndecisions, declaratory judgments, if the Congress does not specifically \nauthorize it?\n  I believe the answer to that is no. And that is why this amendment \nclears that up and makes it unambiguous.\n  Mr. BROWN. I might say, Mr. President, at least my understanding, and \nthe Senator may want to correct me if he feels I have misphrased it, my \nunderstanding is Senator Hatch's view is that the courts could not \ninterfere with the budgetary process but that Senator Hatch does feel \nthe courts should be able to give some limited relief.\n  I think that may be a different way of describing the Senator's \nposition. Obviously, Senator Hatch is quite able to describe his own \nposition.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My description of Senator Hatch's position is that he \nwould like to have it both ways to satisfy those who think there ought \nto be court relief and to satisfy those who think there should not be \ncourt relief, because he has some of those voting for the amendment. I \nunderstand the position of my friend, Senator Hatch, which is he wants \nto pass the amendment, and that is fine.\n  I have called into question the political calculus that says you lose \nvotes by passing this amendment. I think you endanger, politically, \nthis amendment by not clearing up this fundamental question.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say I am shocked to hear that any Member of the \nSenate would want to have it both ways. I cannot imagine--it seems \nunprecedented--that any august Member of this body would take that \nposition.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One wants it this way and one wants it that way. You \ncan sort of be all things to all people by saying: Well, it is clearly \na settled question there is no standing to sue, so therefore the court \nwill not get involved. But, on the other hand, there may be some cases \nthat will need to come to the court, where the court will need to order \nsome relief.\n  The classic, to me, was Attorney General Barr, who said--this is \nreally rich. First of all, he said:\n\n       I do believe the Congress should consider including \n     language in the amendment that would expressly limit judicial \n     review to actions for declaratory judgment.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       If, however, such a position would prove to be politically \n     unpopular, I believe, for the reasons detailed in my written \n     statement, that Congress can safely pass the amendment in its \n     current form without undue concern that the courts will \n     entertain large numbers of suits challenging Congress' action \n     on the amendment or that, even if the courts do entertain \n     some suits, they will order intrusive injunctive remedies.\n\n  I mean, he says well, they are probably not going to do it. If they \ndo, there will not be many. And even if they do a few, they will not \norder intrusive injunctive relief.\n  What is intrusive? I would think Missouri versus Jenkins--if they got \ntheir foot in the door, and Solicitor General Barr says they might have \nsome suits, having their foot in the door it does not take many orders \nof the Supreme Court increasing taxes to be pretty intrusive to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I, of course, am \nshocked that any Member would try and have it both ways as we go \nforward.\n  But let me suggest----\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the Senator is expressing his shock, I wonder if he \nwill yield for additional comment?\n  Mr. BROWN. No, I will not yield. Let me finish my statement, and then \nI will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  It is quite clear there is a distinction between remedies that the \ncourts can give and their ability to bring relief. That is well \nestablished. I do not think anyone questions it. The courts cannot \ninterfere with the budgetary process because it is a political \nquestion. I think that is well established. It would violate the \nseparation of powers. Those are quite clear. The real question I think \nyou get down to with this is do you want to find a way to wiggle out \nfrom even the very, very modest levels of discipline that this \nconstitutional amendment would bring?\n  My belief is that it is quite clear that the courts cannot get \ninvolved with a political question, that the talk about a 14th \namendment case as applying here when it has not found that kind of \naction with regard to any of the balanced budget amendments that appear \nin any of the States is to raise a red herring. I do not mean it is not \nbrought up in good faith. I share the view that the Missouri versus \nJenkins case was not decided correctly. But it does not apply to the \nbalanced budget amendments. It dealt with the 14th amendment.\n  Let me just say one other thing. Any American that honestly believes \nthat we can continue on the way we have been I think is kidding \nthemselves. Any American that can look at the last quarter-century in \nwhich we have not balanced the budget one single solitary time and \nthink that we are going to solve this without changing the system is \nkidding themselves. Whether Democrat, Republican, liberal or \nconservative, you are driving this train off a cliff. You are taking \nthe future of this Nation, the future of our children and running it \noff a cliff.\n  There may be Members who come to this floor and say, look. We can \nsolve this thing. Just let us continue on the way we are, and say it \nsincerely. But I do not think it is true. I do not think you can look \nat what has happened and decide in any other spectrum that we have a \ntrain wreck ready to happen, that we are unable to help ourselves, that \nwe have to have some discipline.\n  The question I think that is fairly asked is, is this the right \nremedy? The American people ought to look at the States that have \nconstitutional amendments that require a balanced budget. In Colorado \nwe have had the constitutional mandate to balance the budget for over \n100 years. Of those over 100 years it has been balanced every single \nyear. It has been balanced in good years and it has been balanced in \nbad years. It has been balanced when we have had a Republican \nadministration and when we have had a Democratic administration. It has \nbeen balanced when we have had a Democratic legislature, and it has \nbeen balanced when we have had a Republican legislature, and it has \nbeen balanced because they had to do it. If you had not required them \nto do it, I guarantee it would not have gotten done.\n  In the last 25 years, we have not had a single, solitary year, not \none, where you have had a balanced budget. I do not think there is \nanybody in this Chamber--or at least not very many--who would come to \nthe floor and say we have done a good job setting priorities. If \nanybody is comfortable with a program to subsidize tobacco at the same \ntime you have a program to urge people not to use it, I want them to \ncome forth and tell me about it. That is ludicrous. Whether you are \nfrom a tobacco State or not, to subsidize a crop that you turn around \nand urge people not to use and bill the taxpayers for both ends of it \nis stupid. That is what we are doing.\n  We have a foreign assistance program that buys weapons for one \ncountry to \n [[Page S2704]] counter the weapons we bought for another country which \nwere given to counter the weapons we bought for the other country to \nbegin with. That is nuts. We have refused to set priorities. That is \njust plain ludicrous.\n  We have a farm program that results in people growing crops on land \nthat are better suited to other crops. Does that make any sense at all? \nWe literally grow crops on ground that would never be used for that \npurposes if you did not have a program like that. That is the silliest \nthing I ever heard of. And we continue to do it.\n  If you think those examples are out of place, look at the rest of the \nway we spend our money. Does anybody believe that the Tea Tasting Board \nis a good idea? The National Jute Association or the International Jute \nAssociation? There is not one of these, there is not 10 of these, there \nis not 1,000 of these. There are thousands and thousands and thousands, \nand the reason they exist is we have not set priorities.\n  The facts are these: We have not balanced the budget once in 25 \nyears. We have not balanced it when we have had a recession and we have \nnot balanced it when we have had a boom.\n  The President who says we can solve this without a balanced budget \namendment sent us a budget the other day. The estimates I believe are \ninaccurate. But even if you accept the estimates, which incidentally \ninclude a suggestion that we are not going to have a recession in the \nnext 5 years--and, if anybody wants to make a bet on that one, I would \nbe glad to take their money--even with assumptions that you are not \ngoing to have a recession again, even with the assumptions that the \nrate of inflation is going to have less of an impact on increasing \nspending than it will on raising revenues. Let me be specific about \nthat.\n  They assume a rate of inflation that will increase revenue at a \nhigher rate than you will increase the cost of programs. One level of \ninflation, and they assume that you are going to have a higher level of \ninflation for increasing revenue than you will have for increasing \nprograms. It would be laughable if it were not so serious. Even with \nassumptions that by anybody's definition are creative, even with \nassumptions that say we are not going to have any new spending \nprograms--and we have not had a Congress when you did not have new \nspending programs that I can recall--even with wild assumptions, even \nwith no new programs, even with no emergencies, even with no waivers \nfor the budget, the deficit continues on for a level of a couple \nhundred billion dollars. And CBO says that it is going to go up to \nabove $400 billion by 10 years out.\n  That is from the person who says we can solve this legislatively. It \nis nonsense. It is nonsense. To say no to a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution is to say no to our future, to gut this \nconstitutional amendment from ever being able to be enforced is a \ntravesty in this Member's view.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. If we are going to deal with this issue, we need an \nalternative. I have to tell you I think this balanced budget amendment \nthat is before this body is far too weak. Colorado says you have to \nhave a balanced budget. And we balanced it. This says you have to have \na balanced budget unless 60 percent of Members vote to waive it. It is \nthe softest, weakest, most ineffective balanced budget amendment I have \nseen. There may be others in the States that are weaker than this. But \nI do not know about them.\n  This very, very, very modest form of discipline apparently is too \nmuch for people who believe that the future of our country is on \nuncontrolled spending. But let me tell you, Mr. President. This issue \nis a lot more important than Colorado or Louisiana or Michigan. This \nissue goes to the very heart of the future of this Nation and the \nfuture of the men and women who have their children and their \ngrandchildren who are going to be raised in this country.\n  This issue is a question of whether or not we are able to control the \nwaste that has given us the biggest national deficit in the history of \nthis country or the history of any country in the history of the world.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me finish my statement, if I could, because it seems \nto me we are overlooking the real problem. The real problem here is an \nappetite by this Congress for uncontrolled spending. The real problem \nhere is an unwillingness to live by any limitation.\n  Mr. President, I want to relate a fact to the Members in this body, \nbecause I think every one of them knows it and shares it. I came to \nCongress in 1981. We passed a budget, and the budget was not balanced. \nBut what it said is the next year out it is going to be balanced. We \nare not balanced this year. But give us another year, and we will have \nit balanced. We had a plan to get there. We had limitations on \nspending, and projected tax revenue. What happened? What happened was \nthis: Congress appropriated more money than they had allowed for in \ntheir own budget. They waived their own Budget Act. The fact was our \nestimates were overblown, and we exceeded our own spending limits. You \nwould say, OK. That is one year out of one. That is not too bad. But \nwhat happened the next year? The next year we adopted a budget with the \nphony estimates in it. And that is exactly what they were. They were \nphony, and they were Reagan estimates, and I called them phony at the \ntime. We adopted a budget with phony estimates in it, and Congress \nexceeded its own spending budget again. And everybody said next year. \nThe next year we adopted a budget, and it said after a couple or 3 \nyears we are going to get down to a balanced budget. It had phony \nestimates in it, and Congress exceeded the amount that they allowed \nthemselves to spend.\n  Mr. President, that has happened every single, solitary year. It \nhappened in 1981, it happened in 1982, and it happened in 1983 and \n1984, it happened in 1985, 1986, and 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, \n1992, 1993, and 1994. Does anyone honestly believe it is not going to \nhappen again and again and again? If you do not believe it look at the \nPresident's budget. Look at the assumptions that are in the President's \nbudget. Come to this floor and honestly tell me you think we are on the \nright path.\n  The simple facts are these: We are hoodwinking America. We have \npassed budgets every time in the last 15 years, and every time those \nbudgets were not realistic, and every time those budgets were not \nfollowed and they are not going to be followed.\n  We are debating an amendment that says we are going to eliminate the \nCourt's ability to have any discipline here. It does not surprise me \nthat this Congress does not want to have discipline over spending. But \nif anybody cares about the future of their kids and grandkids and what \nthis country stands for, then they had better figure out a way to bring \ndiscipline to this place and figure out a way to have accurate \nestimates, better figure out a way to have us change our ways, because \nthe reality is that this is shameful. The reality is that we have taken \nthe future of the strongest, greatest Nation on the face of the Earth \nand we have thrown it in the trash because people did not have the \ncourage and the willingness to stand up and eliminate wasteful spending \nand set priorities.\n  I do not know how many people watch Presidential trips, but I can \ntell you it happens both in Democratic and Republican administrations. \nYou have so many people that go with the President on trips, and it is \nshameful. Anyone who looks at the way Congress spends its money has to \nbe shocked. Do you really need elevator operators on automatic \nelevators? Are Members really unable to push the buttons themselves? Do \nyou really need a staff that is nine times bigger than any other \ncountry in the world has for its deliberative body? Incidentally, that \nis what our staff is, said the Congressional Research Service the last \ntime they did a study on it. Does anybody believe we need 1,100 police \nofficers on Capitol Hill? I mean, that is two, 2\\1/2\\ for every Member \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, this Congress is out of control. We desperately need \ncontrols. We desperately need discipline. To adopt an amendment that \neliminates our ability to have this measure enforced, I think, turns a \nblind eye to the problem the American people have. I do not know \nwhether this constitutional amendment is going to pass, but I will tell \nyou one thing, the American people are not going to watch their future \nthrown down the drain.\n   [[Page S2705]] This is a lot more important than Democrats or \nRepublicans, a lot more important than party. It deals with the future \nof our country and of our children. I do not think anybody who believes \nyou can continue on with the kind of abuse we have had for this system \nis looking at the world right. I have listened to the debate on the \nfloor. I hear Members come to the floor say, goodness, the problem is \nnot with Congress. The Congress' budgets have been less than what the \nPresident has asked for. That is right, but it is not accurate. The \ntruth is, yes, the budgets Congress has passed have not been as large \nas what the Executive--sometimes--has asked for, but left unsaid in \nthat is the fact that Congress has appropriated more than either they \nbudgeted or what the President asked for in budgeting.\n  To say that and describe the problem in that way simply misleads \npeople. Congress has not been responsible when it has come to our \nbudget. Yes, we have adopted budgets that look good at the time, but we \ndid it with phony estimates and we turned around and ignored them.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the point of all of this--and then I will yield--\nis simply this: If we are looking for an answer to this problem that \navoids discipline, that avoids controls, that avoids limits, we are \ngoing to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My colleague made a powerful speech--and I really mean \nthat--for a balanced budget. But I do not understand him to be saying \nthat the court ought to be the one to order a balanced budget, to order \na tax increase, or to order spending cuts; am I correct in that?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, my belief is that political questions will not come \nout of the jurisdiction of the court. It seems to me there is an area \nfor court jurisdiction here--enforcement.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But is the Senator familiar with the fact that, in \n1982, two former attorneys general, Senators Gorton and Rudman, offered \nan amendment of the same import of my amendment today, and that \nalthough it was defeated, 12 Republicans who are still serving in the \nSenate voted for the amendment, including Senators Chafee, Cohen, Dole, \nGorton, Hatfield, Kassebaum, Lugar, Murkowski, Pressler, Roth, Specter, \nand Stevens--that list includes some of the best lawyers in the \nSenate--and the point is, on this question of whether the courts ought \nto have jurisdiction--I think my friend would agree with me--is one \nthat really merits some very serious thought; would the Senator not \nthink?\n  Mr. BROWN. I certainly agree. In terms of the other Members the \ndistinguished Senator mentioned, I would leave it to them to defend \ntheir votes. I have enough trouble defending my own.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Has the Senator voted on this question before?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be glad to check the record and let the Senator \nknow.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would not think the Senator made the mistake of \nvoting against this kind of amendment before. I do not believe he has, \nbecause it was passed in the last Congress, without objection. The \nDanforth amendment was passed in the last Congress, without objection. \nIt truly has been a bipartisan amendment, where Senators on both sides \nhave seen the real need to limit the intrusiveness of the courts. The \npower of the courts, once granted, can extend to raising taxes, as well \nas cutting budgets, and they are not elected. They do not represent the \npeople and they should not be able to do it, except to the extent that \nwe in the Congress give them the power to do it.\n  I hope the Senator will come to my point of view. That has nothing to \ndo with whether you are for this balanced budget amendment or not--just \nas those Republican Senators who voted in 1982 for the Rudman-Gorton \namendment were supporters of the balanced budget amendment but wanted \nto limit the intrusive powers of the courts to get involved in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me suggest to my friend that while 1982 was not a long \ntime ago, it was before the Lujan case, which occurred in 1992 and \nwhich, obviously, affects thinking in this area. Clearly, these Members \nwill be able to speak for themselves and defend it as they wish. We \nhave other requests for time, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Our time is limited. I will yield the floor, and I know \nthe Senator will be recognized in due course by the Chair.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Colorado will respond to some \nquestions that I have of him on my time now. One of the things which \nthe Senator from Colorado epitomizes is honesty and \nstraightforwardness, and he, with great feeling, I think, expressed the \nview of all of the Members of this body, which is that we should not \nkid ourselves, that we ought to be honest. Honesty is something which \nhe has reflected throughout his career, and I admire him for what he \nsays, what he believes, what he feels and what he represents.\n  The Senator has made some statements about the balanced budget \namendment and how it is, in some respects, quite weak and not self-\nenforcing which, frankly, I happen to share, but that is not the \npurpose of my question. The purpose of my question goes to the Johnston \namendment and whether or not we should be honest as to whether or not \nthe courts are going to be able to enforce the balanced budget \namendment in the absence of legislation, pursuant to section 6.\n  The Johnston amendment makes it very clear that we are able to \nauthorize the court, if we adopt enforcement and implementation \nlegislation, pursuant to section 6, to do whatever we authorize that \ncourt to do. But in the absence of implementation legislation, setting \nforth the authority of the court, the question is, honestly, what is \nthe intention of this amendment? There is ambiguity, and if we are \nlooking for honesty--and I believe we all are--we should clarify that \nissue. There is no reason to write a constitutional amendment which is \nambiguous at the heart of the amendment which is: How is it going to be \nenforced? That is the heart of it. We can make all of the great \nstatements we want about balancing the budget, and we have during the \nearly 1980's.\n  But the key to a constitutional amendment is how it is going to be \nenforced. The key to this constitutional amendment, as has been said \nover and over again by the sponsors, to section 6 which is the \nimplementing legislation, implementing legislation which would be \nrequired of a future Congress.\n  I have problems with laying this on the doorstep of a future \nCongress, because I think we ought to adopt implementing legislation. I \ndo not think we ought to kick this can down the road up to 7 years. But \nthat is a different speech. That goes to the question of just how \neffective this is as a budget balancing tool.\n  My question of my friend from Colorado goes to the intent of the \nsponsors of this amendment as to court enforcement, and I have two \nquestions. First, is it the intent, is it his understanding of the \nintent, that Members of Congress would have standing to file suit to \nenforce this constitutional amendment?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, the Senator is asking for a legal interpretation. I \nwould be glad to supply that and I will supply it for both the Senator \nand for the Record.\n  Let me say I think it is worthwhile noting here that none of the \namendments to the Constitution--and, as you know, we have a number--\nhave included the language as suggested by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana. What is being suggested is different from what we have \ndone with any other constitutional amendment.\n  Second, we did have a proposal last year, I understand, that did \nlimit appeals to declaratory judgments. That is the first time I am \naware of--the distinguished Senators may wish to correct me--it is the \nfirst time I am aware of that you have had that added to a proposed \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Finally, let me suggest, I think it is section 2 of this amendment \nthat deals with the question of whether or not those questions are left \nopen or vague or unanswered. At least I think a fair \n [[Page S2706]] reading of that section indicates that there is real \nguidance within the amendment itself.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Specifically in section 2, what is the Senator referring \nto?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me get that section for you.\n  Section 2 reads as follows:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by rollcall vote.\n\n  That, at least as I read the constitutional amendment, is where the \nreal discipline of this matter is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My friend from Colorado points to something which has also \nbeen pointed to by other sponsors of this legislation, which is section \n2. But is it not true that section 2, in terms of that particular type \nof debt limit, requires Congress to act?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So that even section 2 depends upon implementation by \nCongress of a limit on the publicly held debt; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the value of this, I say to my friend, is that \nwhile you are looking for a device that controls this and avoids ways \nfor people to wiggle out of it, by focusing on what people borrow, we \nthink that may be the single most effective enforcement device there \ncan be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But my friend from Colorado is not responding to my \nquestion, which is: Is it not true that there is no current debt limit, \nas defined in section 2, which is a debt limit on the publicly held \ndebt and, in order to establish such a debt limit, legislation would \nhave to be passed?\n  So again, it depends on a future Congress to establish a limit on the \nso-called publicly held debt, a limit which has not heretofore been \nestablished by statute; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Senator makes a valid point. There is no \nquestion that future Congresses obviously have to be involved in this \ndecision, whether it is the discipline or whether it is the definition.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The discipline which my friend refers to again depends on \nfuture Congress acting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Attorney General to me \nstating exactly that be now printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcoll vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact this Office if we can be \n     of assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Anthony,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because over and over again we have heard that section 2 \nis the discipline. In fact, section 2 is only operative if a future \nCongress establishes something called a limit on publicly held debt--\npublicly held debt.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would beg to differ with my friend. I think the language \nof section 2 is quite clear, not vague. ``The limit on the debt of the \nUnited States held by the public shall not be increased unless three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \nan increase by rollcall vote.'' Obviously, it involves the Congress in \nseveral extents. One, of course, is the waiver should they vote---\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could interrupt my friend again. That is not the \npoint I am making. Any increase in that debt would have to be voted by \n60 percent of the Senate. That is clear in the language. But the \nestablishment of the limit itself would have to be, in the first \ninstance, created by the Congress, because there is no such limit at \nthe moment. Would the Senator from Colorado agree with that?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Senator is right to point out that defining \nwhat the terms ``debt of the United States held by the public'' is \nindeed something that requires it.\n  But I would point out---\n  Mr. LEVIN. It requires Congress to act; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes. Indeed, I think the Senator is correct. But I would \npoint out on that that if that is the Senator's concern, let me suggest \nI think the words of that section are very clear. I do not mean to \nsuggest to the Senator that creative minds that abound in this Congress \nand our courts could not find a way to misinterpret that. But I suspect \nthat even the most creative minds would be pressed to find that \nlanguage vague or unreasonable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it would be quite simple, actually, to have an \nargument as to what is meant by that term.\n  Now to get back to my question. Is it the intent of the Senator from \nColorado that a Member of Congress would have standing to file suits to \nenforce this constitutional provision?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is an appropriate legal question. I would be glad to \nsupply the Senator a legal memo to that effect, and I would be glad to \nput it in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I will ask a second question. I think these \nare critical questions and I think we should get answers to them from \nthe sponsors.\n  Is it the intent of the Senator from Colorado that a court could \ninvalidate an individual appropriation or a tax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me speak in reference to section 2. It seems to me, at \nleast in regard to section 2, the device here that I think is so \nhelpful, at least I like it very much, is that it limits Congress' \nability to continue to borrow money in that regard and that indeed does \nhave an impact on one's ability to fund new programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Michigan \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana \nwould yield me 5 additional minutes?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I so yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question to the Senator from Colorado is: Is it the \nintention under this amendment that courts could invalidate the \nindividual appropriations or tax acts? The Senator from Colorado \nrepeatedly said that it is not the intention of the Congress, it is not \nthe intention of this balanced budget amendment to have courts \ninterfering with the budgetary process. That is what the Senator from \nColorado has represented. It is not the intention of this amendment to \nhave courts interfere in the budgetary process?\n  My question is: Is it the intention of the sponsors or of the Senator \nfrom Colorado that a court could invalidate an individual \nappropriations or a tax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator wish me to repeat the question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Would you please?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention of the sponsors or the Senator from \nColorado that a court could invalidate an individual appropriations or \ntax act?\n  Mr. BROWN. It strikes me that the beauty of section 2 is that it \nplaces the limit on the amount we can borrow, which places then back in \nthe hands of Congress the discretion as to what we fund and the limit \ndiscipline it places on us is our limit to add to the debt. So at least \nmy impression would be Congress would retain the ability to make a \ndecision as to where their limited funds would be allocated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me ask my friend from Illinois, because I do not think \nthat is responsive to the question.\n  The Senator from Illinois is on the floor. Is it the intention of the \nsponsors of this amendment that the court, without further authority \nunder section 6, would have the power to invalidate an individual \nappropriation or a tax act?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n   [[Page S2707]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response, my instinct is that unless \nthere was a blatant violation of the intent of this amendment, the \ncourts would not get involved. We are not dealing with something like \nthe 14th amendment where it is somewhat amorphous.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The words ``blatant violation'' are all that have to be \nalleged in a suit brought in a court to then allow the invalidation of \nan appropriation or tax act.\n  Is that what the Senator from Illinois is saying?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the answer is we can imagine all kinds of \nscenarios. But the reality is that we want to handle this ourselves. We \ndo not want the courts to get involved. If some future Congress were \njust to blatantly say, ``We will ignore the Constitution,'' then the \ncourts might get involved.\n  The courts have only been involved in a tax matter in the Jenkins \ncase in Kansas City where we have a different constitutional principle \ninvolved.\n  In this amendment we are not talking about very precise things, but \nabout a self-enforcing mechanism.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since we are on my time, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to \ncomment.\n  Let me tell Members what the reason is that I am pressing folks on \nthis. The key sponsor of this legislation in the House, Representative \nSchaefer of Colorado, who is the lead sponsor of Schaefer-Stenholm, had \nthe language that we are debating now. He said the following: ``A \nMember of Congress or an appropriate administration official probably \nwould have standing to file suit challenging legislation that subverted \nthe amendment.''\n  I want to read all three of these comments of Representative Schaefer \nand contrast this to the assurances that the Senator from Utah, I think \nin good conscience, gave as to his intention that there is no standing \nto sue on the part of Members of Congress, that the courts will not be \nable to intervene. And yet the sponsor on the House side states a very, \nvery different intent, which is the reason we should adopt the Johnston \namendment, because there is not only ambiguity among law professors, \nthere are differences between sponsors on this side and sponsors on the \nHouse side.\n  The second statement of Representative Schaefer: ``The courts * * * \ncould invalidate an individual appropriation or tax act.'' Think about \nthat. Here we are told there is no intention for courts to be involved \nin the budgetary process. The principal sponsor on the House side says \nunder this amendment a court could invalidate an individual \nappropriation or tax act. If that is not meddling in the budgetary \nprocess, I do not know what it is.\n  Finally--I think my time is run out. I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the statements of \nRepresentative Schaefer, along with the accompanying letters, be \ninserted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: Enclosed is a copy of the \n     proposed Constitutional Amendment relative to the balanced \n     budget. My question is the following:\n       The Committee Report states (p. 8) that the amendment is \n     ``self-enforcing'' because of Section 2, which requires a \n     three-fifths vote to increase ``[t]he limit on the debt of \n     the United States held by the public.'' Is Section 2 self-\n     enforcing, or must Congress act pursuant to Section 6 to \n     adopt enforcement and implementation legislation for this \n     provision to be legally enforceable?\n       I would appreciate your very prompt reply, given the fact \n     that we are debating this amendment at the current time.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcall vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact this Office if we can be \n     of assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Anthony,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Statements of Representative Dan Schaefer, Lead Sponsor of the \n        Schaefer-Stenholm Substitute to House Joint Resolution 1\n\n       A member of Congress or an appropriate Administration \n     official probably would have standing to file suit \n     challenging legislation that subverted the amendment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The courts could make only a limited range of decisions on \n     a limited number of issues. They could invalidate an \n     individual appropriation or tax Act. They could rule as to \n     whether a given Act of Congress or action by the Executive \n     violated the requirements of this amendment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       . . . no role for the courts is foreseen beyond that of \n     making a determination as to whether an Act of Congress . . . \n     is unconstitutional and a court order not to execute such \n     Act. . . .\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana which \nwould make it clear that the balanced budget amendment cannot be used \nto turn over to the judicial system the responsibilities of managing \nthe fiscal obligations and priorities of the United States.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana would make clear we do \nnot intend that unelected judges would assume the power to set tax \nrates or impound Social Security checks of elderly citizens in order to \ncomply with the constitutional mandate that is created through the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is probably no more significant amendment that \nwill be offered during this entire debate on the balanced budget \namendment. It goes to the very heart and structure of our system of \ngovernment which we established over two centuries ago.\n  Unless the Johnston amendment is adopted, the constitutional \namendment we are debating could be construed to authorize Federal and \nState courts to intervene into the most political decisions now made by \nelected officials, including decisions about levying taxes and spending \nthe revenues raised on national priorities that are established through \nour democratic process.\n  Instead, Mr. President, individuals appointed, not elected, to \nlifetime judicial seats could become intimately involved in these \nmatters. The independent judiciary, of course, is as important to our \nsystem as any other element, one of the most important. We do intend \nthat our judges be free from partisan pressures. We intend that they \nmake decisions based upon the law, not upon opinion polls or election \nreturns.\n  That structure is also based on something else, Mr. President. It is \nbased upon the assumption that those courts with unelected leadership \nwill not be given the responsibility for actions which are intended and \nreserved for elected officials, those in the legislative and executive \nbranches.\n  If the balanced budget amendment is added to the Constitution without \nan amendment which clarifies and limits the potential role of the \ncourts in establishing fiscal priorities for the Federal Government, we \nwill have suddenly opened the door to one of the most radical \nrestructurings of our system at any time in our history.\n  I assume in the last Congress, Mr. President, concerns about this \nissue led \n [[Page S2708]] to the adoption of the so-called Danforth amendment \nwhich specifically restricted the role of the courts in enforcement of \nthe balanced budget amendment to the issuance only of declaratory \njudgments. We do not have that here in this amendment now. We do not \nhave that restriction. Indeed, some of the most stalwart proponents of \nthe amendment have conceded that without clear limitations, either in \nthe amendment itself or the implementing legislation, the judiciary \ncould become intimately involved in actually directing compliance with \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Now, of course, the response to these concerns has uniformly been, \n``Do not worry about the details; we will fix it later.'' That is what \nwe are told about all of our amendments. Repeatedly it is asserted that \nthis issue can be addressed simply by implementing legislation.\n  Now, the Judiciary Committee report accompanying Senate Joint \nResolution 1 suggests that the silence of the amendment on the issue of \njudicial review is somehow a good thing, a virtue, asserting that \nthrough this silence the authors have refused to establish a \ncongressional sanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in \nfundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions while not undermining \ntheir equally fundamental obligation to say what the law is.\n  The proponent goes on to say to the extent that we do have any \njudicial intrusion, it can be reigned in later on by having \nimplementing legislation.\n  Mr. President, that is the classic sidestepping of critical decisions \nthat has engendered public disdain for this body and for elected \nofficials in general. It is irresponsible and an abdication of our most \nawesome duties to have failed to address this issue in a forthright and \nhonest manner.\n  The role of the courts in enforcement of this amendment ought to be \nresolved now, not sometime later. This is when we send it out to the \nStates, not later.\n  Mr. President, this entire debate over the balanced budget amendment \nhas become somewhat troubling. We seem to be rushing the proposal \nthrough to meet an arbitrary deadline that was originally set up as a \ncampaigning proposition. There has been little serious debate over the \nwords of the proposed constitutional amendment. We are constantly \ndiverted from any real discussion of the problems that should be \naddressed before this language is placed in the Constitution to a \ngeneralized discussion of Federal deficits and their impact on the \nnational economy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that for a moment we set aside these \ngeneralities and focus on the language of the balanced budget amendment \nthat we are considering, and specifically the role of the courts. I \nstrongly urge the supporters of the amendment to consider the Johnston \namendment on the merits and not just vote it down again because of some \nprearranged agreement to defeat any and all amendments. That is not \nappropriate when we are talking about the most fundamental issue of the \nseparation of powers that this country is founded upon. It is not \nappropriate, not in the U.S. Senate.\n  This is a constitutional amendment we are debating and we may well be \nsending on to the States. We better take the time to ensure that we \nhave not created unintended consequences by careless wording of the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the ratification of the balanced budget amendment \nwithout the Johnston amendment will result in judicial involvement in \nits implementation. I think that is virtually without question.\n  The Constitution of the United States has been amended only 27 times \nin over 2 centuries. Ten of those amendments comprise the Bill of \nRights. Three others, the 13th, 14th, and 15th, arose out of the Civil \nWar.\n  Our Founding Fathers made it difficult to amend our great national \ncharter, and rightly so.\n  A constitution is designed to endure for the ages, not merely reflect \nthe passing issues of the day.\n  Once altered, it is very difficult to change.\n  For example, the 18th amendment, Prohibition, was ratified in 1919. \nIt was a mistake. It inserted government into the private lives of \ncitizens. It was widely flaunted and bred disrespect for the law. It \nwas not repealed until 1933 by the 21st amendment. It took 14 years to \nundo that error.\n  An amendment to the Constitution is not like any ordinary legislative \nmatter that we can change next year when we find out that it does not \nwork exactly as intended.\n  The Constitution is not something we can tinker with and adjust from \none Congress to the next.\n  If the 104th Congress is intent upon adding the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, then we better do \nit right.\n  We better take the time to ensure that we have not created unintended \nconsequences by careless wording of the amendment.\n  Let us not allow legitimate frustrations over the Federal deficit \ninadvertently lead to a radical restructuring of our entire system of \ngovernance.\n  Mr. President, that ratification of the balanced budget amendment \nwithout the Johnston amendment will result in judicial involvement in \nits implementation is virtually without question.\n  Legal scholars from left to right agree that the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment will force the courts into potentially endless \nlitigation over its enforcement.\n  Former Solicitor General and Federal Judge Robert Bork said,\n\n       The result . . . would likely be hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of lawsuits around the country, many of them on \n     inconsistent theories and providing inconsistent results.\n\n  Kathleen Sullivan, professor of law at Stanford University similarly \nobserved,\n\n       . . . enforcement of the Balanced Budget Amendment would \n     inevitably wind up on the doorsteps of the state and federal \n     courts, and ultimately at the Supreme Court.\n\n  She further testified,\n\n       . . . the possibilities for litigation over balanced budget \n     compliance are staggering. Judges [might be asked] to enforce \n     balanced budgets either by enjoining excess spending or by \n     ordering tax increases, the latter possibility no mere \n     phantom after recent decisions by the Supreme Court upholding \n     . . . federal judicial power to require the levy of a tax.\n\n  Yale University professor of law, Burke Marshall, had this to say:\n\n       I have little doubt that the courts ultimately would, \n     however reluctantly, exercise the power of judicial review \n     over such questions as the meaning of the language [used in \n     the Amendment].\n\n  Although some may hope that the dictates of the amendment would be \nself-enforcing and self-policing by the Congress, there is little basis \nfor such speculation. There is a virtual endless list of situations \nwhere litigation is likely to result from efforts to interpret or \nenforce the amendment.\n  Courts will be asked to interpret the language of the amendment, \nincluding such questions as what constitutes total outlays and total \nrevenues. These terms are not self-evident and are not likely to be \nself-evident to future generations.\n  Litigation will surely ensue to determine what activities are or are \nnot covered by the amendment.\n  Almost unbelievably, the Judiciary Committee report, for example, \nmakes the remarkable observation that the electrical power program of \none quasi-public entity, the Tennessee Valley Authority, would not be \ncovered by the amendment since its operations are entirely the \nresponsibility of the electric ratepayers. Not only is the naming of \nthis one agency remarkable, it clearly opens the door to many other \nquasi-public entities seeking similar status. As the author of \nlegislation introduced on January 4, S. 43, to terminate some of the \npublic funding of TVA programs and develop privatization plans for this \nentity, because I wanted to identify and show where I would create the \nbalanced budget. I am both intrigued and perplexed by the decision to \nspecifically exempt the Tennessee Valley Authority as a part of this \nbalanced budget amendment process that supposedly is neutral as to what \nwould and would not be included.\n  Courts will be asked to hear challenges to the executive branch \nefforts to carry out the constitutional mandates. For example, if \noutlays exceed revenues in any fiscal year, the President could argue \non constitutional grounds that it is necessary to impound funds and \ntake other actions unilaterally to meet the requirements of balanced \nbudget amendment. As \n [[Page S2709]] Presidents test these powers, surely those affected \nwill seek judicial review.\n  For example, during the 1970's there was substantial litigation over \nthe Presidential assertion of impoundment authority. Roughly 80 cases \nwere decided by the courts on impoundment questions, generally against \nthe broad interpretation of such power advanced by the Nixon \nadministration. Passage of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 brought \nthat litigation to rest.\n  Yet, backed by a new constitutional balanced budget amendment, many \nbelieve that the President would have not only the authority to impound \nappropriated funds, but would have an obligation to do so under the \nconstitutional mandate.\n  Surely, individuals whose retirement checks are withheld or Federal \nemployees whose salaries are reduced by executive fiat would very \nlikely have standing to sue under this amendment.\n  Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Services noted in \ntestimony to the Senate Appropriations Committee that the experience in \nthe States indicates that courts could well be asked to monitor \nspending, taxing, and indebtedness actions.\n  Mr. Fisher observed, ``If state actions are a guide, judges will not \nbe shy about tackling budgetary and fiscal questions, no matter how \ncomplex.''\n  Former Solicitor General Charles Fried also testified before the \nAppropriations Committee that ``[t]he experience of state court \nadjudication under state constitutional provisions that require \nbalanced budgets and impose debt limitations * * * shows that courts \ncan get intimately involved in the budget process and that they almost \ncertainly will.''\n  Cases will also arise when Members of Congress seek to challenge the \nactions of the executive branch.\n  One of my former professors, Prof. Archibald Cox, observed, ``There \nis * * * substantial likelihood that the Federal courts will be drawn \nin by congressional suits.''\n  The Supreme Court has recently assumed that either House has standing \nto sue to enjoin action rendering its vote ineffectual, Burke versus \nBarnes (1987).\n  Thus, if the President impounded funds appropriated by Congress on \nthe grounds that anticipated revenues had fallen short of projections, \neither House might challenge such action and, again, as the Senator \nfrom Louisiana so well points out, we have the strong likelihood of the \ncourts being involved. Although the question of when individual Members \nof Congress might have standing to pursue such actions remains open, \nthe standing of Congress itself to assert its prerogatives seems \nclearly established.\n  Finally, there are strong arguments to be made that individual \ntaxpayers could have standing to bring suit to challenge a failure to \nenforce the amendment.\n  Harvard Law Prof. Archibald Cox observed in his testimony before the \nAppropriations Committee last year that if the Supreme Court's \nformulation of standing in Flast versus Cohen, the seminal taxpayer \nstanding case, is taken at face value, a Federal taxpayer would surely \nhave standing to challenge an expenditure under the proposed amendment \nupon the allegation that it had resulted or would result in a violation \nof the specific limitation imposed by section 1 of the amendment.\n  Certainly, taxpayer suits in the State courts are well-known, and the \namendment does not restrict litigation to the Federal court system. \nAbsent a provision placing exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal court \nsystem, the issue of State court litigation remains a viable option.\n  This nightmare of litigation will likely have three major results.\n  First, it will insert judges into policymaking functions that are \nunprecedented, for which they have no experience or judicially \nmanageable standards to guide their decisions. That courts would take \non such tasks as levying taxes is not mere speculation; the 1990 \ndecision of the Supreme Court in Missouri versus Jenkins, upholding a \ndistrict court decision directing a local school district to levy a tax \nin order to support a target school required in a desegregation order \nmakes it clear that this is a very real possibility.\n  Second, it would entail a radical and fundamental transformation of \nroles assigned to the different branches of government in this country.\n  As Nicholas Katzenbach testified,\n\n       * * * to open up even the possibility that judges appointed \n     for life might end up making the most fundamental of all \n     political decision is not only an unprecedented shift of \n     constitutional roles and responsibilities but one that should \n     be totally unacceptable in a democratic society.\n\n  Third, and equally important, this shift in power to the judiciary \ncould do incalculable damage to the judiciary itself. As Federal courts \ntake on the task of enjoining the expenditure of funds appropriated by \nCongress or requiring the levy of specific taxes, the backlash toward \njudicial fiats could be enormous. Ultimately, the very effectiveness of \nthe courts in preserving constitutional rights and liberties of \ncitizens could be undermined.\n  The answer to these concerns which has been made by the opponents of \nthis amendment has been singularly unsatisfactory. Repeatedly, we are \ntold, ``we will deal with the problem in the implementing \nlegislation.''\n  Well, Mr. President, the short answer is what if Congress fails to \nagree on implementing legislation?\n  What if the President vetoes any implementing legislation passed by \nCongress and Congress lacks the two-thirds majority needed to override \nsuch a veto?\n  Is there any serious doubt that the judicial branch has the ability \nto enforce a constitutional mandate even in the absence of implementing \nlegislation?\n  It is hornbook law that the Federal courts have the duty to enforce \nconstitutional requirements.\n  There is no implementing legislation for the first amendment, or the \nfourth amendment or the sixth amendment. The power of the courts to \nenforce the constitution arises from the constitution itself, as was \nheld in Marbury versus Madison, very early in our country's history.\n  As Assistant Attorney General and former Duke Law School Professor \nWalter Dellinger testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nmonth,\n\n       Section 6 of the Balanced Budget Amendment does give \n     Congress affirmative authority to legislate implementing \n     legislation. But unless that authority is deemed exclusive, \n     it does not oust the courts of jurisdiction to act without \n     any implementing legislation, just as the courts are able to \n     act under section 1 of the 14th Amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, let me address one last argument, \nthe political question argument, advanced by proponents of the \namendment who belive that judicial intervention into the budget process \nis not likely to follow ratification of the amendment. The proponents \nargue that the courts are likely to use the political question doctrine \nto duck deeper involvement into budgetary decision making. The \nconstitutional scholars, pointed out before the committee that the \nquestions which are likely to arise under the balanced budget amendment \nsimply do not meet the criteria established under Baker versus Carr \n(1962), which lays out the political question doctrine. Moreover, \nrecent cases have suggested a narrowing of the political question \ndoctrine.\n  In light of the legislative history of this amendment and the \npresumption by both proponents and opponents that the courts will have \nsome powers to hear cases involving its implementation, there is little \nlikelihood that the political question doctrine will shield the \namendment from judicial review.\n  Mr. President, in the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton warned \nthat ``there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated \nfrom the legislative and executive powers.''\n  If the Johnston amendment is not adopted, we run the grave risk of \ncreating precisely the kind of peril against which Hamilton warned: and \nthe peril is allowing unelected judges to decide policy questions that \nhave heretofore been dealt with by the legislative and executive \nbranches of our Government.\n  To embark in that direction is the height of foolishness.\n  Those on the other side of this debate who call themselves \nconservatives ought to be among the first to cosponsor and applaud the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Why leave this important issue of whether unelected judges should \nhave \n [[Page S2710]] the authority to make economic decisions unresolved?\n  Why would the Senate abdicate its responsibility? I have authored a \nlot of amendments here, Mr. President. I may have more. I care about \nthem all--middle-class tax cut, tax expenditures, issues having to do \nwith how this amendment is set up. I would happily drop all those \namendments if we could just solve this fundamental problem and if we \ncould just resolve, through the Johnston amendment, the question of \nwhether we are going to turn over this Government to the unelected \njudges or whether we are going to maintain our right and our \nresponsibility to uphold the Constitution and deal with budgetary \nmatters.\n  Mr. President, there is no question, of any amendment, this is the \none that should be adopted.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania? Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does the Senator have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The question I have is, given everything the Senator \nsays will happen--all these suits occurring, et cetera--is there not \nspecific authority in section 6 of this amendment for Congress to pass \nimplementing legislation wherein we can specifically limit the ability \nof taxpayers, Members of Congress and others to sue on this amendment? \nIs that not the ability of the Congress to do even prior to maybe even \nratification by the States? Could we not have legislation moving \nthrough the process to do that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Surely there is a possibility we could try to pass that \nlanguage and that would help. What I am suggesting here is, under the \nbalanced budget amendment and under the inherent powers of the court to \nenforce the balanced budget amendment, that that may well be overridden \nby the power of the courts to take those suits and these folks would \nhave standing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I did not understand, what would be overridden by the \ncourts, our implementing legislation?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting that simply barring those particular \nlawsuits, or attempting to, may not be consistent with the court's \nruling of his inherent powers in this situation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is suggesting the Congress cannot limit \nsuits? That is not within our ability to redress to the courts----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting in the situation where the budget is \nnot balanced, where there is a problem with the entire balanced budget \namendment and the balancing of the budget, that the courts are going to \nhave a certain amount of inherent power to enforce the amendment. I do \nnot deny Congress certainly has some power.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Could we not limit them to simply declaratory judgment? \nIs the Senator saying the courts could go beyond that even though \nCongress limits them to simply declaratory judgment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is that the Senator's intent?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we did that in the implementing legislation, to \nlimit them to declaratory judgment, is the Senator suggesting the \ncourts can ignore that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am suggesting it is possible that subsequently the \nU.S. Supreme Court could rule that the balanced budget amendment, that \nwould derogate from the balanced budget amendment and take away the \npower of the people to have a balanced budget by taking away the right \nto enforce it. If you do not include in the constitutional amendment \nitself, if you do not specify in the Constitution that statutory \nprovision cannot necessarily be interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court \nto derogate to the balanced budget amendment. I am not convinced of \nthat at all.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I can read to the Senator, if he would like, example \nafter example--I would like to submit it for the Record--of where the \nCongress has specifically limited the powers of the courts dealing with \nthese kinds of matters.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is under the current Constitution; this is under a \nnew Constitution, one with a balanced budget amendment in it. The \ncourts do not currently have a balanced budget amendment to deal with.\n  What I am suggesting is, if you have a balanced budget amendment, and \nlater on you decide that you want to have a statute, it is not certain \nthat the court would rule that that limitation----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It may be unconstitutional.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself some time \nto address this issue.\n  Section 6 of the constitutional amendment which we are discussing, \nthe balanced budget amendment, specifically states that Congress has \nthe ability to pass implementing legislation. In that legislation we \ncan limit the authority of the courts----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To address this question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Even assuming the worst case, assuming that the sky \nwill fall down----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have the ability here in this Chamber and across the \naisle to deal with this issue, and in fact I suspect that as we do pass \nimplementing legislation, which I am sure we will, we will be back on \nthis floor and I think that is the arena for this discussion as to what \nthe appropriate remedies should be.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would ask the Senator's reaction to the statement of \nSolicitor General Freed with regard to this issue where he said that if \nCongress attempted to pass legislation pursuant to section 6 to \neliminate Federal court jurisdiction of questions arising in the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, that limitation itself might \nvery well be unconstitutional.\n  That is my point. You may want to pass legislation afterwards. You \nmay hope that the court will accept it. But there is no certainty \nwhatsoever that the court will not say, I am sorry. This is merely a \nstatute. And my question is, how does the Senator react to the \nquestion?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I disagree. It has been law in this country for as far \nas I know. The only situation where that could be a problem is if all \ndue process, all other court access is denied. If we provide for some \ncourt access, which I am sure we will, if we provide for some court \naccess, then I think it is very clear that they will not have other \nrecourse--as long as we provide an avenue to the courts. We have the \npower to do that, to direct what avenue they take.\n  If we say in the implementing legislation that there will be no \naccess, I think the Senator might have a point. But I do not think we \nare going to do that. But I think that is a discussion for another day, \nnot to insert in the Constitution in this amendment a complete \nprohibition of all court activity because I think that overreaches.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will briefly yield and then I wish to respond to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think the Senator brings up an important and close \npoint and that is whether the phrasing in section 6, where Congress \nshall enforce and implement the article, whether a denial of \njurisdiction, a denial of all remedies would be considered to be \nenforcing and implementing. This same kind of language is in section 5 \nof the 14th amendment. I am quite familiar with this because I had an \namendment here which I passed twice in the Senate, invoked cloture \ntwice on it, to \n [[Page S2711]] limit busing under the 14th amendment, and the question \nwas addressed by the then Attorney General as to whether that \nlimitation was implementing the 14th amendment, and the decision of the \nAttorney General was not altogether satisfactory. Suffice it to say, \nthere would be a real question as to whether that would be implementing \nand enforcing if you denied all jurisdiction. But it seems to me that \nis not the important----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can take my time back, I would agree with the \nSenator that I think we could run into problems if we denied every \naccess to the courts. I am suggesting that I do not believe that will \nbe the case. I think there will be some sort of relief provided for in \nthe implementing legislation. And if we did not, I think we would have \nsome sort of constitutional question. But I am saying that is an issue \nwe should bring to the floor and discuss, but we should not do a \ncomplete ban on any kind of redress to the courts. I think it is unwise \njust from a policy perspective. But I think it does not have a place in \nthe Constitution as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield just for one statement----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Which is that under my amendment we do not prohibit the \nCongress from acting. To the contrary, we say that the court shall have \nno jurisdiction except to the extent that Congress specifically acts. \nSo we allow that. We contemplate it. We encourage it. And Congress \nought to act. On that the Senator and I agree.\n  The question is if Congress does not act, what is the inherent power \nof the Court? And we wish to make it clear that they have no inherent \npower except to the extent we give it to them.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All I would suggest is that implementing legislation \ncertainly must follow. It is a certainty that it will follow this \nlegislation, and I think we will provide, I know we will provide some \nremedies therein to provide for redress of this grievance with respect \nto the question that the Senator from Michigan brought up. It is a good \nquestion. The question is whether a citizen or someone would have \nstanding to bring here.\n  Standing is one issue. Whether they would be successful is another \nissue. Standing is the first hurdle that someone must pass.\n  With respect to that question, there is a three-part test that is \nused, that has been used for quite some time, and number one, the \ncitizen must show injury in fact. I think that is a very high hurdle, \nfor one individual to show a personal injury due to the fact that we \nhave an unbalanced budget, and in fact we have cases that are very \nclear on that: Frothingham versus Mellon, a very old Supreme Court case \nstill in effect, a 1923 case, says that allegations that amount to \ngeneralized grievance are not justiciable.\n  That to me is a pretty clear indication that you have a high burden \nupon just the first leg of this three-part test to cover.\n  No. 2, you have to show that one particular piece of legislation \ncaused the unbalancing. Well, which one caused the unbalancing? How do \nyou go about attacking that one as the one that did it? I think that \nalso raises a very difficult question.\n  And finally--and we have talked about this briefly--whether it is a \nredressable grievance. What can the Court do to solve this problem? And \nyou run into the political question doctrine and a whole lot of other \nthings about whether the Court can reach over into article I and impose \ntaxes under a balanced budget amendment. I think that is a very tall \norder, for the courts to say that they have that kind of power in that \nbranch of the Government when it is very clear that article I says that \nCongress has the power to tax and to spend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator allow a response to that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I promised the Senator from Illinois I would yield him \nsome time, so I will yield to the Senator from Illinois 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me just make a few observations. First--and I do not question the \nsincerity of my colleague from Louisiana at all on this; I know he is \nsincere--some who attack this are going to attack it no matter what. \nOne former Member of this body was attacking this because the courts \nwere going to intervene, and then we adopted the Danforth amendment, \nand he attacked it because it was toothless and it was unenforceable. \nIt is kind of a no-win situation for some of the opponents.\n  Second, in terms of a precedent for what you are talking about, court \nintervention, the only real precedent is the Jenkins case in Missouri \nwhere you are dealing with individual rights and something that is not \nreal clear. Here you are talking about an institutional situation where \nwe can precisely measure what has happened. I think on balance the risk \nis very small. And I would quote from former Attorney General Barr.\n\n       I see little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micro- management or superintendence of the \n     Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, \n     moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that courts will \n     play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, \n     that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed [vastly \n     outweighed] by the benefits of such an amendment.\n\n  We clearly have the ability to determine who has standing. Now, \nobviously--and I heard my friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, quote \nCongressman Schaefer. I differ with Congressman Schaefer in terms of \nwhat our implementing legislation should be, and I think the majority \nin the House and Senate will.\n  I think standing ought to be limited to, perhaps, 10 Senators, 30 \nHouse Members, 3 Governors--something along that line--and limited \nsolely to the Federal courts. I think we can pass something like that \nso there is not going to be, in any event, just a huge amount of \nlitigation even if you try stretching your imagination.\n  I point out, also, we can avoid all of this by building small \nsurpluses, as Alan Greenspan, Fred Bergsten, and other economists have \nrecommended that we do. If we do not have surpluses, if we have a \nsituation, with a 60 percent vote, we can have a deficit. And it takes \na 60 percent vote to add to the debt. These are very precise \nmeasurements. We are not talking about individual rights where there \nmay be strong disagreements.\n  I point out also, and my colleague from Colorado, Senator Brown, \npointed this out in committee when we had the hearing, that States have \nsomewhat similar provisions, 48 of the 50 States, in their State \nconstitutions. There has been almost no litigation on this. So the \nhistory of States suggests this will not happen. Senator Brown \nmentioned in the history of Colorado's provision, there has been no \nlitigation on this question.\n  Does that mean the courts cannot ever get involved? The answer is, if \nwe blatantly ignore the Constitution, then there is a narrow window for \nthe courts to get involved. That window, I think, should remain open. I \ndo not think we should close that window. I think it is unlikely that \nwill ever be a problem. But who knows who will be in Congress 50 years \nfrom now? Some Congress may decide we just want to ignore the \nConstitution. I cannot imagine that, but it is possible.\n  In that kind of case, the courts can intervene. But I think the \nhistory of State provisions, the provision that says the Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, makes it \nvery clear we are not going to have a massive amount of litigation.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield me some additional \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Louisiana yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have been speaking to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, particularly Senators Brown and Gorton. I \nbelieve we have an agreement as to at least what we could agree to. If \nmy colleagues on this side of the aisle would have no objection to this \nlanguage, \n [[Page S2712]] then I will propose to modify my amendment accordingly.\n  The language is a combination of language originally proposed by \nSenator Gorton back in 1982, and with the Brown suggestion about \nsection 2. It would read as follows. I am not asking at this point to \nmodify the amendment, but I would like to discuss it before I do.\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article except for \n     section 2 hereof or as may be specifically authorized in \n     implementing legislation pursuant to this section.\n\n  Section 2, my colleagues will recall, as Senator Brown talked about, \nprovides that:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  As Senator Brown pointed out, that is a powerful way to enforce the \namendment. That would be exempted from the--in other words, the court \nwould have jurisdiction under section 2, but otherwise would not have \njurisdiction--would not--the judicial power would not extend, except as \nspecifically authorized by Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana will yield for a \nquestion, a clarification, on this?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As far as I am concerned, any clarification is an \nimprovement because we now, as the Senator so eloquently pointed out, \nhave an ambiguity which is unacceptable in a provision. Whether people \nfavor the provision otherwise or oppose it otherwise, we ought to seek \nclarity in what we are doing.\n  As I understand the language the Senator has just read, it would say \nthat basically a court could enforce the section 2 limit on the debt. \nThat limit on the debt held by the public would still have to be \ndefined by Congress, since there is no existing statute that sets that \ndebt held by the public, and that is confirmed by letter from the \nAttorney General which I put in the Record.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I believe that is also in the committee report. They \nsay the debt is a creature of legislation and would be subject to that \ndefinition by Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But my question of the Senator from Louisiana is this. Is \nthe Senator saying that, in the event that the Congress did not adopt a \nlimit on the debt of the United States held by the public--and there is \nno such statutory limit now, the statutory limit now is on the debt, \nnot just the debt which is held by the public which is part of the \nnational debt--if the Congress did not set such a limit as provided for \nin section 2, that this language that the Senator just read would \nauthorize a court to legislate that limit?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. No. The court would have--the judicial power of the \nUnited States would extend to that case or controversy, however it \narose and whatever remedies the court would feel were appropriate. We \ndo not know what remedies those might be.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering though, if I could clarify this question. \nIs it the intention of this language--and I think it is important that \nlanguage be before this body for more than a few minutes so people can \nstudy it. This is a critical question. My good friend from Washington \nhas been deeply involved in this question over many, many versions of \nthe constitutional amendment and is really an expert on the subject. So \nI think this language should be before the body for more than a few \nminutes.\n  My question, however, is: Is it intended that a court could order a \nspecific limit on the debt ``held by the public,'' in the event that \nCongress did not adopt a statute defining such a publicly held----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is a limit on the debt now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the importance of the letter from the Attorney \nGeneral. With the permission of my friend from Louisiana, I would like \nto read it. It is a short letter.\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General of February 14, 1995, concerning the \n     proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. In \n     that letter you asked whether legislation setting a ``limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public'' would \n     have to be passed before Section 2 would have any force. \n     Section 2 states that any increase in the limit on such debt \n     must be passed by a three-fifths rollcall vote of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress.\n       We have consulted the Office of Management and Budget, \n     which has advised us that there is at present no statutory \n     limit on the ``debt of the United States held by the \n     public,'' the type of debt described in Section 2. Rather, \n     there is a limit on the ``public debt,'' which includes debt \n     held by the public and certain other debt, such as debt held \n     by the Social Security Trust Fund. Unless and until Congress \n     passes legislation establishing a limit on the type of debt \n     described in the amendment, the strictures against increasing \n     this debt limit would have no effect.\n\n  I cannot say it any more clearly than the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. There is no statutory limit on the ``debt of the United \nStates held by the public'' in current law. It would require a future \nCongress to establish such a new kind of debt limit, which would \nexclude debt held, for instance, by the Social Security Administration.\n  My question, then, is whether or not it is the intention of the \nframers of this new language that a court could order a Congress, or \nadopt itself, language which would define ``debt of the United States \nheld by the public,'' since there is no such debt in current law?\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This amendment has the judicial power of the United \nStates to extend to that case or controversy. I can imagine the number \nof things the court could do. The court can do what they want to \nbecause they are omnipotent. They can say that the public debt, as \npresently set by limit, was meant to be the same thing as this. But \nfrom my standpoint, if the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from \nWashington would like to redefine that term in light of this letter, \nthat would be suitable with me. But I would say that it is improbable \nthat a court would be able itself to set a limit on the public debt.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer the Senator from Louisiana has given to the \nSenator from Michigan is accurate insofar as it goes. But I think the \nmore fundamental answer to the Senator from Michigan is that this \nparticular part of the proposed revision does not change the basic \nbalanced budget amendment with respect to section 2 at all. Right now \nthe thrust of the argument of the question raised by the Senator from \nMichigan is just as valid in the present unamended form to the balanced \nbudget amendment as it would be if this modification were passed. This \nSenator, as each of the Senators knows, was greatly disturbed by this \nparticular question of judicial review 13 years ago, in 1982, and \nproposed an amendment to essentially cause these questions to be \npolitical questions at that time.\n  This Senator is very sympathetic with the direction of the amendment \nSenator Johnston has put forward and would prefer that it be phrased \nslightly differently, but, nonetheless, I feel that I do not wish to \nexpand the judicial power of the United States to writing budget for \nthe United States. When I proposed that, without the exception for \nsection 2, the Senator from Colorado and others expressed to me a deep \nconcern about a form of violation of the Constitution that I think will \nnever take place. Their comments were directed at our comments, which \nwould simply defy the plain requirements of section 2 and pass a debt \nlimit increase with 55 percent of the votes in the Senate or 55 percent \nof the votes in the House and just simply flat out ignore the \nConstitution. They wished to see to it that the courts would have \njurisdiction to prevent that blatant violation of the Constitution. I \ndo not believe that it is even remotely conceivable that would ever \nhappen.\n  The reason I sympathize with the general direction of what the \nSenator from Louisiana wants to do, what I fear is going to happen \nunder this constitutional amendment is that Congress is going to pass a \nbudget and the President is going to sign a budget, under the same \ncircumstances which happens today, that is invalid according to the \nestimates by the CBO and the like and that someone or some group will \nhave standing to go into court and say, ``No; the CBO estimates \n [[Page S2713]] are wrong. We have to get the estimates,'' and that \nsome court which desires to get into this business is going to say, \n``Yes, you are right. Your estimates are better than Congress,'' and \norder the rewriting of a budget. I do not believe anyone, I say to the \nSenator from Michigan, who was asked this question, believes we are \ngoing to get cases under section 2. But, in any event, we are not going \nto get any more cases under section 2 with this revised amendment than \nwe will get without any amendment at all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Washington yield? I thank him for \nhis clarification. As I understand it, it would be his intention as one \nof the co-authors of this language, I gather, that the Senator from \nLouisiana has described, that the jurisdiction is referred to the \ncourt, pursuant to section 2, to enforce the 60-vote requirement in \nthat amendment, not to define words that a legislature or Congress \nwould ordinarily be required to define.\n  Mr. GORTON. Clearly, any controversy arising under section 2 would in \nfact be justiciable under the modification of the draft working with \nthe Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Louisiana. But the point \nis that it is true with the original balanced budget amendment, we are \nnot changing that by proposing this. This modification, just as Senator \nJohnston's original amendment limits the jurisdiction of the courts of \nthe United States, modifies it in this fashion. It does not do it quite \nas much because it does not limit it with respect to section 2. It just \nlimits with respect to the other section, but nothing, in my view, \ngiven the Supreme Court, by this modification that is not there in the \npresent form of the balanced budget amendment that we have been \ndebating for 3 weeks.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Technically the Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I agree with the Senator from Washington. Moreover, \nthere is a legislative limit today on the debt of the United States. So \nCongress must act, plus act every year to increase the debt. They may \nact to increase the debt as defined by statute now. But, if you can do \nthat, chances are you will be able to do it to increase it pursuant to \nthe terms of this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. As I understand, that was in the letter from the \nAttorney General. I must say it sounds like chopped logic to me. We \nhave a statute under the deficit now which uses words slightly \ndifferent from those of section 2 in House Joint Resolution 1.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is slightly different. If the Senator will yield, the \nquestion is whether or not to include debt held by the Social Security \nAdministration. That is not a slight difference.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am convinced that the simplest of all implementing \nlegislation for this kind of constitutional amendment, should it become \npart of the Constitution, will define the debt in a way which is \ntotally consistent with section 2. So as a practical matter, I do not \nthink such a case of controversy will ever arise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could ask the Senator from Louisiana this \nquestion, the same question, now that we have the letter from the \nAttorney General. It is the intent, as I understand it, that under the \nlanguages which you read that the court could enforce the requirement \nof 60 votes, and that is the principal purpose of the language.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not mean to be evasive. I am just saying that the \njudicial power of the United States would extend to cases and \ncontroversies arising under section 2. The court can do what it thinks \nis proper, if it finds standing, if it finds there is a justiciable \nquestion and it extends to such powers as the court thinks are proper.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Since what the Senator from Louisiana has read is in the \nhandwriting of the Senator from Washington, the answer of the Senator \nfrom Washington to the Senator from Michigan is yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  If no other Senator is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of \na quorum and ask unanimous consent that it be equally divided.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will withhold, I will address a question \nto the Senator from Washington. It has to do with the purpose of this \nlanguage which I have heard and have not had a chance to read. As I \nunderstand it, this would deprive the courts of jurisdiction except \nwith regard to section 2.\n  Mr. GORTON. The amendment that is before the body now, the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana, does not deprive the court of \njurisdiction. The court has no jurisdiction at the present time on a \nconstitutional amendment. It says, in essence, that the court will not \nhave jurisdiction over cases arising out of the balanced budget \namendment, except with respect to its enabling legislation. That is the \nproposal of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  While this modification has some slight language differences from his \noriginal point, its only substantive change in the proposal before the \nbody right now is to allow the court to deal with cases and \ncontroversies arising under section 2. The purpose of it, I may say--\nsince while I was the draftsman, I am not the person who thought it \nup--the purpose of it was to deal with the sincere concerns of the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Brown, that Congress, without such \njurisdiction, literally could define the plain language of section 2 \nand pass a debt limit increase by less than a 60-percent supermajority \nvote.\n  As I have said, I cannot conceive of Members of Congress so blatantly \nviolating their oaths of office under such circumstances. As a \nconsequence, I was perfectly willing to go along with the Senator from \nColorado because I do not think any such case or controversy will ever \narise. But the purpose is to carve out from the general exemption--\nwhich is Senator Johnston's amendment--section 2.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. So while there is an exemption under the Senator's \namendment with regard to enabling legislation, this exemption would \napply to part of the language of the constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, plus enabling legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, and that is section 2. Does the Senator consider \nthat if such amended language was agreed to, that might obviate the \nargument that the courts did not have jurisdiction with regard to \nsection 2? In other words, as I heard the debate here a short time ago, \nI think very strong arguments were made with regard to the amendment \nitself, the totality of the amendment, that there were serious \nquestions with regard to the justiciable issue regarding political \nquestions and all of that, with regard to the amendment in totality, \nincluding section 2.\n  I wonder whether or not, if such language were agreed to, this would \nbe an open invitation to the courts that in fact we are inviting you to \ntake on anything that could be a part of section 2 and might in fact go \nagainst the intent of the proponents of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana?\n  Mr. GORTON. I say to the Senator from Tennessee that he is a shrewd \nreader of legislative constitutional language, because I think in this \ncase he is precisely correct. The paradox, in my opinion, this year, \nlast year, and in 1982, when we debated this subject, is that those who \nhave opposed adding this kind of judicial review section to a balanced \nbudget amendment have made two totally inconsistent, opposite arguments \nagainst including such a section. One is that the courts would never \ntake cases or controversies under this. They do not have any such \njurisdiction, and they would not exercise any such jurisdiction. The \nother argument is that we certainly want the courts to enforce it if \nCongress violates these constitutional provisions.\n  I did not understand those arguments in 1982; I did not understand \nthem in 1986; I did not understand them last year; and I do not \nunderstand them now. I think those who oppose adding something like the \nJohnston amendment at least ought to pick one side of that argument or \nthe other. If their sole reason for not wishing to add something like \nthe Johnston amendment is that it is unnecessary because the courts \nwill never, under any circumstances, deal with a case or controversy \narising under the balanced \n [[Page S2714]] budget amendment, then under those circumstances, we \nhave actually created a cause of action by this particular modification \nwith respect to section 2. I think that is the utter logical \nconclusion.\n  My own view on the subject is that the fundamental argument is \nflawed. I am convinced that the courts would in fact exercise \njurisdiction under cases or controversies arising under this entire \namendment. There is no way in the world we can guarantee that the \nSupreme Court next year, much less 100 years from now, is not going to \ndecide it wants to write a budget and override our estimate.\n  My deep concern is not a case or controversy that is going to arise \nunder section 2 as to whether we have invalidly increased the debt \nlimit, or many other sections here; I believe that the history of the \nFederal courts of the United States clearly indicates that we will be \nfaced very soon--maybe in the first budget that passes after this \nconstitutional amendment becomes a part of the Constitution--with a \nCongress and a President who have passed what they consider to be a \nbalanced budget, using Congressional Budget Office estimates of \nrevenues, for example, and Joint Tax Committee estimates of receipts, \nand that some individual withstanding will sue and say the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates are off, they are phony, this is \nCongress' own creation, they have fixed the figures, and we think there \nis a much better estimate of expenditures and those expenditures are a \nlot higher than the Congressional Budget Office has said and we, \ntherefore, order the Congress either to use our estimates, the \nestimates of the court, to rewrite the budget, or we will impose a 5-\npercent surcharge on the income tax this year to bring it into balance.\n  It is that kind of judicial activism, in my opinion, which has \nplagued the United States in many respects for the last 50 years, with \ncourts running prisons and school systems and shelters for the homeless \nand the like, and acting in a legislative fashion. And for anybody, \nparticularly somebody conservative, to state with assurance that the \ncourts will not involve themselves in this field I just think is a \nfaulty argument.\n  If the argument, on the other hand, is the courts ought to be in this \nfield, I can see someone arguing that they like judicial activism and \nwant courts involved in this field. I just disagree with them. If I \nthought the courts were going to be in this field, I would not want \nanything to do with the balanced budget amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor and a very, very strong supporter. Under those cases, they \nwould probably rather have it in section 2 than not to have it at all. \nPersonally, I would prefer we not have it at all. Personally, I also \nwant to get something accomplished here, and I do not think this \nexception for section 2, in my view, is ever going to come up at all.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer to the question of the Senator from Tennessee \nis that he is absolutely right. It settles that first argument with \nrespect to section 2 and makes it invalid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls the time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I wonder if the Senator would not agree with me that \nsection 2 involves, really, a yes or no proposition--that is, that the \nlimit on the debt of the U.S. public shall not be increased except by a \nthree-fifths vote. It is subject only really to a yes or no \nproposition. That is, you either had the three-fifths or you did not \nhave it. It does not get into all the fiscal questions that might flow \nfrom that; rather, it is a yes or no proposition.\n  So I wonder if the Senator from Washington does not agree that really \nabout all the court could do on that is say, yes or no, you did or you \ndid not, and if you did not, it is not valid and the President could \nnot sign it anyway if it violates the Constitution.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is certainly the thrust of what the Senator from \nColorado was himself concerned with.\n  Again, it is very important, as the Senator from Michigan said, when \nwe deal with the Constitution that we be as clear as we possibly can in \nwhat we say. And it is certainly possible, in the absence of any \nstatute on this subject, that a case or controversy could arise under \nother provisions in section 2. But, as I said, the first thing we will \ndo will be to make the slight definitional changes that are necessary \nto use the phrase in this Constitution and the debt limit legislation \nwhich we have at the present time.\n  So, as a practical matter, I think the only time the question would \never come up is the way the Senator from Louisiana states it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I share the concern of both the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and the Senator from Washington concerning judicial \nactivism. As the Senator from Washington puts it, on one hand, he is \nconcerned about it, and, on the other, he is concerned about the notion \nthat the courts should indeed be involved.\n  I think there is probably a middle ground here that many people are \nstruggling with. I think a very good case can be made for the \nproposition that, indeed, it is unlikely--I am talking about under the \noriginal amendment--that it is unlikely that the court would involve \nitself in the detailed budgeting process of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Now, can anybody say that will not happen with certainty? Absolutely \nnot. We all know that it can happen. It is a possibility.\n  The question is: What is the likelihood? It has never been done \nbefore. You look at what has happened on the State level. You look at \nwhat has happened on the Federal level.\n  I remember the lawsuit against President Nixon back in 1974. The \ncourt dealt with a little different situation there, but they were \ndealing with the powers of the executive branch. If you read that case, \nyou will see how reluctant the Supreme Court is to get into the \noperations of and put limitations on the power of the other branches of \nGovernment.\n  That case came down requiring the President to give up his tapes, but \nin doing so really they raised the threshold very substantially as far \nas any future similar actions against a President. You had to have \neyewitnesses in that case, eyewitnesses, in effect, saying the \nPresident was involved in criminal activity or very possibly could have \nbeen. So they decided against the President in that case. But by their \nlanguage, they were struggling mightily with it and it had to be very \nfact specific and it had to be an egregious case by that language for \nthem to step into the affairs of the President of the United States.\n  I think in all probability that is the way it will be with Congress. \nMy own guess is--and I assume that is all we can acknowledge, that is \nbasically all we are doing here--my own guess is that, absent some \negregious case that the Senator from Washington says he does not think \nwill ever happen, and I agree, but absent some very egregious case \nwhere the Congress of the United States just blatantly and openly \ndisregards the Constitution, I do not think the Supreme Court would \ninvolve itself, even the Supreme Court as we know it today, which too \noften gets into too many things, as we all know.\n  I think many of us simply share the concern that if there is no \nenforcing mechanism at all, if there is no possibility, if we foreclose \nany possibility under any circumstances that the court cannot decide \nthis, that a future Congress would use that and circumvent the intent \nof the balanced budget amendment.\n  So it gets back to how badly do you think our fiscal crisis is; how \nbadly do we need this balanced budget amendment? And I think pretty \nbadly.\n  We have heard the debate here for many, many days. We are headed down \nthe wrong road at breakneck speed. We are bankrupting the next \ngeneration by any objective standard. By any bipartisan analysis that \nhas been made of it, we are in serious, serious circumstances here and \nwe are kind of fiddling around here while Rome is burning and missing \nthe central point that we better keep in mind, and that is we better \nget our fiscal house in order.\n  The balanced budget amendment, without being cluttered with a lot of \ncontroversial amendments designed \n [[Page S2715]] primarily by some to kill it and not to improve the \namendment so that they could support it, instead of doing that, we \nought to refocus and pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  I intend at this stage of the game to say, let us pass it without \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 272, as Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we have had this discussion.\n  At this point, I wish to modify my amendment by inserting, in lieu of \nthe present language, the following language, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right, and the amendment \nis so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       At the end of Section 6, add the following: ``The judicial \n     power of the United States shall not extend to any case or \n     controversy arising under this article except for section 2 \n     hereof, or as may be specifically authorized in implementing \n     legislation pursuant to this section.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for two additional questions?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One of the questions I think it would be valuable for us \nto perk a bit so that others, including members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, could look at the language is a very important change--\nagain, whether you favor or oppose the amendment on other grounds, it \nis important that we clarify the amendment, and the Senator from \nLouisiana has done very, very important work in achieving this \nclarification. I would like to pursue it because there is still some \nambiguity.\n  I have two questions. One is the judicial power of the United States \nrefers to Federal courts. State courts also implement the Constitution \nand enforce the Constitution. I am wondering whether or not it is the \nintention of this language that State as well as Federal courts would \nbe prohibited from enforcing this provision except as specifically \nauthorized in implementation legislation? Is that the intent of the \nauthors of this language?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is not the intent of this language to give State \ncourts the power. I do not believe they would have the power to order a \ntax increase or give a declaratory judgment or cut a Federal program. I \nbelieve that that judicial power adheres only in the United States.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have to say to the Senator from Michigan, the \nConstitution of the United States, as it is presently formulated, or \nformulated here, makes no statements with respect to the jurisdiction \nof State courts. In a very real sense, State courts interpret the \nConstitution, but State courts cannot order the Congress of the United \nStates to do anything. They have no such jurisdiction.\n  So, just as is in the rest of the Constitution, the balanced budget \namendment and the debt limit legislation are silent as to the \njurisdiction of State courts, which is exactly what they are ought to \nbe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand it, however, it is the intent of the \nSenator from Louisiana that, to the extent that this gives any \nauthority at all under section 2 or otherwise, that section 2 authority \nexclusively goes to the Federal courts.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. The phrase in the Constitution, of course, is the \njudicial power of the United States. That is the Federal Government.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question is, the language here as it authorizes section \n2 implementation refers only to Federal courts.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The other question relates to a question I have asked the \nsponsors of the legislation. I sent them a whole list of questions as \nto the enforcement provisions under section 6, because it raises a \nwhole question as to whether or not there is an enforcement mechanism \nfor this constitutional amendment or whether or not it is just a \nstatement of intent and then has no teeth in it. But that is a \ndifferent issue for a different argument.\n  My question, though, is this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Could we answer the questions on the other side's time, \nbecause I think we are about to run out?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Washington yield for this question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana controls the time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Washington ask for a minute or two \nof time in order to respond to the question of the Senator from \nMichigan?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator does not have time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, we \nhave a limited amount of time remaining, and we have speakers that we \nhave to accommodate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the questions \nwhich I forwarded to the Senators from Utah and Illinois, including \nsection 17 be inserted in the Record and specifically any response to \nsection 17 that is obtained today be inserted in the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Balanced Budget Amendment Questions\n\n       1. What exactly is the definition of receipts? For example, \n     do receipts include the receipts from Postal Service stamp \n     sales and TVA power sales? Do they include Medicare premium \n     payments? Do they include the receipts of government \n     corporations and quasi-federal agencies which deposit money \n     in non-Treasury accounts? Who will make this determination?\n       2. What exactly is the definition of outlays? For example, \n     do outlays include federal loans and federally-guaranteed \n     loans? Do they include spending by government corporations \n     and quasi-federal agencies which pay for their activities out \n     of user fees instead of out of Treasury accounts? Who will \n     make this determination?\n       3. Will estimates or actual levels be used for receipts and \n     outlays? In an instance in which the OMB and the CBO disagree \n     with each other on what outlays or receipts are, how will the \n     dispute be resolved so that it can be determined whether or \n     not outlays exceed receipts?\n       4. Who will determine whether a bill is `a bill to increase \n     revenues?' For example, what happens if OMB says the bill is \n     revenue neutral, and CBO says the bill will result in a net \n     increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? How will \n     the dispute be resolved?\n       5. At what point will it be determined that outlays will in \n     fact exceed receipts, triggering remedial action? August 1? \n     September 15? Who will make that determination--OMB or CBO?\n       6. At whatever point it is determined that outlays do or \n     will exceed receipts, will automatic spending cuts or tax \n     increases be triggered? When would that happen, and who would \n     be responsible for making it happen? Will cuts affect all \n     programs equally across-the-board, or will certain programs \n     be exempt?\n       7. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a budget \n     resolution that is not balanced?\n       8. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     increase spending from some base level without off-setting \n     spending cuts or revenue increases? would it matter whether \n     this was the last appropriations bill of the year, and would \n     result total appropriations exceeding expected receipts? If \n     not, how will we ensure that Congress does not increase \n     spending without paying for it?\n       9. Would it violate the language of the amendment if \n     Congress passes, with less than 60% of the votes, a bill to \n     cut taxes without off-setting spending cuts or revenue \n     increases? If not, how will we ensure that Congress does not \n     cut taxes without paying for it?\n       10. What happens if Congress passes a budget resolution \n     which is in balance, and enacts appropriations bills on the \n     basis of that resolution, but part way through the year it \n     appears that outlays will exceed receipts? Would Congress be \n     required to vote separately on whether to authorize or \n     eliminate the excess, even though it voted for budget and \n     appropriation bills in the belief that the budget would be \n     balanced? What mechanism would be created to ensure that such \n     a bill would be considered?\n       11. At what point during the fiscal year would Congress be \n     required to vote to authorize an excess of outlays or to \n     eliminate that excess? What would happen if Congress did not \n     approve either such measure?\n       12. Would the amendment be enforced through sequestration \n     or impoundment? If so, when and how would that action take \n     place?\n       [[Page S2716]] 13. What happens if Congress approves a \n     specific excess of outlays over receipts by the required \n     three-fifths vote of each House, but the projection turns out \n     to be wrong--the deficit is greater than expected. Would a \n     second vote be required to approve the revised estimate of \n     the deficit? Who determines the dollar amount of excess that \n     Congress will vote on in each case? Who determines that the \n     estimated excess was wrong? How often would such \n     determinations be made, and such votes be required? Who \n     determines when the votes must take place?\n       14. The resolution requires that three-fifths of each House \n     vote to approve an excess ``by law''. Does this mean that the \n     President must sign a bill to approve an excess? What happens \n     if three-fifths of the Members of each House approve a \n     deficit, but the President vetoes the bill? On the other \n     hand, what happens if Congress passes a reconciliation bill \n     to balance the budget and the President vetoes it and there \n     are insufficient votes to override the veto? For example, \n     what if Congress votes to increase taxes to eliminate the \n     deficit and the President says he prefers spending cuts and \n     vetoes the bill. If there are insufficient votes to override \n     the veto, who has violated the Constitution--the Congress or \n     the President?\n       15. Could Congress shift receipts or outlays from one year \n     to another to meet balanced budget requirements? For example, \n     could paydays for government employees be put off a few days \n     into the next fiscal year to achieve a balance between \n     receipts and outlays? What mechanisms will prevent this type \n     of abuse?\n       16. Section 2 of the resolution provides that ``the limit \n     on the debt of the United States held by the public shall not \n     be increased'' without a three-fifths vote. What is the \n     current statutory ``limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public'', if any? If there is currently no such \n     limit, how will such a limit be established?\n       17. What does the debt of the United States held by the \n     public include? Specifically, does it include the debt of \n     wholly-owned government corporations (like the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation and the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation)? Does it include the debt of mixed-ownership \n     government corporations (like Amtrak and the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation)? Does it include loans guaranteed by \n     the federal government, such as guaranteed student loans, \n     guaranteed agriculture and export loans, or Mexican loan \n     guarantees? If not, could additional government corporations \n     and quasi-governmental agencies be created to conduct federal \n     programs off-budget to evade the amendment? Could new \n     government guaranteed lending programs replace government \n     spending? How would this be prevented?\n       18. May the President transmit a proposed budget which is \n     not in balance in addition to his balanced budget proposal? \n     May the President transmit a balanced budget, but recommends \n     against its adoption? Can he submit the balanced budget at \n     any time before the fiscal year begins?\n       19. The Committee report states that the words ``bill to \n     increase revenue'' covers ``those measures whose intended and \n     anticipated effect will be to increase revenues to the \n     Federal Government.'' Does this mean net revenue? Over what \n     period of time would this be judged?\n       Would the revenue provision apply to a bill that increases \n     revenues for three years and reduces revenues for the \n     following three years, with a net change of zero over the \n     six-year period? What happens if the amendment is repealed \n     after three years, because it would result in a deficit?\n       Would a bill to increase the capital gains tax be exempt, \n     since many argue would have the effect of reducing revenue in \n     at least the early years after enactment?\n       20. Does ``revenue'' include fees? How do we tell the \n     difference between a revenue measure increasing fees and a \n     spending measure decreasing outlays by requiring users to pay \n     for services provided to them instead of funding the services \n     out of tax revenues?\n       What about a bill to raise the federal share of receipts \n     from concessions in our national parks?\n       What if the bill simply required regular competition for \n     national park concessions? Would that be a bill to increase \n     revenue, since it would have the ``intended and anticipated \n     effect'' of increasing the federal share?\n       21. Does revenue include tariffs? Would a trade measure \n     which authorizes use of retaliatory tariffs in certain cases \n     be considered a ``revenue measure'', since it would arguably \n     have the ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing \n     revenues? Who will make this determination?\n       22. Does revenue include civil and criminal penalties? \n     Would a bill that establishes a new civil or criminal penalty \n     be considered a ``revenue'' measure? How about a bill that \n     indexes certain penalties for inflation? How about a measure \n     to toughen enforcement of criminal or civil penalties? Would \n     a bill to tighten enforcement of the tax laws or provide more \n     personnel to the IRS be covered, since it would have the \n     ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing revenues? \n     Who will decide what is covered by this provision?\n       23. Would a statute that requires a new, lower measure for \n     inflation, be considered a bill to increase revenue, since by \n     slowing the adjustment of tax brackets it would have the \n     ``intended and anticipated effect'' of increasing taxes? \n     Would the elimination of a special, targeted tax break be \n     covered by this provision? Would it cover a bill authorizing \n     the sale of buildings or land?\n       24. Sponsors of the amendment have said that the social \n     security trust funds will be protected in implementing \n     legislation and that the budget will not be balanced at the \n     expense of the States. How will this result be ensured?\n       25. The term ``fiscal year'' is not defined in the \n     amendment. The report indicates that Congress has the power \n     to define the term ``fiscal year.'' Does this mean that \n     Congress could change the effective date of the amendment by \n     legislation, passed by majority vote, which changes the \n     statutory time at which a fiscal year begins and ends?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a comment about the \npractical effect that the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana will \nhave on the process once the balanced budget amendment passes.\n  I think this may be the serious constitutional infirmities that this \namendment could have, and when I say ``constitutional infirmities,'' \nwhat I believe the Senator's amendment will do is, by denying access, \nby denying access to the courts in this constitutional amendment, in a \nsense what we are doing is modifying the fifth amendment due process \nclause. You are saying we have no redress to this act--none--until \nCongress acts.\n  Now, I think the practical effect of that will be--and I think we are \nseeing within this body a lot of support for the courts keeping hands \noff, not reaching in--so what may happen, what I think there is high \nprobability of happening, is we will leave that alone. We, in fact, \nwill not implement. We will not provide. There is no requirement for \nMembers to do so. There is no reason for the Senate now to provide \naccess when, in fact, we have stated constitutionally they have no \naccess.\n  On the other side, if we do not have the Johnston amendment in place, \nit is incumbent upon Members to act because I think the Senator is \nright, we have left a big open question here. Now, it is our duty to \ndefine what avenues the court will have to address this constitutional \namendment.\n  I think what we have done here is take the Congress off the hook of \nhaving to come back, look at this question, debate it, find out \nspecifically what areas we are going to deal with or provide for the \ncitizenry, for Members of Congress, to address this issue in the \ncourts.\n  By this amendment we will, in fact, foreclose that discussion. I \nbelieve that discussion will not occur, or if it does occur, will not \nprevail, that we will feel most comfortable leaving the courts \ncompletely out of it. It has been passed in the constitutional \namendment. There will be no reason for Members to come here because we \nhave taken care of this issue.\n  If we leave it open, the issue will arise again. And I believe the \nSenator is absolutely right. There is such a question here. We will be \ndriven to provide specifically for that kind of redress in the court.\n  I think not only do we have a limitation of the due process clause of \nthe 5th amendment as a result of the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana, which I think is a red flag, No. 1. No. 2, we have in a \nsense decided this issue now maybe for a long period of time and \neliminated any prospect of judicial review for this legislation.\n  I do not think we are prepared to do that. I think we are prepared, \nat least what I hope most Members are prepared to do, is say, ``Let's \nleave this question open for us to go and then provide specific \nredresses in the implementing legislation to deal with this question. \nLet's be precise about it. Let's be limited about it but have a full \nand open discussion about it, not foreclose and slam the door for any \npossibilities of judicial overview,'' whatever limited amount it may \nbe.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Very briefly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What appropriate role would the Senator think the \ncourts ought to have?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think that is a discussion that we \nneed to have. I think that is a discussion that has to be talked about \nfar beyond the few hours of debate we have here on the Senate floor. We \nneed to look at whether we should limit it to declaratory judgment or \nwhether we should grant injunctive relief. All those kind of avenues. \nWho should we give standing to move these suits forward. All of those \ndiscussions, the particulars, need \n [[Page S2717]] to be dealt with in the implementing legislation.\n  If we pass the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana, I do not \nbelieve we will get there. I do not believe we get there because we \nhave already settled the issue and the courts do not have a role.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We say the courts do have a role to the extent we \nspecify.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But there is no incentive as a result of your amendment \nto specify. We have now kept them out of our affairs. There is no \nreason for Members to come back and give them access, where, if we did \nnot pass the amendment, it would be a broad open question as to what \nextent they could get involved.\n  It could be incumbent upon the Senate to protect our own viability as \na body, for the Senate to specifically chart out where they would. I \nthink any kind of implementing legislation--I think the Senator from \nWisconsin was right on this. If we, through implementing legislation, \nsaid they have no access, I think we would have constitutional problems \nwith that. We would have to provide some sort of limited access for \nsuit. Your amendment does not do that.\n  I think you run into very severe limitation on the due process \nclause. We are telling every citizen of this country that you cannot \nredress your Government through a constitutional amendment. I think \nthat is a real problem. I think that is one of the reasons I would be \nopposed to it.\n  The second is, I think it forecloses any future discussion on this \nmatter. I would be happy at this point to yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the hullabaloo is about the \nmodification of the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana applying \nonly to section 2, because the claim is the budgetary language is \ndifferent from the constitutional amendment language.\n  To me, that is such a trivialization of the debate that it is not \nfunny. If we have 67 people who will pass this amendment, we are \ncertainly going to have 51 votes to change any budgetary language we \nhave to in the implementing legislation.\n  Why should we get into a big scholastic--and by ``scholastic,'' we \nwill call it scholasticism -- how-many-angels-stand- on-head-of-a-pin \nargument in the debate over the constitutional amendment over that \nissue?\n  Now, if Members of Congress believe that the issue of standing and \nthe separation of powers and political question are not well defined by \nthe courts and well defined by better than a century of law on this \nsubject, then I can see where they might want to support the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana and his amendment here.\n  The law is so well defined and it is so clear in those areas. I think \nwe made the case earlier in the day that it is clear that I do not need \nto repeat it again at this particular point. I am hoping all Senators \nwill vote against this amendment. It is a mischievous amendment. It is \noffered to try to scuttle the balanced budget amendment, knowing that \nthere can always be made some argument about any term in any balanced \nbudget amendment or any amendment to the Constitution that others might \nagree or disagree on.\n  What we are talking about here is an amendment passed by 300 Members \nof the House of Representatives, the two-thirds-plus vote, for the \nfirst time in history. In my opinion, we simply cannot amend it further \nbecause of that historic vote and the fact that it is a bipartisan \nconsensus amendment by Democrats and Republicans that will work. These \nfrightful occurrences are not going to occur and everybody knows it.\n  The whole purpose of this amendment is, of course, to try to amend \nthis constitutional amendment which puts Members through the whole \nprocess again. Now the original amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana said, ``No court shall have the power to issue relief \npursuant to any case or controversy arising out of this article except \nas may be specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \nto this section.''\n  The modification, as I understand it, would add on to section 6 the \nfollowing:\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising out of this article except \n     for section 2 hereof, or as may be specifically authorized in \n     implementing legislation pursuant to this section.\n\n  We do not need to have litigation for section 2. We do not need to \nhave litigation for any aspect of it. I think under the rules of law \nthat have existed for well upward of a century, this is a false issue, \nand we should vote to table this particular amendment. I hope our \nSenators will do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am indebted to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] and the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] for helping work out this modification which I \nthink achieves very well the purposes that most Senators want to \nachieve on this floor, which is to ensure that the real biting \nenforcement and sanction of section 2 is preserved in this amendment so \nthat, as the Senator from Colorado said, section 2 is the real guts of \nthe enforcement and that remains here with the power of the court to \nenforce it.\n  But other than that, Mr. President, this amendment will provide that \nthe courts may not raise taxes and may not substitute their judgment \nfor that of the U.S. Congress.\n  It is to me an amazing circularity of logic that the opponents of the \namendment as modified have. They say, on the one hand, this is \nabsolutely clear, we know there is no standing to sue, we know there is \nno justiciable question; this is a political question which the courts \ncannot get into. But, on the other hand, there may be some cases where \nsome people will need to go to court and enforce this. But, on the \nother hand, it is absolutely clear. But, on the other hand, if we pass \nthis amendment, the Congress will never act because then it will be \nclear.\n  Well, Mr. President, it either is clear or it is not clear, and we \nknow what the real answer to that question is: It is intentionally \nambiguous, and in that ambiguity, we have mischief, because while what \nJudge Bork says is thousands of cases matriculating up through the \ndistrict courts and the courts of appeal of this country, while we are \nwaiting for those to be decided, the capital markets of this country, \nthe bond markets, the very fiscal essence of the country will be held \nin limbo while the court decides such arcane questions as whether this \nis a political question, whether there is standing to sue, or whether \nit is a justiciable issue.\n  We have the power to decide that issue now, to make it clear and \nunambiguous, which is, the courts do not have authority, except to the \nextent we give them authority.\n  Mr. President, we have between now and 2002--2002--to act to \nimplement this article. Section 6 says:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  If this Senate and this Congress can pass a constitutional amendment \nby a two-thirds vote, by 67 votes, surely it could pass simple \nimplementing legislation which requires only a simple majority. Why \nwould Congress ignore section 6, ignore its duty when it takes only a \nmajority vote, when we feel so strongly today that we are giving a two-\nthirds vote to the constitutional amendment? It does not make sense, \nand it does not add up.\n  If any Member believes, as I believe, that what the courts would \nreally do if they took jurisdiction is order a tax increase and then \nmaybe say, ``Congress, this will go into effect 60 days from now or 4 \nmonths from now unless you act''--I think that is what they would do \nbecause that is the only thing they have expertise to do. They do not \nhave the expertise to cut budgets, to decide between competing claims \nin a budget, but they sure do know how to order an income tax increase, \nbecause it takes no expertise. This amendment would prevent that; it \nwould deprive the courts of the ability to meddle in this \nconstitutional duty, which is properly the Congress', except to the \nextent that we authorize them to do so.\n  Mr. President, it clears up an intentional ambiguity. It loses no \nvotes. I believe this gets votes for this amendment, and it certainly \nmakes a better \n [[Page S2718]] amendment. I hope my colleagues will go along with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would be interested in whether it will \nget the vote of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana if this \namendment passes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I can tell the Senator from Utah what my \nconcern is about this amendment. There was a Treasury study which \nshowed that my State was more heavily impacted than any other State. It \nmade certain assumptions. It made the assumptions that defense would \nnot be cut, as the contract calls for; that Social Security would not \nbe cut, as everyone promised. It was a nationwide study, and it \ndetermined, as I recall, the cuts to Louisiana were something like $3 \nto $4 billion.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask the Senator to comment on his time?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Until I know what makes up the cuts, I cannot vote for \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have been through that argument already, \nand that is, we have never been able to tell where the cuts are up to \nnow. Until we get this into the Constitution, we never will. That is \nwhy we have to get it in the Constitution.\n  This is a bigger issue than any of our individual States. All of us \nare concerned about our States, all of us are concerned about what cuts \nor tax increases, but all of us need to be concerned about the future \nof this Nation, the future of our children and our grandchildren.\n  We have a Federal Government that is running away from us; it is out \nof control. We can debate these things forever. But under the Johnston \namendment, allowing suits under section 2 may allow the courts to relax \nthe standing rules that they have. It would be the exact opposite of \nwhat everybody in this body would like to see happen. It would be an \nindication to them we want them to relax standing rules. Presently, \ncourts will not allow standing to give relief that interferes with \nbudgetary processes, and I do not know anybody who would rebut that \nstatement.\n  Ironically, the Johnston amendment may allow the very thing he fears. \nI frankly do not know why anybody would want to vote for it who \nunderstands the implications of it, but let me just summarize our \nposition on this.\n  Senator Johnston's amendment would deny all judicial review to \nenforce the balanced budget amendment, except for section 2 which may \ngive an indication to the courts that they should relax the standing \nrequirements which means even more litigation all over this society, \nmore than ever before, and there would be no way you could stop it.\n  I believe it is an overreaction to a problem that simply does not \nexist, and to apply what happens in States--and there have not been \nmany suits in States--to apply that to this just is inapposite.\n  The ghost that haunts opponents of the balanced budget amendment is \nthat the judiciary will usurp Congress' power delegated to it by the \nConstitution over spending, borrowing, and taxing matters.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would----\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not have enough time or I would yield.\n  That horrible phantom will place the budgetary process under judicial \nreceivership, through its equitable powers, cut spending programs, and \neven order the raising of taxes, they say. But the apparition is simply \nmake believe; it is a bad dream. The courts simply do not have the \nauthority to usurp Congress' role in the budgetary process.\n  That unfounded phobia has its antidote in the time-honored precept of \nstanding and the political question and separation of powers doctrines. \nAs I said, these jurisprudential doctrines stand as impenetrable \nbarriers to the courts commandeering of the democratic process.\n  Besides, it is just wrong to think that Congress cannot and will not \nprotect its institutional prerogatives. The framers of the Constitution \ndesigned a constitutional system whereby each branch of government \nwould have the power to check the zeal of the other branches. In James \nMadison's words in the Federalist No. 51:\n\n       [T]he great security against a gradual concentration of the \n     several powers in the same department, consists in giving to \n     those who administer each department, the necessary \n     constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist \n     encroachments of others. The provision for defence must in \n     this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the \n     danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract \n     ambition.\n\n  Frankly, I find it utterly inconceivable, as a practical matter, that \nthe chairmen of congressional Appropriations, Budget, and Finance \nCommittees and subcommittees, and Congress as a whole, will stand idly \nby if some district court judge somewhere exceeds his or her authority \nand allows a case implicating this institution's budget and tax and \nspending prerogatives to proceed. Why, it defies belief that these \nSenators like Mark Hatfield, Robert Byrd, Pete Domenici, Jim Exon, and \nleaders like Robert Dole and Tom Daschle, and their counterparts in the \nother body, or any of us, would allow a court to tamper with \ncongressional prerogatives. Congress would do what it would have to do \nand moot any such case which even hinted at success. Does anyone doubt \nthis?\n  Moreover, to resist the ambition of the courts, the framers gave to \nCongress in article III of the Constitution the authority to limit the \njurisdiction of the courts and the type of remedies the courts may \nrender. If Congress truly fears certain courts may decide to ignore law \nand precedent, Congress--if it finds it necessary--may, through \nimplementing legislation pursuant to section 6 of House Joint \nResolution 1, forbid courts the use of their injunctive powers \naltogether. Or, Congress could create an exclusive cause of action or \ntribunal with carefully limited powers, satisfactory to Congress, to \ndeal with balanced budget complaints.\n  But Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nproposes, cutoff all judicial review. I believe that House Joint \nResolution 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial review. By \nremaining silent about judicial review in the amendment itself, its \nauthors have refused to establish congressional sanction for the \nFederal courts to involve themselves in fundamental macroeconomic and \nbudgetary questions. At the same time, this balanced budget amendment \ndoes not undermine the court's equally fundamental obligation, as first \nstated in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), to ``say what \nthe law is'' in those cases where standing exists and the separation of \npowers and political question doctrines do not bar the courts from \nproceeding. After all, while I am confident that courts will not be \nable to interfere with our budgetary prerogatives, I am frank to say I \ncannot predict every conceivable lawsuit which might arise under this \namendment, and which does not implicate these budgetary prerogatives. A \nlitigant, in such narrow circumstances, if he or she can demonstrate \nstanding, ought to be able to have their case heard.\n\n\n                          judicial enforcement\n\n  Nonetheless, I must underscore that keeping open the courthouse door \nto a litigant who is not seeking to interfere with the spending and \ntaxing powers of\n Congress, does not license the judiciary to interfere with budgetary \ndecisions. Because this issue is of great importance to my colleagues, \nI would like at some length to address the concern of some that under \nthe balanced budget amendment courts will become superlegislatures. \nIndeed, opponents march out a veritable judicial parade of horribles \nwhere courts strike down spending measures, put the budgetary process \nunder judicial receivership, and like Charles I of England, raise taxes \nwithout the consent of the people's representatives. All of this is a \n  gross exaggeration. This parade has no permit.I whole-heartedly agree \nwith former Attorney General William P. Barr who stated that if House \nJoint Resolution 1 is ratified there is ``little risk that the \namendment will become the basis for judicial micromanagement or \nsuperintendence of the federal budget process. Furthermore, to the \nextent such judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \nCongress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, moreover, \nwhatever remote risk there may be that courts will play an overly \nintrusive role in enforcing the amendment, that risk is, in my opinion, \nvastly outweighed by the benefits of such an amendment.''\n [[Page S2719]] standing, separation of powers, and political questions\n\n  There exists three basic constraints which prevent the courts from \ninterfering in the budgetary process: First, limitations on Federal \ncourts contained in article III of the Constitution, primarily the \ndoctrine of standing, particularly as enunciated by the Supreme Court \nin Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992); Second, the \ndeference courts owe to Congress under both the political question \ndoctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself, which confers \nenforcement authority in Congress; third, the limits on judicial \nremedies which can be imposed on a coordinate branch of government--in \nthis case, of course, the legislative branch. These are limitations on \nremedies that are self-imposed by courts and that, in appropriate \ncircumstances, may be imposed on the courts by Congress. These \nlimitations, such as the doctrine of separation of powers, prohibit \ncourts from raising taxes, a power exclusively delegated to Congress by \nthe Constitution and not altered by the balanced budget amendment. \nConsequently, contrary to the contention of opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, separation of power concerns further the purpose of \nthe amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance the budget \nfalls squarely on the shoulders of Congress--which is consistent with \nthe intent of the framers of the Constitution that all budgetary \nmatters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n  Concerning the doctrine of standing, it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must first demonstrate standing to \nsue. To demonstrate article III standing, a litigant at a minimum must \nmeet three requirements: First, injury in fact--that the litigant \nsuffered some concrete and particularized injury; second, \ntraceability--that the concrete injury was both caused by and is \ntraceable to the unlawful conduct; and third, redressibility--that the \nrelief sought will redress the alleged injury. This is the test \nenunciated by the Supreme Court in the fairly recent and seminal case \nof Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992). [See, \ne.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982).] In challenging \nmeasures enacted by Congress under a balanced budget regime, it would \nbe an extremely difficult hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate the \ninjury-in-fact requirement, that is, something more concrete than a \ngeneralized grievance and burden shared by all citizens and taxpayers. \nI want to emphasize that this is hardly a new concept. See Frothingham \nv. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923). Furthermore, courts are not going \nto overrule this doctrine since standing has been held to be an Article \nIII requirement. See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. \n26, 41 n.22 (1976).\n  Even in the vastly improbable case where an injury in fact was \nestablished, a litigant would find it nearly impossible to establish \nthe traceability and\n redressibility requirements of the article III standing test. \nLitigants would have a difficult time in showing that any alleged \nunlawful conduct--the unbalancing of the budget or the shattering of \nthe debt ceiling--caused or is traceable to a particular spending \nmeasure that harmed them. After all, there will be hundreds and \nhundreds of Federal spending programs even after Federal spending is \nbrought under control. Furthermore, because the Congress would have \nnumerous options to achieve balanced budget compliance, there would be \nno legitimate basis for a court to nullify or modify a specific \nspending measure objected to by the litigant.\n\n  As to the redressibility prong, this requirement would be difficult \nto meet simply because courts are wary of becoming involved in the \nbudget process--which is legislative in nature--and separation of power \nconcerns will prevent courts from specifying adjustments to any Federal \nprogram or expenditures. Thus, for this reason, Missouri v. Jenkins, \n495 U.S. 33 (1990), where the Supreme Court upheld a district court's \npower to order a local school district to levy taxes to support a \ndesegregation plan, is inapposite because it is a 14th amendment case \nnot involving, as the Court noted, ``an instance of one branch of the \nFederal Government invading the province of another.'' [Jenkins at 67.] \nPlainly put, the Jenkins case is not applicable to the balanced budget \namendment because section 1 of the 14th amendment--from which the \njudiciary derives its power to rule against the States in equal \nprotection claims--does not apply to the Federal Government and because \nthe separation of powers doctrine prevents judicial encroachments on \nCongress' bailiwick. Courts simply will not have the authority to order \nCongress to raise taxes.\n  Furthermore, the well-established political question and \njusticiability doctrines will mandate that courts give the greatest \ndeference to congressional budgetary measures, particularly since \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress \nthe responsibility of enforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows \nCongress to ``rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' See Baker v. \nCarr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962). Under these circumstances, it is \nextremely unlikely that a court would substitute its judgment for that \nof Congress.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the taxpayer standing case, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83 (1968), is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. First, the Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court \nto establishment clause cases. This has been made clear by the Supreme \nCourt in Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 480. Second, by \nits terms, Flast is limited to cases challenging legislation \npromulgated under Congress' constitutional tax and spend powers when \nthe expenditure of the tax was made for an illicit purpose. Sections 1 \nand 2 of House Joint Resolution 1, limit Congress' borrowing power and \nthe amendment contains no restriction on the purposes of the \nexpenditures. Finally, in subsequent cases, particularly the Lujan \ncase, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the need for a litigant to \ndemonstrate particularized injury, thus casting doubt on the vitality \nof Flast. [See Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2136.]\n  I also believe that there would be no so-called congressional \nstanding for Members of Congress to commence actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Although the Supreme Court has never addressed the \nquestion of congressional standing, the D.C. circuit has recognized \ncongressional standing, but only in the following circumstances: First, \nthe traditional standing tests of the Supreme Court are met, second, \nthere must be a deprivation within the zone of interest protected by \nthe Constitution or a statute--generally, the right to vote on a given \nissue or the protection of the efficacy of a vote, and third, \nsubstantial relief cannot be obtained from fellow legislators through \nthe enactment, repeal, or amendment of a statute--the so-called \nequitable discretion doctrine. See Melcher v. Open Market Comm., 836 \nF.2d 561 (D.C. Cir 1987); Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, 656 \nF.2d 873 (D.C.\n Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981). Because Members of Congress \nwould not be able to demonstrate that they were harmed in fact by any \ndilution or nullification of their vote--and because under the doctrine \nof equitable discretion, Members would not be able to show that \nsubstantial relief could not otherwise be obtained from fellow \nlegislators through the enactment, repeal or amendment of a statute--it \nis hardly likely that Members of Congress would have standing to \n challenge actions under the balanced budget amendment.the fourteenth \n              amendment and the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Furthermore, some of my colleagues contend that because section 6 of \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, the section that mandates that Congress \nenforce the amendment through implementing legislation, is similar to \nsection 5 of the 14th amendment, which permits Congress to enforce that \namendment, courts will also be able to enforce the balanced budget \namendment to the extent courts enforce the 14th amendment.\n  This analogy is misleading. First, courts may only enforce an \namendment when legislation or executive actions violate the amendment \nor when Congress creates a cause of action to enforce the amendment. An \nexample of the latter is 42 U.S.C., section 1983, the 1871 Civil Rights \nAct that implements section 1 of the 14th amendment. Of \n [[Page S2720]] course, Congress has not created, and need not create, \nan analogous cause of action under section 6 of the balanced budget \namendment, so there is no direct judicial enforcement provision in \nexistence similar to section 1983.\n  Second, as to the judicial nullification of legislation or executive \naction that is allegedly inconsistent with a constitutional amendment, \nthe case-or-controversy provision of article III requires that a \nlitigant demonstrate standing. As I have stated at great length already \nduring this debate, it is very improbable that a litigant could \ndemonstrate standing under the balanced budget amendment--that the \nlitigant could demonstrate a particularized injury, different from the \ngeneralized harm facing any citizen or taxpayer. Contrast this with \ncases under the 14th amendment where standing was found because a \nlitigant could demonstrate a particular, individualized, and concrete \nharm, as in the one man, one vote case. See Reynolds v. Sims, 369 U.S. \n186 (1962).\n  Third, in this circumstance, as I previously explained, under the \nseparation of powers doctrine, courts will not entertain a suit where \nthey cannot supply relief to the litigant. Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992). The Constitution under article I \ndelegates to Congress taxing, spending, and borrowing powers. These are \nplenary powers that exclusively and historically have been recognized \nas belonging to Congress. The balanced budget amendment does not alter \nthis. Courts, consequently, will be loathe to interfere with Congress' \nbudgetary powers. It is simply an exaggeration to contend that courts \nwill place the budgetary process under receivership or cut spending \nprograms.\n  Fourth, as I also explained, the political question doctrine will \ndeter courts from enforcing the balanced budget amendment. Budgetary \nmatters--such as where to cut programs or how to raise revenues--are\n prototypically a political matter best left to the political branches \nof government to resolve. Courts, under the political question \ndoctrine, will leave these matters to Congress.\n\n\n                 congress' power to restrain the courts\n\n  Finally, it is simply wrong to assume that Congress would just sit by \nin the unlikely event that a court would commit some overreaching act. \nBelieve me, Congress knows how to defend itself. Congress knows how to \nrestrict the jurisdiction of courts or limit the scope of judicial \nremedies. But I do not think this necessary. Lower courts follow \nprecedents, and the precepts of standing, separation of powers, and the \npolitical question doctrine, effectively limit the ability of courts to \ninterfere in the budgetary process.\n  Nevertheless, if necessary, a shield against judicial interference is \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 itself. Under this section, \nCongress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any purported \nbudgetary shortfall, such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency fund. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear \nthat Congress, if it finds it necessary, could limit the type of \nremedies a court may grant or limit courts' jurisdiction in some other \nmanner to proscribe judicial overreaching. This is nothing new. \nCongress has adopted such limitations in other circumstances pursuant \nto its article III authority. Here are a few: First, the Norris-\nLaGuardia Act, [29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101-115], where the courts were \ndenied the use of injunctive powers to restrain labor disputes; Second, \nthe Federal Tax Injunction Act, [28 U.S.C. sec. 2283], which contains a \nprohibition on Federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings; \nand third, the tax Injunction Act, [26 U.S.C. sec 7421(a)], where \nFederal courts were prohibited from enjoining the collection of taxes.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit judicial review of particular \nspecial tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. For instance, \nthe Supreme Court in Yakus v. United States, [319 U.S. 182 (1943)], \nupheld the constitutionality of a special emergency court of appeals \nvested with exclusive authority to determine the validity of claims \nunder the World War II Emergency Price Control Act. In more recent \ntimes, the Supreme Court, in Dames & Moore v. Reagan, [453 U.S. 654 \n(1981)], upheld the legality of the Iranian-United States Claims \nTribunal as the exclusive forum to settle claims to Iranian assets.\n  Beyond which, as I have mentioned earlier, in the virtually \nimpossible scenario where these safeguards fail, Congress can take \nwhatever action it must to moot any case in which a risk of judicial \noverreaching becomes real.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that the enforcement concerns \nabout the balanced budget amendment do not amount to a hill of beans. \nThe fear of the demon of judicial interference is exorcised by the \nreality of over a century of constitutional doctrines that prevent \nunelected courts from interfering with the power of the democratic \nbranch of government and that bestow Congress with the means to protect \nits prerogatives.\n  Mr. President, it is very clear. I do not think we should amend this \namendment, certainly not with the language the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana has brought forth here, which will lead us to more \nlitigation than ever before in worse ways than ever before, and a \nreduction in the amount of Congress' power that currently exists, \nespecially when we can easily change it in the implementing legislation \nwithout any problems.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute, just simply to \nreply to the argument that somehow this language would do away with the \nrequirement for standing.\n  Mr. President, all this language says is that the judicial power of \nthe United States shall not extend to a case in controversy under this \narticle except for section 2.\n  Now, I invite a comparison with the present language of the \nConstitution which says:\n\n       The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and \n     equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the \n     United States, and treaties made.\n\n  Now, under the language of the Constitution which says the judicial \npower shall extend to cases, controversies, et cetera, the court has \nrequired standing. It is the same language that we have in this \namendment. Whatever requirement the court will find for standing under \nthis amendment is the same language that inheres under the \nConstitution. And so, Mr. President, there is no expansion of standing \nunder section 2 under our amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. It seems to me the argument of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Utah comes down to a very simple set of inconsistent propositions. \nProposition No. 1, courts are not going to get involved in enforcing \nthis amendment. Proposition No. 2, we ought to have the courts involved \nin enforcing this amendment.\n  I just simply do not believe that Members can have it both ways. If, \nin fact, courts are going to stay out by reason of standing or other \nvarious doctrines which are not themselves contained in the \nConstitution, then it certainly does no harm to see to it that that is \nthe result.\n  If, in fact, it is the proposition of the proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment, some of the proponents because I am one of \nthem, that courts should be involved, then it seems to me they are \ndoing something in this field that almost without exception they \ndeprecate in other fields. Judicial activism should not be invited into \nthe process of writing budgets of the United States. That is a \nlegislative and executive function.\n  The reason for the amendment is that the Senator from Louisiana, \ntogether with this Senator, wants to make certain that this remains \nsolely a function of Congress and of the executive branch of \nGovernment. And all Members who feel that the courts may very well be \ntoo active today in many social and political issues should vote in \nfavor of the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n   [[Page S2721]] Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I \nthank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding 2 minutes to me.\n  Mr. President, very quickly, I want to commend my friend from \nLouisiana, Senator Johnston, for offering this amendment this \nafternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the most important \namendments and one of the most critical decisions that we will make \nduring the debate on the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to have and to require a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I want to make two quick points. First, I think if the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana is defeated by this body this \nafternoon, two things are going to happen. I think the first thing is \nthat this is going to be seen by the courts as an actual invitation to \ncome forward and start implementing the balanced budget to the \nConstitution of the United States, assuming that two-thirds of the \nSenators agree and that three-fourths of the States support the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The second thing, Mr. President, I say in all due respect, that I \nthink is going to happen, is that the courts will look at the defeat of \nthe Johnston amendment that we are now considering and are about to \nvote on, as having established legislative intent--should we defeat \nthis amendment. And I only assume that the courts would ultimately \ndeclare that the Senate had decided, through the process of \nestablishing legislative intent, that the courts would be the proper \nimplementing authority to implement the balanced budget clause of the \nConstitution of the United States; the balanced budget amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So I see two very bad things coming as a result, Mr. President.\n  If I could have 1 additional minute, Mr. President?\n  I thank my friend from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I see two very bad things happening if we turn down the \nJohnston amendment. I think the Johnston amendment is sound. I think if \nyou could take a poll of the country today and ask the people if they \nwant the courts to implement a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, if they want an unelected lifetime \nappointed Federal district judge from wherever to raise the taxes \nnecessary to implement a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nor in the Constitution, most people would say no. I say that if we fail \nto support, this afternoon, the very fine, clarifying amendment offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana, there could be a disastrous effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 17 minutes. The \nSenator from Utah has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Louisiana and \nthe Senator from Washington. These are two Senators who have different \npositions on the underlying amendment but who have come in very strong \nagreement on the need to clarify an ambiguity. Whatever side of the \nissue we are on, the underlying issue, we cannot in good conscience \nessentially leave a critical ambiguity in the Constitution as to how it \nis going to be enforced and whether or not the courts are going to be \nable to enforce this document.\n  The Senator from Utah, in whom I have a great deal of confidence and \ntrust as a person of honor, says that it is very clear the courts \ncannot interfere with the budgetary process. And that is his intent. \nWhen he says it, as he has a number of times, I accept this as being \nhis intent.\n  The difficulty is the lead sponsor of this language in the House \nseems to have a very different intent. So we are caught in an \nambiguity. The ambiguity is not just between law professors. The \nambiguity is between the language of the sponsor of this amendment that \nis before us in the House and the lead sponsor in the Senate, on the \nvery important questions of standing to sue and what a court can do.\n  Representative Schaefer, in a formal answer for the Record--not a \ncasual comment but a formal answer for the Record--he says the courts \ncould invalidate individual appropriation or tax acts. I read this \nearlier this afternoon. I had it blown up so we could all see exactly \nwhat it is that he has said. ``The courts could make only a limited \nrange of decisions on a limited number of issues.''\n  What are they? ``They could invalidate an individual appropriation or \ntax act. They could rule as to whether a given act of Congress or \naction by the executive violated the requirements of this amendment.'' \nPerhaps he describes that as a limited range of decisions but surely \nthat is a major intrusion in the budgetary processes of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  I wish the intention were clear. I wish it were clear for the sake of \na constitutional amendment which may be adopted.\n  For many other reasons I hope it will not be. I am one of those who \nopposes it for a number of reasons. But whatever side of the \nconstitutional amendment issue we are on, it is incumbent on us to have \nlanguage which is clear as to the heart of the matter, which is the \nenforcement of it. Over and over again we have stated the intention to \nbalance the budget. The heart of the matter is can it be enforced and, \nif so, how will it be enforced? What is the mechanism to enforce it? \nThe Johnston amendment clarifies the question of whether courts will \ntake over legislative functions, such as individual appropriation acts \nor tax acts.\n  This is not a casual comment by one person who is voting for the \namendment in the other body. This is a formal statement for the \nRecord--one of many, by the way, which differs from the sponsors here--\nfor instance on questions of standing. It is----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does it not follow, if you have the power to invalidate \na tax act, that you also have a power to order a tax?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that may well follow. But if you can invalidate an \nappropriation act or a tax act you are deep in the budgetary process.\n  Representative Schaefer has said that a Member of Congress, \n``probably would have standing to file suit.'' That is a formal answer \nto a formal question, ``probably would have standing.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to if I have time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just one sentence. Congressman Schaefer, as sincere as he \nwas, is not a lawyer. His life's work has been in public relations. He \nwas simply wrong. I do not see anybody--I do not know anybody who would \nargue that they can invalidate individual appropriations or tax acts. \nHe may have been very sincere making that statement. He was simply \nwrong.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe the Senator from Idaho put the exact same \nanswers in the Record on this side, in the Congressional Record.\n  This is not a casual answer in a colloquy during a debate. These are \nformal answers, the questions and answers for the Record by the chief \nsponsor of the constitutional amendment that we are voting on. This was \nnot something he threw off on his way to a press conference. This is \nformal. I am reading the Congressional Record in the House, on page \n8754 here, and I am reading it precisely. It is--this is a long \ndocument of questions and answers for the Record.\n\n       The courts could invalidate an individual appropriation or \n     tax act.\n\n  On the question of standing, if we could get the other quote up here \non the question of standing--this is what Representative Schaefer said.\n\n       A Member of Congress or an appropriate administration \n     official probably would have standing to file suit.\n\n  The Senator from Utah--and I take his word. I know--it is not his \nintent. \n [[Page S2722]] When he looks me in the eye and he tells me what his \nintent is, no question, I accept it. I know him well. But it is very \ndifferent from what Representative Schaefer, who is the prime sponsor \nof this amendment, is telling us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I have one minute? I am out of time. I do not know if \nthe Senator from Utah wants to ask me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could. I do not know Representative Schaefer very \nwell. But I do know his experience in these matters is somewhat \nlimited. The fact that somebody puts something in the Record, albeit as \nsponsor of the amendment--this amendment has been around a long time. \nHe was cosponsor of it. That does not mean he, or anyone else, wrote \nit.\n  But let us just talk in terms of what is really involved here.\n  The contention, for instance, that the balanced budget amendment \nwould allow Federal courts to offer the raising of taxes is absolutely \nwithout merit. It is based on a misunderstanding of the case of \nMissouri versus Jenkins, which was a 14th amendment case.\n  In that case the Supreme Court in essence approved, by a 5-to-4 vote, \na lower court remedial order directing State or county political \nsubdivisions to raise taxes to support a court-ordered school \ndesegregation order. The lower court had previously found that the \nschool district had engaged in intentional segregation, in violation of \nthe 14th amendment's equal protection clause.\n  The concern that the balanced budget amendment would allow a Federal \ncourt to order Congress to raise taxes to reduce the deficit is plainly \nwithout merit. Why? Because Jenkins is a 14th amendment case. Under the \n14th amendment jurisprudence, Federal courts may perhaps issue this \ntype of remedial relief to force the equal protection clause against \nthe States, but certainly not against Congress, a coequal branch of \nGovernment. The 14th amendment, of course, does not apply to the \nFederal Government.\n  No. 2, separation-of-powers concerns would prohibit the judiciary \nfrom interfering with the budgetary, taxing, borrowing, and spending \npowers that are exclusively delegated to Congress by the Constitution.\n  And, three, Congress simply cannot be made a party-defendant. To \norder taxes to be raised, Congress would have to be named a defendant. \nPresumably, suits to enforce the balanced budget amendment would arise \nwhen an official or an agency of the executive branch seeks to enforce \nor administer a statute whose funding is in question in light of the \namendment. In the case of Riegle versus Federal Open Market Committee, \nthe court noted that ``when a plaintiff alleges injury by \nunconstitutional actions taken pursuant to a statute, his proper \ndefendants are those acting under the law * * * and not the legislature \nwhich enacted the statute.''\n  So, I respect Congressman Schaefer, but he just simply is wrong on \nthose statements, and the law says he is wrong.\n  Mr. President, let me just switch for a minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Biden be recognized to offer an amendment on \ncapital budgeting following the disposition of Senator Johnston's \namendment and Senator Byrd be recognized to offer an amendment \nfollowing the disposition of Senator Biden's amendment. I also ask \nunanimous consent that there be a time limit on the Biden amendment \nprior to a motion to table as follows: 90 minutes under Senator Biden's \ncontrol, 20 minutes under Senator Hatch's control; and, that at the \nconclusion or yielding of time, the majority leader or his designee be \nrecognized to offer a motion to table the Biden amendment and that no \nother amendments be in order prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat it not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania 5 minutes.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 7 seconds.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had asked the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana to yield me time because the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, asked me if I could get time. I have \nnot made up my mind yet on the matter, but I wanted to express my \nconcerns about the pending issue's repealability and have some ideas \nfrom the manager as to where the issue stood.\n  While this floor debate has been in process, the Judiciary Committee \nhas been meeting in the Antitrust Subcommittee on the baseball issue. \nThe pending amendment makes it plain that there will not be Federal \ncourt jurisdiction, that the judicial power of the United States shall \nnot extend in any case or controversy arising under this article except \nsection 2 here, which may be specifically authorized in implementing \nlegislation pursuant to this section.\n But I inquire of the Senator from Louisiana what the exception for \n  section 2 refers to.Mr. JOHNSTON. Section 2 provides that the limit \non the debt of the United States held by the public shall not be \nincreased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall \nprovide for that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. That is very limited exception. \nThere is no jurisdiction. The issue of jurisdiction concerns me \ngreatly. Earlier this year, I argued a case at the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States involving the Base Closure Commission. The issue was \nwhether Federal courts had jurisdiction of the matter. I had the \noccasion to do very extensive research on the jurisdictional question. \nIt is my view that there ought not to be jurisdiction in the Federal \ncourts on the compliance with the constitutional amendment. This is a \nduty on the Congress.\n  There is the possibility of extensive litigation, and we ought to \nmake our position clear on that in one way or another.\n  If I may have the attention of the Senator from Utah. I understand \nthe concerns the Senator from Utah has in not wanting to have \namendments added to the bill because that subjects the issue to \nconference, but the question I have of the managers of the measure is \nwhat is the import of the absence of this amendment? Will there be \njurisdiction of the Federal courts, I first inquire of my colleague \nfrom Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, first of all, it is not just the concern about going \nto conference, it is a concern about the House wanting to pass the \nbalanced budget again with this amendment in it. We are not sure where \neverybody is there. Second, if we do go to conference, we are not sure \nwe can hold on to it. Even so, third, the amendment now, as modified, \nsays, ``The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any \ncase or controversy arising under this article except for section 2 \nhereof.'' That has now been put into the amendment, which worries us.\n  If section 2 is opened up for litigation, then the courts may take \nthat as an implication that we will permit their lessening of the \nstanding requirements and other requirements. So we think that makes it \neven worse and that would create even more litigation than the Senator \nis talking about.\n  Last but not least, we are very concerned that if you cut off \nlitigation rights for cases, which I personally cannot conceive of at \nthis point, but as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nunderstands, with his experience in the law, there may be real rights \nthat may have to be brought in the courts for particularized injuries \nto individuals. Those are the reasons.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask my colleague from Utah, if the language exception \nas to section 2 were removed, would the amendment be agreeable?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, it still would not be because of the other reasons. It \nstill \n [[Page S2723]] would not be agreeable because we believe it is a false \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator wish another minute?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It depends on how long Senator Hatch's answer is.\n  Mr. HATCH. It will be at least a minute. We do not believe that we \nhave to fear the courts in this matter, because of the principle of \nstanding, and the doctrines of justiciability, the political question \nand separation of powers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if I may have 30 seconds more, is it the view of \nmy colleague from Utah, the manager of the measure, that there would be \nno Federal jurisdiction, no jurisdiction in the Federal courts even \nwithout this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not sure I understand the question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if this amendment is defeated, could the U.S. \ncourts entertain jurisdiction in a suit that is brought challenging the \nfollowing or compliance with the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget?\n  Mr. HATCH. Only if the court is extremely activist and not willing to \nfollow the law.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Only if the court is----\n  Mr. HATCH. There may be jurisdiction, but there will not be any \nstanding. That is the difference. It would take a very activist judge, \nwho I think would be slapped down very quickly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If you are going to rely on standing, the vagaries of \nthat issue, or a defense that may be advanced to stop somebody from \ngoing into court, that is very perilous ground. I think it is advisable \nfor this body to face the jurisdictional issue squarely. I think we \nought to say whether or not we wish the Federal courts to have \njurisdiction over compliance with the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has \none of the best legal minds in this body, has put his finger directly \non the question. It is not clear whether there would be standing, \njusticiability, or whether it would be a political question. But the \nmajority of the opinions I have seen indicate that there would be such \nstanding. The Harvard Law Review demonstrates, however, that taxpayers \nprobably would have standing to challenge. Professor Tribe, Judge Bork, \nand on and on, Mr. President. The better view is that there probably is \nstanding that the courts would interfere, but it is not clear and it \nought to be cleared up. That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Louisiana has \n4\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from Utah has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I ask the date of that law review article?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Harvard Law Review, 1983.\n  Mr. HATCH. That preceded the Lujan case. The law review articles \nprecede that case and are not applicable.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it not \nbe charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the Johnston amendment because \nit is unnecessary and based on false premises. Under the constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment before us, the Congress will have the \nauthority to enforce the balanced budget amendment. All issues \nregarding the implementation and enforcement of the amendment will be \nresolved through implementing legislation.\n  A constitutional amendment necessarily is limited to general \nprinciples. It cannot spell out all issues that could arise under that \namendment. Many constitutional amendments provide that Congress can \nenforce the provision through appropriate legislation. House Joint \nResolution 1 follows in that tradition.\n  I agree that any litigation that might be brought under this \namendment should be resolved expeditiously. But the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana is not necessary to achieve that result. \nCongress can set the appropriate jurisdiction of the Federal courts. \nCongress can pass implementing legislation that provides for Federal \ncourt actions only. And it can provide for expedited review of lower \ncourt decisions and set forth the available relief.\n  However, Congress cannot adopt the suggestion of the Senator from \nLouisiana that Congress could give the Supreme Court original \njurisdiction to hear a case under the balanced budget amendment. The \nSupreme Court ruled in Marbury versus Madison that Congress cannot \nexpand the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\n  Only litigants with standing to challenge governmental action under \nthe amendment would be able to file a lawsuit under the requirements of \narticle III. Some few individuals might have standing. Even these \nindividuals, however, would not be able to require a judicial \nresolution of their cases if the Court concludes that the case raises a \npolitical question.\n  Under the political question doctrine, courts will not decide cases \nraising issues that appropriately fall within the authority of the \nother two branches. For example, the Constitution guarantees a \nRepublican form of government.\n  But the courts have refused to issue decisions in cases raising that \nconstitutional provision because its enforcement appropriately lies \nwithin the authority of the political branches. Similarly, courts have \nrefused to intervene in challenges to the President's authority over \nforeign affairs.\n  Many of the questions raised under this amendment would also be \npolitical ones that courts would not rule on.\n  All the supporters of the balanced budget amendment are concerned \nwith the idea of courts potentially making tax and spending decisions. \nWe intend that courts not do that. And we will pass implementing \nlegislation to address the process by which any litigation can be \nbrought. There is no need to preclude judicial enforcement pending the \nenactment of that implementing legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Johnston \namendment.\n  I am not a lawyer, but legal and constitutional experts I trust and \nrespect have convinced me that the supposed problem with judicial \nreview is, at best, no problem at all; and, at worst, it is a red \nherring that may give some Senators an excuse to vote no on the BBA.\n  I start with Senator Hatch, an outstanding constitutional lawyer. If \nthere were a risk of judicial intrusion into legislative matters, he \nwould be the down here arguing for an amendment to restrict the power \nof the courts.\n  I am convinced that there is no risk of improper court action. \nOtherwise, I would be the first Senator down here supporting a limit on \njudicial review.\n  I am persuaded by the testimony of former Attorney General William \nBarr. To summarize what he said:\n  There is a remote risk of judicial micromanagement; if judicial \nintrusion arose, Congress could correct it by statute;\n  The remote, correctable risk was far outweighed by the need for, and \nthe benefits of the balanced budget amendment;\n  There would rarely--if ever--be standing to sue;\n  The Constitution, the balanced budget amendment itself, and long-\nestablished judicial and constitutional doctrines all require the \ncourts to pay great deference to Congress' handling of legislative \nbusiness, especially when Congress acts affirmatively to establish \nstatutory processes to enforce and implement the amendment.\n  Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a Democrat from the Carter \nadministration appeared before the Judiciary Committee this year to \nstrongly endorse the balanced budget amendment.\n  In a 1992 memo to Representative L.F. Payne on this subject, the \nLincoln Legal Foundation said this:\n\n       [[Page S2724]] (T)here is virtually no danger that the \n     constitutional balanced budget amendment . . . would cede the \n     power of the purse to a runaway judiciary. To the contrary, \n     it would eliminate certain authorities that courts currently \n     have to order the disbursement of federal funds without \n     appropriations.\n\n  Last year, in testimony, attorney John C. Armor told the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n  The balanced budget amendment a suitable addition to the \nConstitution;\n  Limited judicial review was appropriate;\n  Congress is already empowered in the Constitution to limit judicial \nintrusion appropriately through statute.\n  Finally, I refer to an excellent brief memo by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce that summarizes how judicial action will be limited \nappropriately.\n  I am tired of opponents to the balanced budget amendment citing the \nMissouri v. Jenkins case.\n  I agree that Missouri v. Jenkins was decided wrongly; but that case \nhas nothing to do with the legal or constitutional considerations \naround this amendment.\n  That was a case of Federal pre-emption. That was a case of the \nFederal courts enforcing Federal law on a local school district.\n  Let us look at our Constitution:\n  Article I says, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States * * *''\n  Raising taxes is a legislative power.\n  Writing budgets and setting priorities is a legislative power.\n  Article III says: ``* * * the Supreme Court shall have appellate \njurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under \nsuch regulations as the Congress shall make.''\n  Let us look at the amendment itself:\n  Section 6 says Congress will enforce and implemented the BBA;\n  Section 6, by expressly allowing good faith reliance on reasonable \nestimates, allows Congress reasonable flexibility and reduces the \nlikelihood of second-guessing by the courts;\n  Section 2, by subjecting Congress to 3/5 votes on the limit on\n   debt held by the public, makes the amendment essentially self-\nenforcing and locates that self-enforcement squarely in Congress.\n\n  No other amendment to the Constitution removes the courts from the \nprocess of enforcement.\n  In fact, the very, very slight chance that some case may come before \nthe courts is a good thing; it will motivate Congress to make sure we \ncomply with the amendment and stay out of court. It will reassure \nAmerican people that the same branches of Government that built up a \n$4.7 trillion debt, will at least have the legality of their actions \nsubject to fair and impartial interpretation.\n  At the same time, judicial involvement will be limited to, in the \nwords of Marbury versus Madison, ``saying what the law is.'' They may \nstrike down a piece of budget legislation--we may be told to go back \nand start over. They may rule whether an action by the President is or \nis not contrary to the amendment.\n  It does not mean the courts can write a budget or raise taxes. But \ninterpreting the law is the job of the courts. Congress can enact \nreasonable limitations on judicial review. All of which is appropriate, \nlimited, and balanced.\n  As Senator Brown has pointed out, the experience of the States with \nthat flood of lawsuits has never materialized.\n  Finally, as Senator Simon has said, if we balance the budget, if we \nrun small surpluses, if we take care to vote on the issues the \namendment says to vote on, we will never be hauled into court.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the various documents that I have just \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n   Statement of William P. Barr, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n       Hearings on the Balanced Budget Amendment, January 5, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee: I \n     am honored to have been invited today to testify on the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       You have asked me to discuss whether judicial enforcement \n     of the Amendment would result in undue interference by the \n     federal courts in the budget process.\n       In my view, though it is always difficult to predict the \n     course of future constitutional law development, the courts' \n     role in enforcing the Balanced Budget Amendment will be quite \n     limited. I see little risk that the Amendment will become the \n     basis for judicial micromanagement or superintendence of the \n     federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the Amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, \n     moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that courts will \n     play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, \n     that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by the \n     benefits of such an Amendment.\n       I believe there are three basic constraints that will tend \n     to prevent the courts from becoming unduly involved in the \n     budgetary process: (1) the limitations on the power of \n     federal courts contained in Article III of the Constitution--\n     primarily the requirement of standing; (2) the deference \n     courts would owe to Congress, both under existing \n     constitutional doctrines, and particularly under section 6 of \n     the amendment itself, which expressly confers enforcement \n     responsibility on Congress; and (3) the limits on judicial \n     remedies running against coordinate branches of government, \n     both that the courts have imposed upon themselves and that, \n     in appropriate circumstances, Congress may impose on the \n     courts.\n       I will discuss each of these constraints in turn. Before I \n     do, however, let me note that my remarks will focus on \n     sections 1 and 2 of the Amendment. It is these provisions \n     that would create new limits on Congress' power to borrow and \n     to expend borrowed funds, and those new limits may \n     potentially give rise to new opportunities for courts to \n     intrude themselves into the budgetary process in ways they \n     currently cannot. Section 4 of the Amendment, in contrast, \n     presents no such new opportunity or risk for judicial \n     interference in the budgetary process. Section 4 merely adds \n     further procedural requirements for the passage of revenue \n     bills, and courts today already may entertain claims that \n     revenue bills (either taxes or user fees) do not comply with \n     clear constitutional procedures.\n\n\n                       i. article iii limitations\n\n       Article III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction \n     of the federal courts to ``Cases'' or ``Controversies.'' As \n     an essential part of this case-or-controversy limitation, any \n     plaintiff who hopes to invoke the judicial power of the \n     federal courts must demonstrate sufficient ``standing.''\n       Although the Court has not been completely consistent is \n     defining this doctrine, its fundamental principles remain \n     clear. At an irreducible minimum, a plaintiff must show three \n     things to satisfy the standing requirement: (1) ``injury in \n     fact''--that he personally has suffered some concrete and \n     particularized injury; (2) ``traceability''--that the \n     particularized injury was caused by, and is fairly traceable \n     to, the allegedly illegal conduct; and (3) \n     ``redressibility''--that the relief sought will likely \n     redress the plaintiff's injury. E.g., Lujan v. Defenders of \n     Wildlife, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992); Valley Forge \n     Christian College v. Americans United For Separation of \n     Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982); Simon v. \n     Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, \n     38, 41 (1976).\n       Basically, we can anticipate two kinds of court challenges \n     relating to sections 1 and 2 of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment: (1) a claim that a particular budgetary action \n     (such as a spending or borrowing measure) violates the \n     Amendment or its implementing statutes by ``unbalancing'' the \n     budget or by exceeding the applicable debt limit, or (2) a \n     claim that one of the implementing mechanisms enacted by \n     Congress pursuant to section 6 of the Amendment is itself in \n     violation of section 1 or 2. In either case, I believe, few \n     plaintiffs would be able to establish the requisite standing \n     to invoke federal court review.\n    \n    \n       The ``injury in fact'' requirement alone would be an \n     imposing hurdle. It is fundamental that, to establish \n     ``injury in fact,'' a plaintiff cannot rely on generalized \n     grievances and burdens shared by all citizens and taxpayers, \n     but rather must be able to show a particularized injury that \n     he has distinctively sustained. No private citizen or group \n     would have standing to obtain judicial enforcement of the \n     Amendment solely by virtue of their status as a citizen or \n     taxpayer. Their supposed injury--the burden of deficit \n     spending and increased debt--is shared by all taxpayers and \n     is precisely the kind of ``generalized grievance'' to which \n     the judicial power does not extend. As the Supreme Court \n     recently reiterated: ``As an ordinary matter, suits premised \n     on federal taxpayer status are not cognizable in the federal \n     courts because a taxpayer's `interest in the moneys of the \n     Treasury . . . is shared with millions of others, is \n     comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon \n     future taxation, or any payments out of the funds, so remote, \n     fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for \n     [judicial intervention].''' Asarco, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. \n     605, 613 (1989) (quoting Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, \n     487 (1923)).\n       Moreover, even in the case where a plaintiff could \n     establish ``injury in fact''--by showing, for example, that a \n     specific budgetary action causes particularized and distinct \n     harm to him--it would still be difficult for that plaintiff \n     to satisfy the remaining two elements of Article III \n     standing--the traceability and redressibility requirements. \n     Given the myriad components of any budget, most plaintiffs \n     would be unable to show that the putatively illegal conduct--\n     the \n      [[Page S2725]] unbalancing of the budget or the breaking of \n     the debt ceiling--was ``caused'' by, and hence is fairly \n     traceable to, the particular spending measure that has \n     allegedly harmed them. Moreover, a plaintiff would be hard \n     put to demonstrate redressibility because the political \n     branches would have numerous ways to achieve compliance with \n     the Amendment--other than by eliminating the specific measure \n     harming the plaintiff. There would thus be no legitimate \n     basis for a court to single out and strike down the specific \n     spending measure to which the plaintiff objects.\n    \n    \n       I should for a moment address the case of Flast v. Cohen, \n     392 U.S. 83 (1968), where the Supreme Court, 27 years ago, \n     allowed a taxpayer to mount an Establishment Clause challenge \n     against federal aid to parochial schools. Flast is the only \n     instance where the Court has departed from its rigorous \n     restriction on taxpayer standing. Flast plainly has no \n     application to the present context and would not authorize \n     general taxpayer standing to seek judicial enforcement of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. First, the Court has never \n     identified any constitutional restriction on the powers of \n     Congress other than the Establishment Clause that might \n     support an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer \n     standing. Moreover, by its terms, Flast is limited to cases \n     challenging congressional action taken under its tax-and-\n     spending power (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1 of the Constitution) \n     when the expenditure of tax revenue is made for an illicit \n     purpose. In contrast, sections 1 and 2 of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment limit Congress' borrowing power (a separate power, \n     enumerated in Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 2) and contains no \n     restriction on the purposes of congressional expenditures. \n     The Court has expressly declined to extend Flast beyond the \n     exercise of Congress' power under Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1 to \n     other fiscal provisions. See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian \n     College, 454 U.S. at 480. And finally, in subsequent cases, \n     the Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed to need for all \n     plaintiffs to demonstrate particularized injury, thus casting \n     doubt on the continued vitality of Flast. I cannot see the \n     Court resurrecting and extending Flast in the context of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       There remains the question whether, by virtue of their \n     office, Members of Congress can establish standing where a \n     private citizen could not. The Supreme Court has never \n     recognized congressional standing, and forceful arguments \n     have been advanced against it. See Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d \n     21, 41-51 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Bork, J., dissenting), vacated as \n     moot sub nom. Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361 (1987). Those \n     lower courts that have allowed congressional standing have \n     limited it in ways that would greatly restrict its use in \n     efforts to enforce the Balanced Budget Amendment. First, \n     Members must demonstrate that they have suffered injury in \n     fact by dilution or nullification of their congressional \n     voting power. In addition, Members must still satisfy the \n     other requirements of Article III standing, including the \n     traceability and redressibility requirements. And finally, \n     under the doctrine of ``equitable discretion,'' recognized by \n     the D.C. Circuit, Members must show that substantial relief \n     could not otherwise be obtained from fellow legislators \n     through the enactment, repeal or amendment of a statute. See \n     Melcher v. Federal Open Market Comm., 836 F.2d 561, 563 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1987).\n       Even if the legitimacy of congressional standing, in \n     principle, were ultimately accepted by the Supreme Court, I \n     would expect that doctrine would have narrow application in \n     the context of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Even if a \n     circumstance arose where a Member could meet the first two \n     requirements, it seems that, absent a serious and clear \n     abuse, the equitable discretion doctrine would militate \n     strongly against allowing congressional standing. This is not \n     like the Pocket Veto cases where the Executive has allegedly \n     ``nullified'' a Member's vote; here it is Congress itself \n     that is taking the challenged action. If the doctrine of \n     ``equitable discretion'' has any force, it should apply to \n     limit judicial actions by individual Members who wish to \n     challenge enforcement of the Congress' own budgetary \n     decisions, since the real grievance of the congressional \n     plaintiffs in such a case would be the failure to persuade \n     their fellow legislators of the correctness of their point of \n     view. See Moore v. United States House of Representatives, \n     733 F.2d 946, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. \n     1106 (1985); Riegle v. Federal Open Market Comm., 656 F.2d \n     873, 881 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1082 (1981).\n    \n    \n       It is obvious from this discussion that I view Article \n     III's standing requirement as a principal safeguard against \n     undue judicial activism in this area. But I would be the last \n     to say that the standing doctrine is an ironclad shield \n     against judicial activism. The doctrine is malleable and it \n     has been manipulated by the courts in the past. There is a \n     clear trend, however, toward narrowing the parameters of \n     constitutional standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n     supra; Valley Forge Christian College, supra. Furthermore, we \n     can anticipate that the congressional budgetary process is \n     not likely to be a field where the courts would be eager to \n     stretch the doctrine. The federal budget and the public debt \n     limits do not typically implicate sensitive individual \n     rights, and thus there may be less temptation for courts to \n     apply the standing requirements more loosely. In addition, \n     courts are not expert at fathoming the ins and outs of \n     budgetary arcana, and there is no reason to think they would \n     be so inclined to enter that thicket as to manipulate \n     standing principles to do so. Nevertheless, the possibility \n     remains. One way to minimize the risk of such judicial \n     activism is for Congress to take care in the wording of any \n     particular statutes that are enacted in implementing the \n     Amendment so as not to give rise to colorable claims of \n     standing or private rights of action.\n       Before moving on, I should also point out for the Committee \n     one area that I believe does hold some potential for mischief \n     and that Congress may wish to address. That is the area of \n     state court review. The constraints of Article III do not, of \n     course, apply to state courts, which are courts of general \n     jurisdiction. State courts are not bound by the ``case or \n     controversy'' requirement or the other justiciability \n     principles, even when deciding issues of federal law, \n     including the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. \n     Asarco, Inc., 490 U.S. at 617. Accordingly, it is possible \n     that a state court could entertain a challenge to a federal \n     statute under the Balanced Budget Amendment despite the fact \n     that the plaintiffs would not satisfy the requirements for \n     standing in federal court. Absent an applicable provision in \n     federal law for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts, \n     the state court in such a circumstance would have the \n     authority to render a binding legal judgment. Ibid. The only \n     avenue for federal review would be by certiorari to the \n     Supreme Court, which has held that it may exercise its \n     discretionary jurisdiction in such cases ``if the judgment of \n     the state court causes direct, specific, and concrete injury \n     to the parties who petition for * * * review, where the \n     requisites of a case or controversy are also met.'' Id. at \n     623-24.\n       To avoid the possibility that a federal statute or the \n     federal budgetary process itself might be entangled in such a \n     state court challenge, I would suggest that Congress include \n     a provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction in any \n     implementing legislation enacted pursuant to section 6 of the \n     Amendment. Such a provision should be carefully worded so as \n     not to create inadvertently any implied right of judicial \n     review in federal court and so as not to affect any of the \n     otherwise applicable limitations on justiciability discussed \n     in this statement.\n\n\n                         ii. judicial deference\n\n       Let me now turn to the second factor that will constrain \n     judicial overreaching. In those cases where standing is \n     established and the court proceeds to review the merits of a \n     claim under the Balanced Budget Amendment, there is no reason \n     to believe that the court would readily second-guess \n     decisions made by the political branches. On the contrary, \n     following long-established doctrine, as well as the \n     Amendment's own explicit dictates, a reviewing court is \n     likely to accord the utmost deference to the choices made by \n     Congress in carrying out its responsibilities under the \n     Amendment.\n       This judicial deference would be strongest in cases \n     challenging the implementing mechanisms adopted by Congress. \n     The Balanced Budget Amendment, in essence, mandates certain \n     results (balanced budgets and capped debt) and leaves it to \n     Congress to put in place mechanisms to achieve those results. \n     It is well-established that where the Constitution requires a \n     certain ``end,'' Congress will be given the widest latitude \n     in selecting ``means'' to achieve that end. Thus, for \n     example, the courts have accorded broad deference to Congress \n     in its selection of appropriate enforcement mechanisms under \n     section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Katzenbach v. \n     Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966). And in the context of the \n     apportionment process, where the Constitution mandates in \n     fairly precise terms that Representatives shall be \n     apportioned among the several States ``according to their \n     respective Numbers'' (Art. I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3), the Supreme \n     Court has deferred to Congress' choice of the method for \n     apportionment, even though a State adversely affected could \n     demonstrate that another method might yield a more accurate \n     result. See U.S. Dep't of Commerce v. Montana, 112 S. Ct. \n     1415, 1429 (1992).\n       The need for deference would be even more compelling in \n     cases under the Balanced Budget Amendment, since the language \n     of the Amendment explicitly confers on Congress, in mandatory \n     terms, the responsibility for implementing the Amendment and \n     specifically allows Congress in so doing to ``rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts'' (emphasis added). Unless \n     the implementing and enforcement provisions adopted by \n     Congress are plainly incompatible with the Amendment, it is \n     unlikely a court would substitute its judgment for choices \n     made by Congress.\n       Even in challenges to specific budgetary actions--for \n     example, a claim that a particular spending measure threatens \n     to unbalanced the budget--the courts would tend to defer to \n     the judgments of the political branches, except where a \n     constitutional violation is clear. Not only do courts start \n     with the general presumption that Congress has acted \n     constitutionally, see Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. \n     Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 729 (1984), but that general rule \n     of deference is substantially reinforced by the Amendment's \n     explicit assignment of implementation responsibility to \n     Congress in section 6, including the express recognition that \n     Congress may rely on estimates--a process \n      [[Page S2726]] that inherently involves discretionary and \n     expert judgments. It is precisely when reviewing these kinds \n     of technical fiscal issues--matters uniquely within the \n     province and expertise of the political branches--where the \n     courts are most inclined to defer to the sound judgment of \n     the Congress and the Executive.\n       In sum, then, even where the courts reach the merits of a \n     claim under the Balanced Budget Amendment, we are far more \n     likely to see deference to Congress than heavy-handed second-\n     guessing by the courts. This is not to say that courts will \n     ignore clear instances of abuse; however, it is precisely in \n     such cases--in which the violations are not arguable but \n     palpable--where judicial intervention is most appropriate.\n\n\n                  ii. limitations on judicial remedies\n\n       For the reason outlined above, I am confident the courts \n     will entertain very few suits challenging congressional \n     actions under the Balanced Budget Amendment, and that, when \n     and if they do, the courts will be inclined to defer to the \n     judgments of Congress and the\n      Executive in the budget area. Assuming, however, that a \n     court might entertain such a suit and might declare a \n     particular budgetary action unconstitutional as a \n     violation of the Amendment, there are still further \n     judicial constraints making it unlikely a court will order \n     intrusive remedies in such a case. As I see it, these \n     constraints fall into two categories: prudential \n     considerations that will limit a court's exercise of its \n     remedial powers and limitations created by section 6 of \n     the Amendment itself.\n       First, courts are appropriately wary of becoming too deeply \n     involved in superintending decisions and processes that are \n     essentially legislative in character, and for that reason, \n     any court--most certainly the Supreme Court--will hesitate to \n     impose remedies that could embroil it in the supervision of \n     the budgetary process. Indeed, in the context of the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment, the choice of any specific remedy--for \n     example, an order specifying a particular adjustment of \n     expenditures to bring the federal budget back into compliance \n     with the Amendment--would invariably require the court to \n     displace Congress by making a policy decision that is \n     inherently legislative and therefore inappropriate for the \n     courts. I believe it far more likely that a court faced with \n     a violation of the Amendment would take the less intrusive \n     route of simply declaring the particular action at issue \n     unconstitutional and leaving it to Congress to choose the \n     appropriate remedy.\n    \n    \n       There are plenty of cases in which the Supreme Court has \n     followed this route. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 \n     U.S. 1 (1976), the Court declared the composition of the \n     Federal Election Commission unconstitutional as a violation \n     of the Appointments Clause, but stayed the Court's judgment \n     to ``afford Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the \n     Commission by law or to adopt other valid enforcement \n     mechanisms'' that would remedy the violation. Id. at 143. And \n     recently, in Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 113 S. Ct. \n     2510 (1993), where the Court refused to order refund of the \n     amounts improperly collected and held instead that the \n     fashioning of an appropriate remedy was properly left to \n     state authorities. See id. 2519-20.\n       Even in cases where there has been a proven violation of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court has required the same \n     respect for a legislature's ability to devise remedies \n     involving the exercise of the legislature's taxing authority. \n     In Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), the Court \n     confirmed that ``the imposition of a tax increase by a \n     federal court,'' even as a remedy for racial segregation by a \n     state school district, must be ``an extraordinary event.'' \n     Id. at 51. ``In assuming for itself the fundamental and \n     delicate power of taxation,'' the Court held, ``the District \n     Court not only intruded on local authority but circumvented \n     it altogether. Before taking such a drastic step the District \n     Court was obliged to assure itself that no permissible \n     alternative would have accomplished the required task.'' \n     Ibid. According to the Court, ``the very complexity of the \n     problems of financing and managing a * * * public school \n     system suggests that * * * the legislature's efforts to \n     tackle the problems should be entitled to respect'' and that \n     ``local officials should at least have the opportunity to \n     devise their own solutions to these problems.'' Id. at 52 \n     (internal quotation marks removed). The Court in Jenkins \n     upheld the district court's power to order a local school \n     district to levy its own taxes because such a levy was the \n     only means by which the school district could raise funds \n     adequate to comply with the court's desegration order. See \n     id. at 55-58. That could never be the case with any potential \n     violation of the Balanced Budget Amendment, which imposes a \n     cap on spending and the public debt, rather than an \n     obligation to raise revenues. There will always be a myriad \n     of policy choices available to Congress for avoiding \n     infringement of the budget cap.\n       Jenkins is also readily distinguishable from the context of \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment on the ground that Jenkins did \n     not involve ``an instance of one branch of the Federal \n     Government invading the province of another,'' but instead \n     involved a court order ``that brings the weight of federal \n     authority upon a local government and a State.'' Id. at 67 \n     (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \n     judgment). The distinction is critical because under Article \n     I, Section 1, ``[a]ll legislative Powers'' granted under the \n     Federal Constitution are vested in Congress, and the \n     enumeration of legislative powers begins by providing that \n     ``[t]he Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes'' \n     (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1). Based on these provisions, the Court \n     has stated that ``[t]axation is a legislative function, and \n     Congress * * * is the sole organ for levying taxes.'' \n     National Cable Television Ass'n v. United States, 415 U.S.C. \n     336, 340 (1974). See Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. at 67 \n     (Kennedy, J.).\n       A second source of limitations on the courts' exercise of \n     their remedial powers is found in the Amendment itself. Under \n     section 6, which provides that ``[t]he Congress shall enforce \n     and implement this article by appropriate legislation,'' \n     Congress will have the authority to adopt remedies for any \n     purported violation of the Amendment. Congress, for example, \n     could provide for correcting a threatened budget imbalance or \n     overspending through sequestration, rescission or other \n     devices. In addition, section 6 logically gives Congress the \n     power to limit the types of remedies that might be ordered by \n     a court. This power is consistent with Article III's \n     delegation of authority to Congress to define and limit the \n     jurisdiction of the federal courts, and would allow Congress, \n     for example, to deny courts the ability to order injunctive \n     relief for violations of the Amendment. Congress has adopted \n     such limitations in other contexts. See, e.g., Norris-\n     LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101-115 (prohibiting \n     courts from entering injunctions in labor disputes); Federal \n     Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2283 (prohibiting federal \n     courts from enjoining state court proceedings); Tax \n     Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7421(a) (prohibiting suits to \n     restrain the assessment or collection of taxes).\n       These powers given to Congress will compound the courts' \n     self-imposed prudential concerns, with the result that the \n     courts will be even more hesitant to order intrusive remedies \n     for ostensible violations of the Amendment. Courts regularly \n     defer to remedies that have been crafted by Congress. This \n     deference is shown even in cases involving the vindication of \n     individual rights. The Supreme Court, for example, has held \n     that Congress may adopt procedures limiting the remedies \n     available in so-called Bivens actions, which are actions \n     brought against federal officials for the violation of an \n     individual's constitutional rights. See Bush v. Lucas, 462 \n     U.S. 367, 388-90 (1983). Similarly, in devising a judge-made \n     remedy for violations of the Fifth Amendment privilege \n     against self-incrimination in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. \n     436 (1966), the Court recognized that ``Congress and the \n     States are free to develop their own safeguards'' to redress \n     violations of the privilege and that such alternative \n     remedies woud be respected by the courts. See id. at 490. \n     Moreover, even if Congress does not exercise the authority \n     granted to it under section 6, the courts will undoubtedly be \n     aware of Congress' ability to limit the relief that courts \n     may grant, and this awareness in and of itself will likely \n     check any tendency on the part of the courts to develop their \n     own creative remedies for violation of the balanced budget \n     requirement.\n\n\n                      IV. The Amendment's Efficacy\n\n       Some have suggested that the federal courts' limited role \n     in enforcing the Balanced Budget Amendment makes the \n     Amendment a ``paper tiger.'' Their premise is that, unless \n     the courts are there to coerce compliance at every turn, the \n     political banches will flout their constitutional \n     responsibilities. These critics do not argue for a greater \n     role for the courts so much as they dismiss the Amendment as \n     a feckless exercise. In my view, this critique is mistaken: \n     it is based on a distorted view of the Constitution and \n     ignores the practical experience of over two centuries.\n       First, of course, the point is not that the courts will \n     never be there; it is that we need not fear an avalanche of \n     litigation, with the courts regularly reviewing fiscal \n     decisions and effectively usurping the proper functions of \n     the political branches. Where the judicial power can properly \n     be invoked, it will most likely be reserved to address \n     serious and clearcut violations.\n       More importantly, Members of Congress and Presidents seek \n     to conform their actions to constitutional norms, not because \n     of external threats of judicial coercion, but primarily \n     because of their own difelity to constitutional prinicples. \n     After all, it is not only judges who must take an oath of \n     allegiance to the Constitution. Just as the vast majority of \n     citizens obey the law because they wanted to--not because \n     they fear the police--so too those who serve in the political \n     branches feel constrained by constitutional requirements and \n     strive to obey them, whether backed by judicial sanction or \n     not. Congress, for example, has dutifully provided for a \n     census every ten years since the 1790s, as required by the \n     Constitution, without court order. Even in an area as \n     unreviewable and murky as the War Powers, the political \n     branches strive to comply with constitutional norms. And the \n     Senate has always administered responsibly its sole power to \n     try cases of impeachment, without allowing such trials to \n     degenerate into Kangaroo courts, even though the exercise of \n     that power is not subject to the check of judicial review. \n     See Nixon v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 732 (1993). As Judge \n     Williams put it in the Nixon case:\n       ``If the Senate should ever be ready to abdicate its \n     responsibilities to schoolchildren, or, moved by Caligula's \n     appointment of his horse as senator, to an elephant from the \n     National Zoo, the republic will have sunk to \n      [[Page S2727]] depths from which no court could rescue it. \n     And if the senators try to ignore the clear requirement of a \n     two-thirds vote for conviction, they will have to contend \n     with public outrage that will ultimately impose its sanction \n     at the ballot box. Absent judicial review, the Senate takes \n     sole responsibility for its impeachment procedures as a full-\n     fledged constitutional actor, just as the framers intended.'' \n     Nixon v. United States, 938 F.2d 239, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1991) \n     (footnote omitted), aff'd, 113 S. Ct. 732 (1993).\n       For over 200 years, day after day, the business of \n     government has gone forward in prescribed channels, with \n     judicial enforcement the exception, not the rule. The \n     Balanced Budget Amendment will be effective without judges \n     hovering at Congress' elbow; the Congress will carry it out \n     and it will achieve its intended results.\n       Finally, we can rest assured that the Amendment will be \n     policed through the most effective enforcement mechanism of \n     all--the watchfulness and wrath of the American people. After \n     all, the requirements of the Balanced Budget Amendment are \n     not like those of the Appointments Clause or the Emoluments, \n     Clause, which could be violated with virtually no political \n     fallout. Rather, they touch upon one of the core political \n     concerns of the people. Does anyone seriously maintain that \n     Congress could thumb its nose at a constitutional balanced \n     budget requirement with impunity? Or play fast-and-loose with \n     it and escape political retribution? It is precisely in areas \n     like this, where the political check is so potent, that we \n     can safely trust in its efficacy.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Statement of Griffin B. Bell, Senate Judiciary Committee, Balanced \n         Budget Amendment to the Constitution, January 5, 1995\n\n       The missing element in our constitutional system is the \n     absence of a provision requiring a balanced budget, provided \n     reasonable safeguards are in place to protect the national \n     defense and to assure the national interest in the event of a \n     depression.\n       Almost all the states have a balanced budget requirement in \n     their respective State Constitutions. This is the safeguard \n     which assures State financing only for services which are \n     within the states' abilities to pay.\n       The federal government completely controls the money \n     machine in the sense that it can borrow funds without limit. \n     There is no inherent self-discipline built into the system. \n     The only limit on federal spending is in the collective will \n     of the Congress and the President. The federal debt is now so \n     high that the country is, in effect, under normal rules, in \n     bankruptcy. But the federal government does not have to \n     declare bankruptcy. It can continue to borrow money to pay \n     the interest on the debt and to continue to borrow money over \n     and above the principal amount already owed. We long ago \n     began using Social Security taxes as a part of the general \n     fund to support this debt load, contrary to the belief of \n     most Americans that Social Security taxes were being put into \n     a trust fund for their future needs.\n       Without a constitutional restraint, there is no hope \n     whatever of paying off the present debt, much less for \n     stopping the creation of additional debt. We should be \n     thankful for today's low interest rates, else we would have a \n     greater economic crisis on our hands.\n       In the famous letters between Lord McCaulay of England and \n     Henry Stevens Randall, the first Jefferson biographer, and in \n     particularly the letter dated May 23, 1857, Lord McCaulay \n     expressed concerns about the lack of controls on the fisc.\n       He said, and I quote: ``I seriously apprehend that you \n     will, in [a] season of adversity . . . do things which will \n     prevent prosperity from returning; that you will act like \n     people who [would], in a year of scarcity, devour all the \n     seed corn, and thus make the next year a year, not of \n     scarcity, but of absolute famine. There will be, I fear, \n     spoilation. The spoilation will increase the distress. The \n     distress will produce fresh spoilation. There is nothing to \n     stop you. Your Constitution is all sail and no anchor.''\n       McCaulay was correct. Without a constitutional amendment \n     requiring a balanced budget, our Constitution truly is all \n     sail and no anchor. The lack of an anchor has placed our \n     country in the peril that it is now in because of our \n     monstrous and increasing debt and ever escalating \n     entitlements.\n       I have never heard anyone suggest that we begin to pay off \n     our debt. It would not be out of reason to set the debt aside \n     and retire it on a sinking fund basis, just as is done with \n     state and municipal bonds at the present time. The debt could \n     be gradually reduced once the budget is balanced by including \n     a payment on the principal of the debt, thus reducing \n     interest payments which make up a large part of our federal \n     budget.\n       In this way, we would pay the debt of our own generation, \n     rather than transferring it to our children and \n     grandchildren.\n       The other example of lack of discipline on the part of our \n     law makers is the cost-of-living index and its impact on the \n     debt. The cost-of-living index is a self-fulfilling prophecy \n     for annual inflation, particularly when the cost-of-living \n     index seems to produce a figure which is always higher as to \n     most people than actual inflation. The Congress can revamp \n     the cost-of-living index to make it the same or less than the \n     actual rate of inflation. This alone would go a long way \n     toward bringing the budget in balance over a few years.\n       There is something sinister about basing entitlements of \n     all kinds on an automatic cost-of-living index, particularly \n     when the index is higher than the actual inflation. This is a \n     giveaway scheme of the worst sort and exceeds any reasonable \n     basis of governing.\n       Thus, a combination of a balanced budget amendment to our \n     Constitution, with savings on interest over time and with a \n     gradual reduction in debt principal, coupled with an \n     adjustment of the cost-of-living index will restore fiscal \n     sanity to our government.\n       We must begin to speak in plain English when referring to \n     our debt. It will not do to speak of mere reductions in the \n     deficits as savings.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 The Lincoln Legal Foundation,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 5, 1992.\n     Hon. L.F. Payne,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Payne: On behalf of the Lincoln Legal Foundation, \n     let me extend my thanks to you for providing this opportunity \n     to comment on the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment outlined \n     in H.J. Res. 290. We at the Foundation take pride in serving \n     as advocates for the broad public interest in defending \n     liberty, free enterprise, and the separation of powers. It is \n     in this capacity that we have undertaken our evaluation of \n     the proposed Amendment.\n       We have confined our remarks to the prospects for judicial \n     enforcement of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Critics have \n     charged that the Amendment will unleash an avalanche of \n     litigation, thereby paving the way for the micro-management \n     of budgetary policy by the federal judiciary. As defenders of \n     the Madisonian system of checks and balances, we at the \n     Foundation take such charges seriously and have scrutinized \n     them in light of the relevant case law.\n       We begin with a brief overview of standing doctrine and its \n     impact on the justiciability of the proposed Amendment. We \n     then consider the political question doctrine and the \n     barriers it creates to judicial review. We conclude with our \n     recommendations for refining and implementing the Amendment.\n\n\n            i. standing under the balanced budget amendment\n\n       Standing refers to a plaintiff's interest in the issue \n     being litigated. Generally speaking, in order to have \n     standing a plaintiff must have a direct, individualized \n     interest in the outcome of the controversy at hand. Persons \n     airing generalized grievances, common to the public at large, \n     invariably lack standing.\n       Limitations on standing stem from two sources. Article III \n     Section II of the Constitution restricts the jurisdiction of \n     the federal judiciary to ``cases'' and ``controversies.'' As \n     a result, only plaintiffs with a personal stake in the \n     outcome of a particular case have standing to litigate. The \n     general prohibition against advisory opinions also can be \n     traced to Article III.\n       In addition to Article III restrictions, federal courts \n     have outlined certain ``prudential'' restrictions on \n     standing, premised on non-constitutional policy judgments \n     regarding the proper role of the judiciary Unlike Article III \n     restrictions on standing, prudential restrictions may be \n     altered or overridden by Congress.\n       Standing requirements under the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will vary according to the type of litigant. \n     Potential litigants fall into three categories: (1) Members \n     of Congress, (2) Aggrieved Persons (e.g. persons whose \n     government benefits are reduced or eliminated by operation of \n     the Amendment), and (3) Taxpayers.\n\n                         A. Members of Congress\n\n       The federal courts by and large have denied standing to \n     members of Congress to litigate issues relating to their role \n     as legislators.\\1\\ Only when an executive action has deprived \n     members of their constitutional right to vote on a \n     legislative matter has standing been granted.\\2\\\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n       Accordingly, Members of Congress are unlikely to have \n     standing under the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment, unless \n     they can claim to have been disenfranchised in their \n     legislative capacity. Assuming that Congress does not ignore \n     the procedural requirements set forth in the Amendment, the \n     potential for such disenfranchisement seems remote.\n\n                          B. Aggrieved persons\n\n       Standing also seems doubtful for persons whose government \n     benefits or other payments from the Treasury are affected by \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment. In order to attain standing, \n     such persons must meet the following Article III \n     requirements: (1) They must have sustained an actual or \n     threatened injury; (2) Their injury must be traceable to the \n     governmental action in question; and (3) The federal courts \n     must be capable of redressing the injury.\\3\\\n       Assuming a plaintiff could meet the first two requirements, \n     he still must show that the federal courts are capable of \n     dispensing a remedy. Judicial relief could take the form of \n     either a declaratory judgment or an injunction. A declaratory \n     judgment, stating that Congress has acted in an \n     unconstitutional manner, would do little to redress the \n     plaintiff's injury. On the other hand, injunctive relief \n     could pose a serious threat to the separation of powers.\n       For example, an injunction ordering Congress to reinstate \n     funding for a particular program would substantially infringe \n     upon \n      [[Page S2728]] Congress's legislative authority. Similarly, \n     an injunction ordering all government agencies to reduce \n     their expenditures by a uniform percentage - would undermine \n     the independence of the Executive Branch. It is unlikely that \n     the present Supreme Court would uphold a remedy that so \n     blatantly exceeds the scope of judicial authority outlined in \n     Article III.\n\n                              C. Taxpayers\n\n       Taxpayers may have a better chance of attaining standing \n     under the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment. Traditionally, \n     the federal courts refused to recognize taxpayer standing. \n     However, in 1968 the Warren Court held in Flast v. Cohen that \n     a taxpayer plaintiff does have standing to challenge \n     Congress's taxing and spending decisions if the plaintiff can \n     establish a logical nexus between his status as a taxpayer \n     and his legal claim.\\4\\\n       The logical nexus text consists of two distinct elements. \n     First, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the congressional \n     action in question was taken pursuant to the Taxing and \n     Spending Clause of Article I Section 8 of the Constitution. \n     Second, the plaintiff must show that the statute in question \n     violates a specific constitutional restraint on Congress's \n     taxing and spending power.\\5\\\n       Taxpayers suing under the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment probably could meet both prongs of the logical \n     nexus test.\\6\\ In order to satisfy the first prong, potential \n     litigants would have to tailor their complaint to challenge \n     the unconstitutional enactment of a law by Congress (e.g. an \n     appropriations bill), not the unconstitutional execution of a \n     law by the Executive. Litigants could satisfy the second \n     prong by demonstrating that the statute in question violates \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment, an express restriction on \n     Congress's taxing and spending power.\n       Even if a taxpayer satisfies Flast's logical nexus test, \n     more recent opinions like Valley Forge suggest that the \n     Supreme Court also would expect taxpayer plaintiffs to \n     fulfill the Article III standing requirements. In other \n     words, in order to have standing, a taxpayer would have to \n     demonstrate that he has sustained an actual or threatened \n     injury traceable to a specific congressional action.\n       In theory, a taxpayer could claim that excess spending in \n     violation of the Balanced Budget Amendment will harm him by \n     undermining the national economy or by increasing the \n     national debt. However, a majority of the Supreme Court \n     probably would find the connection between the excess \n     spending and the alleged injuries too tenuous to grant \n     standing. As a result, standing would be limited to taxpayers \n     with concrete injuries, stemming directly from the \n     congressional action in question.\n         ii. the amendment and the political question doctrine\n\n       Even if a litigant attained standing under the proposed \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, a federal court could refuse to \n     hear the case on the grounds that it raises a political \n     question. The leading case with respect to political \n     questions remains Baker v. Carr.\\7\\ In Baker, the Supreme \n     court held that the constitutionality of a state legislative \n     apportionment scheme did not raise a political question. In \n     doing so, the Court identified a number of contexts in which \n     political questions may arise.\n       Foremost among these are situations in which the text of \n     the Constitution expressly commits the resolution of a \n     particular issue to a coordinate branch of government. The \n     Judicial Branch will refrain from adjudicating an issue in \n     such circumstances. However, this textual constraint would \n     not preclude judicial review of the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, since H.J. Res. 290 does not assign responsibility \n     for enforcing the Amendment to either the President or the \n     Congress.\n       The Baker court also identified the following prudential \n     consideration in deciding whether to invoke the political \n     question doctrine as a bar to judicial review:\\8\\\n       (A) Is there a lack of discernable or manageable judicial \n     standards for resolving the issue?\n       (B) Can the court resolve the issue without making an \n     initial policy determination that falls outside the scope of \n     judicial authority?\n       (C) Can the court resolve the issue without expressing a \n     lack of respect for the coordinate branches of government?\n       (D) Will judicial intervention result in multifarious \n     pronouncements on the same issue from different branches of \n     government?\n       Each of these considerations creates an impediment to \n     judicial review of the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment. In \n     particular, courts may find the fiscal subject matter of the \n     Amendment difficult to administer. For example, what happens \n     if ``estimated receipts'' fall short of projections halfway \n     through a fiscal year? On what data and accounting methods \n     would the courts be expected to rely? Given the lack of \n     concrete standards, apparently rudimentary determinations \n     (e.g. When do ``total outlays'' exceed ``estimated \n     receipts''?) may prove beyond the competence of the \n     judiciary.\n       Moreover, the potential judicial remedies for violations of \n     the Amendment may undermine the separation of powers. As \n     discussed above, various forms of injunctive relief almost \n     certainly would infringe upon the prerogatives of Congress \n     and the Executive Branch. Given the Supreme Court's \n     structuralistic adherence to the separation of powers \n     doctrine in cases like I.N.S. v. Chadha\\9\\ and Bowsher v. \n     Synar,\\10\\ it is almost impossible to imagine a majority of \n     the justices on the present, or a future, Court jumping at \n     the opportunity to become embroiled in a partisan wrangle \n     over the size and scope of the federal budget. Instead, one \n     would expect the Court to make every effort to avoid such an \n     intrusion.\n\n\n                            iii. conclusions\n\n       The constraints imposed by standing requirements and the \n     political question doctrine by no means preclude judicial \n     review of the Balanced Budget Amendment. Nevertheless, they \n     do place substantial barriers to litigation. In light of \n     these impediments, the Foundation believes that the prospects \n     for a flood of new litigation and the specter of budgeting by \n     judicial fiat have been greatly exaggerated.\n       The Amendment proposed in H.J. Res. 290 would clearly \n     invite judicial review of any spending or taxing legislation \n     purportedly enacted in violation of the formal requirements \n     (e.g. a supermajority for increasing the debt limit, a full \n     majority on recorded for a tax increase) set forth in the \n     text. This is no different from the status quo, for even now \n     we would expect a court to strike down an act that was \n     somehow enrolled on the statute books without having properly \n     cleared the requisite legislative process of votes, \n     presentment, and the like.\n       What the Amendment would not do is to confer upon the \n     judiciary an authority to substitute its own judgment as to \n     the accuracy of the revenue estimates, the needfulness of \n     taxes, or the prudence of a debt limit. The courts would \n     merely police the formal aspects of the work of the political \n     branches: Did they enact a law devoted solely to an estimate \n     of receipts? Are all outlays held below that estimate? Were \n     measures passed by requisite majorities voting, when \n     required, on the record?\n       Sections 2 and 4 of the proposed amendment clearly invite \n     only limited judicial scrutiny of this kind, and then only of \n     the process, and not of the substance, by which the political \n     branches have acted?\n       Section 3 seems to be purely hortatory, and probably \n     provides no predicate at all for judicial action. Whatever \n     the political ramifications of a failure on the part of a \n     President to propose a balanced budget in any given year may \n     be, there appear to be no legal implications whatsoever. No \n     act of law-making depends in any constitutional sense upon \n     the President's compliance with this requirement, let alone \n     upon the substance that any such proposal may contain.\\11\\\n       Section 1 is the crucial text, then, but even here the \n     boundaries of justiciability would be tightly limited. A \n     purported enactment might be struck down by the courts if it \n     provided for outlays of funds in excess of the level of \n     estimated receipts established for the year in the annual \n     estimates law, or if it called for such an excessive outlay \n     without having been passed on a roll-call vote by the \n     required super-majority, or if it attempted to avoid the \n     balanced budget limit applicable to the fiscal year of its \n     enactment by purporting to be within the limits of receipts \n     estimated for another year, past or future.\n       But there is no basis in the text of Section 1 for a court \n     to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions on \n     any basis. That is, the proposed amendment would confer no \n     authority on the judiciary to choose which appropriations \n     would be satisfied from the Treasury and which would not, but \n     only to say that once outlays had reached the level \n     established in the estimates law then the officials of the \n     Treasury must cease disbursing any additional funds.\n       Because Section 6 of the proposed amendment would define \n     ``total outlays'' to ``include all outlays of the United \n     States Government except for those for repayment of debt \n     principal,'' the amendment would abolish permanent indefinite \n     appropriations, revolving funds, and the funds, such as the \n     Judgment Fund, from which they are disbursed.\\12\\ This would \n     decisively prevent the courts from invading the Federal fisc \n     in the guise of damages awards against the United States \n     Government. Upon effectuation of this amendment, damages \n     awards against the Government in all cases (except for \n     repayment of debt principal) would have to be part of the \n     outlays voted each year by Congress, and the current \n     congressional practice of waiving the sovereign immunity of \n     the United States on a blanket basis in the adjudication of \n     various kinds of damages against the Government would have to \n     end.\n       In short, it is our view that there is virtually no danger \n     that the constitutional balanced budget amendment \n     contemplated by H.J. Res. 290 would cede the power of the \n     purse to a runaway judiciary. To the contrary, it would \n     eliminate certain authorities that courts currently have to \n     order the disbursement of Federal funds without \n     appropriations. If ratified and made part of the \n     Constitution, the balanced budget amendment would return \n     responsibility and accountability for all Federal outlays \n     squarely to the Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Joseph A.

The practical and political wisdom of the practice is \n     debatable, as is the wisdom of the contents of any particular \n     budget. But the practice, even with the constitutional \n     sanction that H.J. Res. 290 would give it, in no way \n     derogates from the responsibility of Congress to account for \n     the power of the purse or from the procedural rules adopted \n     by the Framers for safeguarding the separation of powers \n     respecting the fisc, such as the requirement that bills for \n     raising revenue originate in the House of Representatives. \n     The President would now have a constitutional duty to propose \n     an annual balanced budget, but his submission would be only a \n     proposal, and the existing groundrules of Articles I and II \n     would continue to define the procedures by which laws are \n     made and the separation of powers maintained.\n     \\11\\It is our view that this would also abolish other \n     permanent indefinite appropriations arrangements and \n     revolving funds as they now stand, including those for the \n     Social Security, Medicare, and Civil Service Retirement \n     Systems. They all involve ``outlays'' within the \n     comprehensive meaning of Section 6, and so would all require \n     affirmative congressional action for each year's \n     disbursements. Congress could continue to provide that \n     outlays be made on formulaic bases (e.g., as ``formula \n     payments''), but they would be subject to the total annual \n     ceiling on outlays and mere qualification of an individual to \n     receive a payment would no longer automatically work to raise \n     the spending limit.\n     \\13\\I would like to thank Charles H.

The reason is that after almost two decades of \n     effort, the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution now \n     seems on the cusp of success before the Senate, and the BBA \n     is the focus of this hearing. I am not here today on behalf \n     of a client, but on my own.\n       I am John Armor, a constitutional lawyer who practices \n     before the Supreme Court, a former Professor of Political \n     Science, and author of several books and many articles, \n     usually on political science or constitutional law. Most \n     germane to today's hearing, I have testified for 17\\1/2\\ \n     years now before committees of state legislatures, and \n     occasionally before Congressional Committees, on legal \n     aspects of the BBA.\n       I will address three subjects, two of them briefly because \n     others will cover them in far more detail, and one at some \n     length, because others are unlikely to address it and it is \n     most important now as the Amendment seems close to passage. \n     The subjects are: the need for the BBA, the appropriateness \n     of constitutional provisions which are economic in nature, \n     and the problems and solutions on the questions of judicial \n     review under the BBA.\n\n\n               The Need for the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       All but one of the 50 states have some form of balanced \n     budget provisions in their laws. Forty-seven have provisions \n     in their constitutions; two have statutory provisions (ones \n     that they abide by, contrary to some statutory solutions \n     which Congress has tried, beginning in 1974); and one state, \n     Vermont, has no such provision. The exception proves the \n     rule; Vermont is not known as a hotbed of wild spending, \n     promoted by representatives of the tour bus and maple syrup \n     industries.\n       In all the other states, the operation of their various \n     balanced budget provisions demonstrate anew the importance of \n     institutional restraints to guide legislative behavior. \n     Madison, Hamilton and Jay put the issue most succinctly in \n     The Federalist over 200 years ago in arguing for adoption of \n     the Constitution. At that time, only the House of \n     Representatives was popularly elected. Writing about the \n     House, they said it would, ``balance the willingness to spend \n     against the reluctance to tax.''\n       There is a great deal of political and constitutional \n     wisdom in that short phrase, that Congress (no longer just \n     the House) should ``balance the willingness to spend against \n     the reluctance to tax.'' That is exactly what the balanced \n     budget amendments in the states accomplish for them. \n     Legislators are free to vote for whatever programs they \n     believe are in the interest of their constituents. But, at \n     the same time, they are obligated to impose the taxes to pay \n     for those programs.\n       Therefore, state legislators every year, or every two years \n     in Kentucky, create two sets of priorities. First are \n     priorities among spending programs--those at the bottom of \n     the list will not be approved, even through in the abstract \n     they might seem to be good ideas. Second are priorities among \n     taxation plans. The ones which are the least desirable and \n     most likely to provoke strong opposition will not be \n     approved, even though in the abstract they could raise \n     substantial funds for worthwhile programs.\n       In short, legislators become mindful of what the great \n     French Minister, Tallyrand, is credited with saying, ``The \n     art of taxation is like plucking a goose, the object is to \n     get the most feathers with the least amount of hissing.''\n       This balancing act between what legislators might want to \n     spend, and what taxes they are willing to impose, all things \n     considered, is continuous in the states. The same balancing \n     act used to be carried out annually by Congress. For 150 \n     years we operated under an unwritten constitutional standard. \n     Spending would not exceed taxes except during time of war or \n     during national emergencies amounting to what we now call \n     ``recessions'' or ``depressions.'' Once the emergency was \n     over, taxes would be used to pay down the public debt to \n     zero, or close to it.\n       We abandoned this standard fifty years ago. The \n     ``willingness to spend'' was disconnected from the \n     ``reluctance to tax'' in a process that has accelerated in \n     recent years of massive deficit\n      spending every year, not just during wars or emergencies. \n     There is no reason to blame any particular President or \n     Congress. With $4 trillion in known debt, and more than \n     that amount in unfunded, future commitments, there is \n     ample blame for all parties concerned. Ending that process \n     and restoring the connection between taxing and spending \n     is the central purpose of the BBA.\n       A major argument advanced against the BBA is that there \n     will be attempts to avoid or evade its provisions, no matter \n     how carefully they are drafted. That is absolutely true. \n     History has shown dozens of examples at the state level where \n     creative bookkeeping has been used to bail out state \n     governments which are strapped for funds but find necessary \n     choices among spending on one side and taxation on the other, \n     politically impossible. Sometimes, judicial enforcement \n     applied at the state level.\n       I urge you not to confuse the question of whether the BBA \n     will work perfectly, with the question of whether it will \n     work substantially. Consider the magnificent guarantees in \n     the First Amendment--freedom of religion, of speech, of the \n     press, and of political activity. Every one of those has been \n     repeatedly assaulted by various laws and ordinances at the \n     federal, state and local level, right from the beginnings of \n     the Republic. There were many individual failures. We once \n     had laws under which newspaper editors were jailed for \n     printing their opinions, until Jefferson became President. We \n     once had established churches supported directly by state \n     funds, until well into the 19th century.\n       I could run a long list of occasional failures of the First \n     Amendment in all four of its areas of protection. The proper \n     question about the First Amendment is not whether many \n     interests, many times, on many issues, sought to violate it. \n     It is whether the nation is much the better because it has \n     the First Amendment. By analogy, this is also the proper \n     question to ask about the BBA. Will it provide benefits to \n     the nation for the foreseeable future? If you answer that \n     question yes, then you should support it.\n       One last point. We have the example of another unwritten \n     constitutional provision that we lived by for 150 years. Once \n     it was broken, however, we wrote it into the Constitution. \n     George Washington was responsible for the fact that no limits \n     on Presidential terms were placed in the Constitution. But, \n     he was also the creator of the tradition that Presidents \n     voluntarily leave office after serving two terms. Once that \n     tradition was abrogated by FDR, we placed it in the \n     Constitution as the 22nd Amendment.\n       The same can apply to the Balanced Budget Amendment. Now \n     that the tradition has been abrogated, it can be written into \n     the language of the Constitution.\n\n\n       appropriateness of economic provisions in the constitution\n\n       The claim has often been made that the Constitution is \n     intended for broad and lofty purposes, that provisions for \n     economic programs have no place in that document. This slogan \n     sounds like it might have merit; it has superficial appeal. \n     However, as soon as one delves into the Constitution, it is \n     clear the Framers included ``economic'' provisions, whenever \n     and wherever they considered them appropriate as a matter of \n     public policy.\n       Article I, Section 2, chose to forbid taxes other than per \n     capita. We chose to reverse that decision by the 16th \n     Amendment which permitted income taxes. Article I, Section 8, \n     contains many ``economic'' clauses: the Commerce Clause, \n     gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and \n     bars the states from taxing or regulating it. (This clause \n     created the first ``common market'' among sovereign entities \n     in the history of the world. It was magnificently \n     successful.) Clauses 1 and 4, provide the right to borrow \n     money and the regulation of the value of money, with a \n     prohibition against the states minting their own money. (Many \n     states were printing their own money, prior to the adoption \n     of the Constitution. Some just ran the presses and devalued \n     their currency exactly as\n      Congress did with paper money during the American \n     Revolution, giving rise to the phrase, ``not worth a \n       Continental.'')Article VI, clause 1, is also economic, \n     providing that all debts contracted under the \n      [[Page S2730]] Confederation would remain ``valid against \n     the United States.'' Preserving the nation's reputation as \n     well as its financial stability were reasons for this clause, \n     which was hotly debated at the Philadelphia Convention of \n     1787.\n       My favorite clause to demonstrate the point is the one \n     invented by Dr. Benjamin Franklin as a result of his \n     experiences in Europe, given to James Madison, and inserted \n     in the Constitution with almost no discussion. Franklin had \n     observed that inventions and books were freely copied in \n     Europe, thereby denying those who had created them both the \n     benefits of their labors and the incentives to create more. \n     To solve that problem, Franklin invented clause 7, to secure \n     ``for limited Times to Authors and Inventors exclusive Right \n     to their respective Writings and Discoveries.''\n       There is no question that this is an ``economic'' \n     provision. Given the two century experience of the United \n     States leading the world in discoveries, inventions and \n     intellectual property, there is little doubt this clause in \n     the Constitution lies at the heart of the American economic \n     success story.\n       So, I suggest that whenever anyone claims that economic \n     provisions do not belong in the Constitution, the reply \n     should be to cite these and other provisions and reject that \n     claim out of hand. The question is not whether economic \n     provisions belong in the Constitution; it is whether the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment is a wise policy at this time in \n     our history, to be written into the Constitution.\n\n\n            judicial review of the balanced budget amendment\n\n       The subject of judicial review of the BBA has hardly been \n     addressed in the continuing public debate over the BBA. When \n     there was little chance that the Amendment would be adopted \n     any time soon, there was little reason to discuss this \n     particular consequence. The situation having changed, it is \n     now time to address this in detail.\n       Where the Constitution and applicable statutes are silent \n     about judicial review, it is left to the Supreme Court to \n     decide whether judicial review exists, and if so, what \n     remedies may the courts apply for any violations. Not only \n     can the Court set its own standards, it is also free to \n     reverse them. Witness Baker v. Carr, 369 US 186 (1962). Until \n     that case, the courts had refused to take up the ``political \n     questions'' of mal-apportioned state legislatures. In Baker, \n     it reversed itself, the consequence was 30 years and counting \n     of court orders that legislatures, city and county councils \n     reapportion themselves.\n       You could bet either, or both, of these results, if you \n     remain silent on the subject of judicial review of the BBA.\n       This discussion is based on five assumptions about the \n     results that this Committee, the whole Senate, and the whole \n     Congress may have in mind about judicial review of the BBA. \n     If any of my assumptions are incorrect, I trust I will \n     promptly stand corrected. The assumptions are:\n       1. There should be judicial review of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment.\n       2. It should be brought about by a single set of \n     responsible parties.\n       3. Enforcement should be extremely swift.\n       4. Courts should not be involved in choosing between \n     different government programs in enforcing the Amendment. All \n     such policy judgments should be left to Congress.\n       5. Courts should be prohibited from enforcing the BBA by \n     judicial imposition of new taxes.\n       Under both Article III, Section I, and under the enabling \n     clause that has been added to the BBA. Congress has the power \n     by legislation to remove, create, or shape the Supreme \n     Court's jurisdiction for review of the BBA. This is a process \n     well known to this Subcommittee; its heritage\n      traces back to the Judiciary Act of 1789. Only the original \n     jurisdiction of the Court as declared in Article III, \n     clause 2 is outside this statutory authority of Congress.\n       So, you can pass a statute which states what the judicial \n     review of the BBA shall be, and what remedies can be applied. \n     By making those exclusive, you can rule out any other forms \n     of judicial review or remedies. The process of judicial \n     review of the BBA and remedies applied will then be exactly \n     what you say it should be--no more, no less.\n       To assure only one case, brought by responsible parties, \n     you could provide that any six Senators, or any 25 \n     Representatives, or any three Governors, could bring an \n     action in the Supreme Court if they felt that the BBA had \n     been violated, or was about to be violated if no budget was \n     passed by the first day of the new fiscal year. On the filing \n     of the case, all other Senators, Representatives and \n     Governors would be informed and would be welcome to join the \n     case on either side as they deemed fit.\n       You do not want thousands of citizens represented by \n     thousands of tin horn lawyers, rushing into courts across the \n     nation to bring their disparate cases to enforce the BBA. By \n     this mechanism you can prevent that. The minimum numbers of \n     Senators, Representatives or Governors to bring the action \n     should be a significant number but a minority, similar to \n     provisions in the Rules of both Houses that protect the \n     interests of minorities, but not necessarily minorities of \n     one.\n       Placing the case in the Supreme Court, plus providing that \n     the Court must hear the case in 30 days and issue its \n     decision not more than 15 days thereafter, would assure \n     expeditious consideration. The Court would be free, as it has \n     in many of the previous 200 original jurisdiction cases, to \n     appoint Special Masters for fact-finding purposes, with their \n     conclusions subject to challenge before the whole Court.\n       In order to prevent either judicially-ordered taxes or \n     Court selection between competing programs and public \n     policies, the remedies from the Court could be restricted as \n     follows: (A) The Court could determine only that the budget \n     was, or was not, in balance, and (B) the exact dollar amount \n     of the projected year's income, assuming there is no \n     declaration of war, and Congress has not acted by the supra-\n     majority to remove the budget from the scope of the \n     Amendment. (C) The Court could then order only an across-the-\n     board cut in all programs without exception in the percentage \n     required. In other words, if the Court found that the budget \n     was out of balance by 3.4%, its only remedy would be to order \n     a 3.4% cut in all programs.\n       This point is extremely important. Having spent 17 years \n     talking with Members of Congress and with members of state \n     legislators on the subject of the BBA, I believe there is an \n     overwhelming feeling that the Supreme Court should not be \n     involved in choosing between closing down an Air Force base \n     or cutting Aunt Tilly's social security check. That sort of \n     policy judgment should always be made by elected \n     representatives of the people in each level of government.\n       Once the Court had ordered an across-the-board cut, \n     Congress would then have 20 days to act by statute to adjust \n     the cuts on a policy basis, making greater cuts in some \n     programs, less in others, by staying within the total dollar \n     amount declared by the Court. If Congress fails to act, or if \n     it acts but violates the Amendment a second time, then the \n     Court-ordered across-the-board cuts would be final for that \n     fiscal year.\n       Congress should have one bite at the apple to make those \n     policy judgments between competing programs, after a \n     declaration of violation of the BBA. But, it should be only \n     one bite, otherwise, every budget could be wrapped up in \n     eternal litigation, every year.\n       Lastly, what happens if Congress fails to pass a budget by \n     the first day of the fiscal year? Then the Court should have \n     the power to examine the taxes then in effect, and determine \n     the dollar amount that those taxes would raise in the coming \n     year. The amount would be the cap. All programs would be \n     presumed to continue at their current levels of funding \n     (exactly what Congress\n      itself does in Continuing Resolutions). The Court would \n     determine whether that did, or did not, result in balance. \n     Again, Congress would have 20 days to make policy-based \n       adjustments.I am deliberately not trying to write or offer \n     precise language. You and your staff are far better able to \n     do that. However, approaches such as those outlined could \n     accomplish all the basic purposes that are covered in the \n     assumptions, stated above.\n       One last point about when such statutory provisions should \n     be passed. Most of my time on this subject over the last 17 \n     years has been spent with state legislators, both in hearings \n     and often in far-reaching, challenging conversations about \n     ramifications of the BBA. If you intend to establish by \n     statute the parameters of judicial review and remedies, you \n     should pass that statute at the same time you pass the BBA \n     and send it out for ratification.\n       Some of the more far-sighted state legislators are engaging \n     in the same process you are, asking themselves what might the \n     Supreme Court do, or not do, to enforce the BBA. They are \n     especially concerned with two areas--judicially-imposed \n     taxes, and judicially-made choices between different policies \n     and programs. If you pass the statute now, or very soon after \n     you promulgate the BBA for ratification, you will satisfy \n     state legislators, first, that judicial review will occur, \n     and second, that judicial enforcement will not get into \n     either of these areas of grave concern.\n       If you do not pass such a statute within a few months of \n     promulgating the Amendment, you will engender serious \n     concerns among the state legislators about whether you will \n     ultimately do that, and if so, what provisions you will \n     choose to include. Recalling that ratification requires the \n     approval of 38 state legislatures, or ratifying conventions \n     elected in 38 states under the other Article V method, you \n     will endanger the ratification of the BBA if you do not \n     provide review statute so state legislators can read it side \n     by side with the text of your BBA.\n       There may be other aspects of enabling legislation that you \n     may want, but do not choose to address until and unless the \n     states ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. Your own \n     considerations and reflections, together with the responses \n     of the states as they ratify, might be valuable in writing \n     that legislation. However, on judicial review itself, I \n     strongly urge you to consider, write and pass that \n     legislation as soon as possible, once you decide to pass the \n     BBA itself.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       You have 200 years of history at the state and local level \n     about the importance of making the tough decisions about \n     taxing and spending, about ``balancing the willingness to \n     spend against the reluctance to tax.'' You also have 150 \n     years of experience here in Congress on the same point. If \n     that satisfies you that the nation needs the BBA in the \n     Constitution, now is the time to act.\n        [[Page S2731]] You should not be reluctant to act on the \n     grounds that this is an ``economic'' provision. The \n     Constitution has many other provisions intended to effect the \n     economy of the United States, ones which in the fullness of \n     world history have been proven to be basic in the \n     organization of any competent national economy. Consider the \n     fact that Dr. Franklin's invention of the Patents and \n     Trademark clause has become regional through NAFTA, and may \n     shortly become global through GATT. Economic provisions \n     belong in our Constitution, provided they are the right ones \n     for the nation at the right time in our history-whether the \n     year is 1787 or 1994.\n       Lastly, you should be concerned with judicial enforcement \n     of the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it is correct to place \n     the Amendment in the Constitution, it is also correct to \n     guarantee both that if will be enforced, and to prevent forms \n     of enforcement that would undercut the essential purposes of \n     Congress, namely decisions on taxation and on competing \n     public policies. Fortunately, the Constitution gives Congress \n     the power to shape judicial enforcement to accomplish both \n     purposes.\n       I welcome your questions on this complex subject with \n     complex ramifications.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, DC]\n\n           Balanced Budget Amendment: The Role of the Courts\n\n       Some lawmakers and commentators have raised questions about \n     the enforcement of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution. A primary concern is that Congressional efforts \n     to meet the balanced budget requirement would be challenged \n     in the courts, and the judiciary would be thrust into a non-\n     judicial role of weighing policy demands, slashing programs \n     and increasing taxes.\n       On the other hand, there is a legitimate and necessary role \n     for the courts in ensuring compliance with the amendment. \n     Congress could potentially circumvent balanced budget \n     requirements through unrealistic revenue estimates, emergency \n     designations, off-budget accounts, unfunded mandates, and \n     other gimmickry. Certainly, the track record of the \n     institution under the spending targets of Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings and other statutory provisions is no cause for \n     optimism.\n       It is our view that the need to proscribe judicial \n     policymaking can be reconciled with a constructive role for \n     the courts in maintaining the integrity of the balanced \n     budget requirement. Congress is expected to address technical \n     issues such as accounting standards, budget procedures and \n     judicial enforcement in followup implementing legislation. By \n     drawing on the existing legal principles of ``mootness,'' \n     ``standing'' and ``non- judiciability,'' implementing \n     legislation can define an appropriate role for the courts in \n     making the amendment work. The net effect can be to prevent \n     judicial assumption of legislative functions such as \n     selecting program cuts, while allowing the courts to police a \n     framework of accounting standards and budget procedures.\n\n\n              Traditional Limits on Judicial Intervention\n\n       In general, the courts have shown an unwillingness to \n     interject themselves into the fray of budgetary politics. The \n     New Jersey Superior Court observed that ``it is a rare case .  \n     .  . in which the judiciary has any proper constitutional \n     role in making budget allocation decisions.''\\1\\ The \n     judiciary has remained clear of most budget controversies \n     through the principles of ``mootness'' and ``standing,'' as \n     well as the ``political question'' doctrine.\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A case is considered moot, and can be rejected by the \n     court, if the matter in controversy is no longer current. In \n     Bishop v. Governor, 281 Md. 521 (1977), taxpayers and \n     Maryland legislators claimed that the governor's proposed \n     budget violated the state's balanced budget law, because $95 \n     million was contingent upon enactment of separate federal and \n     state legislation. The Maryland Court of Appeals dismissed \n     the case as moot because by that time the separate \n     legislation had been\n      approved, and the relevant fiscal year had elapsed. Mootness \n     will be a factor in many potential challenges to \n     Congressional action under a federal Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, particularly those based on unplanned \n     expenditures or flawed revenue estimates which become \n     apparent near the end of the fiscal year.\n       The doctrine of standing limits judicial access to parties \n     who can shoe a direct injury over and above that incurred by \n     the general public. The logic is that the grievances of the \n     public (or substantial segments thereof) are the proper \n     domain of the legislature.\\2\\ The U.S. Supreme Court has \n     generally held that status as a taxpayer does not confer \n     standing to a challenge federal actions\\3\\, and has barred \n     taxpayer challenges of budget and revenue policies in the \n     absence of special injuries to the plaintiffs.\\4\\ A state \n     cannot sue the federal government on behalf of its \n     citizens,\\5\\ and it is doubtful that Members of Congress have \n     standing to challenge federal actions in court.\\6\\\n       The political question doctrine is a related principle that \n     the courts should remain out of such matters which the \n     Constitution has committed to another branch of government. \n     The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a ``political question'' \n     exists when a case would require ``nonjudicial \n     discretion.''\\7\\ This would be the case with many budgetary \n     controversies, such as the choice to cur particular programs, \n     which by their nature require ideological choices and the \n     balancing of competing needs. In theory, at least, Congress \n     brings to this task a ``full knowledge of political, social \n     and economic conditions...,'' as well as the legitimacy of \n     elected representation.\\8\\ The New Jersey Supreme Court \n     recognized this in a case where local governments challenged \n     funding decisions made by the governor and legislature, \n     holding that the allocation of state funds among competing \n     constituent groups was a political question, to be decided by \n     the legislature and not the judiciary.\\9\\ The Michigan \n     Supreme Court has likewise held that program cutting \n     decisions are a non-judicial function.\\10\\\n\n\n                         a role for the courts\n\n       The courts have asserted jurisdiction over politically \n     tinged controversies where they find ``discoverable and \n     manageable standards'' for resolving them. In Baker v. Carr, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that objective criteria guide \n     judicial decisonmaking and limit the opportunity for \n     overreaching. In the balanced budget context, the \n     ``discoverable and manageable standards'' principle can help \n     demarcate lines between impermissible judicial policymaking, \n     and the needed enforcement of accounting rules and budget \n     procedures.\n       In all likelihood, a strong framework of accounting \n     guidelines will emerge from implementing legislation. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee has interpreted Section 6 of the \n     bill to impose ``a positive obligation on the part of \n     Congress to enact appropriate legislation'' regarding this \n     complex issue.\\11\\ Judiciary Committee staff on both the \n     House and Senate side have indicated their intention that \n     implementing legislation embrace stringent accounting \n     standards that will minimize the potential for litigation. \n     Should legitimate questions arise concerning the methods by \n     which Congress ``balances'' the budget, these standards will \n     also provide objective criteria which meet constitutional \n     standards for judicial intervention.\n       The implementing package is also likely to establish \n     guidelines for judicial involvement defining what issues are \n     judiciable and which parties have standing to challenge \n     Congressional decisions. Where Congress has defined standing \n     within the relevant statue, the courts have generally \n     deferred to this request for judicial input, and entertained \n     suitable cases.\\12\\ This approach has the advantage of \n     defining appropriate controversies and plaintiffs more \n     precisely. In the Balanced Budget context, the right to raise \n     particular arguments could be delegated to specific public \n     officials. State budget officers, for example, could be given \n     standing to contest unfunded federal mandates.\n       We are satisfied that such enforcement procedures, coupled \n     with budget process and accounting guidelines, will operate \n     against a backdrop of traditional legal principles to \n     rationally limit judicial action. The effect should be to \n     prevent judicial overreaching into legislative functions \n     while providing a check on Congressional attempts to evade \n     the requirements of the BBA through procedural and numerical \n     gimmickry.\n                               footnotes\n\n     1.

The decision implied that citizen suit \n     provisions must be carefully articulated and supported by \n     clear legislative goals.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to vote against the motion \nto table the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. President, in my view, courts should not be allowed to enforce \nthe balanced budget amendment by raising taxes, cutting benefits, or \notherwise involving themselves in Federal budgetary policy. We live in \na democracy. And the power to tax and spend should be granted only to \nthose who are accountable to the public.\n  Our Nation was founded on the principle of no taxation without \nrepresentation. It is not time to turn back now.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, unless amended, the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution that is before us today threatens to give \nthe courts unlimited power to raise taxes and cut \n [[Page S2732]] spending when necessary to ensure a balanced budget. \nThe Johnston amendment would ensure that this power could be exercised \nonly if explicitly authorized by the Congress.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not even think that Congress should be \nallowed to give courts the power to increase taxes as a means of \nenforcing this constitutional amendment. Decisions about taxing and \nspending should be made by elected officials, and those officials \nshould not be allowed to avoid accountability for those decisions by \ndelegating that power to the judiciary.\n  So, Mr. President, I seriously considered voting to table the \nJohnston amendment because it does not go far enough to limit judicial \npower, and I suspect that some of my colleagues will vote to table the \nJohnston amendment on that basis. However, I have decided to vote \nagainst the motion to table since, although the Johnston amendment does \nnot go far enough, it at least would put some limits on the judiciary's \ntaxing and spending powers under the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I believe I am prepared to summarize in \n1 minute and I will yield back the balance. Mr. President, I yield \nmyself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, this amendment as worked out with the distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] and the distinguished Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] deprives the courts of judicial power to raise \ntaxes, to cut budgets, to be involved in fiscal affairs of this \nCongress except to the extent that the Congress specifically authorizes \nthat in authorizing legislation.\n  It is the duty of Congress to implement and enforce this article by \nauthorizing legislation. Section 6 so states, and there is also an \nexemption made for section 2. That is, the judicial power of the courts \ncan extend to the enforcement of section 2 which in return requires 60 \nvotes to raise the debt of the United States.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what the sponsors of this \nconstitutional amendment have said the amendment does. They have stated \nthat the courts may not enforce this amendment. This makes it clear \nthat the courts may not enforce the amendment except in the case of \nsection 2 or unless the Congress specifically authorizes them to do so.\n  Mr. President, it is unthinkable to have the kind of ambiguity in the \nConstitution of the United States that is inherent in this amendment \nunless the Johnston amendment is agreed to.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I believe we are ready to yield back the balance of our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to table the Johnston amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, could we have order?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nfor 5 minutes to deliver a eulogy honoring those men who died and who \nwere wounded and who participated in the battle of Iwo Jima, 50 years \nago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senate is not in order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, 50 years ago, I was stationed at Marine \nCorps Air Station, Cherry Point, NC, while serving as a radio operator \nhaving achieved the rank of sergeant. That was on February 19, 1945. I \nlistened with rapt attention, along with my fellow marines, to radio \nreports of a massive marine assault on an obscure Pacific island called \nIwo Jima. Though at that time, I doubt whether any one of us could \npinpoint that island on a map----\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The name Iwo Jima would soon take its place along such \nhallowed names as Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, Normandy, and \nTarawa Atoll. As a vast naval armada moved closer to the shores of Iwo \nJima, the commanders who would soon send their young marines into \nbattle prepared messages to be read shortly before H-hour on board all \nships of the invasion fleet. Maj. Gen. Clifton B. Cates, commanding the \n4th Marine Division, reminded his marines of their recent victory on\n Tinian in the Mariana Islands, where the division's ``perfectly \nexecuted amphibious operation'' resulted in the capture of the island \nin 9 days, ``with a minimum of casualties to our unit, and with heavy \nlosses to the enemy.'' Similarly, Maj. Gen. Keller E. Rockey, \ncommanding the 5th Marine Division, searched for the proper words to \nexhort his men. Unable to draw upon past glories, as his division would \nfight together as a unit for the first time on Iwo Jima, Rockey \nreminded his men that the ``time has now come for us to take our place \nin the battle line.'' Noting that ``the hopes and prayers of our people \ngo with us,'' he assured his marines that ``we will not fail.'' The \nupcoming 36-day battle on Iwo Jima would fully justify the confidence \nwhich Generals Cates and Rockey placed in their marines.\n\n  One of the most visible and poignant memorials in this city\n   commemorates the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi, the Iwo Jima \nMemorial, 4 days after the landing, but the battle would rage for 32 \n  more days.Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Arkansas may proceed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Iwo Jima Memorial is a fitting tribute to the 5,391 \nmen killed, 17,370 men wounded, and the 60,000 men in that total force. \nBut it is a tragedy that there cannot be a statue \n [[Page S2733]] for every single brave marine who participated in that \nbloody battle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to proceed for \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how contemptuous I am \nof the fact that we could not get order in the Senate to deliver this \ntribute. Some of our own colleagues were heroes during World War II. \nSenator John Glenn, a brave marine, is on the Senate floor now. Nobody \nin this body fought longer and harder than he. And in one of the \nbloodiest battles of all, the battle of Guadalcanal, was Senator John \nChafee of Rhode Island.\n  I was asked by the Marine Corps to deliver this memorial, and I was \nhappy to do it. I was not at Iwo Jima. I was just a young marine \ngetting ready to be shipped out to invade Japan.\n  Mr. President, many people in this body remember very little about \nWorld War II and nothing about Iwo Jima. We wanted that island so we \ncould bomb Japan from the islands of Tinian, Guam, and Saipan. We \nneeded Iwo Jima so that disabled planes that could not make it back to \nTinian from Japan would have a relatively safe haven on which to land. \nIt is estimated that the landing strip at Iwo Jima saved the lives of \n25,000 airmen who would have had to ditch at sea and probably would \nhave been lost if it had not been for those brave, almost 6,000, men \nwho gave their lives there.\n  I do not intend to criticize my colleagues, but it is tragic that \nsometimes people do not show more respect for those who provided the \nliberties for this Nation so we could stand here and debate these \nissues as free men and women. It is disappointing.\n  Last night I went to bed, turned on the television set because that \nis a good way to go to sleep, and just happened to turn to PBS, the \nstation so many people want to get rid of. I started watching a \ndocumentary on Iwo Jima, one of the most gut-wrenching documentaries I \nhave ever witnessed. Men who had never talked about that battle, even \nto their wives and children, poured out their souls and their hearts to \nthose interviewers. One man said that he killed a Japanese and when he \nwent over to him--I do not know whether he killed him or whether he \ncame upon him--and he said he had a wallet sticking out of his top \npocket. He reached over and took it out. He was going to take it. He \nopened it up, and there was a picture of this young Japanese soldier's \nmother and father and of his wife and child. And he put it back. He \nsaid, ``I knew that that man was doing exactly what he had been forced \nto do, what he had been told to do--try to kill me. And I had'' been \nprogrammed to try to kill him. And he said, ``What a terrible way to \nresolve our differences.''\n  One other man said the Japanese were famous for having gold teeth. \n``So,'' he said, ``I went around taking gold teeth out of Japanese \nsoldiers' mouths. Got a bag full.'' He said, ``I can hardly stand to \ntell you that, it is so barbaric. But war is barbaric. I was just \nyoung. It is a terrible, shameful thing to admit that today. At the \ntime I thought it was OK.''\n  Another man said there was a man in his company who said he went \naround cutting off the ears of Japanese soldiers--barbaric. Somebody \ntold the company commander. This man, who had gathered a whole sack \nfull of ears, was required by his company commander to dig a hole 6 \nfeet deep and bury them and cover them.\n  But of all those men of my age and a little older who spoke last \nnight, virtually every one of them said, ``I did not hate the Japanese. \nI knew they were doing what they had to do, just as I was doing what I \nhad to do.''\n  I am honored to have been a Marine, honored to have served in the \nsame war, in the same service, with men like John Glenn, Howell Heflin \nand John Chafee, and especially honored to be asked by the Marine Corps \nto deliver this short eulogy to those 6,000 men who died and the 17,000 \nwho were wounded and all of the 60,000 who participated.\n  One man said last night that he felt almost guilty, after seeing what \nhe had seen, coming home alive. I can sort of relate to that.\n  Mr. President, I know everybody in this body joins me in paying \ntribute to these very brave men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I just want to personally express my regard \nfor the senior Senator from Arkansas, for the eloquent way he has paid \ntribute to those who died for us, to those who were wounded for us, and \nto those who fought for us, including himself and others in this body. \nAs someone who lost his only brother in the Second World War after his \n10th commission, I have to say that I was really moved by what the \ndistinguished Senator had to say.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I served after the opening of World War II, \nbut I can remember Iwo Jima vividly. My political mentor was Paul \nDouglas, who served in this body, was a great U.S. Senator, was a \nmarine, and proud to be a marine in spirit. I wish I could hear Paul \nDouglas give a talk today. He was 50 years old when he volunteered to \nbe a marine, went over and was wounded in Okinawa and Iwo Jima.\n  But I think of people like Dale Bumpers and John Glenn when we talk \nabout courage. You look about, and Howell Heflin, he was in the \nMarines, too. We can be very, very proud of those who served our \ncountry. But I think of John Glenn and that little thing that he got \ninto when he was shot into space. It was incredible. I see our \ncolleague, Chuck Robb, who was in the Marines, and John Chafee, and \nprobably some others here who were in the Marines.\n  As one who was not in the Marines, who was not in the service during \nthat period--I was in from 1951 to 1953--I just want to say we are very \nproud of those who served in the Marines, those who served in that \nPacific war. It was a war where we were fighting people who were \nforced, as Senator Bumpers said, to do the things that we were forced \nto do. It was a war where there was clear aggression, where we stood up \nfor what we should stand for.\n  I am proud, as an American who was too young to fight in World War \nII, of those who did.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to express my thanks and \nappreciation to the senior Senator from Arkansas for the very eloquent \nremarks he made--and it is so fitting that he did so for this body and \nfor all of us--about what took place in Iwo Jima. I was not at Iwo \nJima. I do not know if anybody in this Chamber was in the Battle of Iwo \nJima. There is no question that there were fierce battles in the \nPacific in World War II.\n  I think Senator Bumpers has portrayed it so eloquently--the values, \nwhy the whole thing took place. It took place exactly as he said--so \nthat those bombers which were going from Tinian, from Guam, to Japan \nwould have a place, if they were shot up, as they were, to seek a \nharbor of refuge, as it were.\n  I can remember. I was a young marine at the time on Guam. For the \nbombers on Guam, they built two parallel strips for those B-29's to \ntake off. And they would take off on the minute on one runway and on \nthe half minute on the other runway. They assembled some 500 of them on \nthese trips to Japan. It was between a 16- and 18-hour round trip for \nthose bombers. Then, of course, when they completed their mission over \nJapan, after flying up there, a 7- to 8-hour trip up there with those \ngreat loads, then they would start back, many of them badly shot up, \nand their goal was to get to Iwo Jima.\n  The time I am talking about was some months after we had secured Iowa \nJima. I had a friend in one of those B-29's. He was the pilot. He \nradioed ahead to Iwo Jima that he was in a condition 3. As I recall, \nthat was a term for the really desperate to land, and that gave him \npriority. You set your own conditions based upon the number of engines \nout and the amount of gas you had left. They said to him, ``How much \nfuel do you have? How long can you circle?'' He said for 4 minutes. \nThey said, ``Circle for 3 minutes. Your priority is set.'' So he made \nit safely. But that shows you the congestion that was at Iwo Jima and \nthe value of that.\n  So, as Senator Bumpers so eloquently pointed out, 6,000 men were \nlost, and it was a terrible thing. It was a case where they gave their \nlives for \n [[Page S2734]] somebody else. I did not know the figures. But Senator \nBumpers indicated some 25,000--I can well believe that figure--airmen \nwere saved. So it was a dramatic period, when the very best came out in \nour country and those who were there.\n  I am so glad Senator Bumpers called our attention to it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am in the process of preparing remarks, \nand have worked on them today, dealing with the Battle of Iwo Jima. I \nhave some remarks that were prepared to deliver tomorrow, probably in \nmorning business.\n  But I am moved by the eloquence of Senator Bumpers. It brought back \nto me a lot of personal feelings that were heightened by his remarks. \nMy division, the 3rd division, was in reserve in the landing on Iwo \nJima. The 4th and the 5th Marine Divisions landed on D-Day, and they \nmoved inland basically uncontested for awhile. But then the Japanese \nguns came forth from their pill boxes and from their fortifications \nthat they had worked on for months and months, and complete devastation \ntook place on the beaches of Iwo Jima.\n  It was decided that the 3rd Marine Division, which was being held in \nreserve, would be committed, and the 3rd division was committed. I had \nbeen a member of A company, 1st battalion, 9th Marines. That is 9th \nregiment in Bougainville and Guam. I was wounded in Guam and came back \nto the United States, and was in a hospital on the day of D-Day that \nthey landed.\n  I later talked to the survivors of A company. They told me that A \ncompany, 1st battalion, 9th Marines, 3d Marine Division, suffered more \nthan 200 percent casualties on Iwo Jima. They sent in replacements at \nvarious stages before the island was finally captured.\n I lost many a friend in that battle. The raising of the flag on Mount \nSuribachi is symbolic of the battle in the Pacific, where we really, by \ngreat military strategy, went through a campaign of island hopping, by \nwhich they would select an island that was in a very strategic position \nand bypass most of the well-fortified islands that the Japanese thought \nwe would be attacking first. This island-hopping strategy reduced the \ncasualties tremendously. But Iwo Jima lay in a position 660 miles off \nof the coast of Japan. The Japanese had built two airstrips and were in \nthe process of building a third airstrip, primarily to place on that \nisland. Most of their fighter pilot planes were left with the idea of \nintercepting our bombers as they came through from Guam, or Tinian, or \nSaipan to Japan. As Senator Bumpers and Senator Chafee have pointed \nout, the planes that came back, many of them damaged by antiaircraft \nand fighter pilots of the Japanese, landed in an emergency on land. But \nit also was very important in our victory against the Japanese in that \nit destroyed a potential fighter pilot baseline that could have caused \n  tremendous problems relative to that.But I look back in memory of my \nfriends that I lost, and I would have been on Iwo Jima with my outfit \nif I had not been back in the United States at that particular time. \nThe words that stick in my mind are the words of Admiral Nimitz \nfollowing the Battle of Iwo Jima when he said: ``Uncommon valor was a \ncommon virtue.'' The marines that participated in that, and the Navy \nthat was involved, and the Air Force, everybody concerned, really were \ngreat heroes, and we will be honoring the 50th commemoration of that \nbattle in the near future. I believe Sunday there is a ceremony at the \nIwo Jima monument. So I pay tribute to those that lost their lives, to \nthose that were wounded, and to those that helped in that very \nimportant battle to bring about V-J Day.\n\n\n                                Iwo Jima\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nSenator Bumpers and the others that have spoken so eloquently about Iwo \nhere today. I was in World War II and in the Pacific but not in the \nBattle of Iwo Jima. After the war, we were assigned to China. I was \nstationed for 6 months in Beijing; it was called Peking then. Our \nsquadron flew out later on and landed at Iwo, and this was after the \nwar. We had a chance to walk those same black sand beaches that they \ncame in on during the battle of Iwo.\n  It is hard to see how anybody could ever make it up those beaches, \nwhich were the only landing areas on the island, because the cliffs \nabove that area were all honeycombed with caves back in the rocks. Guns \nwould come out and fire. Machine guns would go out and fire and go back \ninto the hole again. Unless the naval gunfire that supported them there \nmade a direct hit on the tiny openings, they kept coming out and mowing \npeople down, down below them. We walked in those caves and looked down \nas the Japanese gunners were able to look down on the beach at that \ntime, and how anybody ever got ashore there with that kind of withering \nfire looking right down their throats is something that is hard to \nfathom. It was so impressive that I remember it very, very vividly to \nthis very day.\n  The reasons for the sacrifices have been spoken about here this \nafternoon. Senator Heflin has mentioned the motto that is on the Iwo \nstatue at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue on the edge of Arlington \nCemetery: ``Uncommon valor was a common virtue.'' Indeed it was. It is \nhard to look at Iwo and to be there on Mount Suribachi, or to go down \nand be in those caves and look down on the black sand beaches and \nimagine how anyone could come across those beaches, where the soft \nrolling sand underfoot--literally, where we tried to walk you would \ntake almost two steps forward and one back, that type of situation. \nThat loose, pebbly type sand was so difficult to even get tracks on. It \nwas hard for them to move at that time. Uncommon valor was indeed a \ncommon virtue.\n  One of my most prized possessions at home is a statue of Iwo. It is a \nsmaller version of the Iwo statue that is over on the edge of Arlington \nCemetery. It is not just a curiosity stand type statue you would buy \nfrom one of the souvenir stands here in Washington. When I had been on \na space flight many years later, Felix de Weldon, the sculptor who \ndesigned the Iwo statue--it was his concept--was doing a bust of me \nlater on and we become friends. He had one of his first working models \nthat he had, from which he designed the Iwo statue. It is a one-tenth \nscale model, exact. If you took a picture of it at the right angle, I \ndoubt that you could tell the difference between that and the big Iwo \nstatue. It is a one-tenth scale model. Because I had been in the Marine \nCorps, he wanted me to have that. I did not want to take it. I thought \nit should go to the Smithsonian or Marine Headquarters or someplace. He \nwanted me to have it, so I finally took it. It is one of my most prized \npossessions at home. I am sure 1 day it will wind up exactly there, in \nthe Smithsonian or Marine Headquarters. Every time I see that statue at \nhome, I am reminded of that visit to Iwo and what it must have been \nlike to be there that day when uncommon valor was such a common virtue.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I had not planned to speak this afternoon at \nall. As a matter of fact, I was just about to part from this Chamber \nwhen the senior Senator from Arkansas asked for the floor. I knew he \nwas going to recite a few words that had been prepared officially by \nthe Marine Corps, and it was my privilege to deliver another as a part \nof that series earlier this week.\n  I would like to join with all of the colleagues here on the floor, \nand the many who have been fortunate to be in this Chamber at this \nparticular moment, and say thank you, Marine Dale Bumpers, for \nreminding us for a few minutes what is important in life.\n  I could not help but be drawn back into my own experience. I was, at \nthe time of Iwo Jima, a young boy starting school. But I suspect, if I \nam honest, I would acknowledge that Iwo Jima probably had a lot to do \nwith my decision to join the Marine Corps. I certainly, like many \nothers, benefited from the heroism that was demonstrated in that \nparticular battle along that tiny eight-square-mile island. And even \nDale Bumpers' description of having talked to those who had examined \nthe photographs and other remains of the enemy that they had taken \nduring the course of the battle rings very true to me in a different \nconflict later on. But it still happens and you still have that very \npersonal gut-wrenching feeling that there are human beings on both \nsides of those \n [[Page S2735]] equations that are not necessarily involved in the \npolitical struggles that are involved.\n  I simply join in saying thank you to my fellow marines here and \nelsewhere for the legacy that they left to all of us who served later. \nThose immortal words ring through to all of us. As my friend, John \nGlenn, talked about his statue, I have a much smaller and much less \nprestigious copy that sits on the front of my desk in my office to \nwhich I will return shortly, which\n but reminds me of a time when something very important in our history \noccurred, just 50 years ago.\n\n  And for those of you who were fortunate enough to be present in the \nChamber today, something important in this Chamber occurred, and it is \nall too rare that we have a feeling where we have been truly moved by a \nfew words. I would have to say that our distinguished friend from \nArkansas has a disproportionate number of those moments to his credit.\n  In any event, may I join colleagues who are here celebrating that \nuncommon valor that occurred some 50 years ago and ask others around \nthe country to stop for just a minute or two to think about the \nconsequence of the risks and the sacrifices they made in terms of the \nquality of life that remains today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have been sitting here and listening, and \nI think the distinguished Senator from Virginia has hit the same note \nthat I have been feeling--a little bit emotional; rightly so; \nbeautiful--because I could hear the ``Star Spangled Banner'' in every \nvoice. I could hear the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag in every \nvoice. I could hear and feel the tide, why this country is so great and \nwhat this institution is.\n  And I could hear the roll being called here in the Senate--Senator \nChafee, Senator Bumpers, Senator Glenn, Senator Heflin, Senator Robb--\nyou go on through. They may have different opinions about the issues on \nthe Senate floor, but none--none--of those would take a step back from \nthe defense of this country and the attempt to do what is right. And it \ngoes across the aisle.\n  So I do not know. I hope there are a lot of people watching tonight \nso they could have heard my long and good friend from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, and listen to John Glenn and to feel it, and listen to Howell \nHeflin.\n  Why was he back in the States? He was wounded.\n  And they said those who have experienced war, as some of us in this \nChamber have, are those most opposed to it.\n  And so, I thank all of you. I hope I can get a tape of this. I want \nmy grandkids to see it, because it has been now 50-some-odd years. I \nwas 19. I guess you were about the same age. We were all about the same \nage. And we were called on.\n  Oh, you may fuss and fume at me about my political stance. You may \nfuss and fume at the others about their political stance, but do not \ndoubt their courage or their loyalty to this country.\n  So this occasion was very beautiful. I am pleased that Senator \nBumpers, my good and loyal friend, was able to get up tonight and \nremind us and shake us back to the very essence and roots of why we are \nin this Chamber and why we try our best to do what is good for the \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if nobody else wishes to speak, let me \njust follow up on what Senator Ford has said and perhaps we can get \nback on the matter we are supposed to be debating. This has nothing to \ndo with the Marine Corps. It has to do with another point I want to \nmake.\n  Several of us went to Europe on June 6. We went to Anzio in Italy \nbefore we went to Utah and Omaha Beaches. And I was really not prepared \nfor the experience. Anzio, a battle I remembered well was memorialized \nby roughly 10,000 white crosses and Stars of David in the cemetery \nthere. We were there on June 4.\n  We went then to Utah Beach and Omaha Beach on June 6th. And behind \neach beach there were roughly 10,000 graves, Stars of David and \ncrosses. Each one of those represented a knock on the door. ``We regret \nto inform you your son, your husband, your brother has been killed in \naction.'' That was one of the most traumatic things I ever experienced.\n  President Clinton, in one of the cemeteries was talking to a man. The \nman said, ``This man who lies under this cross saved my life. He went \nout on a patrol that I was supposed to go on. I had been doing it every \nnight. He said, ``No, you stay. I'm going tonight.''\n  ``And I let him go.''\n  That same man asked the President, ``Do you know Clayton Little?''\n  And President Clinton said, ``Know him? I should say so. He served in \nthe legislature, both when Senator Bumpers was Governor of Arkansas and \nwhen I was Governor of Arkansas. He was one of the finest men I ever \nknew.''\n  The man said, ``He was one of the best friends I ever had. He was by \nmy side during the entire battle at Anzio.''\n  But like this moment, I say to the people of this body that we ought \nto do this more often--stop and reflect on what is really important in \nour lives and in this country.\n  I looked at all those graves, and I thought of the unbelievable \ntrauma so many families had experienced as a result of each one of \nthem. And I began to think about the things we say and talk about in \nthis Chamber. And so much of it is not very important. And when you get \ncaught up in the experience I had, you begin to get your priorities a \nlittle straighter. It is like a cancer diagnosis. You begin to realize \nwhat is important and what is not.\n  But the point I want to close on, Mr. President, as Senator Ford has \nsaid very well, nobody should ever question the loyalty or the \npatriotism of anybody. I deplore that. We are all loyal Americans. We \nare here debating because we have serious policy disagreements, but we \nreally agree on a lot more than we disagree on.\n  Somebody came up to me and said, ``You know, today's generation would \nnever bare their chest to those German machine guns on those beaches. \nThey'd never get them out of those landing craft to walk up a beach, \nunprotected, baring their chest to German machine guns.''\n  And I said, ``Of course they would.''\n  They thought the same thing about our generation. And I believe that \ntodays generation, if our liberties were at stake, would do the same \nthing we did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is not a very propitious time for me \nto send an amendment to the desk.\n  Let me, while Senator Bumpers is still here, say one thing to Senator \nBumpers.\n  I was with Senator Bumpers and others on the 50th anniversary of D-\nDay on those beaches, including down in Italy in Anzio.\n  I was 2 years old when the people of Dale's generation, although I do \nnot feel like he is a different generation than me --and I mean that \nsincerely, and I do not--until I stood on those beaches.\n  I came home and said something to my father that I never said before. \nMy father was not on any one of those beaches. As I stood there and \nwatched Senator Heflin, Senator Bumpers, Senator Hollings and Senator \nGlenn and others with whom I was attending these ceremonies, and the \nthousands of veterans who were there, I marveled at one thing.\n  Being a U.S. Senator for 22 years, I have been to a lot of veterans' \nevents. I did not see one bit of revelry. I only saw reverence. I \nwatched these men and their counterparts--civilians--walk out on those \nbeaches--which seemed to be 20 miles wide--in solitude. There were \n10,000 individuals there, all lost in their own memories.\n  It impressed me in a strange way, I say to my friend from Arkansas. \nHere is what I told my dad. I came back with such a sense of awe. As a \nstudent of history, thinking I was a pretty smart, well-educated guy, \nuntil you stand on those beaches. Now I understand why they all came in \nat midtide. I am assuming it was equally as bad or worse at Iwo Jima, \nand I have never been there.\n  I not only had a sense of awe and pride in my father's generation and \na renewed respect for that generation, \n [[Page S2736]] but I had an incredible sense of envy, almost a feeling \nof anger. John Kerry is a veteran. John was a decorated veteran in \nVietnam. My generation went to war in Vietnam without the benefit that \nyour generation had.\n  When you stood there on the beaches of Iwo Jima, or deciding whether \nor not to get out of the landing craft on Omaha Beach, you knew, had \nyou failed, all of humanity would have suffered. There was no question \nthat the fate of mankind hung in the balance. Had you not prevailed, \nyour wives, mothers, and children would have lived under an oppression \nunlike anything that had been seen in the previous two centuries.\n  When John Kerry rode down some god-awful river in Vietnam, he did not \nknow who the hell he was after, was not quite sure why he was there, \ndid not have any idea anymore than my friend from Virginia had as to \nwho might be shooting at him, and I suspect never had the absolute \ncertainty that what they were doing, as difficult as it was, was \nsomething that, beyond question, had to be done.\n  I understand my dad's generation better, having been there, because \nnow I understand why guys like my dad--and God, it seems ridiculous to \ntalk to you as if you were my dad's age because I have worked with you \nall my professional life--why you have such an incredible sense of \noptimism. Why on either side of the aisle, whether it is you or John \nChafee or whomever it is, have this unabating notion that we can, in \nfact, get things done.\n  I look at my generation and those who are younger, and I am not \nnearly as surprised as to why they are as confused as they are about \nthe ability, and not even thinking about it in your generation, why \nthey wonder whether or not this institution makes any sense, whether or \nnot the system works.\n  It seems to me you not only did something incredibly courageous--and \nI see Dan Inouye, and nobody in this whole body have I ever felt closer \nto than Dan Inouye, and he knows I am not just saying that. Here is a \nguy, he goes and loses his arm. He should have gotten the Medal of \nHonor, in my view, if you read about his exploits. And he acts like he \nwas born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He acts like not a single \nthing ever happened to him in his life that was difficult. He acts like \nthe world is just a cupcake, and we can make it great for everybody.\n  It is an incredible, incredible thing that your generation has passed \non. I do not know how it gets renewed. But I know one thing: More \npeople should hear you talk about it. More people should go and stand \non Omaha Beach or go to Iwo Jima or go up into the hills in Italy where \nthese guys--Bob Dole and others--got stopped.\n  I know it sounds corny, but I defy anybody of any generation to have \nbeen there on D-Day and not walk away with a deeper understanding of \nwhy your generation has done so much for this country and why other \ngenerations have been so uncertain about what they can do. The biggest \nthing it does, it seems to me, is hopefully remind people in this era \nof bitter politics, of political invective, of the mindless things that \nare being said on the left and the right, of the personal \ncharacterization of political motivation of whatever anybody does, of \nthe era of 30-second personal attacks on anybody that disagrees with \nyou, you must be un-American or must be less dedicated than whomever it \nis they are arguing with.\n  I hope they understand that, as corny as it sounds, the women and men \nwho served in this body--and I have been here for 22 years--I have not \nmet a one, I have not met a one in either political party when they \nwalk out of here and get in their car at night or go down to the train \nstation like I do and look in the rear view mirror, they see that \nCapitol dome, do not still get a chill.\n  I noticed people when we were over there on D-Day, Dale, there was \nnot anybody watching us. Everybody was the same. I watch people when \nthey play the ``Star Spangled Banner.'' There was not any hometown \ncrowd. I watched peoples' eyes mist and people got goosebumps. I know \nit is not in vogue to say those things, and probably an editorial will \nsay how corny we were today--or I know I was.\n  The best thing that can happen in this sick political atmosphere we \nfind ourselves in, is for more people to understand, whether it is the \nRush Limbaughs of the world or a left-wing version of Rush Limbaugh on \nthe air who makes everything personal about what people do, there is so \nmuch more that we agree on in this Chamber than we disagree on. There \nis so much more that your generation did for this Nation than you \nunderstand and appreciate, if I can say so, so much more.\n  But you had something that I think we are all still searching for, \nand that is the absolute certainty that what we were undertaking needed \nto be done, was noble, was moral, was necessary, and was right. I think \nthat is what everybody is searching for. You paid a horrible price for \nhaving found it in your generation, but having found it and survived \nit, you made this country something that it never had been, because of \nthe growth and the optimism and the absolute enthusiasm you all brought \nback from having done what you did and literally saved the world for \ndemocracy.\n  I want to tell you I had not planned on speaking on it at all, but my \nrespect for my father has always been great. My respect for his \ngeneration and my mother's, as well.\n  I end with one little story. I was with you, and we split up after \nthe President spoke. I went up to the cemetery. I was walking around \nthe cemetery, just kind of in a daze. My wife and I--my wife was not \neven born during any portion of World War II -- were looking at the \ncrosses, just wandering through, and this guy was being pushed in a \nwheelchair by his two sons. And I am looking at a grave marker. I did \nnot even see him. And he said, ``Is that you, Senator Biden?'' And I \nturned around. I did not know the fellow. He was from Indiana. I turned \nto him and I was like most of us were, somewhat emotional about what we \njust observed. And I said, ``Thank you for what you did.'' And he said, \n``Don't thank me, thank my wife.'' And I turned around, and his wife \nwas not with him. And I said, ``Thank your wife?'' I said, ``Why, \nsir?''\n  He said, ``My wife did as much to make sure I could get on that \nlanding craft and get here because she made it. She made it at home. \nShe produced the reason we were able to win, because of the industrial \nmight of the people we left behind to produce and outproduce the \nGermans.''\n  But it was typical. Here is a guy going through a graveyard where his \nfriends are buried. I compliment him and he tells me to thank his \ndeceased wife who made the landing craft.\n  I sure as heck hope there is some way we can rekindle that kind of \nnotion of sense of duty, sense of responsibility, sense of shared glory \nthat seems to be missing so much in this country today. And I hope in \nGod's name we can do without another war. But I want to compliment you \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2732-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2736-S2754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 278\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for a capital budget)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Bradley, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 278.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n    \n    \n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       3On page 3, strike lines 4 through 8, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 7. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \n     United States Government except for those for repayment of \n     debt principal and those dedicated to a capital budget. The \n     capital budget shall include only major public physical \n     capital investments. For each fiscal year, outlays dedicated \n     to the capital budget shall not exceed an amount equal to 10 \n     percent of the total outlays for that year, which amount \n     shall not be counted for purposes of section 2. Three-fifths \n     of each House may provide by law for capital budget outlays \n     in excess of 10 percent for a fiscal year.\n        [[Page S2737]] ``Total receipts shall include all receipts \n     of the United States Government except those derived from \n     borrowing and the disposition of major public physical \n     capital assets.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKerry be added as an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nBill Bradley of New Jersey, Senators Daschle, Dorgan, and Lautenberg.\n  The amendment we have sent to the desk--some have suggested, why are \nwe continuing to do this; it looks like the train has left the station \nand no one is going to listen anymore to the argumentation for any \nchange in this balanced budget amendment. It seems that somehow it was \nlike the tablet that was handed down, chiseled in stone; even though \nprivately Members who are inclined to vote for this amendment but think \nit is flawed now will say, ``Well, why don't you agree to this \nchange?'' And they will look at us and say, ``Oh, it makes sense, but \nwe can't change it; this is the best we can do.''\n  I do not think it is the best we can do and my colleagues who \ncosponsor this do not think this present balanced budget amendment is \nthe best we can do. That is why we continue to talk about how we can \nimprove it to make it workable.\n  I wanted to make the case today that while it would be useful to \nestablish a capital budget under the current budget rules and \npractices, it will be even more important if the balanced budget \namendment is ratified and becomes part of the Constitution.\n  The main reason budget experts advocate a way of designating specific \ncapital budgets is to assure that we weigh the immediate benefits of \nspending for current operations against the long-term benefits of \ninvestments that pay over the years. They are the hard choices the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine has had to make, as a Congresswoman \nand now as a Senator. We all make them. And that is, there are tens of \nthousands of needs out there.\n  But what we tend not to look at closely enough, in my view, and will \nnot be permitted to look at, as a practical matter, closely enough, is \nthe distinction between short-term investment and long-term investment \nwhen we are dealing with limited dollars. Roads, bridges, dams, water, \nsewer systems, potentially even electronic infrastructures and, yes, \neven those major defense assets that assure the protection of our \nprivate economy and public works, all of these return benefits over \nmore than the single fiscal year that the balanced budget amendment \nfocuses on.\n  We decide to focus on an immediate need of whether or not we are \ngoing to hire 10 more FBI agents. That is an immediate question. That \nis an operating budget. We are going to pay their salaries, an \nimportant consideration. And that focuses legitimately on what we do \nyear to year. But there are others you focus on that have life \nexpectancies and needs that go well beyond a year's time.\n  Even under current budget rules without this balanced budget \namendment passing, many observers believe our budget provides for too \nfew of these long-term investments. We get much pressure on it from our \nconstituents at home, as we should, to deal with the immediate needs \nthat they have. It is a whole lot harder to convince them that maybe we \nshould use some of that money to make a longer-term investment for \nwhich they will not see immediate benefit but will, in fact, have much \ngreater benefit for them and their children than the short-term \ninvestment.\n  So under our current budget system, we face this difficulty. In \nrecent reports, the General Accounting Office, which has been quoted \nnumerous times by people who are for the balanced budget amendment, \nagainst the balanced budget amendment, and not sure of their position \non the balanced budget amendment, the GAO report has repeatedly \nemphasized the need for a budget process that forces clear decisions \nbetween our short- and our long-term needs.\n  In fact, in the 1992 report on the dire consequences of our current \ndeficit policies, the GAO declared, and I quote:\n\n       A higher level of national savings is essential to the \n     achievement of a higher rate of economic growth. But by \n     itself, it is not sufficient to assure that \n     result. . . . In addition . . ., economic growth depends upon \n     an efficient public infrastructure, an educated work force \n     and an expanding base of knowledge, and a continuing infusion \n     of innovations. The composition of Federal spending, as well \n     as the overall fiscal policy, can affect long-term economic \n     growth in significant ways.\n\n  Let me repeat the part that they emphasize: The composition of our \nspending, how we spend it, has as much impact upon our future growth as \nwhat we spend in the aggregate.\n  The composition of Federal spending that was the concern of the GAO \nreport, Madam President, was the mix between operating expenses and \ncapital investment.\n  Let me wrap up this extended citation of where the GAO comes down on \nthis issue with the conclusion of the report's chapter on long-term \npriorities, and I quote:\n\n       The recent approach to budgeting, focusing on each year's \n     choices in isolation, has not served the Nation's needs. Only \n     if we change the framework of the debate to emphasize the \n     long-term consequences of both fiscal policy and relative \n     priorities within the budget can we hope to develop a \n     national consensus on the potentially discomforting actions \n     needed to achieve the future we want for ourselves and for \n     the next generation.\n\n  How much truer will these words be, Madam President, after the \nbalanced budget amendment passes, if it does, a balanced budget \namendment that raises each year's fiscal balance to the level of a \nconstitutional mandate?\n  Madam President, you and I do not know each other well but we have \nserved together in different bodies for a long time. How many times \nhave we heard, in both political parties, all these experts who have \ncome down and talked to us over the last 10, 12, 15 years, saying \nthings like: ``You know, corporate America is shortsighted. The \nJapanese are farsighted. Corporate Japan is farsighted. They make long-\nterm investments, they forgo short-term gains; they work on long-term \nprofits, not short-term profits.\n  And how many times have we heard managers from the Harvard business \nschools and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and \nthe other great business schools of America tell us the same thing?\n  That is all we are saying here; that is all the GAO is saying here. \nAs American corporations have begun to retool and not think of what the \nnext quarter's profits will be but think about what the next 4 years' \nsituation will be, and 8 years and 10 years, corporate America has \ngotten strong. We now, to take one anecdotal example, we now build \nbetter cars than Japan; they are higher quality. We are gaining a \nlarger share of the market. We are doing better because the corporate \nexecutives stopped thinking about getting the price of the stock up to \na certain price by the time they retired so their retirement benefits \nrelated to the value of the stock at the time.\n  All I am suggesting, and others, and GAO is we have to do the same \nthing as we make this fateful step, which I think we should make, to \nhaving a balanced budget amendment. How much more difficult will it be \nfor us to make these long-term decisions when we are operating under \nthe constraint of requiring an absolute balance every year, every time \nwe present a national budget?\n  Will not our current incentives--what we all agree is a callous \ndisregard for the burden of debt on our children--will not those \ncurrent incentives just shift to a new incentive?\n  Right now, rather than make the hard choice of cutting spending or \nraising taxes, we have an incentive to push off the burden of the debt \nwe are accumulating onto my sons and daughter, onto your children, our \nchildren, the next generation.\n  That is the incentive. That is why we say we need a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Once we pass the amendment, and I hope we do--I hope we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment--once we pass it, the incentive shifts. We \nmay no longer push debt onto our children, but we may well neglect the \nthings we need to do in order to sustain our infrastructure and to \nraise the level of potential growth in our economy.\n  Mark my words; when there is a short-term need to deal with an \nimmediate problem when we have to balance \n [[Page S2738]] the budget, and someone says but if we do not deal with \nthe infrastructure of the country, the highway system or the port \nsystem or the sewer system or whatever it may be, or investing in long-\nterm technology in a major growth requirement in the Defense \nDepartment, star wars, whatever you want to pick, you know what we are \ngoing to do? We are going to make sure we take care of the immediate \nneed because we are going to go back home for election, and we do not \nwant to tell anybody, by the way, the reason I did not vote to continue \nto fund this or that program is because I believe that if we invest \nmore money in our ports, it will put us in a position to compete better \nwith the Germans and the Japanese in the next generation. And that is \nwhy I cut your program and why I invested it in a long-term investment.\n  Fat chance. Fat chance. If we have an incentive now to push off debt \nto our children, I think the incentive to neglect future investment \nunder the balanced budget amendment will be even stronger.\n  Madam President, it would be wrong to shift to a new incentive to \nbalance each year's budget without adequate consideration for \ninvestments that are equally important to future generations.\n  I believe that without a capital budget provision the balanced budget \namendment will replace our current shortsighted budget perspectives \nwith another potentially harmful perspective that only rewards current \ncash-flow balances without regard for the investments that are our \ngeneration's responsibility to the next generation.\n  Madam President, we have heard repeatedly here on the Senate floor \nthat virtually every State in our land has some form of balanced budget \nrequirement in its constitution. We have one in Delaware, one that we \nadded to our Constitution in the year 1980, and it has worked well. But \nall of the States, including my State, also use their bonding authority \nto pay for capital projects.\n  Madam President, as a prudent way of living within the constraints of \na constitutional restriction, without neglecting our future, I do not \nknow how we can do anything other than what States do.\n  I have heard, until I have had it up to here, the States and \nGovernors telling us how they balance their budgets. Let me tell you \nthey do not. They do not balance their budgets. I do not know of a \nsingle State that balances its budget, not a single one that I can \nthink of.\n  I am prepared to state for the Record--if any Senator can come to the \nfloor and tell me otherwise, I will apologize--they do not balance \ntheir budgets. They balance their operating budgets, their operating \nbudgets. I also hear my friends, who support this amendment a little \nmore stridently than I do, say the following: why can we not balance \nour budget like the folks back home balance their budgets?\n  Well, unless you hang out with a really wealthy crowd, I doubt \nwhether you know anybody at home who balances their budget. I will bet \nyou there is not a single person sitting in the gallery here who \nbalances his budget like this amendment will require the Federal \nGovernment to do.\n  I wonder how many people walk out and pay cash for their new house? I \nwonder how many people who have purchased a house within the last 2, 5, \n10, 12 years own the house outright and are not paying a mortgage?\n  My dad used to be in the automobile business. There were not a whole \nlot of people who walked in and plunked down cash or a check for a \nbrand new car. If they did, he wondered whether they were drug dealers \nmost of the time. Who comes in and does that? Some people have the \nmoney to do it and some people have the discipline to do it, but most \npeople buy their cars on time.\n  A lot of us, myself included, have to borrow money to send our kids \nto college--take out loans, second mortgages on our homes.\n  As long as we pay the mortgage payment, as long as we pay the \nprincipal and interest on the college loan, as long as we pay the car \npayment, we will assume we are balancing our budget. But if we passed a \nlaw saying no household in America could operate other than on a \nbalanced budget, as we are about to pass here, there would be an awful \nlot of people in apartments. There would not be any new homes being \nbuilt.\n  I think we should be honest with the American people about what we \nare doing here.\n  Now, there are some arguments which I will respond to--I am sure they \nwill come up--about why the Federal Government does not need a capital \nbudget. I respectfully suggest that is not the case. If the example set \nby the States is an appropriate one, Madam President, as we have heard \nso often over the years in regards to a balanced budget amendment, then \ncertainly we should learn from the States' universal determination to \nborrow for those projects that they deem worthy of long-term funding. \nThat is how they do it. The amendment I am offering with my colleagues \ntoday will put that lesson into effect.\n  Madam President, I have here an editorial from the Wall Street \nJournal, not viewed as a liberal paper. Probably the news portion of \nthat paper, if not the best, is one of the best in America. The \neditorial page, like many editorial pages, is often very strongly \nslanted. No one has ever suggested that the editorial writers of the \nWall Street Journal are a bunch of liberal big spenders and taxers.\n  Let me read what they say in an editorial dated November 11 of last \nyear right after the election. The editorial board expressed concern \nthat Congress might move precipitously on a balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me read a passage from that editorial:\n\n       To understand the economics--\n  Says the Wall Street Journal.\n\n       If all American households were required to balance their \n     budgets every year, no one would ever buy a house. Of course, \n     households don't think about their budgets that way. They \n     figure balance means meeting the mortgage payment. Similarly, \n     State and local governments with balanced budget requirements \n     can still borrow money for capital improvements. . . .\n\n  This amendment offers a simple mechanism to address the lack of a \nFederal capital budget in the proposed balanced budget amendment.\n  It introduces the concept of capital investment and says that the \nFederal Government is not bound to pay for such investments out of \noperating expenses up to a total of 10 percent of the operating outlays \neach year. So, to make it simple, let us assume that there is a $100 \nbillion budget--it is more than that, but let us make it easy, a $100 \nbillion Federal budget. No more than $10 billion could be added on to \nthat budget in terms of a capital budget.\n  We can decide to build the bridges and highways out of operating \nexpenses if we are flush. But we can also decide it makes sense to \nborrow the money, like we do in States with bonds, essentially saying \nwe will pay it off in 2 years or 5 years or 10 years. And we must \nbalance it, in the sense that States do in that we pay the yearly \npayment it costs to pay that off--the mortgage payment on the new \nairport, the new highway, the new exotic aircraft we have to build, the \nnew whatever capital investment we decide upon.\n  In other words, it permits borrowing, the issuing of bonds for such \ninvestments just like the States, up to a maximum of 10 percent of each \nyear's operating expenditures. We would be able to issue bonds without \nthe three-fifths supermajority requirement needed for an excess in \noutlays over revenues in 1 year.\n  So, to borrow the money to do that, that is to make a capital \ninvestment, it would be a simple majority vote. Yet if we wanted to in \neffect borrow money, or go in debt in our operating budget, we need a \nthree-fifths vote. And the rationale for that is simple, and that is we \nshould encourage long-term investment and discourage short-term \ninvestment, given limited dollars.\n  Above that 10 percent amount, you could not borrow without a \nsupermajority with 60 votes--just like you have to have now in this \namendment to borrow money or increase the debt.\n  As the Wall Street Journal and many others who have commented on the \nbalanced budget amendment proposal before us here today pointed out--\n``Borrowing for investments with long-term payoff is the practice of \nindividuals, the practice of cities, the practice of State governments, \nand the practice \n [[Page S2739]] of businesses. And it exists in all other advanced \neconomies.''\n  And it ought to be our practice, too. It is sound economic practice.\n  The 10-percent cap on the investment budget is a rough average of \nwhat we have been spending on a restrictive definition of capital \ninvestment every year since 1980. I must say, many analysts believe \nthat our investment budget has been inadequate to meet the needs of the \nfuture. They say we should be investing a lot more than 10 percent of \nour operating budget in long-term investment. That may be. But I am not \nwilling to allow more of that to occur with a simple majority vote. If \nwe want to do more than that, then it has to compete on the same basis \nthat an operating deficit would compete.\n  I think the capital budget should have to compete the same way, once \nit is beyond 10 percent. But a 10-percent cap on borrowing, without a \nsupermajority needed for extension of the national debt, provides a \nreasonable minimum above which the approval of three-fifths of both \nHouses would be required.\n  So we could have a larger capital budget in the future if we need it. \nBut either borrowing more under the three-fifths requirement, or if we \ndecided to, by putting some big investments in our operating budget, \nwould be the only way we could do it.\n  By accepting this capital budget amendment we will have established \nthe formal procedure, with constitutional authority, for considering \nthose projects which will have long-term payoffs and that, therefore, \nmerit long-term finance. The capital budget includes only major \nphysical capital assets, the kinds of purchases that individuals, \nbusinesses, and our State and local governments make by borrowing. It \ndoes not include research or education that many of us may argue are \nlong-term and needed capital--investments in our future. They are \nimportant investments but they are more properly handled on a year-to-\nyear basis, in the opinion of the authors of this amendment.\n  Madam President, let me make it clear again that what constitutes a \ncapital investment will be defined in the amendment. But we do not have \nto fund a capital investment through borrowing. We can fund a capital \ninvestment, if we decide to, through the operating budget. It will take \na majority of Senators even to conclude that we should treat it as a \ncapital investment.\n  So the point is there are several hurdles you would have to cross \nhere. This is not a giant loophole to allow us to continue deficit \nspending. You would have to meet the definition of a capital \nexpenditure, you would have to get the Senate and House both to agree \nit was a capital expenditure, and then you would have to get them to \nagree to the fact it was worth borrowing money to in fact make that \ncapital investment. And if the capital investment that was about to be \nmade would exceed the 10 percent limit on what could be made, it would \nrequire a three-fifths vote in both the House and the Senate to do it. \nBut at least the mechanism that is available to every State would be \navailable to the Government.\n  It can be argued, and accurately, I think, that the balanced budget \namendment as currently written permits borrowing and, therefore, future \nCongress's could engage in a form of capital budgeting. By that same \nlogic, of course, our Constitution now permits us to balance the \nbudget. The point of a balanced budget amendment is not to correct the \ndefect in the Constitution but to correct a defect in our behavior--not \nthe Constitution. We do not need this amendment to balance the budget. \nThere is no amendment now that says you cannot balance the budget. We \njust do not do it. So many of us think we need an amendment to say we \nmust do it.\n  I would argue the same rationale applies to those who say with the \nbudget amendment we have up here, Joe, you could have borrowing if you \nget a three-fifths vote and you can call it whatever you want, capital \nbudget or anything else. That is true. But it begs the question.\n  It is in that spirit that we offer this amendment. Not because some \nform of capital budget is impossible under the present amendment, but \nbecause we need to provide an explicit mechanism by which we can \ndistinguish between projects that merit long-term financing and those \nthat should be funded year to year.\n  One more point before I close, Madam President. My colleagues will \nknow that we have provided that any revenue from the sale of public \nassets will and can be only used to fund capital budgets. So, for \nexample, if we decide in order to raise money we are going to sell off \nYellowstone National Park--and no one is suggesting that, that is why I \npick it-- instead of that money going into the general fund that money \nwould go to reduce the debt that has been accumulated on the capital \nbudget and pay off the mortgage quicker. That is what it would do. This \nprovision removes an incentive to sell off our assets in the name of \nshort-term budget balances.\n  Again, I want to protect our kids, not only from accumulation of debt \nand the interest they will pay on it, I want to protect them from the \nshortsightedness and the incentive to shift away from them the long-\nterm investments they need. So, in order to satisfy our immediate need \nto balance the budget I do not want them selling off Cape Henlopen \nState Park, which is supposed to be there for posterity, in order that \nthey not fire people who are on the Federal payroll to meet the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  So, Madam President, without an explicit capital provision, our \nincentive will be to focus only on those spending priorities that have \nshort-term payoffs, economically and politically.\n  Madam President, I see the minority leader, the Democratic leader is \nhere. I can refrain because I know he is on a very difficult schedule--\nrefrain from delivering the rest of my statement at this point.\n  I will be happy, with the permission of my friend from Utah, to yield \nto him to speak on this or any other item he wishes to speak to.\n  Madam President, this amendment is a genuine improvement, in my view, \ndesigned to protect our children just as the overall balanced budget is \ndesigned to protect them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished \nminority leader of the Senate, the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first let me congratulate the Senator \nfrom Delaware for his eloquent presentation and the leadership he has \nshown once again on this very important issue. No one in the Senate has \nbecome more of an expert on this particular question than the junior \nSenator from Delaware. I applaud him and thank him for offering the \namendment.\n  We all know the purpose of a balanced budget amendment. The purpose, \nof course, is to free ourselves from our overwhelming debt burden and \nto promote economic expansion and growth for ourselves and our \nchildren. We are here to find a more certain path by which to \naccomplish that very purpose.\n  A constitutional requirement to balance the budget is one means to \nattain that goal of a budgetary balance. But the point of the whole \nexercise is economic productivity and growth. That is what we seek. We \nwant to be able to tell business and we want to be able to tell \nfamilies that Government policies will create more of an opportunity to \nhave more economic growth and activity than we have now.\n  But if we are to ensure future economic growth, we certainly need to \ncraft a balanced budget amendment carefully in a way that meets the \nobjective of strengthening the economy.\n  I support the idea of forcing the Federal Government to adopt \nbudgetary discipline under which most families and businesses and \nStates must live. As we all know, our current budget rules do not \nfunction that way, and we need to correct them.\n  Today we have an amendment that would address that situation and \nforce the Federal Government to live by the same budget, by the same \nrules and the same standards that every American family, every American \nbusiness, and nearly every American in every State is required to live \nby.\n  The Biden amendment would establish, for the first time at the \nFederal budget level, the principle that there is a distinction between \ncapital costs and operating costs. We actually would, for the first \ntime make the distinction between capital costs and operating costs. \nThis is absolutely necessary to allow us to balance the budget and at \n[[Page S2740]] the same time invest in limited long-term priorities \nthat fall outside the scope of annual operating expenses.\n  We have to come to the same conclusion that businesses and families \nand State governments already have: that there are different types of \nspending. On the one hand we have investments that can generate the \neconomic growth in this country, in this business, or in this family. \nOn the other hand, we have the operating expenses that daily, monthly \nor annually we have to pay the bills for, to do the work of government \nor business.\n  That really is a principle that every family and every successful \nbusiness has recognized. When a family buys a house or car, or a farmer \nbuys a better tractor, they do not pay cash. If a business expands to a \nnew location or upgrades its computer system or purchases modern \nmachinery, it does not pay cash. People and businesses borrow for long-\nterm investments.\n  So the Biden amendment suggests that we draw the same distinction, \neconomically and fiscally, between investment and operating expense.\n  That is really what the vast majority of States do today. States do \nnot finance road construction or new school buildings or State \ncourthouses or prisons solely out of a single year's revenues. They \nissue State-backed bonds and pay them off over the useful life of these \ninvestments. That makes good, common business sense.\n  So I support the idea of a constitutional budget amendment because I \nbelieve its goal is to strengthen our economy. But we do not strengthen \nthe economy simply by writing new words into the Constitution. We \nstrengthen the economy when we focus on the elements that make the \neconomy strong, and shape the constitutional amendment to reflect those \nelements. We strengthen the economy by concentrating Federal spending \non investments that promote long-term economic development, just as \nbusiness do.\n  So I have cosponsored the pending amendment because I believe it is a \npractical way to promote economic growth. The amendment would put the \nFederal budget on the same footing, and subject the Federal Government \nto the same requirements that govern most States, businesses, and \nfamily budgets today. It would establish a clear distinction between \ncapital costs and operating costs.\n  The amendment is tightly drawn, as the Senator from Delaware has \npointed out, to prevent the Federal Government from sinking deeply into \ndebt to finance capital investments. The capital budget would be \nlimited to no more than 10 percent of the total outlays for each fiscal \nyear.\n  It would operate under the pay-as-you-go discipline imposed by the \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment itself. So would the \noperating budget. Depreciation and debt servicing costs would be \nassessed to the operating budget, so debt incurred for public \ninvestments would have to be repaid within a balanced operating budget.\n  Just as any family must keep monthly car and mortgage payments \naffordable, the Government would not be able to take on more debt \nwithout cutting spending or increasing revenues in the operating \nbudget.\n  So the amendment would ensure that the Constitution preserves the \nability of the Federal Government to do what it needs to do, to invest \nin our economic future in a meaningful way. Put simply, it would create \na capital budget to clearly distinguish tax dollars used for public \ninvestments from tax dollars used for immediate consumption.\n  It would create a powerful incentive to balance the operating \nbudget--the consumption side--and it would offer an equally powerful \nincentive to subject all proposed investments to heightened scrutiny.\n  We hear repeatedly that the States balance their budgets, so why does \nnot the Federal Government do so? It is a good question. But it is a \nquestion that compares apples and oranges.\n  Most States' balanced budgets requirements apply only to their \noperating budgets. They borrow for long-term investments and pay back \nthe loans. They balance their books, they do not balance their budgets.\n  The amendment before us provides for a way to make this an apples-to-\napples comparison. It would place the Federal budget on the same plane \nas most State budgets that exist today.\n  Again, the current Federal budget makes no distinction between \noperating and capital costs. We treat a highway that lasts 40 years \nprecisely as we treat a traveling bureaucrat's lunch that is eaten and \nforgotten in 15 minutes. That is a prescription for shortchanging \ninvestment.\n  A family does not treat a monthly mortgage payment the same as it \ntreats a night at the movies. When the budget is tight, we clamp down \non nights out. But we still pay the mortgage.\n  So it is time to abandon the idea that we can operate in today's \neconomy out of a cash drawer as we could two centuries ago. For too \nlong, that attitude has forced the Federal Government into costly and \nsenseless solutions that are short term and, frankly, shortsighted. For \nexample, in the mid- 1980's, when President Reagan was anxious to avoid \nthe appearance of higher deficits, the General Services Administration \nspent hundreds of millions of dollars on rental leases around the \ncountry, although it would have made more sense to build and own the \nbuildings outright. In some cases, taxpayers are still paying on some \nof those leases today.\n  The argument that Government should operate on a more business-like \nbasis is really what this amendment is all about. Every wise business \nborrows money to make investments that will increase profits. Smart \nbusinesses do not have to guess how much of their borrowed capital, how \nmuch of their revenue, how much of their future capital is going to be \nsunk into wages instead of a new warehouse. They know how their money \nis allocated because they have capital budgets, and they have operating \nbudgets. It is the instinctive response of any normal household to draw \nthe distinction. But, under current law, the Federal Government cannot \ndo what families or businesses do today.\n  Madam President, a group of 435 leading economists recently called \nupon Congress and the President to increase public investment now and \nfor the 21st century. They included six Nobel laureates, and their call \nreflects their professional judgment, not a political one.\n  They said:\n  ``There is a danger in the current antigovernment tone of our \nnational political discourse that we as a nation will forget the \nessential economic contribution made by public investment in our people \nand in our infrastructure. * * * The cost of infrastructure decay, \nurban squalor, and social polarization is too high.''\n  Nearly every economist agrees that the United States is not investing \nenough in public infrastructure. Our public capital--roads, bridges, \nrails, and airports, our water systems, schools, and libraries--are all \ninvestments made in the past that support our present standard of \nliving.\n  Our ability to compete, our ability to improve the quality of life \nfor ourselves, and our ability to prepare for the 21st century depends \nupon our willingness to make these kinds of investments. But our \npresent budget structure, unchanged, guarantees that we will not be \nable to do so.\n  The distinctive mark of American economic growth throughout its \nhistory has been productivity. Ours is an economy and a system that has \ngiven free rein to the investments, public and private, needed to \nsustain the productivity growth that we witnessed now for so long. We \ncannot, we should not, continue to live off our seed corn. We should be \nplanting for our own futures, certainly not eating the very product \nthat has produced the kind of economic vitality that we now enjoy.\n  The reason these economists and other Americans had to call attention \nto infrastructure is that investment is not treated by our budget as a \ndistinct budgetary cost separate from consumption, and I daresay that \nmost of the people in the Chamber today would privately agree that it \nshould be. The Biden amendment at long last would achieve just that.\n  Polls show that Americans want much of what Government provides. They \nwant to eliminate waste, of course. So do all of us. But they also want \na strong national infrastructure with safer highways, with safe dams, \nwith safe bridges, and good schools.\n  [[Page S2741]] Indeed, most of our arguments over Government are not \nover the investment end of it; they are over the operational costs. \nSuch issues relating to welfare and some of the consumption questions \ncertainly will come up in the coming weeks and months on this very \nfloor. I have not heard much anger, frankly, over capital investments \nthat past generations have made in this country. That is not what this \ndebate is about. We all recognize that public investment continues to \ndecline. We all recognize that someday the bill will come due. We all \nrecognize that if we do not address it now, this problem is going to \ncontinue to become more complicated. It will compound and become even \nmore expensive.\n  The amendment before us is neither radical nor complicated. It is a \ncoming of age for the Federal Government. It would give us the tools \nthat every other competitive trading nation in the world already has.\n  Twenty years ago, the first Budget Act was passed. Frankly, I think \nit was regarded as revolutionary.\n For the first time, Congress would know how much money was being \nspent, and on what, before it was spent, not afterward.\n\n  By now, Congress has done practically everything possible to the \nBudget Act except to repeal it. But still we do not have a handle on \nspending.\n  We cannot agree, between 1990 and today, whether the trust funds \nallocated to future Social Security benefits should be counted against \ncurrent deficit spending. We took Social Security off budget 5 years \nago. This week, we nullified that decision. No wonder there is \nbudgetary confusion.\n  It is time for another revolution, similar in scope to the one that \nbrought the Budget Act into being. It is the single step that would \ngive us the tools needed to change business as usual in Washington.\n  The Biden amendment would make that revolutionary,\n   commonsense change. It would allow us to balance the budget and at \nthe same time promote the long-term investment that we all want, the \nlong-term investment that would give us a real level of confidence \nthat, indeed, we can look to the future in the belief that we can, \nindeed, improve our productivity and strengthen our economy.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n    \n    \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware and as an original \ncosponsor. I think this is one of the most important amendments that we \nwill consider in this entire debate on a balanced budget amendment. It \ngoes to the question of truth in budgeting.\n  I read in the paper constantly how the proponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment say, why can we not balance the budget? Our average \ncitizen in New Jersey has to balance his or her budget, and so does the \ncitizen in Maine or South Dakota or Utah. In fact, I have heard people \nsay, if the factory worker can do it, why can we not do it? If the \ninsurance salesman can do it, why can we not balance our budget?\n  Madam President, I suggest that average people out there in the \ncountry today, by a surprising margin, do not balance their own \nbudgets, in the way we would have to under this balanced budget \namendment. I think there is a very important distinction to be made \nbetween people who spend money for consumption and people who spend \nmoney for investment.\n  The average person today, assuming that he has a credit card, spends \nmoney by using that credit card and piles up debt. This type of \nspending is primarily for consumption. At the same time, my guess is \nthat there are millions of Americans who have mortgages on their homes. \nMadam President, under the rules established by this balanced budget \namendment, any American who has a mortgage on his or her home would not \nhave a balanced budget. Under the balanced budget amendment, all \ncapital expenditures have to be funded currently, which means that if \nyou were going to buy a home under the balanced budget amendment, you \ncould not get a mortgage; you would have to pay for the whole house in \n1 year. How many people in this country do that? Not very many. They go \nto the bank and they get a mortgage, and as a result of this mortgage, \nthey pay the house off over many years as they use it, and as the \nbenefit of the asset accrues to them. They also pay the interest \ncharges every year.\n  Madam President, let me suggest that there is a great difference \nbetween a mortgage and credit card debt. Similarly, there is a great \ndifference at the Federal level between operating expenses and capital \nexpenditures. Operating expenses fund consumption, the day-to-day costs \nof running the Government, including everything from veterans' programs \nto the FBI to employees' salaries. The benefits of this type of \nspending are used up almost immediately. However, when the Federal \nGovernment makes a capital expenditure, meaning an investment in a \nphysical asset such as a building, a highway, or a port, the benefit \nfrom that asset does not accrue to the country in that first year. It \naccrues over time. Yet, the balanced budget amendment, as it currently \nstands, would require us to put the whole cost in the budget up front, \nunlike the average citizen.\n  Therefore, Madam President, the first point I want to make is that \nthere is a real distinction between financing day-to-day expenses and \nfinancing long-term investment. American families know that \ndistinction. That is why they have credit cards and mortgages--one to \npay for day-to-day expenses; the other, to finance long-term \ninvestments. The Federal Government should operate the same way \nAmerican families do. We should have a Federal budget that balances our \noperating expenses. We should not have a Federal budget that requires \nshort-term balance on long-term investments.\n  So that is the first point I would like to make. Under this \namendment, capital expenditures are listed in a separate budget from \nthe operating expenditures. And while a three-fifths vote would be \nneeded to allow borrowing for the operating budget, if you want to \nborrow on the capital budget, it would take only a majority.\n  The other argument we have heard in this debate, is that States \nbalance their budgets, so why can the Federal Government not balance \nits budget?\n  Madam President, States do not balance their budgets as the Federal \nGovernment would be required to balance its budget under the terms of \nthis amendment. We all live in different States. Let us take my State \nof New Jersey. We have a balanced budget requirement in New Jersey. The \nState must balance the budget. That is what it says. However, we also \nrealize the importance of making long-term investments for our State's \nfuture. Therefore, notwithstanding the balanced budget requirement, the \nState has the authority to borrow to finance capital investments. In \naddition to general obligation bonds issued directly by the State of \nNew Jersey, we have a number of State authorities that are authorized \nto borrow to finance long-term investment projects. These authorities \ninclude the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which as of \nNovember 1994 had $3.6 billion in debt outstanding; the New Jersey \nTurnpike Authority, $2.8 billion; the New Jersey Educational Facilities \nFinance Authority, $1 billion; the New Jersey Sports and Exposition \nAuthority, $900 million; the New Jersey Building Authority, $700 \nmillion; the New Jersey Highway Authority, $640 million; the New Jersey \nWaste Water Treatment Trust, $620 million; the South Jersey \nTransportation Authority, $590 million; the New Jersey Water Supply \nAuthority, $150 million; and the South Jersey Port Corp., $40 million.\n  In total, Madam President, New Jersey had 19.8 billion dollars' worth \nof debt in 1992 which was used to finance capital projects. The total \nannual New Jersey State budget is around $16 or $17 billion. If New \nJersey had to balance its budget as the Federal budget would have to \nbalance its budget under the balanced budget amendment, New Jersey \nwould have to spend more in annual debt payments than it now spends.\n  Madam President, despite the importance of investing for our Nation's \nfuture, the balanced budget amendment does not distinguish between \noperating and capital expenditures. Instead, the amendment, unlike the \nbalanced budget requirements in New Jersey and 42 \n[[Page S2742]] other States, lumps both of these categories together by \nlimiting the Federal Government from borrowing to finance long-term \ninvestment. The balanced budget amendment would require that the full \ncost of each investment project be paid immediately regardless of the \nterm of the investment's life. In other words, in New Jersey, $19 \nbillion would be due next year because that is how much New Jersey is \nin debt with the so-called balanced budget amendment at the State \nlevel. If this rule were applied to families, they would be forced to \npay off their entire mortgage immediately and they could never again \nborrow to buy a home, pay for college, or finance any other long-term \ninvestment.\n  Do we really want to hamstring the Federal Government in this manner? \nI think not. American families do not do it; our States do not do it. \nWhat is good for families and States should be good for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We ought to have a separate capital budget. Therefore, the capital \nbudget amendment that the distinguished Senator from Delaware has \noffered would do nothing American families, businesses, and States do \nnot already do.\n  By allowing the Federal Government to borrow to finance long-term \ninvestments, this amendment would allow the Federal Government to \nmanage its finances in the same way that most States, families, and \nbusinesses manage theirs. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Why treat the Federal Government differently? Who would argue that \nfamilies in this country should be prevented from taking out mortgages? \nWhy should we say to New Jersey taxpayers, ``Pony up for the whole \nState budget plus the total for all State borrowing, all $19 billion \nworth, to pay that debt off?'' Why should we say to businesses that \nborrow to finance capital investments in plant and equipment, ``Nope, \nyou can't do that. You have to pay it all off in the same year you buy \nit.''\n  The reason that we do not do that, of course, with regard to \nfamilies, businesses, and State governments, is that we recognize the \nconnection between long-term investment, economic growth, and job \ncreation.\n  The more investment you have, the more jobs you have. The more long-\nterm investment you have, the broader your foundation for economic \ngrowth is over time.\n  How often do we hear about the balanced budget amendment, ``We need \nto reduce the deficit. We need to eliminate the debt. We need the \nbalanced budget amendment because it is through debt passed on to \nsubsequent generations of taxpayers that the ultimate unfairness comes \nin.''\n  However, these same concerns about intergenerational cost shifting do \nnot seem to come into play when we discuss the possibility of issuing \ndebt to finance long-term capital projects that provide benefits over a \nnumber of years. Why pay for the benefits of a bridge in 1 year when \nthose benefits are going to flow over 50 years? Why pay for the \nbenefits of your home in 1 year when the benefits are going to flow \nover 50 years? American homeowners do not pay for all those benefits in \n1 year. They pay over 10, 20, 30 years.\n  Why should the Federal Government be different? In short, it should \nnot.\n  But there is a bigger point here and the bigger point is that capital \ninvestment, whether you are running a company or a government, is \nenormously important because it is through investment that we increase \nproductivity which provides a foundation for long-term economic growth. \nThat increased productivity is critical if we wish to enhance long-term \njob opportunities, improve our standard of living, and keep our Nation \ncompetitive in an increasingly international marketplace.\n  Capital investments are investments in the long-term productivity of \nour economy and in the living standards of our citizens. However, \nbecause these advantages do not become apparent until several years \nafter the funds have been invested, they are often underfunded, \nparticularly when funds are tight, as they are now. Budget decisions \ntend to focus on immediate, operating needs. As a result, long-term \ninvestments get shortchanged.\n  By separating capital expenditures from operating expenditures, we \nensure that these long-term investments are not overlooked in the \nbudget process. By allowing them to be financed through debt, we can \nensure that the long-term economic vitality of our country will be \npreserved.\n  The threat of insufficient capital investment is very real. Recently, \na group of 435 economists signed a statement that warned:\n\n       There is a danger in the current antigovernment tone of our \n     national discourse that we as a Nation will forget the \n     essential economic contribution made by public investment in \n     our people and in our infrastructure.\n\n  ``Public investment.'' Ask anybody who lives on the east coast, west \ncoast, or gulf coast of the United States how important ports are. \nThose are big capital investments.\n  Ask anybody that lives anywhere in the United States how important \nhighways are. Ask anybody who lives in a larger metropolitan area how \nimportant mass transit is. Ask anybody in the West how important dams \nare. Ask anybody in the dry West, beyond the 100th meridian, how \nimportant irrigation is. Ask anybody beyond the 100th meridian in the \nWest how important public investment in power are.\n  Ask anybody, and they will tell you that it is on the strength of \ninvestment, both public and private, that long-term economic growth is \nbased.\n  Madam President, I would simply suggest that if we look at the public \ninvestments in the 19th century. The distinguished Senator from Idaho \nis here. He knows how important the dams are in the West. He knows how \nimportant the irrigation systems are in the West. Madam President, if \nwe could not finance those systems with debt, we would have to account \nfor it all in the first year. We would have to pay the entire cost \nupfront. Most of those projects would not have been built had it not \nbeen for the Federal Government's ability to borrow and, in the future, \nmany projects such as these will not be built.\n  We need to liberate capital spending from these requirements. We can \ndo so by having a separate capital budget, a capital budget that would \nbe capped at 10 percent of the total operating budget outlays. If we \nwere able to do that, I believe that we would all benefit--our country \nwould benefit and our children would benefit.\n  Madam President, I would like to close by emphasizing that the \nproblem we are seeking to resolve by creating a separate capital budget \nis a real one with significant repercussions for our children and \ngrandchildren. Like those economists said, if we do not make those \ninvestments, then our future will not be secure. How we choose to \nfinance long-term public investments will have enormous consequences on \nthe economic well-being of future generations. It is just as \nirresponsible to leave children and grandchildren with an enormous debt \nburden as it is to leave them without the infrastructure necessary for \nthem to build their future.\n  I believe it is this concern about the impact of our decisions on \nfuture generations that is really driving the balanced budget \namendment. If we are truly concerned about our children and their \neconomic well-being, then it is clear that the time has arrived for a \ncapital budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague. If I may have the attention of my \nfriend from New Jersey and tell him that I agree completely on the need \nfor long-term investment. But I believe the case is not there for \ncarving out this exception for the balanced budget amendment.\n  It is very interesting that you mention the interstate highway \nsystem. President Eisenhower, to his great credit, proposed the \ninterstate highway system. And he suggested that we issue bonds for it. \nAnd a U.S. Senator by the name of Albert Gore, Sr., stood up and said \nwe should not issue bonds, we should have a gasoline tax to pay for \nthem. And as of about a year or maybe a year and a half ago, the \nestimate was we saved $750 billion in interest.\n  The largest project we have now is a nuclear carrier. $7 billion or \nso is paid over 5 years. We can do that on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  GAO has said we ought to separate investment from consumption in our \nbudget. I agree with them. But they \n[[Page S2743]] also warn we have no necessity for a capital budget as a \nlocal unit of government may have.\n  It is also interesting, as we look at the history of our budget, as \nour deficits have grown, our capital investment has diminished so that, \nif we are interested in capital investment, what we ought to be doing \nis getting the deficit down and, in fact, we will have more capital \ninvestment.\n  Now, I happen to favor, for example, moving ahead in a massive way \nfor mass transit. I think we could say to the Chicago Transit Authority \nand the others, ``We are going to set aside 2 cents of our gasoline, \n$2.4 billion, for your capital investment,'' and then if they want to--\nbecause they do not have the ability to do anything--if they want to \nissue bonds, they can do that.\n  I would finally point out that this balanced budget amendment, \nbelieve it or not, does not prohibit capital investment, in a way that \nI happen to think is not the desirable thing. The Judicial Building \nright next to Union Station was a project designed by our colleague, \nSenator Pat Moynihan. Architecturally, it is one of the most attractive \nbuildings in the Capitol area today. Without my knowledge--because I \nwould have voted against this method of financing--we are leasing that \nfor 20 years, and at the end of 20 years we will own that building. I \ndo not favor that, but I mention that simply to suggest there is \nflexibility within this amendment.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, if I could respond to my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I know we are limited to 20 minutes. If you can respond on \nthe time of Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Anyway the Senator from Illinois would like--I would \nlike to accommodate him because I think he raises a couple of good \npoints.\n  He raises the issue of the U.S. highway being built. Why do you need \ndebt? I wonder if the Illinois Turnpike Authority is financed the same \nway. The New Jersey Turnpike is not financed the same way. We float \nbonds.\n  I note that in the 1950's there were a couple of years in which the \nFederal Government ran a surplus on a current year basis. We had no \ngigantic national debt, a very minuscule national debt, we ran a \nsurplus. This allowed us the freedom to finance major capital projects \non a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  However, I would say there is a great difference between our \nsituation today and the situation that faced young Senator Albert Gore, \nSr. when he proposed his amendment. The difference is about $4.3 \ntrillion worth of debt.\n  As we try to balance the budget, we will be forced to make dramatic \nspending cuts. The capital budget amendment would simply cause us to \nweigh an investment's long-term benefits against its long-term costs. \nIf the benefits outweigh the costs, we should be able to finance the \nproject over its projected lifetime. Without this amendment we will be \nforced to budget for the entire cost of a capital investment in its \nfirst year and compare this cost to the many competing, and frequently \nlegitimate, demands for current consumption spending.\n  The Senator makes a second point which is that as the deficit has \ngrown, capital investment has dropped, to which I would say, ``And the \nsun comes up in the morning.'' Of course, as deficits grow, capital \ninvestments drop. Capital investments drop because the public sector \ncrowds out the capital markets. Instead, the money goes to finance \npublic sector consumption. As a result, there is relatively little \navailable for private sector investment.\n  But that is not the point. The point here is the public budget. \nUnless we act, public investment will continue to drop as we attempt to \nreduce the deficit. Ask yourself, you are a practicing politician, are \nyou going to respond to the guy that comes in and says you know what we \nneed is a new highway system. What we need is a new dam. Or what we \nneed is a new power plant. Or are you going to say, I will give you the \npower plants, the bridge, the highway, but all you senior citizens, all \nyou middle-class taxpayers, all you others out there who want to eat \ninto a shrinking amount of available public funding, I will say no to \nyou so I can make this long-term investment? This never happens. It has \nnot happened in the past and is not likely to happen in the future. \nThat is precisely why we need a capital budget.\n  Now the Senator made one last point about how the balanced budget \nshould be flexible. I agree and would simply ask the question: Why is \nwhat is good for the American family not good for the Federal \nGovernment? Why is it that American families, when they buy a long-term \nasset, their home, get a mortgage and pay it off as they benefit from \nit each year in terms of interest payments? Why is that okay for the \nAmerican family but not okay for the Federal Government? Why is it that \nGovernors across this country say they have a balanced budget but still \nassume debt to finance long-term projects?\n  In my State alone, the State budget is $16 to $17 billion; the amount \nof amassed debt is $19.8 billion. Why is what is good for the Governors \nis not good for the U.S. Government? Why is what is good for the \nAmerican families is not good for the U.S. Government?\n  So I would simply say, I think the Senator has raised a number of \ninteresting questions, to which there are answers, and I have done my \nbest to try to answer him.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion. I am going to support the amendment that is on the floor \nbecause I think it makes a lot of sense, but I am always interested in \nthis notion of families versus Governors. The major difference here is \nevery American family who has debt is required not only to pay interest \non the debt but to pay down the principal payment after payment after \npayment.\n  The difference is, the Federal debt keeps increasing because we pay \ninterest and increase the principal year after year after year. That is \na very fundamental difference between families and Governors.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If I could respond to the Senator, I take his point. At \nthe same time, no family is going to put the full price of the house \nout. No family is going to be required, as we would be under the \nbalanced budget amendment, to pay this full amount upfront. I think \nthere is a significant difference. I take his point on the narrower \nissue. On the broader issue, I do not think anybody wants to say to \nAmerican families, ``You can't buy your home with a mortgage, you have \nto pay for it all up front.''\n  I think that is what we are saying under this balanced budget \namendment, that you cannot finance long-term investment out of debt and \nthat, in my view, will be counterproductive; it will lead to lower \neconomic growth and fewer jobs.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first of all, I think Senator Dorgan makes \na very good point. I will add, that family does not mortgage itself \nbecause they want to but that is the only way they can acquire the \nthing. When you have a $1.6 trillion budget and the biggest capital \nitem is $8 billion, less than 1 percent of that budget, then you do it \non a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  Second, the point that was made for States, I happen to know a little \nbit about the Illinois toll road. I was in the State legislature. I \nvoted against it. I wanted to do it on a pay-as-you-go basis. We could \nhave done it, and no one in Illinois would be paying tolls today if we \nhad been prudent.\n  The reality is, we have the lowest gasoline tax of any country \noutside of Saudi Arabia. If we want to do something in mass transit or \nhighways, we can do it on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  Finally, I urge that everyone listen to what the General Accounting \nOffice suggests and that is we ought to divide our budget into \ninvestment and consumption but not have a separate capital budget as an \nexcuse for a deficit.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains in control of the proponents of the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes and ten seconds.\n  [[Page S2744]] Mr. BIDEN. I yield time to my friend from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nsimply would like to make the point again, the Senator said people \nwould not be able to buy homes if they could not get mortgages. Right, \nthat is true. Why did we decide we would allow them to have mortgages? \nSo they would buy homes, employ people and, at the same time, make an \ninvestment that lasts a long time, precisely because it is in the \ninterest of this country to have investments in homes that last a long \ntime.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, why did we allow them to deduct \nthe interest they pay on their mortgage? To further encourage them to \nbuy.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Why do we build the roads that got them to the homes in \nthe subdivisions? Same reason. But there is a difference between that \nand sending somebody a check that they spend tomorrow. That is the \noperating budget. Send people a check and they spend it tomorrow. You \ncan do debt like that, too.\n  You can have a credit card as an individual, you can go out and \nspend, consume, go to the movies, buy your wife dinner, buy some new \nclothes and put it on the credit card. That is consumption. That is the \noperating budget. In general, we should not borrow to finance such \ntypes of spending. However, when you buy a house, you have a longer-\nterm investment so you do not want to pay $100,000 or $200,000 for that \nhouse in 1 year, you want to spread it over time because you are going \nto derive the benefits of that house over a longer period of time, year \nby year by year.\n  All we are saying is treat the American Government the same way that \nwe treat American families. Treat the Federal Government the same way \nthat we treat State governments.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware was not on the floor when I \npointed out that in my State of New Jersey, we have public \nindebtedness--State government and authorities--of $19.8 billion and, \nyet, the Governor--and every Governor who has been Governor of the \nState of New Jersey--asserts we have a balanced budget. We balance the \noperating budget, we do not balance the capital budget. The capital \nbudget is debt for long-term projects that help the economy grow and \nprosper. It is nonsensical to say, ``Well, we don't need that. We are \nprohibiting it in the balanced budget amendment.''\n  Instead, look what happens when you gain control over spending by \nbalancing the operating budget and capping the capital budget. Under \nthis proposal, the capital budget would be capped at 10 percent of the \noverall budget over time and the payoff in jobs, investment, economic \nproductivity is immensely greater than that investment. I agree with \nthe Senator from Illinois, it will not be made in the amounts that are \navailable under a capital budget because all those demands of people \nwho want to consume money we send them through the mail will be greater \nthan those people who will be farsighted enough to say, ``Build this \ndam, build that highway or build mass transit.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. One of the reasons why, as I understand it, some of us--\nmyself, I know the Senator from Illinois feels this way and I suspect \nthe Senator from Idaho--feel we need a balanced budget amendment is \nbecause now the incentive is to thrust off onto our children the \nobligation of paying for what we are unwilling to make tough decisions. \nWhen the President put his deficit reduction package down, the three of \nus voted for it but we could not get anybody else to vote for it \nbecause we did not dare to say we were raising taxes on the very \nwealthy among us, we did not dare to go back and say we were going to \ncap spending for social programs, et cetera. So it was easier to let \nthe debt accumulate and the incentive was to shunt it off to our \nchildren.\n  My question is this: Will we not just be supplanting that incentive \nto shove off onto our children debt that we do not want to meet and \ninstead shove off on our children the lack of the infrastructure they \nare going to need to be able to compete?\n  How many people in here are going to go home and say in New Jersey, \nDelaware, Illinois, Maine, wherever, ``By the way, the reason why I \nvoted against providing more money for education is because we think \nthat the Port of Wilmington and the Port of Camden need an investment \nof 12 new cranes which are going to cost a half-a-billion dollars, \nbecause in order for us to be able to compete with the Germans, we have \nto be able to export more to Europe of the automobiles that we are \nbuilding.\n  How many people are going to find that their town meeting folks are \ngoing to say, ``Now let me get this straight, you mean to tell me my \nkid is not going to have as much money for school this year or for a \ncollege loan program this year or for tuition this year because you are \ntelling me you invested so my grandkid will be able to compete with the \nGermans 10 years from now?''\n  Has anything in the political experience of the Senator from New \nJersey led him to believe that will be the norm for American \npoliticians?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I will reply to the distinguished Senator from Delaware, \nthere is one simple answer: Those investments will not be made.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Bingo.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. There are not profiles in courage enough for people to \ntake longer-term decisions, witness this deficit and debt. The Senator \nis exactly right.\n  He points out that we will have a balanced budget amendment that will \nsimply reduce the chances for better jobs, more jobs, higher incomes \nfor our children because we will not be building the kind of \ninfrastructure and the kind of investments that most every State in the \nUnion finance by borrowing.\n  In my State, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has financed through \nborrowing what is probably the best known investment. I guess there is \nnot a Member of this body who has not ridden on the New Jersey \nTurnpike. That would not have been built if it had not been debt \nfinanced. I do not know if anybody has gone to Giant Stadium or to the \nracetrack built under the auspicies of the the Sports & Exposition \nAuthority. They would not have been built if they had not been debt \nfinanced. I do not know if many people know about the incredible dams \nin the west that would not have been built.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Specifically to the point of New Jersey, if you take the \ncapital investment bonded by the State of New Jersey and the surpluses \ninvested in the employment trust funds and you put them into a unified \nbudget with the operating budget of the State of New Jersey, that is, \nthe General Accounting Office report, October 1983, as we do at the \nFederal level in a unified budget, guess what you have in the State of \nNew Jersey? You have a balanced budget based on revenue, based on the \nvalue of the trust funds, based on the capital investment from bonding, \nand that is why you have the rating you do in the bond system.\n  Now, what the Senator is saying is true, but we must tell the whole \nstory. And the whole story is the net assets versus the expenditures of \nthe State of New Jersey.\n  Dick Gephardt over in the House asked for that report, and in almost \nall cases with all States, if you look at it through the eyes of a \nunified budget, which the Senator is not arguing at this moment----\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But the Federal Government does look at it in the eyes of \na unified budget, because that is how we treat Social Security--and \nthat has been argued here in the Chamber--then, I say to my friend, the \nrest of the story is that when you put it all together, the State of \nNew Jersey, being as fiscally responsible as they are, is balancing \ncapital, capital reserves in the trust funds of the retirement system \nversus the investment of the bonds they floated and the obligation they \nget as an A or a AAA rating and their operating fund and they have a \nnear balanced budget. That is the reality of the report.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I would say to the distinguished Senator that they might \nhave a AAA rating, but it does not \n[[Page S2745]] equal the rating of the U.S. Government. And the reason \nit does not equal the rating of the U.S. Government is because we can \nprint the money. State borrowing is not as secure. There might be a \nGovernor in New Jersey that might make some bad economic decisions. \nThis might result in a bigger deficit than investors had imagined. \nLenders might believe that the State is not making a good investment. \nAt some point they might not be funding the pension funds as they \nshould be funding the pension funds. In fact, right now that is the \ndebate. And indeed that might affect their rating.\n  But we are talking about the Federal Government. I would say to the \ndistinguished Senator as well, look, I voted to take the Social \nSecurity trust funds out. Let us have the trust funds as a separate \npart of the budget. Let us have an operating budget and then let us \nhave the capital budget. Let us organize it clearly and tell the \nAmerican people, as the Senator points out, just like the State of New \nJersey, so that we can then say we have a balanced budget if we balance \nthe operating expenditures.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a moment for me to respond?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would yield only on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, on my time.\n  As I understand what the Senator just said, put another way, if New \nJersey wanted to pay off its bonds, it would have to take all the money \nit has in its pension funds. Bingo, that is a great idea, is it not? \nWhat does that do? I mean look, this is not real complicated.\n  The Senator from Idaho just laid it out. He said, look, if you take \nthe money that is in here for the pension funds, all that money that is \nsaved up, and you take the revenues that are coming in on a yearly \nbasis and you look at the money that is being paid out and the \nindebtedness, you are almost balanced. That is almost balanced if you \nempty the bank account, the bank account being the pension funds, which \nmeans those people do not get paid their pensions. What are we talking \nabout here?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure, on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator knows he is not talking about that. The \nSenator is talking about an annual payment on the bond, not emptying \nout the trust funds. We are not emptying out Social Security. The \nbottom line is that GAO agrees with me against the Senator on the \nconcept of a unified budget. Now, the Senator can play the rhetorical \ngames but the reality is States cannot print money. They must borrow.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I will not. They keep their rating by their fiscal \nresponsibility. That is exactly what they do. Interestingly enough, \nwhen you put it all together State by State, while we do not have a \ncapital budget--and we know we do not have it, and the reason we do not \nhave it is because we like the pay-as-you-go basis; it controls our \nability to spend and we know we cannot control our ability to spend--\nthen States are not in a bad shape. States have been offered this \nfinancing mechanism simply because they do not have the ability to \nprint money, because they are a part of the whole.\n  Now, we know that. Senators know that. And it comes down to the \nreality of fiscal solvency. States do not borrow beyond their ability \nto pay.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on my own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me talk like a good old-fashioned Republican here. Let \nus talk about how people back home do it.\n  Now, let us just look at what the Senator said. He said States have \ndebt. Well, they have debt. We are just saying we should not have any \ndebt. But he is saying--let us get this straight--we are going to \ncollect in taxes in New Jersey as we collect in taxes federally from \nthe FICA tax for Social Security and the income tax and excise tax and \nall the other taxes, the State of New Jersey, the State of Delaware, \nthe State of Illinois, the State of Utah, we are going to collect this \nmoney. Now, under the system that they are setting up, the total amount \nof money we collect cannot be less than the money we pay out. Right? \nOK, so far so good. New Jersey does the same thing. But what we are \ndoing in our unified budget is we are spending the Social Security \npensioners' money.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the Senator will yield at that point.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. And by the logic of the argument of the Senator from \nIdaho, he thinks we should continue to raid the Social Security trust \nfunds in order to balance the budget.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Precisely. If I can say to my friend, and he also thinks \nthe State of New Jersey--I do not know that what they do is different \nthan Delaware; I do not know what New Jersey does, but in most States \nthey do not take that money and spend it to pay for roads. Some States \ndo. Most do not. They have it segregated, their pension funds.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. New Jersey is the exception in that as well because New \nJersey--I do not know what the date of the Senator's economic report \nis, but in the recent New Jersey budget, the State borrowed $3 billion \nfrom the pension funds to fund the deficit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right. Now, let us get it like the homeowner does. Let us \nsay a homeowner decides, I want to retire, and I am just going to leave \nthe State of Delaware or the State of New Jersey. I want to sell all my \nassets and pay all my debts. OK. Well, what he or she has to do is sell \nthe house, sell everything they own. They take everything, all their \nincome, that year. They pay everything off. And whatever they have left \nmeans they are either in debt as they leave town on borrowed money for \nan Amtrak ticket or they have money in their pocket.\n  Now, how about if you put the State of New Jersey or any other State, \nor the Federal Government in the same situation.\n  What happens now? In order for the State of New Jersey to pay off all \nthat it owes, that is, its bond indebtedness, in 1 year, and all that \nit costs to operate the State for 1 year, it has to go and take money \nout of the pension fund. They could, if they took all the money out, \nsettle all their debts. But now there is no money left for my uncle \nwhen he retires.\n  Now, I do not call that solvency.\n   It may be that technically it is solvent, but it sure puts a lot of \npeople in jeopardy.\n\n  I do not want to carry this too far except to say, look, there is \nnothing sacrosanct about the way this amendment is written--this main \namendment is written. It makes sense to make sure we do not shift the \nincentive from accumulating debt on our children's backs so they have \nto pay interest on the debt, to denying them the ability to have any \ninfrastructure left where they can make this country competitive.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield for one last point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be delighted to.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Again, back to the New Jersey example, the State budget \nis roughly $16.9 billion, the indebtedness is $19.8 billion. Imagine \nwhat would happen to taxes if you had to fund New Jersey investment the \nway this amendment would require us to fund Federal investment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In 1 year.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. In 1 year.\n  Mr.BIDEN. Without being able to raid the retirement fund.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Right, while protecting the pensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we talked about State total indebtedness. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this survey of \nState and local governments by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. It is in \ncurrent dollars. Just going back to 1983, the total indebtedness was \n$167,289,000,000 for the States. In 1993, 10 years later, it is \n$387,680,000,000 indebtedness.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                  State government total indebtedness\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nFiscal year:                                                     Amount\n  1993..........................................................387,680\n  1992..........................................................371,901\n  1991..........................................................348,769\n  1990..........................................................318,254\n  1989..........................................................295,500\n  1988..........................................................276,786\n  1983..........................................................167,289\n  [[Page S2746]] 1978...........................................102,568\n  1973...........................................................59,374\n  1968...........................................................35,666\n  1963...........................................................23,176\n  1958...........................................................15,394\n  1953............................................................7,824\n  1948............................................................3,676\n\nNote.--Amounts are in current dollars.

Let us just hope everybody does not think we know what we \nare doing here and decide to pass in every State a balanced budget \namendment like we have here, because we will be in chaos. Why, \neverybody who stood up--the distinguished Senator from Utah, the \nmanager of the bill is here. His Governor, a really solid guy, a guy \nwho is a fiscal conservative I assume, a guy who is straight as an \narrow, and I asked him, ``Do you balance your budget?''\n  He said, ``No, we have a capital budget.''\n  I said, ``Should we have one federally?''\n  He said, ``Well, it is something you should look it. It seems like a \npretty good idea to me.''\n  Did anybody go out there and survey the Governors, whom we all think \nsomehow God invested them with some new knowledge now? Governors are \nin. That is great. Ask them do any of them object to us having a \ncapital budget? This is silly, refusing to do this.\n  I see my friend from New Jersey is on the floor. Would he like some \ntime yielded?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Please, go ahead. I have 8 minutes left. Is 5 minutes \nsufficient?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will talk fast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis courtesy. I also want to commend my senior colleague from New \nJersey because, though our arguments are going to be essentially the \nsame, I thought he did his very well.\n  I want to talk about this, the notion of separating the Federal \nbudget into capital and operating budgets, and only requiring that the \noperating budget be balanced, which is what I hear being said here. I \ncome out of the business community. I served as CEO of a major American \ncorporation and got my financial experience there. So as I approach \nthis problem, I see it, perhaps, from a moderately different \nperspective than some.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support cutting wasteful spending and \nreducing the deficit, but I have serious concerns about putting rigid \nrules for fiscal policy into the Constitution. The balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution should be defeated. However, if we are to \nhave such a constitutional requirement, it should at least establish \nrules that recognize simple and practical realities.\n  House Joint Resolution 1, unfortunately, does not do this. By \ncontinuing commingling of capital and operating budgets, it would \nincorporate budgetary procedures in our Constitution--the permanent law \nof the land--that no aware businessperson would ever think about \nadopting for their business. It flies in the face of common sense and \nstandard business practice.\n  Mr. President, how many times have we heard the same argument: If \nordinary Americans can balance their family budgets, if State \ngovernments can balance their budgets, and if businesses can balance \ntheir budgets, why can not the Federal Government?\n  It sounds good, Mr. President. And the real answer is that, yes, \nfamilies, States and businesses balance their budgets, principally \nbecause they are able to borrow for long-term investments and spread \nthat investment over a period of time so it is accounted for in \nrelation to the life of the asset as it is used. Families borrow money \nto buy a house or a car. For most families the achievement of an asset \nbase is almost exclusively because they are able to mortgage a piece of \nproperty, pay it off over a period of time, and accumulate some \ncapital.\n  States borrow for capital projects that will provide long-term \nbenefits, like roads and bridges. And, every day, businesses borrow to \ninvest in plant and equipment to make them more competitive. If they \ndid not, most would have no future, especially in today's increasingly \ntechnological age. They know they need to make investments in the \nfuture. That is why they do not balance all receipts and expenditures--\nthey balance only their operating budgets.\n  By contrast, Mr. President, House Joint Resolution 1 in its current \nform lumps the capital and operating budgets together, and makes no \ndistinction between investments and operational expenses. As a former \nCEO of a major cooperation, I can attest that this approach violates \nthe most basic principles of budgeting in the private sector. Virtually \nno major business in America commingles their capital and operating \nbudgets. Nor do State governments, and for good reason.\n  Mr. President, too much borrowing is a dangerous thing, that is \nclear. But borrowing per se is not an evil thing. In fact, it is often \nthe most appropriate way to finance long-term investments.\n  To illustrate the point, let us consider a town that is trying to \nattract investment by high technology companies, but which lacks the \nschools needed to support such companies.\n  If the town cannot afford to build new schools, its only option would \nbe to borrow. By doing so, and building those schools, the town would \npromote economic growth, improve the quality of life for years, and \nspread the costs among all the generations who would benefit. In other \nwords, it would be a win-win situation for everybody.\n  But now let us assume that this town must live under House Joint \nResolution 1. What would happen? The answer is: absolutely nothing. The \ntown could not afford the new schools. It would not attract high \ntechnology investment. Jobs would be lost. And the town's long-term \nfuture could be threatened. All in all, it would be a lose-lose \nsituation for everybody.\n  Well, Mr. President, the fate of that town is really a metaphor for \nwhat could happen to our country under a balanced budget amendment. Any \nitem that cannot be paid for by today's taxpayers will never be built--\neven if any borrowed funds would be repaid many times over, and even if \nthe economy would benefit substantially by the investment.\n  Mr. President, such a constitutional bias against long-term \ninvestment is especially troubling since our nation has long \nunderinvested in our infrastructure.\n  History has shown that investment in infrastructure is directly \nrelated to productivity. That is an economic reality that our \ncompetitors well understand, but which we have been ignoring. In fact, \nof the G-7 nations, the United States ranks at the bottom for \ninfrastructure investment as a percentage of GNP.\n  Japan spends three times more on infrastructure investment than the \nUnited States. The Japanese recognize that to stay competitive they \nneed an efficient transportation system. To match Japan's investment \nlevel for just 1 year, we would need to invest over $250 billion in \ninfrastructure.\n    \n    \n  Mr. President, as we meet here today, almost one-fourth of America's \nhighways are in poor or mediocre condition. Another 36 percent are \nrated only fair. One in five of the Nation's bridges are structurally \ndeficient, meaning that weight restrictions have been set to limit \ntruck traffic. There are unacceptable flight delays at 23 of the \nNation's major airports. If no capacity improvements are made, 33 of \nthe Nation's major airports will experience unacceptable delays by the \nyear 2002. The effects of poor roads and limited air traffic capacity \ncost our economy $45 billion annually.\n  As we move into the 21st century, which will demand substantial \ninfrastructure investment, we are laying the groundwork for economic \ndisaster.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues have been arguing recently that \nwe ought to shift power from Washington, and rely more on State \ngovernments to set policy. So it's instructive to see how State \ngovernments budget their resources. And the answer is: They borrow to \ninvest.\n  Take my State of New Jersey. Some of our Governors have pointed to \nour State's balanced budget requirement, and said the Federal \nGovernment should adopt a similar limitation. But \n[[Page S2747]] New Jersey's balanced budget requirement applies to our \noperating budget. It does not prohibit borrowing for investments. In \nfact, between 1960 and 1992, State debt increased from $914 million to \nalmost $20 billion. That works out to over $2,500 for each State \nresident.\n  Mr. President, balanced budget requirements in other States contain \nsimilar provisions for capital budgeting. So those of my colleagues who \nroutinely proclaim the superior wisdom of the States should not have to \nthink twice about voting for this amendment. It is entirely consistent \nwith State practices.\n  Mr. President, investments in our infrastructure are critical to our \nability to compete in the global economy and to maintain our country's \nstandard of living. But that investment would be impossible under this \nbalanced budget amendment, which requires today's taxpayers to pay for \nbenefits that only future generations will receive.\n  That does not make sense. And to put this kind of misguided policy \ninto the Constitution, where it would handcuff our economy in \nperpetuity, would be irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the long-term future of our \neconomy. We are talking about the future of our children and \ngrandchildren. I am thinking of my new granddaughter, Mollie, who was \nborn just a couple of weeks ago--and all the children born in New \nJersey this year. I want them to have as good a life as they possibly \ncan. And I want our Nation to make the investments necessary to make \nthat happen.\n  That is not going to be possible if the Constitution establishes \nbudget rules that create a bias against long-term investment and fly in \nthe face of common sense, established business practices, and State \nbudgetary practices.\n  Mr. President, capital budgeting works for America's businesses. It \nworks for America's families. It works for State governments. It should \nbe incorporated into this balanced budget amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this proposed exemption for a so-called \ncapital budget, in our opinion, could help evade the purpose of the \nbalanced budget amendment. So I urge its defeat for five reasons.\n  No. 1, this provision opens up a loophole in the balanced budget \nrule. There would be a powerful incentive for Congress and the \nPresident to help balance the budget by placing more programs in the \ncapital budget created by this amendment. An abused or gimmick capital \nbudget exemption could actually endanger capital investments, as \nfalsely styled capital items crowd out real capital investment.\n  It may also be that with a segregated capital budget Congress may \nlimit itself to spending on capital investment only in the capital \nbudget rather than spending more than 10 percent in the general budget.\n  But my primary concern is this--that this provision can be used as an \nescape valve for at least 10 percent of the budget each and every year. \nUnder President Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal year 1996 that \nwould mean that we could have yearly deficits of $160 billion per year, \nadding to the debt we already have, and growing. That means we would \nnot be improving things very much from the deficit levels currently \nprojected by the President. That is my first objection to this \namendment.\n  No. 2, the loophole problem is aggravated by the fact that there is \nno standard definition of what a capital budget really is. In President \nClinton's proposed fiscal year 1996 budget, the Office of Management \nand Budget admits this. OMB lists a number of broad categories of \nprograms that may or may not be considered capital expenditures. They \ninclude research and development, education and training, and other \nsuch categories--very broad categories. Even within these broad \ncategories there are questions about what programs should or should not \nbe included. The amendment's attempt to cure the definitional problem \nonly raises new definitional problems. The definition given is somewhat \ncircular. Just what does ``major public physical capital investment'' \nmean? Each term is subject to substantial debate. This is a \nconstitutional amendment. OMB's categories include a subdivision for \nmajor public physical capital investment, the same language used in the \nBiden amendment. This subdivision is broken into so-called direct \nnondefense and defense investments and grants to States and local \ngovernments.\n  All of this suggests that the capital budget would be easy to \nmanipulate, or as OMB says malleable. This amendment would, in fact, \ncreate an incentive to manipulate it. As the President's own budget \nanalysis admits,--this is on page 113 of the Analytical Perspectives \nVolume of the Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 1996, just \nsubmitted: It says, ``[t]hese and other definitional questions are hard \nto resolve.'' It goes on to say\n\n       [t]he process of reaching an answer [to the definitional \n     questions] with the capital budget would open the door to \n     manipulation because there would be an incentive to make the \n     operating expenses and deficit look smaller. By classifying \n     outlays as investment and using low depreciation rates this \n     would justify more spending by the program or the Government \n     overall.\n\n  It is particularly inappropriate to place capital budgeting in the \nConstitution when there is no agreement on what constitutes a capital \nbudget.\n  The third reason for my urging the defeat of this amendment is that \nthe Constitution is not the place to set budget priorities. The \nbalanced budget amendment seeks to create a process in which programs \ncompete for a limited pool of resources. A constitutional amendment \nshould be timeless and reflect a broad consensus--not make narrow \npolicy decisions.\n  This exemption creates in the founding document a new constitutional \nbudget subdivision with a percentage cap on it. We should not place \ntechnical language or budget programs into the Constitution which \nundercut its simplicity and universality.\n  My fourth reason for urging defeat of this amendment is that a \ncapital budget exemption is unnecessary. Total Federal spending has \ngenerally been above 20 percent of GDP, and less than 4 percent of \nFederal outlays are for nondefense physical investment, one of the \npossible definitions of capital investment.\n  In President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget, direct nondefense major \npublic physical capital investment is projected to be only 1.21 percent \nof total spending. Federal grants to State and local governments is \nprojected to be 2.44 percent of total spending. So, if we add the \nnondefense capital spending to grants, the total capital investment is \nonly 3.65 percent of projected Federal spending.\n  Direct major public physical capital investment for national defense \nis projected to be 3.23 percent of total spending. If you added in the \ndefense category, the total capital investment would be 6.98 percent of \nthe total budget.\n  Given the relatively small and constant share that such capital \nexpenditures--as usually understood--have in a very large Federal \nbudget, there is no need to remove capital expenditures from the \ngeneral budget.\n  One example might illustrate the lack of need for a capital budget. \nAlthough President Eisenhower initially proposed that the Federal \nInterstate Highway System be financed through borrowing, Congress \ndecided to keep it on budget and finance it through a gas tax at the \nsuggestion of Senator Albert Gore, Sr. We are unlikely to have a \ncapital expenditure of this magnitude again. But, if we do, there is no \nreason to create a standing exemption for such investment.\n  If Congress decides to borrow for a particular large investment, this \navenue is available under the balanced budget amendment as now drafted, \nand to the extent that the three-fifths vote provision in this \namendment for additional capital investments replicates the general \nprovisions of the balanced budget amendment, this amendment of my \nfriend and colleague from Delaware simply is pointless. Under the \nbalanced budget amendment, Congress can borrow to finance any such \ninvestments if three-fifths of each House vote to do so. This provision \nof this amendment is simply duplicative of the underlying amendment's \nprovisions.\n  The fifth reason I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment \nis that capital spending should compete in the \n[[Page S2748]] budget like all other spending. The balanced budget \namendment seeks to foster an atmosphere in which Congress prioritizes \nspending options within the revenues available. House Joint Resolution \n1 does prevent the creation of separate operating and capital accounts \nto show where federal money is being spent. Any implementing \nlegislation which creates such separate accounts, however, must leave \nthe total budget in balance, since implementing legislation cannot \nsubvert the clear mandate of this amendment. But, Mr. President, \naccounting techniques should not subvert the prioritizing function of \nthe amendment.\n  The proposed exemption allows the entire budget to be used for \nnoncapital investment like simple transfer payments, and then allows a \n10-percent increase in Federal spending--and the debt to fund it--for \ncapital investments. The General Accounting Office saw the fallacy \nimplicit in this exemption when it said, ``The choice between spending \nfor investment and spending for consumption should be seen as setting \npriorities within an overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for \nrelaxing that constraint and permitting a larger deficit.'' GAO, Budget \nPolicy: Prompt Action Required to Avert Long-Term Harm to the Economy, \nJune 1992, p. 79.\n  The GAO further said, ``The creation of explicit categories for \nGovernment capital and developmental investment expenditures should not \nbe viewed as a license to run deficits to finance these categories.'' \nId.\n  Each Congress should make its own decisions about spending priorities \neach year, but within a rule of fiscal discipline as the balanced \nbudget amendment would require. This is particularly true where this \nproffered exemption for a so-called capital budget is so large that it \nnearly maintains the status quo of deficits above $160 billion a each \nyear. Under the provisions of this amendment, we could continue to roll \nup debt almost as fast as we do now, maybe even faster as time goes on. \nThis amendment creates an exception that nearly swallows the rule.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the revenue portion of this \namendment unduly hamstrings the Federal Government with respect to the \nsale of assets. If the Government decides to sell off some outdated or \nunneeded assets, there is no reason not to count the revenue resulting \nfrom the sale as revenue to the Federal Government. This provision \nmight even create a disincentive to get fair value from assets we sell \nbecause the revenues would not count as revenues, and to me this makes \nno fiscal or business sense.\n  Finally, there is a flaw in the analogy to States and private \nentities that the proponents of this amendment have made. Besides the \nfact that the Federal Government does not need capital budgeting as \nmuch as smaller entities, the analogy to capital budgeting by \nbusinesses or States is flawed because the Federal Government is not \nsubject to the same checks as either private businesses or State and \nlocal governments. Private businesses are disciplined by markets. State \nand local governments' capital budgeting is subject to State bond \nratings. These checks on the abuse of capital budgets would not exist \nunder a Federal capital budget making it far more likely that a Federal \ncapital budget could be abused.\n  Mr. President, so that we can move quickly here this evening, or at \nleast adequate speed, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the Biden amendment Senator Feingold be recognized to \nmake a motion to refer, and that time prior to a motion to table be \ndivided in the following fashion: That no amendments be in order prior \nto the motion to table, 20 minutes under the control of Senator \nFeingold, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Hatch.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time on the Feingold motion the majority leader, or \nhis designee, be recognized to make a motion to table the Feingold \nmotion.\n  I have been asked to announce by the majority leader that this is not \nnecessarily the final vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nconcept of a capital budget embodied in this amendment offered by \nSenator Biden and Minority Leader Daschle.\n  This amendment would establish a separate capital budget for the \nFederal Government, which would be distinct from the general operating \nbudget. It would provide the mechanism to make major physical \ninvestments that are necessary to remain internally strong and able to \ncompete with other nations for the jobs and opportunities our citizens \ndeserve.\n  I think we all realize the benefits and importance of long-term \ninvestments in our Nation's infrastructure. In creating a separate \ncapital budget, we would recognize the difference between the \ngovernment spending that responds to immediate needs and the spending \nthat serves as an investment in America over generations.\n  Families are familiar with this concept. Millions of households \nborrow to make very specific investments in their own futures, such as \nthe mortgage required to buy a home. They do this because they realize \nthe long-term benefits of home ownership. They recognize that many of \nthe things they buy will last beyond the time they are done making \npayments on them. My highly respected friend, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, has described how he went into debt to purchase a \nbedroom set when he and his wife were younger. This very frugal, wise \nperson made a sensible investment to increase his family's standard of \nliving.\n  The fundamental purpose for a capital budget is to ensure that \nAmerica's citizens of today are targeting certain resources into our \ncollective needs over future needs. When states issue bonds to pay for \nthings like drinking water purification systems, they are recognizing \nthat the benefits of that new system will go to many people over the \ncourse of 25 years of so.\n  If a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution passes, it should \nbe constructed to treat a one-time, one-year tax break differently than \nthe long-term investments in the necessary pillars of a strong nation. \nI think of the facilities needed to keep water pure and safe. Airports, \nhighways and roads are that are the lifeblood of our economy, and are \nthe only way for rural areas to have real opportunities for jobs and \nindustries.\n  Many of those in favor of a balanced budget amendment point out that \n49 states work within a balanced budget requirement. However, most of \nthose requirements allow for state borrowing to fund capital \ninvestments.\n  In West Virginia, while we do not have a formal capital budget \nprocess, our state is permitted to borrow to fund long-term \ninvestments. The state is allowed to repay these debts over time from \ngeneral revenues provided that there is a statewide vote granting the \nauthority to do so. The state may also incur debt without this vote if \nthe repayment is something other than general revenues.\n  In November, the voters in West Virginia held one of these statewide \nvotes and passed what was called amendment 3. It was designed to fund \nwater and sewer projects--an investment they felt will give them and \ntheir families benefits over a number of years. Amendment 3 \nspecifically authorized the state legislature to issue and sell up to \n$300 million in state bonds to be paid for over a period of 30 years.\n  Mr. President, as a former Governor, I am more than familiar with the \ndifference between operating budgets and capital investments that \ncannot be neglected. I know the cost all too well of neglecting \ninfrastructure, health and safety facilities, transportation--when I \nbecame Governor, I faced those costs and fought to catch up so our \nstate could compete for the jobs and opportunities that we saw other \nstates win as a result of their superior roads and other assets.\n  I am afraid that if we pass this balanced budget amendment without \nallowing for a capital budgeting process, we will make a bad mistake \neven worse. The idea of using the Constitution to set economic policy \nis bad enough. Passing such an amendment without allowing for a \nseparate capital budget that recognizes the difference between long and \nshort term investments is short-sighted and could be very costly to \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, all of my colleagues should vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all I can say is I understand what my dear \nfriend and colleague is trying to do. I just disagree, and I think the \nSenate should disagree because it would be a \n[[Page S2749]] tremendous loophole. These five reasons that I have \nlisted are reasons why I think and why I believe that this amendment \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in a minute and 20 seconds I will give five \nreasons why the Senator is wrong, in my view. One, he makes conclusory \nstatements. Two, major physical assets is defined in the amendment, and \nit is amazing how inventive he is about redefining what is in the \namendment. He accurately read everything the GAO said, but that is not \nwhat we say in amendment. Four, we want competition to be skewed \nbetween long-term investment so we do not have our children paying the \nsame price they are paying for the accumulated debt we have here. And \nfive, nobody else does it the way my friend from Utah wants it done. I \nthink it is time we ask ourselves, ``I wonder why.''\n  I urge those of us in this body who agree with the need for a capital \nbudget to vote against tabling.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When the Senator says ``nobody else does it the way the \nSenator from Utah is suggesting,'' the Senator is referring not only to \nState and local governments, which borrow in order to fund a capital \nbudget; he is talking about businesses which borrow and about \nindividuals who borrow in order to fund a capital asset; he is talking \nabout all of the other countries in the world. He is absolutely \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Maybe we can be different, but I hope we are not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 32 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will just say this. I have made the case that borrowing \nby State and local governments and by businesses is completely \ndifferent from the borrowing for capital budgets by the Federal \nGovernment. I do not think you can make the analogy as simple as has \nbeen made by some of my colleagues.\n  I yield back whatever time remains.\n  Mr. BIDEN. On behalf of the minority leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a list of some of those in support of the amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Support the Biden-Bradley Amendment to the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Dear Senator: As currently drafted, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment (BBA) would create a political straight jacket that \n     could push Congress to sell off our nation's treasured public \n     lands such as national parks, forests and wildlife refuges. \n     To help prevent this consequence, we urge you to support an \n     amendment Senators Biden and Bradley are expected to offer \n     this week to the BBA. The Biden-Bradley amendment would \n     establish a capital budget to assure continued federal \n     investments in major public assets from being counted toward \n     reductions in the operating budget deficit.\n       Some policy groups have voiced support for selling off \n     public lands as a means of lowering the federal deficit, most \n     recently at a January hearing before the House Interior \n     Appropriations Subcommittee. While such a proposal seems \n     unthinkable to most Americans, the BBA could push Congress in \n     this direction. This possibility is not merely academic. \n     After a previous administration initiated wide-spread sales \n     of public assets to reach deficit reduction targets, Congress \n     approved the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (contained in \n     Public Law 101-508), which prohibits the Congressional Budget \n     Office from counting the sale of public assets toward deficit \n     reduction.\n       The reason for such a prohibition is obvious. While sales \n     of federal assets may help reduce the deficit during the year \n     in which they occur, the resulting one-time revenues do \n     nothing to reduce the persistent spending problems that cause \n     continued federal deficits. Far from reducing spending, \n     selling public lands only results in the exchange of one \n     public asset--say a national park--for another, cash. As \n     such, it amounts to budgetary gimmickry in the name of \n     deficit elimination.\n       Circumstances may well arise in which it is appropriate for \n     Congress to consider the sale of individual federal land \n     holdings. The Biden-Bradley amendment does nothing to inhibit \n     that. But the Biden-Bradley amendment does assure that the \n     balanced budget amendment does not provide a perverse \n     incentive to sell off large portions of the public estate to \n     produce phony deficit results.\n       We urge you to support the Biden-Bradley amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rodger Schlickeisen, President, Defenders of Wildlife; \n           Brent Blackwelder, President Friends of the Earth; Paul \n           Pritchard, President, National Parks & Conservation \n           Association; John Adams, President, Natural Resources \n           Defense Council; Beth Millemann, Executive Director, \n           Coast Alliance; Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra \n           Club; Peter A.

Under the previous order the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send a motion to refer to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] moves to refer \n     H.J. Res. 1 to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to \n     report back forthwith H.J. Res. 1 in status quo and at the \n     earliest date possible to issue a report, the text of which \n     shall be the following: It is a Sense of the Committee that \n     the language of the report to accompany S.J. Res. 1, Senate \n     report 104-5, which appears on page 19, and states, ``Among \n     the Federal programs that would not be covered by S.J. Res. 1 \n     is the Electric Power Program of the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority which will be deemed null and void and have no \n     effect as the legislative history in interpretation of H.J. \n     Res. 1.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the purpose of this motion is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  The Judiciary Committee report accompanying Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nhas the most extraordinary passage which flatly says that the Electric \nPower Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority is not--repeating this \nnow--is not covered by the balanced budget amendment, on the grounds \n[[Page S2750]] that this program is paid for by the Electric Power \nProgram.\n  Not another single agency in our Government is singled out in the \ncommittee report in this manner. Only the Tennessee Valley Authority is \nexempted. That is right. Not Social Security, that is not exempted. But \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority is exempted.\n  Mr. President, we have heard of appropriations pork. Now I think we \nhave a new creature--constitutional pork. We are making constitutional \nhistory here, and at the same time we are creating a far more \nsophisticated pork than we have ever had in this institution. We are \nputting it right into the Constitution.\n  Not only, then, Mr. President, are the advocates of the balanced \nbudget amendment saying they will not lay out a plan and say what they \nare going to cut, they are doing it better. They are actually \nprotecting one particular program over all the other programs by \nwriting in committee report language. It is an incredible provision for \na committee report.\n  To put it another way, Mr. President, this is an attempt to put the \nequivalent of an earmark into a Constitution for a program that is of a \nconcern to particular Members of Congress. Do not let anyone be kidded. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has to interpret the language of the \nConstitution. They will be looking at that committee report to get a \nsense of what was intended. They will see that the most important \nprogram apparently in all of our Government, of everything that this \nGovernment has ever done or ever will do is one program: The Tennessee \nValley Authority. The only one the Judiciary Committee thought should \nbe treated in a special way.\n  Let me raise just two reasons why I think this language is totally \ninappropriate. First, the proponents of this language argue that the \nTVA's Electric Power Program should not be covered by the balanced \nbudget amendment because the financing of that program has been the \nsole responsibility of its own electric ratepayers, not the U.S. \nTreasury and the Nation's taxpayers, since 1959.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is an argument but it is certainly a \ndebatable one. The Congressional Budget Office in its annual report on \noptions on reducing the deficit, has this to say about the TVA Electric \nPower Program. It says:\n\n       Because many TVA stewardship activities are necessary to \n     maintain its power system, their cost would more \n     appropriately be borne by the users of the power. Direct cost \n     to the Federal Government could be reduced by about $70 \n     million annually if TVA were to increase power rates or fees \n     to cover costs of all stewardship.\n\n  Mr. President, CBO thus says that the Federal taxpayers are, in fact, \nsubsidizing the electric power user. It is not just being paid for by \nthe folks in that area of the country.\n  So, Mr. President, that is not a dispute we need to settle here or \nnow. That is what the advocates will say every time, ``We do not have \nto decide this now.''\n  But the point is that the backers of this language have attempted to \ntilt the argument on their side by placing this language in the \ncommittee report that will be used to interpret the meaning of this \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  So what proposition does this stand for? Apparently, so all agencies \nare not equal under the balanced budget amendment. Some--in fact, one--\njust one program gets special treatment.\n  We will take a look at some of the other quasi-public agencies that \ncould make a pretty good claim as the same status as the TVA. Looking \nat the U.S. Postal Service--and here is a routine letter I received \nfrom the Postal Service in December 1994--that depends exclusively on \npostage and fees rather than taxpayers' revenue for operations, and has \ndone this since 1982. Each class of mail by law must cover its cost and \nwe must break even over time.\n  So the argument, Mr. President, that the Postal Service should \nreceive special status under the balanced budget amendment would seem \nto be very much the same as the argument used to exempt the TVA. Why \nwas the Postal Service not mentioned in the committee report as being \nexempted from the balanced budget amendment?\n  Now, if you do not like the Post Office, and a lot of people do not, \nthere are a number of other Federal programs that are operated entirely \non revenues produced by users.\n  For example, the Department of Agriculture's Marketing Service \nprovides grading services on a user-fee basis for meat, poultry, eggs, \ndairy products, fruits, vegetables, cotton, and tobacco. Should these \nactivities be exempted from any impact of the balanced budget amendment \nsince they are entirely funded by the users and not the Federal \ntaxpayers?\n  Let us try the Farm Credit Administration. This is an independent \nagency in the executive branch of the U.S. Government which is \nresponsible for the regulation of the examination of banks and \nassociations and related entities that collectively comprise our farm \ncredit system. The expenses of the Farm Credit Administration are paid \nthrough assessments against institutions under its jurisdiction. So, \nagain, here is another one--not the TVA--but another program that \noperates at no direct cost to the taxpayer.\n  So I ask again, is the Farm Credit Administration exempt like TVA \nfrom the impacts of the balanced budget amendment? If so, why was it \nnot also cited in the constitutional history reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee's report in the same manner?\n  What about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, another quasi-\nGovernment corporation established in 1933? FDIC does not operate on \nfunds appropriated by Congress but on assessments on deposits held by \ninsured banks and from interest on the required investment of its \nsurplus funds in Government securities. Is FDIC covered or not, and if \nnot, why was it not cited by the Judiciary Committee?\n  I will tell you why, Mr. President. The answer is clear. The \nTennessee Valley Authority was singled out in the committee report \nbecause those concerned about its future do not want any budget cuts \nimposed upon this entity. It is not surprising in light of this whole \nbalanced budget amendment, nobody wants to get cut.\n  Guess what? The folks who support the TVA are fearful of the Federal \nbudget knife hitting one of the programs they support in part, I \nsuspect, because there have actually been a number of bills introduced \nin Government to cut off the subsidies to the TVA.\n  I introduced on the first day of this Congress S. 43 which would \nterminate several current TVA programs and provide for a report on what \nremaining functions should be separated from the Federal Government. My \nRepublican colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Scott Klug, has \nproposed legislation along similar lines in the other body.\n  TVA supporters know that TVA is on the short list of most deficit \nreduction advocates, and that is why they want to provide it with \nspecial protection that no other program of any kind in the Federal \nGovernment is getting.\n  Mr. President, it is not just the CBO that cited TVA programs as \nneeding reform. Citizens Against Government Waste include TVA in their \nprime cuts list for 1994. Reducing funding for TVA was also part of the \nKerrey-Brown deficit reduction package, which I cosponsored. The \ndeficit reduction package of a group of Senators led by Senator John \nKerry, which I also cosponsored, included it, and also the so-called \nfamous Penny-Kasich plan also listed the TVA. There is no reason why we \nshould allow this program to gain special protection as a result of the \nlanguage that was put in the committee report.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I am afraid that this attempt in the \ncommittee report begins to make this whole balanced budget process look \na little bit like a $3 bill. My motion will not disturb the balanced \nbudget amendment in any way. It simply says that the committee report \nlanguage that singled this agency out for special protection is null \nand void and cannot be used for legislative history purposes when we \nfinally get around to achieving a balanced budget.\n  So to conclude, it is a simple proposition. We just need to ask the \ncommittee to come up with an additional report to change this. \nOtherwise, we will have enshrined a new tradition, something that no \nDemocrat or Republican has ever achieved before, we have created \nconstitutional pork.\n  [[Page S2751]] I hope that every Senator rejects this attempt to \nexempt one program while all the others have to be on the chopping \ntable for potential cuts.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I was unaware that this motion would be \nmade. It caught me by surprise. I would like to go into great detail, \nand I did not know that there would be a time limitation until it had \nalready occurred in regard to it. I would like to go into detail, which \nI will later, hoping that this is defeated and then we would have an \nopportunity to explain the history and the background and the reason \nwhy the TVA is a self-operating agency of the Government and, \ntherefore, because of its uniqueness, different than any other agency \nor body, should be exempt in the balanced budget amendment.\n  This involves the electrical power program of the TVA, just the \nelectrical power program. Certainly, the electrical power program of \nthe TVA ought to be paid by the power users, by the ratepayers and not \nby the Government. And the intention of this report language is to \nguarantee and ensure that the Government does not have to pay for the \nelectrical power system of the Tennessee Valley Authority. That is the \npurpose it was put in there.\n  They have variances that occur all the time, and they have to act \nimmediately. They may have a tornado, they may have a downed situation \npertaining to the transmission of electrical current and they may have \nto move. They may have to spend money immediately relative to those \nmatters.\n  The ratepayers ought to be the ones to pay for it. That is the reason \nit was put in there. It was put in there for the protection of the \ntaxpayers of the United States. It is put in there to protect the \ntaxpayers so they do not have to pay for the electricity rates of the \npeople in Tennessee and Alabama and Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky, and \nthe other places.\n  We have a limited time. Senator Ford, as I understand it, wants to \nmake some remarks. I yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator give me 1 minute?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me associate my remarks with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. TVA is important. TVA rests on its \nown bottom. TVA serves the ratepayers. The ratepayers pay TVA. It is \ngood for the valley; it is good for economic development. It is a \nprogram that works.\n  I am opposed to using Social Security money. That is fine, we lost \nthat one, but we should not lose this one. This is an amendment that is \nout of order, in my opinion, as it relates to the budget. And the \nincome to TVA is important.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just say, this is quick. We did not have an \nopportunity. We have 10 minutes. It does not give us much time. I just \nhope that our colleagues will vote against this amendment; that we will \nhave an opportunity then, if it is brought up again, to explain it in \nmore detail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself such time as is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I definitely believe the TVA should be given the fair \nconsideration, indeed, that all programs should be given when it comes \ntime to balance the budget. I am willing to look at the arguments as to \nwhat aspects of TVA should be continued and what aspects should not--\nall the arguments.\n  But it is a little difficult for me to hear Senators from that area \nof the country get up and talk about how wonderful TVA has been to that \npart of the country. I recognize the Depression, New Deal, and the \nhistory of TVA. I have similar feelings with regard to aspects of our \ndairy programs and those programs that have helped keep our dairy \nfarmers going all these years. But I have not sought through the \ncommittee report or any other mechanism to write a special protection \nfor the dairy program or even some of the other programs that affect \nour State, such as the Farm Credit Administration, another quasi-public \nagency that does not rely on taxpayer dollars directly. We do not have \nan exemption for that.\n  If there is to be any meaning to the notion that everything has to be \non the table and that this is not the time to make the preliminary \ndecisions, it must mean that the TVA cannot be exempt while all these \nother worthy programs that mean so much to people around the country \nare not exempt.\n  All this is--let me be clear, this is not an attack on the TVA--this \nis just saying there should not be any language in a committee report \nthat is going to be used by the courts and everyone else in the future \nto interpret the balanced budget amendment that exempts one program.\n  That is all. It is a very simple proposition. I am sure much later we \nwill get to the merits of the TVA. So I would suggest this is a very \nmild suggestion that we not mess around with the future of the balanced \nbudget issue by writing in exemptions in a committee report that relate \ndirectly to the constitutional provision.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I agree that it may not be an attack on the TVA. It is an attack on \nthe balanced budget amendment. I think the language of the committee \nspeaks for itself. The financing of the TVA power program has been the \nsole responsibility of its electric ratepayers, not the U.S. Treasury \nand the Nation's taxpayers.\n  That says it all, Mr. President. It is not an annual expenditure. It \nis not a would-be pork barrel project. It is not the nonpower program \nwhich is on the table along with everything else. It has to do with a \npower program that is self-financing. And of course, all this is \nanother attempt by those who would defeat the balanced budget amendment \nto raise a red herring. We have seen time and time again those who \nwould offer amendments, amendment after amendment after amendment, \nwhile at the same time stating that if their amendments, or all of \ntheir amendments in their totality were adopted they would still oppose \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  So I suggest that we analyze this for what it is. It is another \nattempt to encumber and somehow obfuscate the issue as far as the \nbalanced budget amendment is concerned.\n  The committee considered this situation. It analyzed the power \nprogram of the Tennessee Valley Authority and stated the clear fact. It \nis not whether or not we want it on budget or we want it off budget or \nwhether it ought to be on or whether it ought to be off. We can debate \nthat at the proper time. But it simply stated the fact that since 1959, \nthe financing of that program has been the sole responsibility of its \nown electric ratepayers.\n  So I would urge that we defeat this amendment and not go against the \nlanguage that was well considered before the committee and we move on \nwith what we are supposed to be here about, and that is bankrupting the \nnext generation. I think we get too balled up in some of these \ncollateral issues sometimes. We forget sometimes what we are about.\n  Mr. President, with the enactment of the 1959 Self-Financing Act, the \nTVA Board was given the authority to make power system decisions. In \nturn, the power system became the sole financial responsibility of TVA \nratepayers, not the Treasury or U.S. taxpayers. Since 1959, the power \nsystem has not received appropriations and has been funded exclusively \nwith power revenues and proceeds from the sale of bonds which, by law, \nare not obligations of or guaranteed by the United States.\n  All taxpayer funds originally invested in the power system, \ndesignated as the appropriation investment, are treated on the power \nsystem's balance sheet as the Government's equity. Since 1959, TVA has \nmade annual payments to the Treasury--currently $20 million per year--\nto reduce that investment's balance. TVA also makes \n[[Page S2752]] an annual return payment on that balance, which is \ncalculated at the Treasury's current interest rate. This covers the \nTreasury's cost of money and keeps the taxpayers whole.\n  Since the receipts and outlays of the power system are its alone, it \nis incorrect and misleading to regard them as receipts and outlays of \nthe United States. This view was shared by Senator Howard Baker while a \nmember of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, TVA's \njurisdictional committee.\n  In reporting legislation in both 1975 and 1979 which increased the \nTVA bond ceiling, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nexpressly agreed that ``the obligations represented by bond issues \nunder the increased ceiling will not result in any outlay involving \n`Government funds''' and that TVA power funds ``are not, however, \ngenerated through the general treasury and do not affect Federal fiscal \npolicy.'' In both the 1975 and 1979 reports, the committee also found \nthat there would be ``no cost'' to the Government ``in implementing \nthis legislation.''\n  Mr. President, there are those of us who think we are bankrupting the \nnext generation, that we need to do some things fundamentally----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield another minute?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield one more minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That we need to do some fundamental things to change \nthe direction of this country. There are those of us who are concerned \nabout the investment rate, which is now one of the lowest in the \nindustrial world; there are some of us concerned about the savings \nrate, which is the lowest in the industrialized world. We are concerned \nabout the growth. That is what we are supposed to be discussing here \nwith regard to the balanced budget amendment, not singling out some \nself-financing program by folks who would basically love to defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment in its entirety.\n  So I would urge that we keep that in mind, and we do defeat this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself such time as I need.\n  Mr. President, I am kind of amazed at the comments of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. He is suggesting that this amendment is an attempt to \nderail the balanced budget amendment. But I think everyone should know \nthat I could be here delaying debate--I have the floor. I could be \nreading the entire history of the TVA to the Senate, if that is what I \nwanted to do--just open it up and read and read. That is permitted \nunder the rules as we know.\n  That is not what I did. I entered into a very brief time agreement, \n20 minutes for my side. It is because I am not, Mr. President, trying \nto hold up the balanced budget amendment. In fact, this will take 2 \nseconds. All we have to do is vote in a few minutes to strike this \nridiculous language from the committee report that tries to protect one \nprogram out of all the programs in the Federal budget.\n  So I want everyone to know who is listening, it is completely false \nthat this is an attempt to delay the balanced budget amendment. It is \njust 20 minutes, 20 minutes to say why should one program of all the \nprograms in the United States in our budget get special treatment and \nall the rest, including Social Security, which the Senator from \nCalifornia worked so hard on--\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from California for a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My question is, is the Senator aware that not only \nTVA is excluded but also the Bonneville Authority, and I believe others \nas well?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. There is only one entity that we are aware of that has \nbeen specifically named. If there are others that should be named, I \nthink that should be the subject of similar amendments. And I am very \nglad to see the senior Senator from California asked that question \nbecause she knows very well how hard she fought to try to get an \nexemption for a program that really probably does deserve the \nexemption, and that is the contract with the American people in the \nform of Social Security. But that is not the one that got protected.\n  Mr. President, this suggestion that this is a delay tactic is very \ntroubling to me. I think it is not fair. In fact, I find it astonishing \nthat the Senator from the very State that gets protected by this thing \nmore than any other State, Tennessee, stands up and says this is a \ndelay tactic.\n  I am just calling it what it is. It is a great deal for Tennessee. I \nwould love to be able to exempt all the programs in Wisconsin up front \nin the committee language and then pass a balanced budget amendment. I \nwould get a lot of pats on the back back home for that one. But I did \nnot do it. I would not try to do it because I know very well that is a \ndenial of the very meaning of the balanced budget amendment.\n  All the folks on the other side talked about the glidepath, about the \nright to know; we cannot make those decisions now. If we lay out what \nis going to be cut and is not cut, what happens is that the process \nfalls apart.\n  I suggest this committee language, if it is not struck, is the \nbeginning of the end of any serious attempt to balance the budget \nbecause there would be a tremendous outcry across the country that this \nand only this program is important enough to be protected and that \nevery other program did not count.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is a very, very clear amendment that \nshould not even be controversial. That language should not be in the \nreport. We all know it. And I would certainly hope TVA has to fight the \nsame battle that everybody else does as the coming months go on.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield one minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the language of the report is among the \nFederal programs, and among the Federal programs where we guarantee \nbonds are REA's in Wisconsin and Illinois and Minnesota, and other \nStates. We guaranteed Lockheed bonds in California. We guaranteed bonds \nfor New York City, for Chrysler. Only when there is an outlay by the \nFederal Government is that subject to the balanced budget amendment. \nThat is what the report language says. It is good language, and the \namendment should be defeated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself sufficient time.\n  Let us take a look at the language. It is true, as the Senator from \nIllinois says, ``Among the Federal programs that would not be covered \nby Senate Joint Resolution 1 is the electric power program of the \nTennessee Valley Authority.''\n  But that is all that is mentioned. It is a real valuable thing for a \nprogram to be the only program out of the entire U.S. budget that gets \nexempted specifically. In other words, all the others will have to \nargue somehow that they are within that language. Maybe they will have \nto go to court, if they are allowed to go to court. We are not even \nsure about that.\n  One program gets named, one program is on this pedestal and even \nthough the Senator from Illinois, Mr. President, intends that others be \nmentioned, they ought to be mentioned. If we have to do that, let us \nhave the committee issue a new report and list all the programs that \nare exempt. I am sure it would be as comfortable to the people who \nsupport those programs as this language is comforting to those who \nsupport the TVA. This is about the sweetest deal you can get, a \nconstitutional exemption for your program while everyone else has to \nget into the field and has to fight each other for scarce Federal \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I cannot accept this argument of the Senator from \nIllinois. If it was intended the other programs be mentioned, they \nshould have been mentioned. Only one is mentioned, and that program \nshould not get that kind of special treatment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n   [[Page S2753]] Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the final time I \nhave to the distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHeflin, from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes, 22 seconds.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as I mentioned before in my opening \nargument, I reiterate it because it has not been answered: Really, the \npurpose of this is to protect the taxpayers. It is to say, and to have \nin report language--it is not in the language of the constitutional \namendment, but in the report language--its purpose is to protect the \ntaxpayers from where the taxpayers might have to pay or subsidize the \npower program of the Tennessee Valley Authority. It is put there with \nthe idea of protecting the taxpayers, and that is what it has been.\n  The TVA program has been that the entire power program shall not be \nsubject to appropriations and it is not subject to other types of \nrevenues that come in. The revenues that operate in regard to this are \nstrictly the ratepayers'. They get a bill. The ratepayers get a bill \njust like every other utility user gets a bill, and they pay it every \nmonth. Those revenues do not go into the Treasury of the United States. \nIt is there for the protection of the taxpayers. It is report language \nand it is different from the language that is in the constitutional \namendment. It is not mentioned in there. It is just report language to \ngive some guidance, to show that the taxpayers are not to have to pay \nin regard to the rates of the utility users.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Motion to Reconsider--Roll Call Vote 72\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the last vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 seconds remaining. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry; is there any time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin controls 3 minutes \nand 53 seconds.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just to conclude, this is really a very \nmild thing to ask. I am just asking that this process be a little bit \nhonest and that we not mention in the committee report that will be \nused to interpret the constitutional amendment one program. There are \nmany quasi-public agencies. This notion that the TVA is a self-\nsupporting program is just an argument--debatable. It is nothing better \nthan that. The CBO says it is not.\n  We are going to accept here as a part of the constitutional process \nwe are engaged in this absurd notion that simply because an argument is \nmade by the supporters of the program, it is not going to be on the \ntable? I cannot accept that.\n  I suggest again, if we are going to go forward with this \nconstitutional pork, it will become the symbol of the lack of \nseriousness of the balanced budget amendment, the ultimate proof that, \nwhen given an opportunity, special interests will be protected even \nwith a balanced budget amendment, the principle being enshrined in the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  I implore my colleague, take a minute or two to strike this language. \nIt has no other consequence. I implore you to get this out of there so \nthe process of balancing the budget can be an honest one, when we \nfinally get to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will be unable to \nfind any additional amendments to be offered this evening. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia plans to lay down an amendment, as I understand it, \ntomorrow morning?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would like to have another amendment or two tonight. I \ncannot force Members to offer amendments, so this will be the last vote \nof the day.\n  I am not certain how long we will be in session tomorrow, but \nprobably most of the day. I am still prepared, as I have indicated \nbefore, if we can get some agreement to bring this to a conclusion, to \ngo out Friday and all next week. We await some response from the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  So we are prepared to entertain an agreement that might bring this to \na conclusion. There will be a cloture vote tomorrow. I will file two \ncloture motions tonight, so there will be two cloture votes when we \nreturn on next Wednesday. So Members will know that there will be votes \non Wednesday--probably a goodly number of votes Wednesday.\n  It is my understanding there are 30-some amendments filed at the \ndesk. I do not know how many of those Members intend to call up. I \nthought the other day I was informed it would only be three major \namendments. Then we were told maybe it will be 8 or 10. Now we are told \nit is 36. That would mean we have still a long, long time on this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I understand how important it is. I understand you do not amend the \nConstitution lightly. I think we have now exceeded by a couple of days \nthe longest time we have spent on this issue. I think we passed the \nbalanced budget amendment--in the 97th Congress we passed a balanced \nbudget amendment after 11 days of floor action. There were 31 \namendments offered. The resolution passed the Senate by a vote of 69 to \n31.\n  We have not been able to repeat that performance so far on the number \nof days or the number of amendments. But, hopefully, on the number of \nvotes. And we would settle for that.\n  This will be the last vote today.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the motion.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to lay on \nthe table the motion offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of future \ngenerations. Our national deficit for fiscal year 1994 stood at $203 \nbillion. Gross interest on the national debt is now the second largest \nexpenditure in the entire budget--higher than Defense spending. The \nFederal Government, this year alone, will spend an estimated $295 \nbillion in interest on the national debt, which is a 400-percent \nincrease since 1980 and an amount equal to 57 percent of all personal \nincome taxes collected. Our total accumulated Federal debt stands at \n$4.65 trillion--$18,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nLike every family and business in America, when the Government borrows \nmoney it must pay interest on its debts. Given these grim statistics, I \nbelieve that we in Congress must amend the Constitution of the United \nStates and pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Dr. Robert Reischauer, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nin his cost estimate to the Committee on the Judiciary stated:\n\n       Over the entire 1996-2002 period, the savings in CBO's \n     illustrative path that result directly from policy changes \n     would total more than $1 trillion--in relation to a baseline \n     that includes an inflation adjustment for discretionary \n     spending after 1998.\n\n  Amending the Constitution, which represents the very core of American \nlife, a governing principle born of a revolutionary war, withstanding a \ncivil war, two world wars, the war for equality throughout the Nation \nand endless conflicts, both social and global, is not something to be \ntaken lightly. That said--I believe our current conflict to conquer and \neliminate our public debt--a war that we fight against ourselves here \nin Congress--calls for drastic measures, a call to arms, which the \nbudget amendment answers.\n  The amendment, House Joint Resolution 1, will set forth in the \nNation's governing document the basic principle that the Federal \nGovernment must not spend beyond its means.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \n     posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  These words ring clear today. The American taxpayer will no longer, \nnor should they, allow us in Washington to continually spend their \nmoney with little or no accountability. We in Congress must put \npolitical expediency aside--reduce the defict--remembering that we are \nto serve the American taxpayer and not vice versa.\n  Our Founding Fathers knew of the danger of leveraging current \npolitical aspiration on the backs of future generations. Congress \nremains incapable of looking toward the future--we are an entity \nembedded in the present, unable to look beyond the next election cycle.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper No 51:\n\n       Government is the greatest of all reflections on human \n     nature. If men were angels, no government would be necessary. \n     If angels were to govern man, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary.\n\n  Well Mr. President, here in Washington there are few, if any, angels \ncohabiting among us. Accordingly, we do require a control mechanism to \nreduce our current fiscal dilemma--a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. This amendment will help restore two important elements \nleft unaddressed by the Constitution: limited government and \nan accountable deliberative legislative body, both of which are vital \nto a free America. All too often this legislative body has used the \npower of the purse for political expediency rather than what is in the \nbest interest of the American people.\n  Reducing spending in order to balance the Federal budget is something \nthat will require tough decisions, the kind of decisions we in \nWashington rarely have the courage to own up to and all too often pass \non to future generations.\n  My record with regard to reducing the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment by eliminating excessive spending is clear. I have been \ncited by numerous grassroots groups like the Concord Coalition, the \nNational Taxpayer's Union, as both a taxpayers' friend and as one of \nCongress' most frugal Members. I believe the only way to eliminate our \nFederal deficit is to deal with runaway spending, much like families in \nNew Hampshire deal with life's everyday expenses. If a family is unable \nto pay for a certain expense, the prudent thing to do would be to do \nwithout; not here in Washington where no one and nothing goes without, \nwhether it is funding for Medicare, or to conduct another study to \neliminate the screw worm.\n  The American people are well versed in the way Washington operates--\nthey are not dumb. These past November elections made a strong \nstatement about change; a statement heard loud and clear throughout the \nhallowed Halls of Congress; one that demands we revert from our past, \noutdated social policies that govern the Nation and jeopardize the very \nbeing of the next generation. The people are screaming, ``we have heard \nenough from you in Washington, now it's your turn to hear from us.''\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that the Federal Trade \nCommission is considering filing a complaint challenging the PGA Tour's \nconflicting event and media rights rules as unfair competition.\n  I question whether the public interest would be served by eliminating \nthe foundation for the success of the tour, which has worked well for a \nvery long time and enjoys the support of players, fans, and sponsors. I \nunderstand that the PGA tour has generated more charitable \ncontributions from its events than all other sports combined. I am \nconcerned that forcing the tour to alter its rules may put these \ncharitable activities at risk.\n  Mr. President, I have today sent a letter to Federal Trade \nCommissioner Starek outlining my concerns. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Roscoe B. Starek, III,\n     Commissioner, Federal Trade Commission,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Starek: I understand your staff in the \n     Bureau of Competition, after a four and one-half year \n     investigation of PGA TOUR, has recently recommended to the \n     Commission that a complaint be issued challenging the PGA \n     TOUR's conflicting event and media rights rules as unfair \n     methods of competition.\n       I am familiar with the PGA TOUR's operations and its record \n     of growth, integrity and contributions to charity. PGA TOUR \n     has been able to generate more charitable contributions from \n     its events than all other professional sports combined. More \n     than $30 million in charitable donations were generated \n     through PGA TOUR events in 1994 alone. I am concerned that \n     forcing the PGA TOUR to alter its rules may put these \n     charitable activities at risk.\n       Through years of experience, the players have learned that \n     the way to accomplish their objectives was to develop rules \n     which include the players' commitment to support their own \n     events. Only through this commitment, as expressed in the \n     conflicting event and media rules, will the sponsors and \n     broadcasters who provide the financial support for PGA TOUR \n     events risk investment in PGA TOUR tournaments. It is because \n     of the sponsors' and broadcasters' financial support that the \n     players, through PGA TOUR, are able to produce a ten-month \n     season of weekly tournaments with significant prize money for \n     not only the world's top money winners, but also young \n     aspiring players and players past their prime. Thus, it \n     appears to be clear that both the purpose and effect of the \n     rules in question are to increase output and competition, not \n     to limit competition unfairly.\n       As you know, our antitrust laws do not prohibit reasonable \n     limitations among members of a league or organization of \n     competitors where the limitations are required to increase \n     output and competition.

Mr. President, one of the vital crusades in American \nhistory was the women's sufferage movement--a giant step that, in \nextending voting power to American women, vitalized our entire \ndemocracy as few changes in our political system have.\n  A complement to the extension of voting rights to women was the \nfounding, seventy-five years ago, of the League of Women Voters of the \nUnited States, a non-partisan organization of more than 1,100 chapters \nand in excess of 150,000 members and supporters nationwide. In my own \nState, West Virginians can be particularly proud that the current \nNational President of the League of Women Voters of the United States \nis Mrs. Becky Cain, St. Albans, West Virginia. She is a woman who has \nserved with great distinction during her two-year term.\n  As I suggested, today marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the \nLeague--its ``Diamond'' Anniversary, as it were. Certainly, throughout \nthose seventy-five years, the League of Women Voters has more than \nproved and reproved its value to our democratic way of life in its \nunflagging efforts to educate voters, to encourage the exercise of our \nprecious franchise, to elevate political debate, and to urge improved \nquality among the men and women who seek public office.\n  Mr. President, as we witness the birth pangs of democratic practice \naround the world--as we observe nations and groups of people within \nnations struggling to learn and to revere democratic institutions, and \nto respect honest differences of opinion within their electorates--we \ncan be thankful that America has come so far in little more than two \ncenturies in balancing and preserving those instruments of political \nand electoral life that have provided us with a long heritage of the \npeaceful transfer of political power and mutual respect among people \nwith differing political values. In no small part, we owe to the League \nof Women Voters a large measure of our gratitude for enshrining that \ntradition of civility in our national electoral life. I believe that \nfor that legacy of peaceful change and spirited debate in lieu of armed \nconflict, we stand indebted to efforts of groups such as the League of \nWomen Voters--groups devoted to the peaceful and serious practice of \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, I salute the League of Women Voters, and I know that I \nspeak for all of our colleagues on the League's anniversary in \nexpressing my appreciation to the League for its record of the \nenhancement and celebration of our Constitutional rights, privileges, \nand ordinances.\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE HON. CAL ANDERSON\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a former \ncolleague, a great legislator and a courageous and loyal friend, \nWashington State Senator Cal Anderson.\n  I worked with Cal Anderson when I served in the Washington State \nSenate. He is known throughout my home State as an outstanding \nlegislator. His reputation is one of hard work, of holding true to his \nbeliefs but compromising for the greater good, and of reaching \nconclusions that work for everyone. Cal is a true believer, as I am, in \ngood government.\n  I was honored to work with him on open record policies in my home \nState. I was astounded by his ability to be inclusive, to bring \neveryone into the debate. Cal made sure that our bill was not just \nlegislation that was good to look at but legislation that was good for \npeople.\n  Cal is a Vietnam veteran. He earned two Bronze Stars and four Army \nCommendation medals for meritorious service in that conflict. He is \ncourageous, Mr. President, and he is honest. He has touched so many \nlives across this country--his very presence in our State legislature \nshows young people that no matter who they are or where they come from, \neverybody has a great deal to offer their communities and our country. \nHis very presence tells us that America will be great when we let \neverybody participate and be an equal voice in our national dialog.\n  Cal Anderson is one of the highest ranking openly gay elected \nofficials in this country. He continues to break down stereotypes and \nignorance. And, he is a champion and a role model for all people. \nNobody in the State legislature thought of Cal as the ``gay \nlegislator''; we thought of him as an extraordinary man who just \nhappened to be gay.\n  And, this week, Mr. President, with his characteristic honesty and \nintegrity, Cal Anderson told us he has AIDS. He has been diagnosed with \nnon-Hodgkins lymphoma and is undergoing chemotherapy. I called him \ntoday, and was not surprised to find him in his senate office in \nOlympia. He has a lot of work to do, and is determined to get it done.\n  Mr. President, Cal Anderson's honestly should inspire all of us who \nshape public policy to take this epidemic seriously. In my own State, \nmore than 5,500 men, women, and children have been diagnosed with AIDS. \nMore than 1,100 cases have been reported over the previous year. Cases \nare growing in rural areas, and cases are growing among women.\n  A few weeks ago, we learned the sad news that AIDS is now the leading \ncause of death of Americans between \n[[Page S2756]] the ages of 25 and 44. I fear that everyone in America \nwill soon know someone who is infected with HIV. My friends and \nneighbors in Washington do now: his name is Senator Cal Anderson.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking Cal for everything he does \nfor my home State, and by wishing him and his partner, Eric, only the \nbest with his therapy and in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2755-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support raising the minimum wage. It \nhelps working Americans improve their standard of living. It moves in \nthe direction of self-sufficiency and away from welfare. It gives help \nto those who practice self-help.\n  First, raising the minimum wage will certainly help increase working \nAmericans' standard of living. In this country, a full-time job should \nnot mean full-time poverty. The typical American family is living on \nless than it did 15 years ago. The current minimum wage of $4.25 an \nhour for a full-time year-round worker equals only $8,500 per year. \nThis minimum wage is not a living wage.\n  Second, increasing the minimum wage helps people move toward self-\nsufficiency and away from welfare. I know that raising the minimum wage \n90 cents is not enough to lift a family above the poverty level. But, \nif a 90 cent increase to $5.15 an hour is the best we can get right \nnow, then we will take it.\n  Finally, raising the minimum wage will help those who practice self-\nhelp. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults over the age of 21. \nThey are reliable, dedicated employees who want a chance to move up in \nsociety, or just to get back on their feet.\n  They believe, as we all do, in the satisfaction that comes from hard \nwork. They do not apologize for not making a lot of money and they are \nnot looking for public hand-outs, but they certainly deserve a decent \nwage for honest work.\n  Mr. President, the minimum wage is worth less than it used to be. \nBecause of inflation, the value of the minimum wage has fallen by \nnearly 50 cents since 1991, and is now 27 percent lower than it was in \n1979.\n  I know in the coming weeks we will see many statistics, graphs, and \nfigures from supporters and opponents of raising the minimum wage. But \nin this debate, I do not want my colleagues to lose sight of the fact \nthat these statistics represent people, real people who go to work \nevery day so they can pay their bills, and have a decent place to live.\n  These are real people, who live in Baltimore, Annapolis, Hagerstown, \nand other American cities who must choose between clothing or food for \ntheir kids, between medical care or heat.\n  A low minimum wage contributes to the notion of ``working poor''. By \nraising the minimum wage, we give people a chance to help themselves, \nto do better for themselves and their families, and to achieve the \nAmerican dream.\n  That is why I support this legislation to help make work pay.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2756-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2756-S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE NATIONAL SECURITY REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every Member of the Senate is concerned \nabout the national security of our country. I know each of my \ncolleagues give serious thought and consideration to the details of how \nbest to provide for our national defense and the strength and well-\nbeing of our Armed Forces.\n  And for that reason call to the attention of my colleagues a recent \narticle by the Secretaries of State and Defense, entitled ``Foreign \nPolicy, Hamstrung,'' which appeared in the February 13 edition of the \nNew York Times. Secretary Warren Christopher and Secretary William \nPerry have joined together to present what I believe is a most cogent \nand informative analysis of the National Security Revitalization Act, \nlegislation which the other body is considering today and tomorrow.\n  Secretaries Christopher and Perry point out that this act which is \npart of the so-called Contract With America that the Republican \nleadership of the House is rushing to pass, is in its current form, a \ndeeply flawed piece of legislation. It is their considered opinion that \nthe measure would undermine any President's ability to safeguard our \nnational security and to effectively exercise his or her constitutional \nrole of commanding our Armed Forces.\n  I believe we should give serious consideration to the concerned views \nexpressed by these two able Cabinet officers, who are directly \nresponsible for overseeing the day-to-day work of guiding our Nation's \nforeign and defense policies.\n  They believe that the act's first major flaw is that it would return \nthe United States to a crash-schedule deployment of a costly national \nmissile defense system designed to protect against a nonexistent \ncredible threat to our national security. They correctly point out that \nsuch an unwarranted and expensive system would not only divert billions \nof scarce defense dollars from other more urgent defense needs, such as \nthe readiness and well-being of the men and women of our Armed Forces, \nbut that the unnecessary expenditure of funds on continental defense \nagainst a nonexistent ballistic missile threat would also be \ndetrimental to the ongoing development of an effective theater defense \nsystem.\n  It is indeed ironic that while some on the other side of the aisle, \nboth here and in the House, loudly proclaim the need for increased \nspending on a multibillion-dollar star wars program to defend against a \ntheoretical intercontinental ballistic missile attack, they are, at the \nsame time, unwilling to support the necessary funding for the Nunn-\nLugar program to reduce the threat of nuclear attack by working \ncooperatively with Russia to dismantle the missiles and nuclear \nwarheads which were once aimed at our cities.\n  Secretaries Christopher and Perry also point out that the proposed \nact unilaterally designates certain Eastern European states for NATO \nmembership without consideration of the concerns and desires of other \nNATO members, or the readiness of the designated states to assume the \nmilitary and political obligations inherent in NATO membership.\n  Furthermore, they contend that, by its restrictive language this act \nwould effectively abrogate our U.N. treaty obligations to pay our share \nof U.N. peacekeeping operations. The end result of such short-sighted \nrestrictive action would be the elimination of the availability to the \nUnited States of U.N. burden-sharing resources.\n  We in the Congress must be extraordinarily careful not to permit \noverzealous partisanship to encourage the hurried enactment of \nlegislation which restricts the ability of this, or any future \nPresident of the United States, to carry out his fundamental \nconstitutional duty to protect the national security of our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Secretary Christopher and \nSecretary Perry be printed in the Record, and I commend it to my \ncolleagues' attention.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 1995]\n\n                       Foreign Policy, Hamstrung\n\n              (By Warren Christopher and William J. Perry)\n       This week Congress is to consider legislation that would \n     undermine this and every future President's ability to \n     safeguard America's security and to command our armed forces. \n     The measure is deeply flawed. It is called the National \n     Security Revitalization Act, but if adopted it would endanger \n     national security.\n       We are committed to working with Congress in a bipartisan \n     fashion. But if this measure is passed in its current form, \n     we have told the President we will recommend that he veto it.\n       The bill's first flaw is that it would return the United \n     States to a crash-schedule deployment of a national missile \n     defense, designed to protect the U.S. from missile attacks. \n     That deployment is not justified by any existing threat to \n     our nation's security, and it would divert billions of scarce \n     defense dollars and other resources from more pressing needs, \n     particularly in the area of theater missile defenses.\n       We are building effective theater defense systems; they \n     will protect U.S. forces abroad, and the ports and airfields \n     they use, from Scud-like missiles in the hands of rogue \n     states like North Korea, Iraq and Iran. The continental U.S. \n     does not now face a ballistic missile attack from these \n     states. But we are not complacement. We are conducting a \n     broad research and development program that will, in a few \n     years, be able to deploy a national missile defense system \n     whenever a threat emerges.\n       Second, the bill unilaterally and prematurely designates \n     certain European states \n     [[Page S2757]] for NATO membership. NATO should and will \n     expand. NATO expansion will strengthen stability in Europe \n     for members and nonmembers alike. But new members must be \n     ready to undertake the obligations of membership, just as we \n     and our allies must be ready to extend our solemn commitments \n     to them. Our present steady and deliberate approach to NATO \n     expansion is intended to insure that each potential member is \n     judged individually, according to its capacity to contribute \n     to NATO's goals.\n       That approach gives every new European democracy a strong \n     incentive to consolidate reform. But if we arbitrarily lock \n     in advantages now for some countries, we risk discouraging \n     reforms in countries not named and fostering complacency to \n     countries that are. Indeed, the effect of the measure before \n     Congress could be instability in the very region whose \n     security we seek to bolster.\n       Third, the bill would effectively abrogate our treaty \n     obligation to pay our share of the cost of U.N. peacekeeping \n     operations that we have supported in the Security Council. \n     The bill would require us to reduce our peacekeeping dues \n     dollar for dollar by the cost of operations we conduct \n     voluntarily in support of U.S. interests. These operations \n     deter aggressors, isolate parish states and support \n     humanitarian relief in places like Bosnia and Iraq.\n       If we deduct the cost of our voluntary actions against our \n     U.N. dues, it would cancel our entire peacekeeping payment. \n     Other nations--Japan and our NATO allies--would surely \n     follow, and U.N. peacekeeping would end. Under current \n     circumstances, it would end U.N. peacekeeping overnight.\n       That would eliminate peacekeepers already stationed at \n     important flash points like the Golan Heights\n      on the Israel-Syria border, where U.N. forces support \n     progress in the Middle East peace process. It would pull \n     U.N. forces from the Iraq-Kuwait border, from Cyprus and \n     from the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. In short, \n     this bill would eliminate an effective tool for burden \n     sharing that every President from Harry Truman to George \n     Bush has used to advance American interests. It would \n     leave the President with an unacceptable option whenever \n     an emergency arose: act alone or do nothing.\n       The measure would also impose unnecessary, unsound and \n     unconstitutional restrictions on the President's authority to \n     place our troops under the operational control of another \n     country--even a NATO ally--for U.N. operations. Our forces \n     always remain under the command authority of the President, \n     and we already apply the most rigorous standards when we pass \n     even the most limited responsibility to a competent foreign \n     commander. But the Commander-in-Chief must retain the \n     flexibility to place troops temporarily under the operational \n     control of officers of another nation when it serves our \n     interests, as we did so effectively in Operation Desert Storm \n     and in most other conflicts since the Revolution. By \n     restricting that flexibility, the bill would undercut our \n     ability to get the international community to respond to \n     threats.\n       Effective American leadership abroad requires that we back \n     our diplomacy with the credible threat of forces. When our \n     vital interests are at stake, we must be prepared to act \n     alone. And in fact, our willingness to do so is often the key \n     to effective joint action. By mobilizing the support of other \n     nations and leveraging our resources through alliances and \n     institutions, we can achieve important objectives without \n     asking American soldiers to bear all the risks, or American \n     taxpayers to pay all the bills. That is a sensible bargain \n     the American people support.\n       This Administration has worked hard to improve our \n     consultation with the Congress on every issue raised by the \n     National Security Revitalization Act. But in each case, what \n     is at stake is fundamental: the authority of our President to \n     protect the national security and to use every effective \n     option to advance the interests of the U.S. In its present \n     form, the bill unwisely and unconstitutionally deprives the \n     President of the flexibility he needs to make the right \n     choices for our nation's security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2756-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

A bill to authorize the appropriations for international \neconomic and security assistance; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                     foreign aid reform legislation\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it seems to me there are two \ngood reasons for a complete overhaul of foreign aid the world has \nchanged and Congress has changed. The cold war is over replaced by a \nnew, ambitious Russia, a host of violent smaller regimes, ethnic \ntensions, nuclear concerns, and massive refugee movements affecting \neven our own borders.\n  On the bright side, there are former communist nations actively \nseeking U.S. support, the flourishing of free enterprise and democracy, \ngiant leaps in free trade and real prospects for peace in some of the \nmost war-torn parts of the world.\n  Since the world has changed so dramatically, our tools of foreign \npolicy must change with it--and one of the key tools is foreign aid.\n  That is the impetus for the proposal I am introducing today.\n  Our ability to effectively target foreign aid is crippled in large \npart by the outmoded and unduly complicated Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961.\n  The 300-plus pages of this document contain 33 conflicting goals, 75 \nquestionable priorities, which effectively tyrannize the 10,000 AID \nemployees who carry out 1,700 projects in 89 countries.\n  There is no real sense of coherence, strategy, or focus to the law or \nour aid program. It may seem reasonable to direct the President to \nsupport a rural development program, but should we be \n[[Page S2758]] requiring him to protect ``community woodlots''? Maybe \nthe law should define an ``increase in foreign crop productivity'' as \nan American national priority, but should we go so far as requiring the \nPresident to ``strengthen foreign systems to deliver fertilizer to \nfarmers?'' Creating national standards for nutrition is one thing, but \nshould the law direct U.S. assistance support a ``strategy for breast-\nfeeding''?\n  While many of the goals enshrined in law may be admirable, I question \nwhether they are American national priorities. My bill presents three \nclear, supportable goals: first, foreign aid must protect American \nsecurity; second, foreign aid must promote American economic interests \nand finally, foreign aid must preserve political and regional \nstability.\n  Together with these broad goals, I want to adopt specific conditions \nand performance criteria. If the conditions can't be met, the program \nshould not be funded. Throughout my tenure on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I can't think of a \nsingle country that has graduated from U.S. assistance.\n  This is partly due to the fact that we send money to countries where \ngovernment policies actually defeat the prospects for real economic \ngrowth. It's in our interests to facilitate the transition to free \nmarkets, not subsidize failures.\n  So, as a beginning point, this bill radically changes our approach to \nbilateral economic aid. In the past development assistance has focused \non relieving the symptoms of poverty and despair. No doubt there are \npeople and communities where the quality of life has improved somewhat. \nBut by any standard, the fact is most poor countries are still poor and \nthat is largely because of government practices and policies.\n  This bill starts from scratch. Development assistance, economic \nsupport funds and related programs are eliminated and instead I have \nestablished a new, smaller bilateral economic aid account. Funds can \nonly be spent in countries committed to the road to free-market reform.\n  Aid will flow if a government encourages free trade and investment, \nprotects private property, ownership and interests, limits state \ncontrol of financial institutions, production and manufacturing and \nrestricts interference in establishing wages and prices.\n  Several weeks ago at the Miami summit we heard 33 nations extol the \nmerits of trade not aid. Chile's impressive record may have had a great \ndeal to do with this hemispheric shift in emphasis.\n  In 1970, it had the twin distinction of being the world's largest \nrecipient of U.S. aid per capita and being an economic basket case. \nSetting aside wrenching internal political events, once cut loose from \naid dependency, Chile implemented a comprehensive free-market system, \nturned an economic corner and the rest, as they say, is history. The \nsuccess of these reforms is evident in the fact that Chile's economic \nstrength has opened the door to early membership in NAFTA.\n  Chile offers a good lesson in why foreign aid fails. If countries \nresist market reforms no amount of aid will improve economic or \npolitical conditions.\n  Absent meaningful reforms, foreign aid, like crack for an addict, \nonly fuels failure.\n  The only way to break the devastating cycle of dependency is to end \nforeign aid entitlement programs, to change our economic aid agenda.\n  We should be contributing to a cure, supporting and energizing \neconomic growth and opportunity, not just offering temporary relief \nfrom symptoms.\n  Why? Well setting aside altruistic motives, it is in our economic \ninterests to encourage countries to embrace free-market principles. As \nwe turn the corner on this century, it is clear our own economic health \nand progress, improving and expanding American job opportunities are \nclosely tied to export opportunities in developing countries.\n  This mutually enriching scenario depends upon changing how we \nadminister foreign aid--aid must become performance based.\n  Beyond defining broad goals and performance based economic aid \nstrategy, the bill also funds specific national priorities. As drafted, \nthe bill creates two separate titles--one for Europe and the NIS and \nthe other for the Middle East.\n  There is little question in my mind that the security interests of \nour Nation are directly affected by stability in the Middle East and \nEurope. In the former, the administration has actively pursued a \ncomprehensive peace agreement. Whether or not negotiations produce \nsound, durable agreements, the United States has ongoing interests \ndriven by a number of issues including our close alliance with Israel, \nthe important relationship with Egypt, as well as concerns about \npolitical extremism, energy security and terrorism.\n  I believe our assistance supports vital American interests in the \nregion and should be sustained.\n  Turning to the second region where I think we have vital interest, \nthe bill provides $350 million for Eastern Europe and the Baltics and \n$750 million for assistance to the New Independent States of the former \nSoviet Union. Within the NIS account, the bill earmarks funds for \nUkraine, Armenia, and Georgia.\n  I also toughen conditions on Russian aid. No funds can be provided if \nthere is any evidence the government is directing or supporting the \nviolation of another nation's territory or sovereignty.\n  Beyond the NIS, many of my colleagues share a concern about expanding \nthe sphere of NATO's stabilizing influence. This bill builds on this \ninterest and targets excess defense articles and IMET for the Baltic \nnations and the Visegrad group.\n  In addition, as an alternative to Russia's ambition to exercise a \nunilateral security role in the region, I earmark money for a training \nand support of a joint peacekeeping battalion for the Baltics. This was \na program the President announced in Riga this\n summer and then immediately told Congress, he was diverting the \nfunding to Haiti. This reversal was a serious mistake which the bill \ncorrects.\n\n  This bill not only spells out what needs to be done, but which agency \nshould do it.\n  There are two major structural changes: first, trade and export \npromotion efforts are consolidated. The Trade Development Agency and \nthe Overseas Private Investment Corporation are merged and the funding \nlevel is boosted.\n  One clear way to strengthen popular support for foreign aid is to \nmake it more effectively serve American business interests--as I \nmentioned, American jobs, exports, and income depend on it.\n  Second, the bill abolishes AID and consolidates the agency's \nfunctions under the Secretary of State. This recommendation reflects my \nview that U.S. foreign aid must better serve U.S. foreign policy \ninterests. The connection between U.S. aid and U.S. interests has been \nlost with agencies acting wholly independent of our collective \ninterests and common good.\n  And, there is no more compelling illustration of the problem than the \ndifficulties which plague the NIS program. Here you have the first \nmajor initiative since the Marshall plan. It enjoys the President's \npersonal attention and bipartisan support in Congress--if anything was \ndesigned to work it should have been our NIS effort.\n  Instead, bureaucratic redundancy has allowed AID to blame the State \nDepartment, State to blame AID--and when all else fails, both blame the \nhost government for not asking for a program in the first place.\n  But for a combination of these excuses, we could have had an \naggressive effort underway 2 years ago--helping lay a foundation for a \nlegal and commercial code protecting citizens and property throughout \nthe NIS.\n  Instead, Judge Freeh has been put in the unfortunate position of \nplaying catch-up with an international Mafia capable of undermining the \nsuccessful transition to free markets throughout the region, not to \nmention engaging in nuclear terrorism against the United States.\n  Let me add one more point on the need to reorganize the foreign \npolicy bureaucracy.\n  I have only addressed issues that fall directly within the \njurisdiction of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Given the \nopportunity, I would also recommend consolidating USIA activities under \nthe State Department and abolish ACDA altogether.\n  [[Page S2759]] It makes no sense not to have the agency responsible \nfor communicating U.S. interests separate and apart from the agency it \nserves. The State Department and USIA are integrated overseas and \nshould be here at home. As for ACDA, it is completely unclear what they \ndo that couldn't be done by the Undersecretary for International \nSecurity Affairs. Since these agencies are beyond the jurisdiction of \nmy subcommittee, I will leave their reorganization and funding to the \ngood judgment of Senator Helms and Senator Gramm.\n  This bill is a new lease on life for American assistance programs. \nAlthough drafted here in Congress, I should point out that I worked \nhard to assure that we do not micromanage the process.\n  Presidential flexibility is clearly preserved in general, by \nbroadening goals and specifically by maintaining various waiver and \ntransfer authorities, although I have restructured them somewhat to \naddress a number of problems which have developed in the past several \nyears.\n  Recently, the administration has increased its use of waivers to move \nforward with programs which I think everyone would agree are \ncontroversial. The fact that waivers have been so frequently invoked at \nthe last possible minute, suggest one of two things: either the \nadministration is incapable of even short-term planning or they are \nintentionally undermining the congressional notification and \nconsultation process.\n  I am not prepared to pass judgment at this stage, but let me point \nout that waiver authorities included in this bill in sections 208, 701, \nand 703 must now either meet a national security interests test or \nCongress must be notified in advance of the use of the waiver.\n  Let me conclude by summing up where my bill takes foreign aid: First, \nI clearly define American interests; second, I set standards for \nperformance; third, I fund American priorities in the Middle East and \nEurope and, fourth, I reorganize the bureaucracy so that foreign aid \nbetter serves our foreign interests.\n  If we don't produce real changes in how we administer foreign aid--\nsoon--we will end up with no foreign aid at all.\n  In 1961, when he transmitted the Foreign Assistance Act to the Hill, \nPresident John Kennedy said:\n\n       No objective supporter of foreign aid can be satisfied with \n     the existing program--actually a multiplicity of programs. \n     Bureaucratically fragmented, awkward and slow, its \n     administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational \n     structure covering at least four departments and several \n     agencies. The program is based on a series of legislative \n     measures and administrative procedures conceived at different \n     times for different purposes, many of them obsolete, \n     inconsistent and unduly rigid and thus unsuited for our \n     present needs and purposes. Its weaknesses have begun to \n     undermine our confidence in our effort both here and abroad.\n\n  Forty-four years later, President Kennedy's words couldn't be more \naccurate.\n  Let me conclude by expressing my appreciation to Senator Coverdell \nand Senator D'Amato who have joined in cosponsoring this measure. When \nI released this bill in December, Senator Coverdell was quick to point \nout many features which he supported and one which caused him serious \nconcern. It is in deference to his considerable expertise and strong \nviews that I revised my original draft and removed the Peace Corps from \nmy reorganization plan.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Coverdell and his colleagues \non the Foreign Relations Committee to reform the foreign aid and policy \nprocess. Let me pay special recognition to the committee chairman, \nSenator Helms, whose leadership is crucial to changing the way this \ncountry carries out both its foreign policy and foreign aid agenda. It \nis my hope that working together in the authorization and \nappropriations process we can take advantage of a unique moment in \nhistory and complete a comprehensive reorganization of the foreign \npolicy bureaucracy.\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell, in introducing legislation to \noverhaul our current foreign aid program. I commend him on his efforts \nand his leadership in this matter, and look forward to working with him \nand others to forge a new foreign assistance framework for the 21st \ncentury.\n  That foreign aid reform is needed is clear. Amazingly, after 32 \nyears, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 remains the basic statute for \nour foreign aid program. Since then, the world has changed in ways few \ncould have imagined. The collapse of Soviet influence, the growing \ninterdependence of markets and the regionalization of conflict are \nrealities that face this Congress and the American people. Reform \nefforts must be as sweeping as the changes that have made them \nnecessary.\n  By almost any standard by which Congress evaluates programs, foreign \naid has fallen short. Despite years of U.S. assistance, few countries \nhave been able to make the transition from poor to developed. Examples \nof countries graduating from U.S. assistance to self-sufficiency are \nfew and far between. While many nations have made serious efforts to \nhelp themselves, U.S. assistance is all too often a disincentive to \neconomic reform and real growth. As a result, most Americans hold \nforeign aid in contempt. Their frustration is understandable, but it \nmust be changed if we are to remain world leaders.\n  The world has changed dramatically, demanding a new foreign aid \napparatus to address the new international environment. In this current \nclimate of global unpredictability an shrinking budget resources, a new \napproach is needed. The bill we are introducing today meets that \nchallenge. It states very simply that foreign assistance should meet \nthree goals: It must protect American security, promote American \neconomic interests, and preserve political and regional stability.\n  To meet these goals, our bill consolidates bureaucracies originally \ndesigned to meet the cold-war reality, and streamlines them in order to \nmeet the new security environment. It provides additional resources to \nassist and promote U.S. economic interests oversees, creating more jobs \nand opportunities here at home. Our bill addresses what I believe has \nbeen a dangerous trend toward subcontracting our unique military \ncapability to international institutions by prohibiting voluntary \npeacekeeping funds from being used to support U.S. personnel under U.N. \ncommand. Finally, the legislation anchors United States strategic \ninterested throughout the globe by maintaining our commitment to the \nMiddle East and Europe.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank Senator McConnell for his \ncooperation in another matter regrading this legislation. As originally \nwritten, this bill would have folded the U.S. Peace Corps into the \nState Department. As former Director of the Peace Corps, I believe such \na move would ultimately have detracted from the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the organization. The safety of Peace Corps volunteers, \nin my judgment, depends on its independent status. I raised these \nconcerns with Senator McConnell, and I appreciate his willingness to \nremove this provision.\n  To close, I want to commend the Senator from Kentucky for his hard \nwork in this matter. Prudently managed, properly targeted foreign aid \nserves the national interests of the Untied States. Our challenge is to \nbuild a system that does both. I am proud to be included in this \neffort, and will continue to work toward the principles and objectives \noutlined in this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN:\n  S. 423. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nimproved access to quality long-term care services, to create \nincentives for greater private sector participation and personal \nresponsibility in financing such services, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the private long-term care protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n\nSection-by-Section Summary of the Private Long-Term Care Protection Act \n                                of 1995\n\n       Purpose: The Cohen legislation is designed to provide \n     improved access to long term care services. An emphasis is \n     placed on removing tax barriers and creating incentives which \n     encourage individuals and their families to finance their \n     future long term care needs. \n     [[Page S2760]] The bill creates consumer protection standards \n     for long term care insurance, and provides incentives and \n     public education to encourage the purchase of private long \n     term care insurance.\n\n\n           title i--tax treatment of long term care insurance\n\nSec. 101. Qualified long term care services treated as medical expenses\n\n       Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code is clarified to \n     allow qualified individuals to deduct out-of-pocket long term \n     care services as medical expenses subject to a floor of 7.5 \n     percent of adjusted gross income. Qualified long term care \n     services include necessary diagnostic, preventive, \n     therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance and personal care \n     performed in either a residential or nonresidential setting. \n     Qualified individuals must be determined by a licensed \n     professional or qualified community case manager to be unable \n     to perform without substantial assistance at least two \n     activities of daily living (ADLs) or suffer from a moderate \n     cognitive impairment.\n\n            Sec. 102. Treatment of long term care insurance\n\n       Section 213 is also amended to allow qualified long term \n     care insurance premiums to be deducted as medical insurance \n     subject to the 7.5 percent-of-adjusted-gross-income-floor. \n     Qualified long term care insurance premiums are also \n     deductible as a business expense and employer-provided long \n     term care insurance is excluded from an employee's taxable \n     income. A qualified long term care insurance policy must meet \n     the regulatory standards as established in Title II.\n\n        Sec. 103. Treatment of qualified long term care policies\n\n       Benefits paid under qualified long term care insurance \n     policies would be excluded from income under section 105(c) \n     ``Payments Unrelated to Absence from Work'', and employer-\n     paid long term care insurance would be a tax free employee \n     fringe benefit.\n       The daily benefit cap for all long term care policies would \n     be established at $200 per day and indexed for inflation.\n      There is no ``cliff'' on per diem distributions, meaning \n     that only payments above the established cap are treated \n     as income.\n        Private long-term care insurance is exempt from \n     the continuation of coverage requirements created by COBRA. \n     In addition, long-term care will be considered a ``qualified \n     benefit'' that may be included in a cafeteria plan.\n\n   Sec. 105. Tax treatment of accelerated death benefits under life \n                          insurance contracts\n\n       Clarifies that an accelerated death benefit received by an \n     individual on the life of an insured who is terminally ill \n     individual (expected to die within 12 months) is excluded \n     from taxable income as payment by reason of death.\n\n\n            title ii. standards for long-term care insurance\n\n       Sec. 201. National Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Panel\n\n       Establishes a national advisory board to help implement the \n     long-term care consumer protection standards, and educate the \n     public, insurers, providers and other regulatory bodies of \n     issues related to long-term care insurance.\n\n                     Sec. 202. Policy requirements\n\n       Insurers are required to meet the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) January 1, 1993 standards for \n     long-term insurance. Additional federal requirements include: \n     a mandatory offer of nonforfeiture benefits, rate \n     stabilization, minimum rate guarantees, limits and \n     notification of increases on premiums and reimbursement \n     mechanisms for long-term care policies. Policies that do not \n     meet these consumer protection standards would be denied the \n     favorable tax treatment described in Section I.\n\n    Sec. 203. Additional requirements for issuers of long-term care \n                           insurance policies\n\n       A penalty of $100 per day per policy shall be imposed on \n     long-term care issuers failing to meet the minimum federal \n     standards as outlined in this section. The civil monetary \n     penalty per policy may not exceed $25,000 against carriers, \n     and may not exceed $15,000 per policy against insurance \n     agents.\n\n             Sec. 204. Coordination with State requirements\n\n       A State retains the authority to apply additional standards \n     or regulations that provide greater protection of \n     policyholders of long-term care insurance.\n\n               Sec. 205. Uniform language and definitions\n\n       The National Advisory Council shall issue standards for the \n     use of uniform language and definitions in long-term care \n     insurance policies, with permissible variations to take into \n     account differences in State licensing requirements for long-\n     term care providers.\n\n\n  title iii--incentives to encourage the purchase of private insurance\n\n          Sec. 301. Public information and education programs\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to \n     establish a program designed to educate individuals on the \n     risks of incurring catastrophic long-term care costs and the \n     coverage options available to insure against this risk. \n     Education should increase consumers knowledge of the lack of \n     coverage for long-term care in Medicare, Medigap and most \n     private health insurance policies and explain the various \n     benefits and features of private long-term care insurance.\n\n  Sec. 302. Assets or resources disregarded under the Medicaid program\n\n       Amends Section 1917(b) of the Social Security Act, related \n     to Medicaid Estate Recoveries, to allow for States to \n     establish asset protection programs for individuals who \n     purchase qualified long-term care insurance policies, without \n     requiring States to recover such assets upon a beneficiaries \n     death. This provision is aimed at encouraging more middle-\n     income persons to purchase long-term care insurance by \n     allowing individuals to keep a limited amount of assets and \n     still qualify for Medicaid, if they have purchased long-term \n     care insurance.\n       States that develop asset protection programs to encourage \n     private insurance purchase are required to conform with \n     uniform reporting and documentation requirements established \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n  Sec. 303. Distributions from individual retirement accounts for the \n             purchase of long-term care insurance coverage\n\n       Individuals above 59\\1/2\\ are allowed tax-free \n     distributions from an IRA or an individual retirement annuity \n     for the purchase of a long-term policy. This provision also \n     allows individuals below the age of 59\\1/2\\ to withdraw from \n     their individual retirement account without penalty in order \n     to purchase a qualified long-term care plan. Individuals who \n     obtain tax-free distributions from their IRA or individual \n     retirement annuity would be restricted from deducting their \n     long-term care insurance premium as a medical expense under \n     Title I of this act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 424. A bill to provide for adherence with MacBride Principles by \nUnited States persons doing business in Northern Ireland; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           the northern ireland fair employment practices act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Northern \nIreland Fair Employment Practices Act. This legislation seeks to deter \nefforts to use the work place as an arena of discrimination in Northern \nIreland. I am pleased that my colleague from New York, Representative \nBen Gilman, chairman of the House International Affairs Committee has \nintroduced this bill, H.R. 470, in the House.\n  The Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices Act incorporates the \nMacBride Principles, which are modeled after the famous Sullivan \nPrinciples, one of the initial efforts to apply United States pressure \nto change the system of apartheid in South Africa. The MacBride \nPrinciples are named in honor of the late Sean MacBride, winner of the \nNobel Peace Prize and cofounder of Amnesty International.\n  This amendment will enlist the cooperation of United States companies \nactive in Northern Ireland in the campaign to force the end of \ndiscrimination in the workplace by:\n  First, eliminating religious discrimination in managerial, \nsupervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs and \nsignificantly increasing the representation in such jobs of individuals \nfrom underrepresented religious groups;\n  Second, providing adequate security for the protection of minority \nemployees at the workplace;\n  Third, banning provocative sectarian and political emblems from the \nworkplace;\n  Fourth, publicly advertising all job openings and undertaking special \nrecruitment efforts to attract applicants from underrepresented \nreligious groups, and establishing procedures to identify and recruit \nminority individuals with potential for further advancement, including \nmanagerial programs;\n  Fifth, establishing layoff, recall, and termination procedures which \ndo not favor particular religious groupings;\n  Sixth, abolishing job reservations, apprenticeship restrictions, and \ndifferential employment criteria which discriminate on the basis of \nreligious or ethnic origin;\n  Seventh, developing and expanding upon existing training and \neducational programs that will prepare substantial numbers of minority \nemployees for managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and \ntechnical jobs; and\n  Eighth, appointing a senior management staff member to oversee the \nU.S. company's compliance with the principles described above.\n  It is at the workplace in Northern Ireland, which can be used to \neither foster or eliminate discrimination, where improving the \nemployment opportunities for the underprivileged will help factor out \nthe economic causes of the current strife in Northern Ireland \n[[Page S2761]] and, hopefully, begin the process toward a peaceful \nresolution of the so-called troubles.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Ireland Fair \n     Employment Practices Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Overall unemployment in Northern Ireland exceeds 14 \n     percent.\n       (2) Unemployment in some neighborhoods of Northern Ireland \n     comprised of religious minorities has exceeded 70 percent.\n       (3) The British Government Fair Employment Commission \n     (F.E.C.), formerly the Fair Employment Agency (F.E.A.), has \n     consistently reported that a member of the minority community \n     is two and one-half times more likely to be unemployed than a \n     member of the majority community.\n       (4) The Industrial Development Organization for Northern \n     Ireland lists twenty-five firms in Northern Ireland which are \n     controlled by United States persons.\n       (5) The Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), \n     Washington, District of Columbia, lists forty-nine publicly \n     held and nine privately held United States companies doing \n     business in Northern Ireland.\n       (6) The religious minority population of Northern Ireland \n     is frequently subject to discriminatory hiring practices by \n     United States businesses which have resulted in a \n     disproportionate number of minority individuals holding \n     menial and low-paying jobs.\n       (7) The MacBride Principles are a nine point set of \n     guidelines for fair employment in Northern Ireland which \n     establishes a corporate code of conduct to promote equal \n     access to regional employment but does not require \n     disinvestment, quotas, or reverse discrimination.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON IMPORTS.\n\n       An article from Northern Ireland may not be entered, or \n     withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, in the customs \n     territory of the United States unless there is presented at \n     the time of entry to the customs officer concerned \n     documentation indicating that the enterprise which \n     manufactured or assembled such article was in compliance at \n     the time of manufacture with the principles described in \n     section 5.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nestablishment in the Department of Veterans Affairs of mental illness \nresearch, education, and clinical centers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n           the va mental health care improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce \nlegislation that would establish up to five centers of excellence in \nthe area of mental illness at existing VA health care facilities. These \ncenters, to be known as mental illness research, education, and \nclinical centers [MIRECC's] would be a vitally important and integral \nlink in VA's efforts in the areas of research, education, and \nfurnishing of clinical care \n[[Page S2762]] to veterans suffering from mental illness. I am \ndelighted to be joined in introducing this bill by Senators Akaka, \nCampbell, Dorgan, and Wellstone.\n  Mr. President, the need to improve services to mentally ill veterans \nhas been recognized for a number of years. For example, the October 20, \n1985, report of the Special Purposes Committee to Evaluate the Mental \nHealth and Behavioral Sciences Research Program of the VA, chaired by \nDr. Seymour Kety--generally referred to as the Kety Committee--\nconcluded that research on mental illness and training for \npsychiatrists and other mental health specialists at VA facilities were \ntotally inadequate. The Kety report noted that about 40 percent of VA \nbeds are occupied by veterans who suffer from mental disorders, yet \nless than 10 percent of VA's research resources are directed toward \nmental illness.\n  Little has changed since that report. Information provided to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs at our August 3, 1993, hearing showed \nthat the percentage of VA patients suffering with mental illness \ncontinues to hover over the same 40 percent rate found by the Kety \nCommittee. Likewise, VA's research on mental illness has not increased \nto any appreciable extend and was estimated to be approximately 12 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, VA provides mental health services to more than one \nhalf to three quarters of a million veterans each year, yet in the \ndecade between the time the Kety Committee began its work and now, \nthere has not been a significant effort to focus VA's resources on the \nneeds of mentally ill veterans. Among the recommendations of the Kety \nCommittee was one that VA centers of excellence be established to \ndevelop first-rate psychiatric research programs within VA. Such \ncenters, in the view of the Kety Committee, would provide state-of-the-\nart treatment, increase innovative basic and clinical research \nopportunities, and enhance and encourage training and treatment of \nmental illness.\n  Based on the recommendations of the Kety Committee, the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs began efforts more than 6 years ago to encourage \nresearch into mental illnesses and to establish centers of excellence. \nFor example, on May 20, 1988, Public Law 100-322 was enacted which \nincluded a provision to add an express\n reference to mental illness research in the statutory description of \nVA's medical research mission which is set forth in section 7303(a)(2) \nof title 38.\n\n  At that time, the committee--see S. Rept. 100-215, page 138--urged VA \nto establish three center of excellence, or MIRECC's, as proposed by \nthe Kety Committee. In March 1992, Senator Cranston, then chairman of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, noted that the VA had not taken any \naction to implement those recommendations. I unfortunately must tell \nyou today that the VA still has done little to implement the \nrecommendations of the Kety committee and has made no progress on the \nestablishment of centers of excellence.\n  Mr. President, I also note that the January 1991 final report of the \nblue ribbon VA Advisory Committee for Health Research Policy \nrecommended the establishment of MIRECC's as a means of increasing \nopportunities in psychiatric research and encouraging the formulation \nof new research initiatives in mental health care, as well as \nmaintaining the intellectual environment so important to quality health \ncare. The report stated that these ``centers could provide a way to \ndeal with the emerging priorities in the VA and the Nation at large.''\n  In light of VA's failure to act administratively to establish these \ncenters of excellence, our committee has developed legislation to \naccomplish this objective. The proposed MIRECC's legislation is \npatterned after the legislation which created the very successful \ngeriatric research, education, and clinical centers [GRECC's], section \n302 of Public Law 96-330, enacted in 1980. The MIRECC's would be \ndesigned first, to congregate at one facility clinicians and research \ninvestigators with a clear and precise clinical research mission, such \nas PTSD, schizophrenia, or drug abuse and alcohol abuse; second, to \nprovide training and educational opportunities for students and \nresidents in psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, and other \nprofessions which treat individuals with mental illness; and third, to \ndevelop new models of effective care and treatment for veterans with \nmental illnesses, especially those with service-connected conditions.\n  The establishment of MIRECC's should encourage research into outcomes \nof various types of treatment for mental illnesses, an aspect of mental \nillness research which, to date, has not been fully pursued, either by \nVA or other researchers. The bill would promote the sharing of \ninformation regarding all aspects of MIRECC's activities throughout VHA \nby requiring the Chief Medical Director to develop continuing education \nprograms at regional medical education centers.\n  Finally, beginning February 1, 1997, the Secretary would be required \nto submit to the two Veterans' Affairs Committees annual reports on the \nresearch, education, and clinical care activities at each MIRECC and on \nthe efforts to disseminate the information throughout the VA health \ncare system.\n  At our committee hearing on August 3, 1993, numerous witnesses, \nincluding Dr. John Lipkin, representing the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, and Mr. Richard Greer, representing the National Alliance \nfor the Mentally Ill, testified in favor of the MIRECC legislation. All \nof the veterans service organizations testifying at the hearing--the \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, \nand Paralyzed Veterans--supported the enactment of MIRECC legislation.\n  Mr. President, the VA for too long has made inadequate efforts to \nimprove research and treatment of mentally ill veterans and to foster \neducational activities designed to improve the capabilities of VA \nmental health professionals. The establishment of MIRECC's will be a \nsignificant step forward in improving care for some of our neediest \nveterans. I am hopeful that this long recognized need will become more \nthan a forgotten want item for veterans who suffer, in many cases, in \nsilence.\n  The Committee on Veterans' Affairs has reported, and the Senate has \npassed, comparable legislation in each of the last three Congresses. I \nhope to bring this legislation before the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs soon and remain optimistic that we can move forward with this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity to \nestablish a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the District of \nColumbia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n       reverend dr. martin luther king, jr, memorial legislation\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, since 1926 this Nation has \ndesignated February as the month to honor the contributions of African-\nAmericans and their proud heritage, which has so powerfully enriched \nour land. As we honor the accomplishments of African-American citizens \nthroughout the country, I wanted to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues legislation introduced today by myself and the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, Senator Warner, to recognize and honor Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  As you know, Dr. King's life was one of extraordinary accomplishments \nand has had a significant and lasting impact on our Nation's history. \nThe legislation Senator Warner and I have introduced today would \nrecognize these accomplishments by authorizing the Alpha Phi Alpha \nFraternity, the oldest African-American fraternity in the United \nStates, to establish a monument to Dr. King on Federal land in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Identical legislation passed the Senate in the \n102d Congress with 60 cosponsors, but was unfortunately not passed by \nthe House of Representatives before adjournment sine die.\n  Pursuant to this proposal, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity of which \nDr. King was a member, will coordinate the design and funding of the \nmonument. The bill provides that the monument be established entirely \nwith private contributions at no cost to the Federal Government. The \nDepartment of the Interior, in consultation with the National Capital \nPark and Planning Commission and the Commission on Fine Arts, will \nselect the site and approve the design.\n  Alpha Phi Alpha was founded in 1906 at Cornell University and has \nhundreds of chapters across the country and many prominent citizens as \nmembers, including the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. \nAlpha Phi Alpha has strongly endorsed the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nMemorial project and is committing its considerable human resources to \nthe project's development.\n  Since 1955, when in Montgomery, AL, Dr. King became a national hero \nand an acknowledged leader in the civil rights struggle, until his \ntragic death in Memphis, TN in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. made an \nextraordinary contribution to the evolving history of our Nation. His \ncourageous stands and unyielding belief in the tenent of nonviolence \nreawakened our Nation to the injustice and discrimination which \ncontinued to exist 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation and \nthe \n[[Page S2764]] enactment of the guarantees of the 14th and 15th \namendments to the Constitution.\n  A memorial to Dr. King erected in the nation's Capital will provide \ncontinuing inspiration to all who visit it, and particularly to the \nthousands of students and young people who visit Washington, DC every \nyear. While these young people may have no personal memory of the \ncondition of civil rights in America before Dr. King, nor of the \nstruggle in which he was the major figure, they do understand that \nthere is much more that still needs to be done. As Coretta King said so \narticulately:\n\n       Young people in particular need nonviolent role models like \n     him. In many ways, the Civil Rights movement was a youth \n     movement. Young people of all races, many of whom were \n     jailed, were involved in the struggle, and some gave their \n     lives for the cause. Yet none of the youth trained by Martin \n     and his associates retaliated in violence, including members \n     of some of the toughest gangs of urban ghettos in cities like \n     Chicago and Birmingham. This was a remarkable achievement. It \n     has never been done before; it has not been duplicated since.\n\n  It is our hope that the young people who visit this monument will \ncome to understand that it represents not only the enormous \ncontribution of this great leader, but also two very basic principles \nnecessary for the effective functioning of our society. The first is \nthat change, even every fundamental change, is to be achieved through \nnonviolent means; that this is the path down which we should go as a \nnation in resolving some of our most difficult problems. The other \nbasic principle is that the reconciliation of the races, the inclusion \ninto the mainstream of American life of all its people, is essential to \nthe fundamental health of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, Martin Luther King, Jr., dedicated his life to \nachieving equal treatment and enfranchisement for all Americans through \nnonviolent means. As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, I \nurge all of my colleagues to join Senator Warner and me in this effort \nto ensure that the essential principles taught and practiced by Dr. \nKing are never forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2757-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 198\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] was added as a cosponsor of S. 198, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to permit medicare select policies to \nbe offered in all States, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 218\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Mr. Cohen] was added as a cosponsor of S. 218, a bill to repeal the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 233\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Thompson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 233, a bill to provide \nfor the termination of reporting requirements of certain executive \nreports submitted to the Congress, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 277\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole], the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], the Senator \nfrom North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], \nthe Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth], the Senator from \nOklahoma [Mr. Nickles], the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], \nthe Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nThurmond], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Thompson], the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], the \nSenator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], \nand the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] were added as cosponsors of S. \n277, a bill to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n                                 S. 356\n\n  At the request of Mr. Shelby, the names of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 356, a bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to \ndeclare English as the official language of the Government of the \nUnited States.\n\n\n                                 S. 415\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 415, a bill to apply the \nantitrust laws to major league baseball in certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 248\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dorgan his name was added as a cosponsor of \nAmendment No. 248 proposed to H.J.

GRANT\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of \nthe recent death of a tireless champion of the world's children, James \nP. Grant. Most of us knew Jim as the deeply committed and energetic \nExecutive Director of UNICEF, where his enthusiasm, his compassion, and \nhis media savvy were legion. For 15 years he refused to take ``no'' for \nan answer, forcing those more accustomed to the high politics of \ndiplomacy to consider the everyday realities for the youngest and most \nvulnerable members of the world's population. His child survival \nrevolution can be credited with saving and improving the lives of \nmillions of children who otherwise would have fallen victim to \nmalnutrition, dehydration and easily preventable diseases.\n  While Jim Grant's contributions as UNICEF's Director are \nunparalleled, it was not only there that he made his mark. In fact he \nspent his entire lifetime in public service: First with the U.N. Relief \nand Rehabilitation Administration in China, where he was born, and \nlater at the United States Department of State, the United States \nAgency for International Development, and the Overseas Development \nCouncil. In each of those capacities his concern for those living in \npoverty and despair lent special significance to his work and \ndistinguished him as an individual.\n  Even as his own health began to fail him, Jim continued his important \nwork at UNICEF. He enlisted the support of everyone from Hollywood \nsuperstars to Members of Congress in helping to realize the ambitious \ngoals of the World Summit for Children--cutting child mortality by one-\nthird, halving malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, providing \nbasic education for all children, and reducing or eradicating childhood \ndiseases by the end of this century. In recognition of Jim Grant's \noutstanding contributions, President Clinton awarded him the Nation's \nhighest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, just last summer.\n  Mr. President, I am certain that my colleagues join me in extending \nmy deepest sympathies to Jim's family.

Mr. President, as a life member of Hadassah, the \nWomen's Zionist Organization of America, I am proud of their \nhumanitarian work around the world. I am also proud that Hadassah's \nfounder, Henrietta Szold, was born in my hometown of Baltimore.\n  Private philanthropy cannot take the place of public policy. But it \ncan play a vital role in providing aid and comfort in places like \nBosnia--where medical facilities have been decimated by war.\n  I am pleased to share information with my colleagues on Hadassah's \ninternational relief work. I ask that Hadassah's report on their work \nin Sarajevo be printed in the Record.\n  The report follows:\n\n  Hadassah Nurses Councils Organize Massive Relief Effort for Sarajevo\n\n       Just a year after its founding in 1912, Hadassah, the \n     Women's Zionist Organization of America, sent two intrepid \n     nurses, Rose Kaplan and Rachel Landy, to Palestine to treat \n     the malnourished and diseased mothers and children of \n     Jerusalem, thereby laying the foundation for its ongoing \n     medical work in Israel. More than 82 years later, in August, \n     1994, Hadassah again sent its nurses on an arduous journey, \n     this time to the besieged city of Sarajevo. Elsie Roth and \n     Kathryn Bauschard of St. Louis, Dianna Pearlmutter of Boston, \n     and Charlotte Franklin of Santa Barbara, all members of \n     Hadassah's nurses councils, went to assess the medical needs \n     of the war-torn city and plan and coordinate the delivery of \n     much needed medical supplies and clothing.\n       Traveling under the banner of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, the nurses visited Kosevo Hospital \n     and the State Hospital of Sarajevo during their 7-day trip. \n     The nurses met with hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, \n     and other personnel and inspected operating rooms, pediatric \n     wards and pharmacy supply centers. They found deplorable \n     conditions in the hospitals, which lacked even the most basic \n     medical supplies.\n       At the time of their visit, Deborah Kaplan, Hadassah \n     National President, stated, ``Hadassah has a long-standing \n     commitment to providing humanitarian aid throughout the \n     world. We are proud to sponsor these four courageous women \n     and, through the Hadassah Nurses Councils, will work to \n     facilitate aid to Bosnia as identified through this \n     mission.''\n       Within five months of their return, the nurses, with the \n     help of Hadassah Nurses Councils throughout the United States \n     and in coalition with other organizations, churches and \n     synagogues, amassed 30 tons of medical supplies and clothing \n     valued at $3.5 million for transport to Sarajevo.\n       Since the nurses' trip, close connections have been forged \n     between the coalition and the Jewish community of Sarajevo. \n     About 300 Jews, a remnant of the 2,500 Jews from Sarajevo who \n     survived World War II, remain in the city. Under the auspices \n     of La Benevolencija, the Jewish humanitarian society formed \n     in 1892, the Jewish community in Sarajevo has assumed \n     responsibility for caring for the entire community. They \n     operate the pharmacies and other health facilities, \n     distribute foods, operate a daily soup kitchen, and \n     facilitate the evacuation of the elderly and children.\n       In this way, the tiny Jewish community, which has existed \n     in Sarajevo for more than 500 years, has been working to save \n     its Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox Christian neighbors. All \n     have been living under increasingly desperate conditions \n     since the Bosnian conflict began nearly three years ago. More \n     than 12,000 residents, including 1,625 children, have been \n     killed and some 60,000 wounded. Medical supplies are not \n     available to treat the sick and injured and restore them to \n     health. Moreover, water, food, gas and electricity are in \n     very short supply. Residents are now resorting to burning \n     what possessions they have left, including old books and \n     family heirlooms, in an effort to survive the winter cold.\n       The supplies collected by Hadassah and the other coalition \n     members were shipped to New York for storage in a central \n     warehouse provided by Queens, NY Hadassah. Eight tons of \n     clothing are now on their way to Bosnia by cargo ship. The \n     remaining 22-ton shipment, including pharmaceuticals, medical \n     supplies and uniforms, has already been sent from Dover Air \n     Force Base on air force planes to Croatia where it will now \n     be airlifted by the United Nations directly to Sarajevo.\n       Hadassah members Sherry Hahn of Arlington and Elsie Roth, \n     taking advantage of the cease-fire negotiated by former \n     United States President Jimmy Carter in December, will return \n     to Sarajevo to meet the shipment and help La Benevolencija \n     distribute the supplies. Hearts will beat again when \n     restarted by a perfectly reconditioned defibrillator included \n     in the shipment. Bodies will heal when external fixators will \n     hold them together without invasive surgery. Limbless people, \n     wounded by shell fire, will walk again when more than 100 \n     pieces of prosthetics replace their feet, legs and knees.\n       In a letter to Hadassah, Sven Alkalaj, the Bosnian \n     Ambassador to the United States, wrote, ``The Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people sincerely offer the \n     American organization Hadassah their thanks for the fine \n     activities of four nurses who, despite the dangerous \n     situation in Sarajevo, had the courage to visit our nation's \n     capital. Their mission was one of humanitarian concern and \n     genuine compassion for our citizens who are in need of \n     desperate medical attention.\n       ``All of these registered nurses displayed an overwhelming \n     desire to help those in need. Their compassion will long be \n     remembered by those of us who had an opportunity to \n     experience their love of humanity and their zeal for the \n     advancement of the human spirit.''\n       Ambassador Stuart E. Eizenstat, representing the European \n     Community, praised Hadassah, saying that this organization \n     [[Page S2769]] should be proud of the relief they are \n     providing in this tragic situation.\n       Hadassah, the WZOA, sincerely thanks the government of the \n     United States, particularly the Department of Defense, for \n     its cooperation in airlifting the relief goods we were able \n     to gather together into this ravaged land.\n       For more than 82 years, Hadassah has been recognized for \n     its pacesetting medical care and for the use of its resources \n     and knowledge to benefit all humankind. This is but another \n     example of Hadassah's affirmation of the Mishna's teaching \n     ``Whoever saves one life, it is as if he saved the entire \n     world.'' The women of Hadassah have learned this lesson well. \n     \n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/15/senate-section/article/S2768-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
