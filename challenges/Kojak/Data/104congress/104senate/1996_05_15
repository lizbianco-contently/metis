Some of them are profoundly personal. We carry \nthe burden of our failures. In the quiet we hear You say, ``You are \nforgiven; peace be with you.'' We also carry the burden of worry over \nour families and friends. You remind us that You love the people about \nwhom we are concerned and so we turn our anxiety about the needs of \npeople over to You. In our work we are burdened by the unfinished and \nthe unresolved. Help us to do the very best we can each day and leave \nthe results to You. As leaders of our Nation, we are troubled by the \ndrift of our society from Your righteousness and truth. The burden of \nleadership rests heavily on our shoulders. We hear Your whisper in our \nsouls, ``I will never leave you or forsake you.''\n  Dear God, bless the Senators, their families, staffs, and all who are \npart of the extended Senate family here in the Capitol. Whatever \nburdens each carries today, we ask You to lift them by Your grace and \nprovide for them out of Your boundless resources. Then help us to lift \neach other's burdens by being as encouraging as You have been to us.\n  Today we join with the Nation in honoring and expressing our \ngratitude for peace officers. Thank You for those gallant officers who \nhave given their lives in the line of duty.\n  In the name of our Lord.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to consideration of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 57) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send to the desk a list of majority \nand minority staff members and ask unanimous consent they be granted \nthe privilege of the floor at various times at the option of the \nmanager and the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                             Majority Staff\n\n       Brian Benczkowski, Jim Capretta, Amy Call, Lisa Cieplak, \n     Christy Dunn, Beth Felder, Alice Grant, Jim Hearn, Keith \n     Hennessey, William Hoagland.\n       Carol McGuire, Anne Miller, Mieko Nakabayashi, Denise G. \n     Ramonas, Cheri Reidy, Ricardo Rel, Karen Ricoy, J. Brian \n     Riley, Mike Ruffner.\n       Melissa Sampson, Andrea Shank, Amy Smith, Austin Smythe, \n     Bob Stevenson, Beth Wallis, Winslow Wheeler (detailee).\n\n                             Minority Staff\n\n       Amy Abraham, Kenneth Colling (fellow), Bill Dauster, Tony \n     Dresden, Jodi Grant, Matt Greenwald, Joan Huffer, Phil \n     Karsting, Jim Klumpner, Soo Jin Kwon.\n       Daniela Mays, Sue Nelson, Jon Rosenwasser (fellow), Jerry \n     Slominski, Barry Strumpf.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, again in behalf of the majority leader, \nI ask unanimous consent that the presence of small electronic \ncalculators be permitted on the floor of the Senate during \nconsideration of the 1997 concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, as I understand it, there are 50 \nhours of debate on this resolution. Unless it is agreed to add \nadditional time, each amendment is given 1 hour for the amendment, 1 \nhour in opposition to the amendment. Amendments to the amendments have \none-half hour, and one-half hour in opposition.\n  The Budget Act prescribes that opening statements will utilize 4 \nhours on economics, and that will be the opening of the budget debate. \nI am not so sure we are going to use all that time, but I would like to \nengage in a dialog with the ranking member, if he would, at this point.\n  Senator Exon, I note, and I think you would concur, this is a rather \nexceptional year in that there are three full budgets that will be \noffered to the Senate: There is the Republican budget that is pending, \nencapsulated in the\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nresolution; there is a bipartisan proposal, led by Senators Chafee and \nBreaux, which is a full substitute for the Republican proposal; and \nthen there is a third proposal, which I assume you or someone on your \nside will offer, which is the President's budget, which, again, is a \nfull substitute for the Republican plan. Also, obviously, there are \nmany amendments that Members on your side and our side would like to \noffer, either to the Republican budget resolution or to one or the \nother of the other full budgets that I have just briefly described.\n  It had been my hope, and I share this with you to see what your \nthoughts are, that we could use the 4 hours allowed for economic \ndiscussion, 2 on each side, and then proceed with amendments to the \nRepublican budget for the remainder of the day--we ought to get a lot \nof them in if we can do that--and that we then, late this evening, take \nan accounting for ourselves and see where we are, and that at a later \ntime in this debate we take the full budgets that are offered as full \nsubstitutes to the Domenici mark. So at some point you would offer the \nPresident's and, some time thereafter, Senators Chafee and Breaux, or \nBreaux and Chafee, would offer theirs.\n  I think we had a very good spirit of cooperation in the committee. I \nam just hoping that between us we can get our Members to start sending \ntheir amendments to us so we will know where we are going. I can say \nunequivocally--I heard from the leader yesterday and I read a statement \nthis morning--we are going to finish this this week. I see no reason to \ngo into Friday night and Saturday if we can work together to kind of \norganize, as best we can, our colleagues in their presentations.\n  I yield at this point for your thoughts or observations, if you would \nshare them with me.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend, the chairman of the committee, for his \nremarks and outline. Generally speaking, I do not know that I have any \nserious reservations. I think the chairman of the committee has \nbasically stated what should be the procedure. I have a caveat to that \nthat I will mention in just a moment. I simply say that I agree that \neven though we have 25 hours on each side--and while you have not said \nthat, I understand the intent is the 25 hours on your side would be \ncontrolled by the majority leader or his designee, which would normally \nbe you, and the same thing would be true on our side with the minority \nleader and myself as the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. Is \nthat the way? Would we follow usual procedures in that regard?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. I see no reason why we should not head for, and very likely \ncan, finish this by Friday late, if not sooner. I say to my friend, in \nthe 4 hours set aside for economic discussions, I do not anticipate we \nwould use all of our 2 hours on this side, although no one ever knows \nwhat happens for sure in the U.S. Senate.\n  I simply say, as I listened to the opening remarks from the chairman \nof the committee, if he felt we would likely only have amendments to \nthe Republican measure today, I had intended at a very early time to \noffer the President's budget, which we offered very early in the \nprocedure in the committee, as you will remember, and we would not \nagree in advance to any extensive delay in our desire to offer the \nPresident's budget, which very likely would be the first action on this \nside. And so I would like to advise the leader of that.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First of all, let me indicate, the leader has already \nindicated that I am his designee to manage this bill and allocate the \ntime. From time to time, as you will, I will give that to some other \nSenator who will manage in my stead.\n  Mr. EXON. We will follow the same procedure here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me tell you one thing I failed to mention by way of \ntrying to reach some accord. It is my commitment and desire, and I hope \nyou will cooperate--I think there is no reason why we should not do \nthis. Senator Grassley has requested and I have agreed that his \namendment with reference to defense will be the first amendment \noffered, and it addresses the pending resolution.\n  So sometime after our opening remarks and some discussions on the \neconomics, I will clearly ask that he be the first one, and I think you \nwill not have any objection.\n  Mr. EXON. I think it should be a foregone conclusion that whatever \nthe procedure, that you on that side and myself on this side will make \nthe final determination of what will be the order of filing amendments. \nCertainly you have every right to recognize Senator Grassley for the \nfirst remarks on that side.\n  What I have indicated is when our time comes, it is very likely that \nthe first action on this side will be the offering of the President's \nbudget as a substitute. I just want to alert you to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You do not intend to have other amendments that address \nthemselves either to our budget or other things before you offer the \nfull budget?\n  Mr. EXON. That is my present plan, although we have not locked in \nanything.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just thought it might be interesting, from the \nstandpoint of understanding, if we got some of the amendments out of \nthe way and we were looking at three full budgets and debating them in \na sequence which would permit us to see them all kind of one, two, \nthree. But you have every right to do that. So why do we not proceed.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Is it correct, under the Budget \nAct, that there are now 4 hours equally divided, minus the time we have \nused, I guess, after the opening statements?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire further along those lines. If, after the \nopening statements by the managers, and we are into the 4-hour period \nthat has just been referenced by the leader of the committee, we \njointly agree or should jointly agree to yield back any remaining \ntime--in other words, suppose we have an hour on each side or an hour \non that side and half an hour on this side, whatever it is, we can \nhopefully work to expedite the procedures----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. EXON. And I am sure you would agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree.\n  Mr. EXON. If we can take that 4 hours and get it down to 1 or 1\\1/2\\, \nthat is our goal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to try to make it less than the 4 hours. \nWe have a few Senators who want to speak on this subject, and they are \ngoing to be given that opportunity. And then we will get off that as \nsoon as we can.\n  I thank Senator Exon for his cooperative spirit this morning. I hope \nwe can do that all the way through the next 3 days.\n  Mr. President, we begin again today a debate that some might think \nhas not yet ended and others might think never ends. To my friend, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, I know this is the last budget \nresolution he will manage on the Senate floor. I will have more to say \nabout Senator Exon at the end of these remarks, but he knows the work \nwe are about today and probably for the rest of this week. It is very \nserious work. It is work that will directly affect our country's \nfuture.\n  In many ways, the work we are about today is a continuation of our \nefforts of the last year to find a way to balance our Federal budget \nearly in the next century and, in doing that, to look through the \nbudget of the United States and find some areas where we are going to \nhave real trouble down the line if we do not make some reforms and \nchanges now.\n\n  In other ways, the work we are about here today builds on the \nsuccessful efforts last year to reduce spending and put us on a path to \na balanced budget. I think the fact has been lost in the heated debates \nlast winter that we did reduce spending on appropriated accounts to the \nlevels assumed in last year's budget resolution.\n  Largely because of those successes in the appropriated accounts, we \nare able to continue our goal of reaching balance in 2002 as originally \nplanned. Obviously, our work is to achieve that goal, that goal which \nwould have been made easier had the President signed the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995 instead of vetoing it last December. But because the \nPresident vetoed that legislation, which we worked so hard to\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nenact last year, we find ourselves back here today. A little \ndiscouraged perhaps, but not daunted at all in our effort and our \nendeavor, because this issue is not going to go away and the American \npublic demands that we balance spending and revenues at the earliest \npossible time.\n  While some things will surely seem not to have changed from last year \nas the debate progresses, in other ways things will have changed \nsignificantly since 1 year ago.\n  First, one big change is that the President, after nine attempts, has \nnow, at least on paper, with some major gimmicks, figured out a way to \npresent what he claims to be a balanced budget plan. We will have a lot \nmore to say about the President's so-called balanced budget plan, and I \nsincerely look forward to debating it.\n  But let me say at the outset, however, that I have known smoke-and-\nmirrors budgets and I have known real budget plans, and I do not \nhesitate to award the President, the President's so-called balanced \nbudget plan this year with an Oscar for the best acting in fiction.\n  Second, another big change this year, we will have a third budget \nplan to debate. I think that is exciting. The bipartisan budget plan to \nbe offered by Senators Chafee and Breaux is a real budget plan. Again, \nI look forward to debating that plan.\n  Unlike the President's, which is a hoax of a budget, I want to \ncompliment the group of Senators who have worked hard this last year to \nput together a real budget, certainly not a smoke-and-mirrors budget \nlike the President's plan. Unfortunately, the bipartisan plan does not \nachieve balance in 2002, and I have some concerns about elements of \nthat plan that we will debate later. But this is a welcome change from \na year ago when Republicans stood here on the floor alone and offered \nthe only real balanced plan for the American people, the only one to be \non the floor of the Senate in almost four decades.\n  Mr. President, the Senate-reported budget resolution, the one before \nus today, Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, offers America hope. It is \nreal--no smoke and mirrors. It recognizes the need to set priorities, \nit makes tough decisions, or at least says to those who will follow \nafter it with legislation that they are compelled to make some tough \ndecisions, and it is realistic. It can be done. It needs to be done. \nThis is a budget designed to help working American families, to make \nthem more secure, secure in their homes, in their communities, and in \ntheir jobs.\n\n  It offers them a more efficient Government, one dedicated to economic \ngrowth and security, support for our children and lower taxes on \nAmerican families.\n  The resolution before us today recognizes the very simple notion that \nour Government cannot simply go on spending our children's money. It is \ngood medicine for our Nation and it is designed to prevent America's \nchildren from having to swallow a poison pill of mounting Federal debt. \nIt is designed to prevent our Medicare system from going bankrupt in \njust 5 years. It is designed to prevent a future of a crushing tax \nburden on those just starting out in life.\n  The resolution before us, Mr. President, will strengthen America, it \nwill continue to build on our successes of last year, and change the \nway our Government works, to make it more efficient, more responsive, \nand less expensive.\n  Most importantly, it is a budget plan that will ensure a better \nfuture for our children and our Nation. I said that last year; I \nbelieved it then; I continue to believe it now. True leadership cannot \nsimply postpone this difficult work because it is an election year. The \nproblem will not go away simply because there is an election this fall.\n  The second balanced budget plan the Republicans have proposed in this \nCongress is designed to return our Nation to fiscal reality and \npreserve America as the land of opportunity, not only for now but for \nfuture generations. In short, it reflects our commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility, generating economic growth, creating family wage jobs \nand protecting the American dream for all our citizens young and old.\n  This budget will restore America's fiscal equilibrium. It will \nbalance the budget by the year 2002 without touching Social Security, \nby ratcheting down the deficit by slowing the growth of Government \nspending. But let me emphasize, Government spending will continue to \ngrow over the next 6 years. It is a budget which will reverse the tide \nof 50 years of power that flowed from the rest of the country to \nWashington.\n  We want to provide more freedom and opportunity to people at the \nlocal level so they might have more control over the decisions on the \nprograms that affect their lives, affect their children, and affect \ntheir communities.\n  Key changes are proposed to shrink the Federal bureaucracy to \nterminate duplication in Government, to consolidate programs to improve \nefficiency, and prioritize the limited resources we have. But at the \nsame time, we continue to support programs which provide needed \nservices to our citizens. We have been careful to preserve a safety net \nfor those truly in need.\n\n  We support programs aimed at keeping America safe, safe in their \nhomes, their schools, and their neighborhoods, by funding needed crime \nprograms and funding those parts of the U.S. Government that are \nengaged day by day in fighting crime across America, such as the FBI, \nthe DEA, Border Patrol and the like.\n  The budget before us today provides $6.5 billion for environmental \nprotection, including increases of nearly $1 billion in the safe \ndrinking, Superfund and the environmental enforcement programs of EPA. \nSo in 1997 it cannot be said that this budget cuts environmental \nspending. It does not. It increases environmental spending.\n  This budget moves toward protecting America's senior citizens. It \nmakes the Medicare trust fund solvent for 10 years, 1 decade. I regret \nthat I cannot stand here and say to the senior citizens of the United \nStates, we are going to make the trust fund solvent for 50 years. The \ntruth of the matter is, it is difficult to make it solvent for 10. And \nwe must at least do that.\n  I mention that the President's stated goal in his budget is solvency \nof the trust fund through 2006, 10 years, the same goal as we have in \nthis budget resolution. The way we have solved it--that is, the budget \nbefore us and the President's--is very different. We will have more to \nsay about this issue, a lot more during the debate.\n  But the Congressional Budget Office tells us very simply--question: \nHow much must we save in the trust fund to keep it solvent for 10 \nyears? Their answer is: You need $123 billion of savings in the trust \nfunded portion of Medicare to meet the President's goal of 10 years. \nThat is what we have done. We have said, Medicare will be changed, \nreformed, but there for every senior that wants it just like it is, but \nthe providers in that system, and through changing the program to offer \noptions, we must save $123 billion.\n  The President's budget, I regret to say, does not meet his goal. He \nonly extends the life of the trust fund for 1 additional year. This is \nthe President's first big gimmick, an unbelievable cruel hoax on senior \ncitizens, particularly those who depend upon home health care as part \nof this system.\n  We protect, preserve and keep Medicare solvent for one decade. For \nMedicare part B--all should know that when you speak of Medicare, there \nare two pieces. One is a trust fund. Every working American puts money \nin that trust fund. That is essentially the part that is an \nencapsulated trust fund for the protection of senior citizens and their \nhealth programs related to hospitalization and long-term home health \ncare. That is the part that is going bankrupt, and we will be there in \n5 years unless we fix it. We have been told, to fix that part you must \nreform it to save $123 billion.\n\n  The other part, frequently called part B, is an insurance program for \nthe rest of health care that is not provided in the trust fund. This \nprogram is funded by general tax dollars, and there is no trust fund. \nSeniors pay a portion of the insurance premium, and essentially it is \nan insurance policy.\n  I want to make it absolutely clear, for part B we have taken the \nPresident's proposed savings, $44 billion--we have heard all we can \ntake about Republicans and Medicare--and this year it is clear that we \nare responding with 44 billion dollar's worth of savings in part B, \nexactly the same number as the\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nPresident. But we are making the trust fund solvent in a real way with \nno gimmicks and absolute integrity.\n  In our budget, so that everyone will understand the dimension of this \nissue, we provide $1.46 trillion of Medicare spending over the next 6 \nyears--$1.46 trillion. We propose to increase on each Medicare \nbeneficiary the amount of money spent from $5,300 per person today to \n$7,000 per person in 2002. How can that be called a cut? You do the \narithmetic and it is a huge increase. If we were to provide these kinds \nof increases anywhere else in any budget it would be impossible to \nsustain it. In the case of seniors, we have a commitment. We want to \nsave the fund and maximize their coverage.\n  Our budget throws the Medicare trust fund a life preserver. The \nPresident's budget throws Medicare overboard. We will have more to say \nabout how the President gets to his statement of 10 years of solvency \nin part A of the trust fund as we move along.\n  Medicaid: Now, so everybody will understand, Medicare is for seniors; \nMedicaid is a program of the U.S. Government, or I should say, a \ncomposite of 23 programs that are put together to help poor people by \ngiving them health care, by paying their health care bills with certain \nlimitations and certain exceptions. This budget assumes we will spend \n$731 billion on Medicaid over the next 6 years. This budget assumes the \nimplementation of the Medicaid reform plan as recommended unanimously \nby a bipartisan group of Governors--that is, 48 Governors. We have \nadded back $54 billion in Medicaid spending compared with last year's \nresolution. Mr. President, that is $36 billion of Medicaid spending, \ncompared with the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by the President. We are \nanxious to get this Medicaid reform done. With the support of Democrat \nand Republican Governors it can be done. The amount proposed for \nsavings is truly achievable.\n  Medicaid spending, Mr. President, will increase under this budget 46 \npercent over the next 6 years. How can that be called a cut? Medicaid \nspending in this budget will increase by 46 percent over the next 6 \nyears. This budget recognizes the need to overhaul America's \ndeteriorated welfare system. Funding levels in this resolution allow \nCongress to send power back to the States as requested by the National \nGovernors' Association, by converting a failed AFDC Program, Aid for \nDependent Children Program, sometimes called the welfare program, into \na block grant with certain guarantees.\n  The resolution before the Senate assumes reforms in the food stamp \nand child nutrition programs to slow the growth rate of spending in \nthose programs but maintains the entitlement to preserve a nutrition \nsafety net for children. It assumes funding targets on the severely \ndisabled in Supplemental Security Income Program.\n\n  This budget assumes funding from reforms to child enforcement \nprograms, to make deadbeat dads support their children instead of \nmaking the Government, the taxpayer, hard-working families trying to \nmake a living, instead of asking them to do the supporting with tax \ndollars. This assumes we will change the law, truly make deadbeat dads \npay their legally responsible child care and support.\n  This resolution assumes savings from restricting immigrants the \naccess to Government assistance programs to ensure that sponsors live \nup to their promise not to allow immigrants to become a public charge. \nActually, very few Americans, and until lately, very few Senators, knew \nthat under our generous policy of family unification, for the last 15 \nyears or so, American citizens have been busy bringing their relatives, \nmost of them elderly mothers, fathers and grandparents, to our country, \nunder our policy of unification, sign a certificate of support, for we \ndo not invite the unification so that the taxpayers can pay for the \nsupport of these people that are brought to America to join in our \nsociety and be part of their family.\n  It is incredible how that approach has degenerated into a program \nwhere billions of American tax dollars are going to legal immigrants \nwho are brought here purposefully to avoid the certificate of support \nand become wards of the Government. It is American history from our \ninception. We have held a policy that we are not bringing aliens to \nAmerica to become wards of the public. That has fallen apart. We put it \nback together in our assumptions here. Many of the assumptions were \nrealized in the votes on the immigration bill, Mr. President, as we \nvoted numerous times last week and the week before.\n  Finally, this budget provides $122 billion in tax relief for American \nfamilies through a $500 per child family tax credit. This will aid 52 \nmillion American children in 28 million families. I want to repeat, in \nthis budget resolution, the resolution itself says we will reduce the \namount of tax we take into the Treasury by $122 billion because we are \ngoing to give 28 million American families, 52 million American \nchildren, a chance to keep more of their money and spend it on their \nneeds. If ever the Tax Code of America went amiss and became \nantifamily, it was when we lost our way and let the deduction for a \ndependent child wither away from where it was in my day to where it is \ntoday. What can be deducted as an expense of rearing a child is a mere \nshadow of what it was in years past. Yet, we wonder why there is so \nmuch strain and stress in families. We will not even be returning it to \nits more wholesome day of profamily taxes, but we will make a giant \nstep when we say every parent with children under 18 will get a tax \ndeduction of $500. Their taxes will be reduced by $500 for each child. \nWhat is wrong with that?\n  For those who want to stand on the floor of the Senate and talk about \nthis budget cutting something so we can pay for tax cuts, let me just \nsay I am very, very proud that we have made room in this budget for \nthis $500 child tax credit. For those who accuse us, let them stand up \nand say they do not want to give the $500 tax credit. Under our plan, I \nrepeat, a family with two children under age 18 would receive $1,000 of \npermanent tax relief.\n\n  In summary, on the $122 billion tax proposal in this resolution, we \nhave reduced Government spending from what it would be by $712 billion. \nIn doing that, we feel very positive about being able to say $122 \nbillion is given back to the people rather than spent on more \nGovernment.\n  In closing, let me say that I hope we can move, during the next 2\\1/\n2\\ days, to enact this resolution, and then move toward implementing it \nin the months of June and July. I believe this can be done. But if, for \nsome reason, we fail again to get the job done, I can only say that I \nthink the tide is turning, and we will be back again and, clearly, \nsooner rather than later, we will do what is right.\n  Finally, I wish it were possible to have my friend and ranking \nmember, Senator Exon, join me in support of this last budget resolution \nand his last budget resolution on the floor of the Senate. That is not \npossible. But he will be convinced, maybe, on its merits, and as we \nmove through this debate, I just want to say that he has been a very \ngood ranking member and has spoken his party's case extremely well. I \nbelieve it is fair to say that the two of us have done that, with \nlittle rancor and, in my case, with great respect and admiration, \nregardless of how it turns out in terms of where Senator Exon ends up \n2\\1/2\\ days from now. I know that he feels very strongly about the need \nto find a balance in Federal spending. He has been a long-time \nsupporter of the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. He \nsupported the line-item veto legislation that was enacted recently. He \nsupported the unfunded mandates legislation voted out of our Budget \nCommittee earlier this year.\n  Obviously, in the years to come, if it is my privilege to be here on \nthe floor, I will miss him and I wish him well. We will have more to \nsay about that soon.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Chair recognizes the \nranking minority member, the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague from New \nMexico for his most kind remarks. I appreciate them more than he knows.\n  When I came here 18 years ago, I sought a seat on the Budget \nCommittee and was granted one. I have served on the Budget Committee \nthe entire time I have been here. One of the stalwarts on that \ncommittee on the other side of the aisle, whom I got to know initially \nvery well that first year on the Budget\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nCommittee, was Pete Domenici. What he has just said means a great deal, \nand I thank Senator Domenici for that. I have the highest respect for \nhis ability and his integrity, and I appreciate what he said about my \nsupport.\n  I feel the same way about the Senator from New Mexico. We do not \nalways agree, and we cannot in this body. Sometimes it may be difficult \nfor people who do not understand the U.S. Senate to recognize and \nrealize that we can disagree on policy, we can disagree on numbers, and \nwe can speak very forcefully about that. That is the process. But as \nfar as personal esteem is concerned, there is no one in the U.S. Senate \nwhom I hold in more high personal esteem than I do my chairman, the \nRepublican Member, and the excellent floor manager of the measure \nbefore us.\n  So in spite of what is said after that, I certainly want Senator \nDomenici to know, as he already knows, that we are good friends, who \nhave high regard for each other personally. And in the difficult tasks \nthat face the Nation, here is where we come to some disagreement as to \nhow to reach the proper end that we both are seeking.\n  As Senator Domenici has said, Mr. President, this is the last budget \nresolution that I shall manage on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I \nremember well my first budget resolution 18 years ago. It was in the \nspring of 1979, and our dear and late colleague, Senator Ed Muskie of \nMaine, was the chairman of the Budget Committee, and the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, Henry Bellmon, was the ranking minority member. \nThe projected deficit for fiscal year 1980 was less than $20 billion. \nIt does not seem possible, but that is what it was. I had high hopes, \nas a freshman Senator, that we would see the end of deficit spending. I \nsaid so in my first speech. But those hopes were dashed, Mr. President, \nduring the Reagan-Bush years when deficits were piled upon deficits. \nPresident Reagan's Office of Management and Budget Director, David \nStockman--in case he has been forgotten--later described that period of \ntime under Reagan-Bush as ``fiscal carnage.'' The fiscal carnage that \ntook place at that time is what we are attempting to deal with here \ntoday, as we were last year. Four years ago, President Clinton began \nthe arduous task of drawing a narrowing circle on the deficit, and he \nsucceeded beyond all expectations, with no help, Mr. President, from \nthose on that side of the aisle.\n  I will simply cite the difficulties that we are in and how we are \ngoing to get out of them, and the significant contribution that \nPresident Clinton has made to the possibility of balancing the budget \nby the year 2002.\n  The graph that I have behind me here is entitled ``Budget Deficits, \nCBO Estimates.'' These are Congressional Budget Office estimates of \nwhere they were going. You will see the year 1980 to the year 2000 \nacross the bottom of the chart, and the billions of dollars in deficits \non the left side. If you will notice, halfway up the chart, before the \ndotted lines start, is where President Bill Clinton came into office. \nAt that time, you will notice that the annual deficits were about $300 \nbillion a year. I would like to make a point here that I think all too \nmany Americans do not fully appreciate or grasp. They hear \n``deficits,'' they hear ``national debt,'' and all too often I think \nthe difference between the two becomes blurred. So, once again, for the \nRecord, let me state that the deficits we talk about are the annual \nshortfalls where we spend in Government more than we take in. The \nannual deficits were running wild.\n  I just stated in my opening remarks that when I was here in my first \nyear, we were facing an annual deficit of $20 billion. When Bill \nClinton became President of the United States, we were facing annual \ndeficits not of $20 billion but of $300 billion.\n  I hear attacks again and again that are not factual, indicating that \nthe President of the United States is not sincere, that he is trying to \nuse smoke and mirrors. The smoke and mirrors in this chart shows what \nhas happened. This bottom line is that President Bill Clinton--without \nhelp from or even one vote on that side of the aisle in the U.S. Senate \nor over in the House of Representatives--has driven that $300 billion \ndeficit down. That is the annual deficit as opposed to the trillion-\ndollar, multitrillion-dollar debt of the United States of America. That \nis something that I think people overlook.\n  At the end of each year when the deficit is $20 billion, as it was \nwhen I came here, or up to $300 billion when Bill Clinton came here as \nPresident of the United States, those deficits at the end of each and \nevery year are piled upon, and we start all over at the end of each \nyear. Those deficits magically go away, I guess. What we do is pile \nthem onto the national debt, which has risen since I came here--before \nthe Reagan-Bush years from under $1 trillion; today, to over $5 \ntrillion--and are going up even under the projections of the \nRepublicans to at least $6 trillion, before we balance the budget, \nhopefully by the year 2002.\n  The point I want to make again, Mr. President, is that when Bill \nClinton became President of the United States we were running deficits \nof $300 billion. Notice the lower line where they have come down now to \nwhere the Congressional Budget Office projects they will be under $150 \nbillion next year. Bill Clinton, therefore, is not even given credit by \nthose on that side of the aisle for more than cutting in half the \nannual deficits of the United States of America. That is a remarkable \nachievement. But you do not hear much about it from that side of the \naisle.\n  The lower part of this President's budget takes the budget down to \nbalance by the year 2002 as opposed to what the Congressional Budget \nOffice projections said they would be on that up line before Bill \nClinton--BBC, Before Bill Clinton. I submit for the Record that I do \nnot think anyone can refute it, that unless we had followed the fiscal \nresponsibility of Bill Clinton when he became President of the United \nStates that has more than cut the annual deficits in half, we would not \nbe standing here today pretending, or hoping, that we could balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 because we would have been way up here on the \nupper part of this chart. And had we continued to follow the policies \nthat those on the other side of the aisle, evidently by their votes, \nwanted to follow we would not be standing here today talking about \nreaching balance in 2002.\n  Before Bill Clinton, BBC, we were in deep trouble, and we are still \nin very deep trouble. But unless Bill Clinton had taken a stand and \nunless the Democrats, by a tie, or one vote, had the courage to stand \nup and say, ``We have to stop it,'' we would not be in a position \ntoday, even under the Republican proposal to balance the budget by the \nyear 2002. So let us give Bill Clinton at least some credit.\n  We thought, Mr. President, that we had a chance last year to build on \nthe President's success. Under his leadership, we would have reduced \nour Federal deficit to use some other figure by a projected $846 \nbillion through fiscal year 1998. We had a rare opportunity to balance \nthe budget last year, but that opportunity was squandered by the \nradical right. Here we are yet with another year and with yet another \nRepublican budget that does not fairly do what this Senator and most on \nthis side of the aisle and most of the American people want to do: \nbalance the budget in a fair and equitable manner.\n  During the opening remarks by my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, and I think I can quote the manager of the bill correctly, he \nsaid the President claims that he will balance the budget. But he \nindicated in his remarks that it was fictional. Let me say, Mr. \nPresident, that all during that debate that followed the budget last \nyear and the failure of the Republicans even to meet with the President \nto work out a proposition, it is clear to see where the responsibility \nlies.\n\n  Despite the claims, despite the statements, June O'Neill, the \nRepublican-appointed head of the Congressional Budget Office, testified \nin front of the Budget Committee, and I quote June O'Neill: ``The \nPresident's budget proposals and policies, as estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office, would balance the budget by the year \n2002.''\n  Let me repeat that again. Contrary to what you have heard, contrary \nto what you are going to hear, the Republican-appointed head of the \nCongressional Budget Office says the President's budget policies will \nbalance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, we also heard a great deal so far today--and I am sure \nthat\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nwe will hear more about it in the future--that the President of the \nUnited States is not being honest with regard to the Medicare trust \nfund. Mr. President, I cite a letter, and hereby request it be printed \nin the Record of May 9, 1996, from June O'Neill, the Republican-\nappointed head of the Congressional Budget Office, to me, the Honorable \nJames Exon, ranking member, Committee on the Budget:\n\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office has examined the effects of the administration's \n     budgetary proposals on the hospital insurance trust fund. \n     Under current law, the hospital insurance trust fund is \n     projected to become insolvent by the year 2001. CBO estimates \n     that the administration's proposal would postpone this date \n     to the year 2005.\n\n  Enough is enough is enough. I do not think we accomplish a great deal \nby plotting against other people's motives when the leader of the CBO \nhas certified that the President is being honest and that the President \nand his administration are being straightforward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I just \nreferenced be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Here we are, Mr. President, with yet another Republican \nbudget. But after 18 months of extremism and demagoguery, after two \nshutdowns and a threat of a dozen more, I must say that I expected \nsomething better. True--and I congratulate and thank my friend from New \nMexico--true, there is some degree of dulling the knife's edge from \nlast year's disastrous Republican budget proposal that was not \nappreciated by the vast majority of the people of the United States \nonce they understood it.\n  But I ask, is this latest Republican budget kinder? Is it a gentler \nbudget than the Republicans had promised the American people? I think \nnot. Yes, it is somewhat better, I would say, than last year. Primarily \nthat is possible because the Congressional Budget Office in the \nestimating of what is going to happen in the future has come up with a \nhealthier economic growth than they had previously. I thank Senator \nDomenici and the Republicans for wisely using that to alleviate some of \nthe hit that many Americans not as fortunate as the rest of us would \nhave taken.\n  We hear time and time again about how the Republicans are going to \nspend more money on these programs than in the past. You have heard \nalready and you will hear more about the fact that the Republicans are \nspending more money than in the past, especially with regard to \nMedicare programs. Yet the facts are that the additional money the \nRepublicans are saying they are going to spend, therefore saying, \npiously, that it is not a cut, even though the rate of increase that \nthe Republicans are proposing for the average Medicare recipient is \nless than the projected increased costs of health care for the public \nat large will not be sufficient for the seniors that need Medicare. So \nanother way of saying it, oh, yes, they are providing more money but \nthey are not providing the money that seniors need for Medicare, if you \nlook at the projections of what the increased costs will be for the \npublic at large.\n  One need only go in this area to the materials issued on May 8 by the \nHouse Budget Committee and the joint House-Senate press conference that \nfollowed. You will see the same venomous policy and skewed priorities \nthat were proposed in last year's budget included in this new \nRepublican budget, although I hasten to add it is an improvement over \nlast year.\n  The direct student loan program would be eliminated. The Goals 2000 \nProgram would be terminated. That is a key educational function. The \nearned income tax credit would be slashed by $17 billion, $7 billion \nabove what the bipartisan Governors found was acceptable.\n  So that there will be no misunderstanding, the earned income tax \ncredit was first proposed, I believe, by President Ford, and the earned \nincome tax credit is designed for the very lowest of the low-paid \npeople of the United States of America. It is designed to get them out \nof poverty by giving them an earned income tax credit. It was a Ford-\nRepublican proposal that we Democrats in a bipartisan fashion \nrecognized was good, and we have taken up the mantle. They, the other \nside of the aisle, are devastating that earned income tax credit that \ngoes right to the heart and throat of many people living near that \neconomic edge.\n  The programs that they advocate also eliminate the Department of \nCommerce, and Energy would be either eliminated or deep sixed to the \nplace where they could not function. Even the slightly better off \nSenate Republican budget cuts $65 billion more in discretionary \nspending than the President's plan, and discretionary spending is \nsomething that we all agree now is a major concern for the future \nwelfare of America. I suppose this warms the cold hearts of Speaker \nGingrich and Mr. Armey and the Republican freshman class over on the \nother side of the Hill, but it is of little consolation to the American \npeople who had expected moderation and imagination and teamwork.\n  I say to my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I compliment his leadership on that side of the aisle in \nmany areas, and I listened with great interest and had a tendency to \nstand up and applaud when Senator Domenici was talking about the need \nto make changes in the immigration policy. I happen to agree that we \nhave gone way too far and allowed way too many people into the United \nStates of America. Not all of the immigrants but far too many are \ncoming in here to take advantage of our safety net that is already \novercrowded, and we are not doing a very good job of maintaining it. We \ncannot have immigrants coming into this country primarily to take \nadvantage of our safety net.\n  I hope and think my friend from New Mexico appreciates the fact that \nduring the recent debate on this measure, this particular Senator voted \nalmost without exception with the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr.  Simpson], the leader of the effort. I think we will find that we \ndid not do everything we wanted to do, but I think we made some good \nstrides under the excellent leadership primarily of Senator Simpson \nand, of course, on our side Senator Kennedy. Immigration is still a \nmajor problem and causes us great difficulty when we try to come up \nwith what is the right thing to do.\n  Once again, I compliment Senator Domenici for his leadership in this \narea and in many others. Yet we are faced with those in our party and \nhe on his side in his party among many who feel that some kind of \ncompromise is something bad.\n  Compromise is the only way we have to bring 100 dedicated, strong-\nwilled people into some kind of coalition so that we can get things \ndone.\n  I must say that I look at this budget resolution, Mr. President, that \nthis budget resolution, while some improvement over the last, still \nfails in many ways. Most of all, this budget fails the American people. \nI do not think putting frosting over a bad cake makes it any better. It \nstill divides our great country when we should be striving to unite it. \nIt still casts blight when we should be providing shade and comfort for \nthe elderly, the disabled and especially our children. It still \nextracts the most from those who have the least when we should be \nasking for a fair and shared sacrifice. This is where President \nClinton's budget succeeds. That is why I will be offering to use the \nClinton budget, which balances the budget by the year 2002 as certified \nby the Republican appointee to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  This is where the Republican budget, in my view, fails the test of \nfairness. The Republican budget promises many things. As far as I can \nsee, the Republican budget may achieve balance. I agree that it would \nachieve balance, as does the President's budget, in the year that they \nclaim it will. But at what cost to the American people under the \nRepublican budget? What sacrifices, many of them unfair in the view of \nthis Senator, are we going to make? As far as the rest of the loud \npromises are concerned, they are gusty winds of propaganda. This \nRepublican budget delivers least when it promises to do most.\n\n  The Republican majority would like Americans to believe that they are \nsaving Medicare for future generations. ``Preserve and protect,'' was \ntheir poster-tested public relations slogan. But when $167 billion--I \nrepeat, Mr. President, when $167 billion is lopped off the projected \nspending for Medicare over\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nthe next 6 years, $50 billion more than in the President's budget, I am \nnot so sure it will be the same first-class health care system that \nexists today. It is this first-class system--and it is a first-class \nsystem--more than just a trust fund that we are trying to protect and \npreserve.\n  Despite the attacks from the other side, I cite back once again to \nthe letter that I received from June O'Neill, the Republican-appointed \nCBO chief, that the President is right in his projections.\n  The Republican budget would reduce Medicare spending growth per \nbeneficiary far below--far below the projected private sector growth \nrate. I mentioned this earlier. It is right to say we are increasing \nthe spending, but if we are increasing the spending for Medicare less \nthan the cost of health care delivery in the private sector, then that \nis not an increase.\n  I am very fearful that what the Republicans are doing here will, \nwithout question, diminish the quality and the access to health care \nfor millions of middle-class Americans. Doctors and hospitals will be \nable to charge seniors for the entire balance of the charges above the \nMedicare payment. Hear this again. Under the proposal, the Republican \nproposal that they claim is fair and reasonable, doctors and hospitals \nwould be able to charge seniors for the entire balance of the charges \nabove the Medicare payment. The danger here, and Americans should \nunderstand it, and they will not have the wool pulled over their eyes--\nis the Republican majority may assert----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield at conclusion of my remarks.\n  The Republican majority may assert that premiums are not going up, \nbut they cannot make the same claim about seniors' out-of-pocket \nexpenses to pay their medical bills. The $123 billion reduction in the \ngrowth of the Medicare hospital insurance spending will particularly \ndevastate rural and urban hospitals. The Republicans assert that it is \nnecessary to preserve the solvency of the trust fund through the year \n2006. Not true, Mr. President. President Clinton's budget proposal \nextends the life of the trust fund without such deep reductions as the \nRepublicans are proposing. The Republican-appointed CBO Director has \ncertified, and I say this again, that the administration's proposal \nwould extend the life of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund \nuntil the year 2005.\n  What about Medicaid? What about Medicaid reform? Reform was the \nRepublican rallying cry, but instead of attempting to reform Medicaid \nin a manner that would be acceptable to mainstream America, the \nRepublican majority paddled up one of their right-wing tributaries and \ncame out with something new. I believe you would take the whole Nation \nby surprise if you told them that the Republican Medicaid reform might \nmean that middle-class working American families might have to pay \nthousands of dollars out of their own pockets for nursing home care for \ntheir loved ones, or that millions of low-income children might have \ntheir health care jeopardized, or that enforcement of nursing home \nstandards might not be as vigilant as it is today.\n  In other words, ``reform'' means ``conform,'' to their way of \nthinking, even if it means taking out a second mortgage on your home to \npay for nursing home care for a sick or elderly parent. With a $72 \nbillion reduction in Medicaid from the projected spending combined with \na block grant approach, that may well be the scenario.\n  In closing, I want to talk for a moment about tax breaks. My \ncolleagues know that I oppose all tax breaks until we get the deficit \nunder control. But, of course, that is not going to prevail. This is \njust one conservative Senator's opinion, that we should not be talking \nabout tax breaks until we get the budget finally and completely under \ncontrol. But that is not the way it is going to be, because this is a \npolitical year. It is not easy to say ``no'' to tax cuts. It is a \npainful, unpopular vote. But that is what we should be doing, in the \nopinion of this conservative Democratic Senator.\n  This year the Senate Republicans claim a net tax cut of $122 billion. \nThis figure is going to be talked about a great deal during this \ndebate. But let me repeat that. This year the Senate Republicans claim \na net tax cut of $122 billion. But no one should be fooled into \nbelieving that the Republicans intend to limit their tax breaks merely \nto that. The gross cuts will be much larger. The House Budget Committee \nand its chairman boast that this budget will provide at least $180 \nbillion in permanent new tax relief.\n  There is something amiss here. The Republicans are certifying and \nclaiming that they have only $122 billion in tax cuts in the Senate \nproposal and yet those who consulted with the Republicans in the \nSenate, their counterparts over in the House of Representatives, claim \nthat the same numbers will add up to $180 billion in tax cuts, and have \nsaid so publicly. There is something wrong. Their budget also provides \nfor a list of tax cuts that could include nearly every item included in \nlast year's totally failed budget that was rejected by the President \nand rejected by the American people. Just so no one has forgotten, the \ntax cuts in that bill would have gone primarily to the wealthiest \nAmericans. So much for the little guy in a Republican proposed budget.\n  I provide this side-by-side comparison for a good reason. I ask my \ncolleagues to remember what happened last year. The Senate Republican \nbudget had $170 billion in tax breaks and the House Republican budget \nlavished even more at $347 billion in tax breaks, largely for the \nwealthy. In the end, the conferees agreed to $245 billion in tax \nbreaks. So experience tells us to be wary of Republican promises of how \nmuch or how little tax breaks will be, and who in the end will benefit \nfrom them.\n  The Republican budget also does not call upon special interests, who \nassume few if any of the burdens of balancing our budget. While \nPresident Clinton has proposed that $40 billion--$40 billion be raised \nfrom corporate reform and loophole closing, the Republican budget lists \nno savings from these categories.\n  When I mentioned that President Clinton has proposed $40 billion be \nraised from corporate tax giveaways and reforms and loophole closings, \nI only say, referring back to the chart I have in back of me that I \nreferenced earlier, the President, Bill Clinton, knows what he is doing \nwith regard to being a fiscal leader.\n  Having said that, I must admit that I would not have stood on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and said that a year ago in January when the \nPresident sent his group down here to explain to us on the Budget \nCommittee his budget for last year. At the time, I said it was a bad \nbudget, I did not support it, I would not support it. But through the \ninfluence of Senators like myself and others, we have helped Bill \nClinton make the firm decisions that he made to accomplish the goal of \nreducing the annual deficit from $300 billion when he took office down \nto $150 billion.\n  The President is now on the right course. I did not salute him when \nhe came up with a budget last year that I did not think made any sense. \nI salute him for what he has done now. He is on the right course. The \nfigures prove that he is on the right course. Let us get behind the \nPresident and support him.\n  Chairman Domenici made it clear, however, that the tax increases can \nbe used by and maybe increased by the Finance Committee to offset \nadditional tax breaks. If the past is any guide, the Republicans will \nsoon be proposing to raid the pension funds for working families to pay \nfor tax breaks that will primarily benefit those earning over $100,000 \na year.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that my friend and colleague, \nSenator Domenici, wants that. But he has to deal with some people on \nthe other side of the Hill who plainly want that, and the Republicans \nin the Senate need and have to have the cooperation and the support for \ntheir Republican counterparts on the other side of the Hill.\n  I simply say that there is an alternative. There is an alternative to \nthis rehashed and repackaged Republican budget. It is the President's \nbudget. In my 18 years in the Senate, this is the first Presidential \nbudget of either a Republican President or a Democratic President that \nthis Senator has supported, and I support it in the form that is \nsubmitted. Not that I agree with all of it, and I hope that if we were \nusing the President's mark, the\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nPresident's budget, we would adopt some changes. But from the \nstandpoint of starting and setting up something to amend, we would be \nfar better off to work from the President's budget with some flaws than \nthe Republican proposal with many, many, many more flaws.\n  The President's budget reflects his values and the priorities. It \nmakes difficult choices, but it makes them fairly. It balances fiscal \nresponsibility with caring and compassion for our seniors, the young \nand the neediest among us.\n  At the appropriate time--sometime today--I will offer the President's \nbudget as a substitute for the Republican budget that is presently \nbefore us. There is a clear distinction between these two budgets, a \ndistinction that is not lost on the American people. We should have the \nopportunity to debate and vote on these two distinct visions for the \nfuture of our Nation, and we will.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, once again, that I know he had a very difficult time \nputting this budget resolution together, and I suspect he would be the \nfirst to admit that there are some things in here that he is not \nenthusiastic about. But, once again, the art of being a leader in the \nU.S. Senate, regardless of which side of the aisle you are on, has to \ntake into consideration what you can do, what you can accomplish, \nbuilding a coalition. Certainly, in this case, the Senator from New \nMexico has built a coalition of what most of the Republicans would like \nto see.\n  I join with my chairman and thank him for mentioning the fact that \nSenator Breaux and Senator Chafee, and several of our comrades on both \nsides of the aisle, have come up with a budget that is worthy of some \nconsideration. Likewise, there are some parts of that budget that I do \nnot agree with, but at least it is something that we should take a hard \nlook at and possibly, in the end, incorporate some of those concepts \nand those ideas of those thoughtful Senators, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, who are trying, in my opinion, to be helpful.\n  I had hoped one day in my Senate career I would be able to say to my \ngood friend, for whom I have said before I have high respect and \nadmiration, that I support his budget. Unfortunately, that day has not \ncome. But I really enjoy working with him, and I hope that the debate \nthat follows will be as factual as possible, will be as short as \npossible, and, once again, I tell him that I will try in every way I \ncan to cooperate with him, as I did in the committee, not to have this \ngo on and on and on.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon.

James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has examined the effects of the Administration's \n     budgetary proposals on the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust \n     fund. Under current law, the HI trust fund is projected to \n     become insolvent in 2001. CBO estimates that the \n     Administration's proposals would postpone this date to 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, shortly, I am going to yield as much \ntime to Senator Mack as he desires. Senator Spencer Abraham will come \nto the floor probably during Senator Mack's discussion. On the record, \nI want to state that I am going to designate Senator Abraham in my \nstead to control the time on this side, at least until noon or 12:30.\n  Mr. President, I want to make two very brief comments with reference \nto the statements of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. First, if \nthe Senator is suggesting that Republicans are for lower taxes, we are \ngoing to plead guilty. We are for lower taxes. If the Senator suggests \nthat we are going to cut taxes for families with children, we plead \nguilty. We are going to do that.\n  Second, the President of the United States entered into his office as \nPresident at a point in time when a number of things were happening \nand, as a matter of fact, he was very, very fortunate, as was the \ncountry, that these events occurred. I personally believe the \nPresident's budget and the President's conduct had nothing whatsoever \nto do with them. They were in play.\n\n  Let me just put up one little chart. You see, Senator Exon says that \nthis budget deficit CBO estimates--let me see if I can meander over \nthere a little bit.\n  Does the Senator mind if I use his chart?\n  Mr. EXON. No. The Senator is welcome to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator would make a point that at this point in \nhistory the budget starts turning down, and it would have gone up; and, \ntherefore, President Bill Clinton has done a masterful job of \ncontrolling the expenditures of our country and being fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Let us just look. This is not me. This says the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It is not the Senator from New Mexico. We asked them, what did \nthis? How did this happen? Lo and behold, here is what they said: Taxes \nwere raised, and that made up 38.3 percent of getting this down.\n  So the American people right off should know, yes, the Democrats got \nthe deficit down. And 38 percent was because they increased taxes. Most \ninteresting, 50 percent--50 percent--of this reduction, from this line \nto this line, had nothing whatsoever to do with any action by anyone. \nThey are merely reestimates of the expenditure of Government to adjust \nthem to the reality instead of the estimate, such things as the savings \nand loan fund to pay for the bailout. We overestimated the amount of \nmoney, and it was sitting there in the budget, a huge amount of money. \nI cannot believe that anybody is going to claim that the President did \nthat or the Democrats, by voting for a tax-loaded budget-deficit \npackage, did that. That is a huge amount of money.\n  Others are estimates in the expenditure costs of programs. The \nestimated increases did not come out as high as the budget projected. I \nmust say, in all deference, it did not matter who was elected \nPresident. That 50 percent occurred from no action on the part of the \nexecutive branch or the Congress. So that is 50 percent; plus 38 \npercent of the reduction in the deficit.\n  Over here we had economic changes amounting to $13 billion. We will \njust put that up there. If they want to argue about that $13 billion--\nthat the President deserves credit for that--then we can talk about \nthat. But the thing that we must be worried about--that we must be \nworried about--is that the Congressional Budget Office told us that \nthrough 1995 the total cuts in spending were $1 billion, the total cuts \nin spending were $1 billion.\n  Frankly, in all deference and with all of the gentleness that I can \nmuster, this is not a deficit-reduction package that is calculated to \npermanently reduce the size of Government, which everyone says is the \ncause of the deficit. Nobody says we are being taxed too low--strike \nthat. Somebody does. Most people do not think we have to raise taxes \nand spend more. They think we should cut the expenditures of Government \nto get to fiscal equilibrium. This is the history of those lines.\n\n  Having said that, I want to just make one last point. Senior \ncitizens, senior citizens, the President of the United States has \npulled off in his budget a huge hoax--a huge hoax--for which, because \nof other things in his budget, as I said in my opening remarks, he \ntruly deserves the Academy Award for fiction on his budget.\n  Let me just tell you about Medicare. Medicare in the entrusted fund, \nthe trust fund, Mr. President, has been assuring and paying seniors for \nlong-term--long-term--home health care. Let me repeat, in the trust \nfund, seniors, you have been getting your long-term home health care \npaid for by this guaranteed fund.\n  Second point. It is the fastest growing item in Medicare. Fact--the \nPresident chooses to take that program out of the trust fund. That \nprogram is $55 billion, home health care for seniors.\n  What a hoax. You take out something you are providing them, and say,\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\n``We're saving the trust fund.'' Now the question is, how does he pay \nfor it, the home health care for the seniors? Interesting. He does not \npay for it. He puts it right on the backs of the taxpayers of America. \nOne might even say, you raise the taxes $55 billion, because the truth \nof the matter is, the insurance premiums that the seniors pay for, \neverything other than what is in the trust fund, other than \nhospitalization and long-term care, the insurance premiums, the \nPresident says we are not going to add the $55 billion to the premiums. \nSo magically he has made the trust fund more solvent by taking away \nsome of its responsibility and also diminishing the assuredness of that \ncoverage for seniors and at the same time does not pay for it.\n  He just says, add it to the expenditures of the Government. I believe \nit is at risk. I believe it was safe in that trust fund. I believe it \nis at risk when you take it out and you do not pay for it and you just \nsay, the taxpayers will pay for it, and Congress will see to that.\n  That is the truth of the difference in our solvency of the trust fund \nand the President's. He has this magic $55 billion solvency by saying \nwhat we have been giving you out of that trust fund we are not going to \ngive you any longer. But we have made it solvent.\n\n  So frankly that is the only difference between the President and the \nRepublicans. That is a big difference. That is a difference that, when \nit is understood, will turn the tables on who is really worried about \nmaking sure the senior citizens get their care and protection.\n  At this point I yield to Senator Mack.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Nebraska, as \nmanager of the bill, is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield myself whatever time is necessary off of my time.\n  Mr. President, I listened very carefully to my friend and colleague, \nand as near as I can tell, when he uses charts to show how we are \nfalsely trying to take credit for reducing the annual deficit, and \ngiving that credit where I think it logically belongs, to President \nBill Clinton, I simply say, well, it is tomfoolery.\n  I also suggest, regardless of the charts and percentages that we talk \nabout, one of the reasons that we are making significant progress is \nthe fact that under President Bill Clinton we are having a good \neconomy, a growing economy, the stock market reaching record \nproportions.\n  I simply say, at least I hope my Republican colleagues would agree \nthat we should give President Clinton the credit that he deserves for \nthe good economic news, the growing economy without inflation that we \nare experiencing under the leadership of Bill Clinton.\n  I would hate to think what the Republicans would be saying if we were \nhere debating this resolution at a time when the economy was not going \nwell, if the confidence of Americans was not as healthy as it is. I am \nsure that under those conditions my Republican colleagues would not be \nblaming President Clinton for those downturns. That is facetious and at \nbest it is an understatement.\n  One other thing on Medicare. The Republicans always seem to keep \nmoving the goalposts. Last year, how many times did we hear, ``Mr. \nPresident, just give us a balanced budget that will be scored and \nbalanced by CBO, and we can come to an agreement.'' The President did \nthat at the urging of myself and others who thought that his earlier \nbudget proposal last year was not sound. He made dramatic changes. He \nchanged many things, all for the good.\n\n  Finally, believe it or not, we got CBO to approve a budget plan that \nthe President had offered. Then, rather than sealing the agreement that \nthey had made--if you could come to a balanced budget agreement \ncertified by CBO, we could get together--they started moving the goal \npost.\n  On Medicare, the Republicans always seem to be moving the goal post \nonce again. All last year, the Republicans called for preserving the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund. All year, time and time again, \nthat is what they wanted. Now, Mr. President, now that the President \nhas come up with a plan, certified again by the Republican appointee, \nthe head of the Congressional Budget Office, they are moving the goal \npost. They said 2005 is not enough, we have to go beyond that. It is \nlike they are moving the budget, and every time we meet their goal and \nreach their goal line, they move the goal post. That may be political. \nI think it is. At least, it seems to me, it is not realistic.\n  I simply say, as somewhat of a football expert, Nebraska could not \npossibly have won two national championships if we moved the goal post \nevery time we got close to the goal line. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would be advised there are 24 \nhours 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Is there a limit on opening statement time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limit.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to focus my remarks \nthis morning not so much on the specifics of the budget, as others will \nduring the next several days, rather I will focus on the economic \nconditions that surround this debate.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nebraska who a minute ago said he \nhoped that we Republicans would give President Clinton credit for good \neconomic news, may be disappointed in what I have to say, because it \ncertainly is not my intention to give the President high marks for what \nis happening in the economy.\n  I ask people to reflect first on my very strong feelings about the \nOffice of President of the United States, an office that all of us hold \nin high regard, when we think back across our history to some of the \ngreat leaders who have held that position. But today, as I discuss the \neconomy, I find it difficult, frankly, to hold in high regard the \ncomments made by the President of the United States with respect to \nwhat is happening with the economy, what is happening with growth, what \nis happening with opportunity.\n  In his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton said \nthis is the strongest economy in three decades. Last year, fourth \nquarter to fourth quarter, the economy grew at an anemic 1.3 percent. \nOver the entire time that President Clinton has been in office, we have \nseen economic growth of only 2.4 percent a year. Compare that to the 10 \nyears prior to President Clinton's administration, when economic growth \nin America averaged 3.4 percent a year. I do not believe this economy \nis something that we should brag about.\n  Now, some economists cite statistics and say to us, ``Well, things \nare really kind of OK, not to worry.'' Let me tell you who I pay \nattention to. It may be all right for the President to pay attention to \nthose economists and maybe try to hide behind the numbers--2.8 percent \nannual real growth in the first quarter of this year--while ignoring \nthe fact that in 1995 we had only 1.3 percent real growth; or to say \nthe unemployment rate is at 5.4 percent, while failing to say at the \nsame time that there were no net jobs created in the private sector \nlast month--none, zero. What does that mean? No opportunity. No \nopportunity to find a new job, no opportunity to leave one job to \nadvance to another. No jobs created.\n\n  When I want to know about the state of the economy, I pay attention \nto the people back home, people who come up to me and tell me they are \nworried about their future. In fact, it is interesting to ask people \nthese days, how many of you believe that you are better off than your \nparents were at your age? Almost every hand in every audience goes up, \nagreeing that they are better off than the previous generation. But \nwhen you then ask how many believe their children will be better off \nwhen they are your age, maybe four or five hands go up. It appears that \nfor the first time in a long, long time, we have a generation of \nAmericans that thinks the next generation will not do as well as they \nhave done. That is what is causing the tremendous anxiety that exists \nin America today.\n  Still, President Clinton wants to claim the strongest economy in \nthree decades--on the basis of 1.3 percent growth. It is interesting to \nremember\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\nthat in 1992, when he was campaigning for the Presidency, he called the \neconomy the worst in 50 years, even though the economy that year grew \nat 3.7 percent. It is a little difficult to understand the President's \nline of thinking: one day he talks about 3.7 percent growth as being a \nvery weak economy, and then a few years later and he is President, and \nthe economy is growing at only 1.3 percent, or even 2.4 percent, to say \nwe have the strongest economy in three decades. It is very difficult \nfor me, frankly, to give this administration, or this President, credit \nfor a strong economy.\n  I think we ought to, again, listen to what the people back home are \nsaying to us. One example. I recently heard a story about a woman \nrecalling that her husband had said to her on two separate occasions, \n``You better not go out today. I may have to call and tell you to come \npick me up, because I may not have a job when this day ends.'' I think \nabout the mother telling her children she would not be home in the \nevening because she had to get a second job to make ends meet.\n  One piece of statistical data that has not made the headlines is \nthat, since January 1994, the number of individuals holding a second \njob has increased 17 percent. Now, the economists might tell working \npeople not to worry. The President may tell working people not to \nworry, that everything is fine. But I can tell you that the people back \nhome do not agree. They are very anxious about their future, and their \nability to make ends meet.\n  As a matter of fact, a recent poll asked, ``How worried are you about \nyour ability to make ends meet?'' The response indicated that some 20 \nmillion American families a year say their ability to make ends meet is \ntheir No. 1 concern. Now there are 30 million families who are \nconcerned about their ability to make ends meet. The anxiety question \nis real. Economists can say whatever they want, but the people in the \nState of Florida are concerned about the future.\n  A couple of other statistics point to why people are feeling anxious. \nReal median family income has declined in 4 out of the last 5 \nyears. And many other indicators suggest that trend will continue. Real \ncompensation--that is, wages and benefits--grew only four-tenths of a \npercent in 1995, the slowest in 14 years. Between 1982 and 1989, real \nincome per person grew three times as fast as it has since 1993, when \nPresident Clinton took office.\n\n  The real issue before us is, how can we help create higher levels of \ngrowth? Should America be satisfied with 2.4 percent real growth, or \nworse? I say the answer is absolutely not.\n  From the end of World War II to the beginning of the Clinton \nadministration in 1993, economic growth averaged nearly 4 percent a \nyear. Today, we are told we are doing well with growth of only 1.6 \npercent. Where are the jobs going to come from that will ensure \nprosperity and opportunity tomorrow?\n  Not long ago, the President of the United States was in Florida, and \nthere was debate over the future of the sugar industry in the \nEverglades. Protesters opposed to the administration's plan said they \nwere going to lose their jobs. In essence, the President responded: \n``Don't worry, we will see that anyone who loses their job will get \nanother one.'' I wonder how many times he has made that comment around \nthe country. But where does he think these jobs come from? Government \ndoesn't create jobs. They come from the private sector, and they come \nas a result of Government getting out of the way and allowing for \ninvestment to take place.\n  So we must begin this discussion, Mr. President, with the \nunderstanding that the economy is weak, not strong, that job creation \nhas slowed. While the administration wants to brag about the 8.5 \nmillion jobs created since they came into office, they neglect to \nmention that if job formation took place at the same rate as in \nprevious recoveries, there would have been 11.5 million jobs created in \nAmerica, and we are really 3 million jobs short. Furthermore, of the \n8.5 million jobs that have been created, many are second and part-time \njobs going to families that need second jobs just to make ends meet. \nThat does not make for a growing economy.\n  I think it is also important that, when we debate the budget, we must \nremember who is paying the bills. I think about the people at home who \ncome up and tell me about their tax burden, what they are being asked \nto pay for Government. I think of the young couple, the husband who \nworks two jobs all week long, from early in the morning until late at \nnight, five days a week, and then stays at home on Saturday and Sunday \nto take care of his little ones while their mom is out on her job over \nthe weekend in order to make ends meet. I think about the couple that \ngets up at the crack of dawn and commutes long distances to work, and \ndoes not get home at night until well after dark, who cannot spend time \nwith their kids, yet are being asked to pay more and more and more to \nthe Federal Government.\n  Do you know what really frustrates them? It is that they are being \nasked to work longer and harder to pay more taxes to support programs \nthat they know have failed and to support individuals who are not \nworking. That is the central theme that runs all through the debate. \nFor example, with respect to the 4.3-cent rollback of the gasoline tax. \nEvery time workers pull up to the gas pump, that 4.3 cents in gasoline \ntaxes goes not to build more roads or to build more bridges, but to \nfund Federal programs they know have failed, and support people who \nrefuse to work. That is why support for activities here in Washington, \nDC, has been so deeply undermined in America.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe our debate should not be so much \nconcerned about this budget itself, but about what needs to happen in \norder to spur growth of this country, and thereby provide more hope and \nopportunity for more Americans.\n  Let me make one other point about productivity growth. Prior to the \nmid-1970's, productivity in America grew approximately 2.1 percent a \nyear. In the last 10 years, that rate declined to about 1.1 percent. \nAnd now, during the 3 years of the Clinton administration, productivity \ngrowth has averaged only three-tenths of a percent. If productivity \ndoes not increase in a meaningful way, there is no way to pass on \nhigher wages to employees.\n  What is causing productivity to decline? More taxes, more spending, \nmore Government, and less freedom, including taking away the freedom to \npursue greater creativity, to spur American ingenuity, and to provide \nopportunity. With higher taxes, more regulation, and more interference \nfrom Washington, there is less opportunity for American business to be \nmore productive, more competitive, and to create jobs.\n  So, Mr. President, I say that, at this point, this economy is weak. \nThere is no sign that, in the long run, we are going to achieve higher \nlevels economic activity or offer hope and opportunity to future \ngenerations of Americans unless we follow far different policies than \nthe ones offered by the administration. Those politicians who believe \nthat today's economic statistics indicate opportunity are making a \ngrave mistake. The debate on this budget should be about America's \nfuture, about the ability to create jobs and opportunity through more \ninvestment, job creation, and business formation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I asked the Senator from Michigan if he \nwould assume the chair so I could take the opportunity to come down to \nthe floor to compliment my colleague, Senator Mack from Florida. He \noutlined for the Senate, and for those who are observing, the real \nconcern and the deep anxiety that exists among many Americans today \nabout their future and their family's future. A concern that I think is \nnow becoming almost universally shared about the impact of the \ndecisions, or lack of decisions, that Washington has made. This \ninability of Congress and the President to make decisions impact their \nfuture in a negative way.\n  We have not faced up to some of the difficult choices that clearly \nmust be made if we are going to put our economy on an upward path, and \nif we are going to offer and provide opportunity for the young people \nof the next generation of America, not to mention this current \ngeneration that is struggling with that economic anxiety. The Senator \nfrom Florida put his finger on the most immediate items that we in this \nCongress and with this President can address in answering these \nparticular problems. We can provide immediate relief to Americans today \nby\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\ndoing what they have asked us to do, and that is examine the role, the \nfunction, the scope, and the size of Government. We can address what \nvirtually a universe of Americans now believe--this Government tries to \ndo too much, it is too big, it spends too much. Americans see the \nresults of this Government and they are simply not the kind of return \non investment that Americans are asking for. They are working harder in \norder to pay more taxes to fuel and feed a Government spending effort \nthat is not addressing the basic needs of Americans in an effective \nway, and they are saying ``scale it back.'' If we could do so and make \nthe appropriate decisions in doing so, we can provide them with an \nimmediate increase in their wages. We can give them immediate salary or \nhourly wage increase by giving them tax relief from the excessive \nburden of taxes now being imposed.\n  This whole question about the gas tax is not really to move the price \nof gasoline which I paid this morning $1.65.9 a gallon. The question \nis, and the issue is, that the Congress has not been straight and fair \nwith the American people on the issue of gas taxes and on a whole range \nof other taxes. The Clinton 4.3-cent gas tax increase was not applied \nto building roads and bridges, which most motorists in Indiana and, I \nthink, across the country believe. When Americans pay extra money to \ncover gasoline increases, I know they at least think it goes to build \nroads and bridges and to help ease their commute to work, or their \ntravel across the country. But no. This gas tax increase went to \ngeneral revenues in order to feed the excessive and seemingly unabated \nspending habits of Congress.\n  So just in the gas tax alone we are talking about more than a \nreduction at the pump. We are talking about being honest with the \nAmerican taxpayer in terms of how their money is being used and giving \nthem some relief. The budget that we are debating today is designed to \nput us on a path toward fiscal responsibility that will allow us then \nto take the savings that occur over and above balancing the budget \nwhich can occur in outyears and return it to the American people in the \nform of tax relief so they do not have to work so hard and do not have \nto take that extra job simply to pay taxes to fuel Government.\n  The Senator from Florida has accurately addressed the issue. And I \nwanted to take the opportunity to step down from the Chair to thank him \nfor his contributions and for reminding us and keeping our eyes focused \non the real picture.\n  The second point I would make is simply that we as a Congress and the \nPresident of the United States must address the tough choices and the \npriority choices that we all know have to be addressed if we are going \nto get a handle on this budget.\n  This idea of deferring for some future Congress the questions about \nmandatory spending and entitlements is simply postponing the inevitable \nand bringing us closer to a day of cataclysmic budget collapse. We \ncannot continue to run up the deficit as we have. We cannot continue to \npretend that there are not problems in the mandatory spending programs \nthat need to be addressed.\n  It reminds me of the old commercial where the fellow picks out the \ndripping carburetor leaking with oil and says, ``You've got two \nchoices. You can pay me now or you can pay me later. If you pay me now, \nwe can make this a lot less expensive and a lot less painful. But, if \nyou wait, the whole engine is going to fall apart.''\n  If we keep postponing this decision, the whole engine is going to \nfall apart. Republicans have attempted to come forward with budget \nafter budget addressing these questions in an honest way even at \nconsiderable political risk only to find that President Clinton ducks \nhis head in the sand, or slips and slides his way through the political \nminefield, the end result of which is to do nothing.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MACK. I think it would be helpful if we put this debate in terms \nthat citizens around the country can associate themselves with. I \nremember last year when we were going through this debate, we talked \nabout what would happen if we got a balanced budget. We said that \ninterest rates would come down and that would mean lower mortgage \npayments, lower automobile payments, and more affordable student loans. \nI think it is important to look closely at what has happened since we \ndid not get an agreement on a balanced budget. Long-term interest rates \nhave risen by a percentage point. What does that mean to the average \nconsumer, to the couple who is out there today closing on the purchase \nof their first home? For the average home in America, that higher \ninterest rate means they will pay about $650 more each year in \npayments, or another $100 a year for a car.\n  So there are real consequences to this debate and for failing to get \na balanced budget proposal through the Congress and signed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Real families, real individuals, hard working men and women of \nAmerica, are paying hundreds of dollars more each year because of the \nfailure to come to an agreement on a balanced budget.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  I will close by quoting what has already been quoted on the floor \ntoday probably, the piece written in the Washington Post by Robert \nSamuelson, who is an economist and writer that I greatly respect \nbecause he speaks with great candor, and I think speaks about the \nthrust that this Congress and that the President needs to address. Just \nto quote part of this. He says, ``As a moral matter, Americans deserve \ncandor.''\n  Americans deserve to hear the truth about the financial situation in \nwhich we find ourselves. We are debating in the Senate this week the \nbudget for the next fiscal year and a budget which lays out a plan to \nachieve a balance in the future. We are debating about these very \nissues, the issues of how we spend taxpayer dollars, and how we \nestablish priorities. And there is no better time to talk about it than \nthis particular week in the Senate.\n  Samuelson said, ``As a moral matter, Americans deserve candor. As we \ndebate this issue, they deserve what we believe to be the truth. They \ndeserve candor about the situation in which we find ourselves. When you \nlook at the mandatory spending in just the Social Security and Medicare \nareas, it is an unassailable fact that longer lives, steep health \ncosts, and an aging baby boom will inevitably make Social Security and \nMedicare unbearably expensive in the next century.''\n  The next century sounds like a long way away. We have plenty of time \nto worry about it. This is 1996 approaching 1997. We will be at the \nnext century before we know it.\n  He uses the word ``unbearably expensive.'' ``We are facing a crisis \nof fiscal proportions that this Nation has never faced in its history. \nIt will be unbearably expensive, if we do not address it, and address \nit now.''\n  He goes on to say, ``At some point, spending and benefits will be cut \nto avoid costs that seem politically intolerable. But the trouble is \nthat the longer changes are delayed the more abrupt and unfair those \nchanges will be, and that's why silence is irresponsible.''\n  We are today hearing silence on this issue from the White House. We \nare seeing gimmicks, budgetary gimmicks, as the Senator from New Mexico \njust outlined, to fool, or attempt to fool the American people about \nthe status of the Medicare trust fund by shifting $55 billion out of \nthat trust fund to the general revenues to either put the benefit \nprogram at risk, or to add additional costs to the taxpayer, or to \ndrive us deeper into debt.\n  Samuelson says ``This is a relevant character issue about the \nPresident. Question: Does he have the moral fiber to help America make \ndifficult choices?''\n  We are trying to make difficult choices. This budget requires \ndifficult choices. But it is time that we stood up and began to tell \nthe American people the truth about those difficult choices and not \npostpone the inevitable. At great risk to this economy, at great risk \nto the future of this generation, and an extraordinarily unbearable \nrisk to the future generation.\n  So I hope we will use this time to make these discussions relevant, \nto talk about them in an honest way, and to quit the posturing and the \npretending and to end the practice of saying,\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\n ``Well, we cannot do it now because there is an election just months \naway.'' I have served in this body for some time, and every 2 years the \nexcuse is ``we will do it after the next election.'' The time to do it \nafter is running out. The risk is extraordinary; the results are \nunbearable; and I hope we could face up to these decisions and honestly \nput it before the American people.\n  Frankly, I think they are ready for the truth. Frankly, I think they \nwill reward truth and reward candor, and I hope this can be a major \npart of this debate in the Presidential election and in the Senate and \ncongressional elections, and I hope we can initiate the debate this \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, once again, we have before the Senate the budget \nresolution that was passed by the Budget Committee under the leadership \nof Senator Domenici. This budget resolution achieves balance in the \nyear 2002. It accomplishes this feat by reducing the size of Government \nand slowing the growth of various governmental programs. At the same \ntime, it preserves and protects Medicare, provides full funding for \neducation and environmental programs, and increases funding for Federal \ncrime programs over previous levels.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by saying I am happy that this year we \nare dealing with a belief that we should balance the budget. One year \nago in this budget process the President was talking about $200 billion \na year deficits as far as the eye could see. This year the President is \ntalking about balancing the budget and attempting, we would argue not \nsuccessfully but at least attempting, to present a budget that does \nbring us into balance.\n  The differences though are considerable. The accomplishments of the \nRepublican budget contrast strongly with the President's budget \nsubmitted earlier this year. Where we rely on tough economics and tough \nchoices, the President's budget relies on rosy scenarios, gimmicks and \ndeferred savings. Where we employ new ideas to help curb the growth of \nour entitlement programs, ideas like choice in Medicare and returning \nour welfare programs back to the States where they belong, the \nPresident relies on tried and, I believe, failed policies that \nguarantee our entitlement programs will continue to spiral out of \ncontrol. Where we put our faith in individuals and families by \nencouraging economic growth so they can earn more, reduce the size and \nscope of government so they can keep more, and in the process do more \nfor themselves and their families, the President's budget simply puts \nhis faith in more government.\n  The differences are these. We are offering a budget that gets to \nbalance and achieves it by making some tough choices, choices that have \nto be made if we are to truly have a balanced budget.\n  The President's budget, on the other hand, in effect says we can \nachieve a balanced budget painlessly, without anybody really having to \nsuffer. That is, in my judgment, impossible. Obviously, we have to \nconstrain the growth of government. We have to do it in a way that is \nfair and equitable. To say that we can accomplish this where tough \nchoices are not needed is wrong.\n  Other Members have already addressed the important details of the \nRepublican budget. How it reduces overall growth in Federal spending by \nover $440 billion through the year 2002 while increasing funding for \neducation, the environment and crime fighting programs. How it protects \nveterans' health care and homeless programs from the devastating cuts \nincluded in the President's budget. And how it protects Medicare home \nhealth care programs by keeping the program within the part A portion \nof Medicare where it belongs.\n  Today, I would like just to focus on one difference between the two \nbudgets. That is the area of tax cuts and how the Republican approach \ncontrasts with that of the President.\n  First, let me put the tax picture in perspective. According to the \nTax Foundation, more than one-third of the average American worker's \nwages go to taxes. For working parents that meant they had to work \nuntil May 7 just to pay their taxes this year. The Tax Foundation calls \nthis tax freedom day, and May 7 is the latest it has ever been \nrecognized.\n  Other indicators are just as ominous. Columnist Bruce Bartlett \npointed out recently that State, local and Federal revenues now consume \nmore of our national income than ever--31.3 percent of everything \nAmericans earned last year. At the Federal level, taxes are also at \nnear record levels. Last year, they consumed 20.4 percent of our \nnational income. This marks only the second period in which the Federal \ntax burden has exceeded 20 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States. The last period was at the end of President Carter's \nadministration, just prior to President Reagan's tax cut proposals of \n1981.\n\n  President Clinton has played a very active role in helping achieve \nthis record tax burden. As a candidate, he campaigned on a platform of \nmiddle-class tax cuts. At that time he stated, ``We will lower the tax \nburden on middle-class Americans.'' He even argued against raising \ngasoline taxes, telling voters, ``I oppose Federal excise gas tax \nincreases.'' Why? Because a gas tax ``sticks it to lower income and \nmiddle-income retired people in the country, and it's wrong.''\n  That is the campaign rhetoric of 1992, but it is not consistent with \nhis performance thereafter. As we all know, President Clinton pushed \nthrough the Congress in 1993 the largest tax increase in history: $265 \nbillion over 5 years. Gas taxes were raised during that budget battle. \nThe President also raised taxes on senior citizens. He raised taxes on \nthe largest corporations, and he raised taxes on thousands of the \nsmallest businesses. He raised taxes on the living and he even raised \ntaxes on the dead. Then he turned around and told a Houston audience, \n``You might be surprised to find * * * I think I raised your taxes too \nmuch.''\n  That is true. The fact is, the tax burden has been raised higher than \nit has ever been before, except for one point in American history. More \nsignificantly, by ranking tax burdens according to Presidents, you can \nsee that this President has presided over the highest average tax \nburden of any President in the history of the country, 19.933 percent \nof national income.\n  In a nutshell, the President has succeeded in completely reversing \nthe progress made during previous administrations in moving us toward a \nsimpler, fairer, flatter Tax Code. The Tax Code now is more burdensome, \nit is more complex, and it is more costly as well.\n  What does that mean to average Americans? We can talk about numbers \nand percentages, as we often do on the floor here, to the point where \nwe lose sight of its impact on real people. But what it means is this. \nLast year Americans paid to Uncle Sam $87.2 billion more than they \nwould have under previous policies. For the average American family, \nthat's over $800 taken out of their pocket each year and handed over to \nthe Federal Government.\n  The Balanced Budget Act which President Clinton vetoed last year \nwould have provided partial relief from these record tax burdens. The \nbill would have reduced the tax burden on Americans by a modest amount, \non average about $36 billion a year. In other words, the tax relief \nvetoed by President Clinton last fall was less than half the increased \ntax burdens that Americans have experienced since he took office in \n1993. President Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act and deprived \nAmericans of middle-class tax relief, like the $500-per-child family \ntax credit, marriage penalty relief, expand IRA's, spousal IRA's, and \nestate tax reforms that would have given small business and family farm \nowners the opportunity to pass on their enterprises to their families \nin a way that is not feasible right now because of the high inheritance \ntaxes.\n  Which brings us to this year. In the President's State of the Union \nAddress, Mr. Clinton announced that ``the era of big Government was \nover.'' He then\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nsent to Congress a budget which would ensure that Government spending \nand income taxes remains at record levels.\n  Once again, however, we have to look beyond the rhetoric. When the \nPresident released his budget in March, he claimed he was providing \nAmericans with $99 billion in tax relief, enough to pay for a watered-\ndown child tax credit.\n  On closer inspection, however, the President also included $62 \nbillion in tax loophole closing and other increased revenues, which \nmeans the net tax relief is only $36 billion.\n  Finally, in an attempt to make the budget reach balance in the year \n2002, President Clinton has to terminate his tax cuts in the year 2000, \nwhich reduces the total tax relief provided in the Clinton budget \nbetween 1996 and 2002 to something around $6 billion.\n\n  Think about that. We are talking about net tax relief over 6 years of \nabout $1 billion per year. There are 250 million-plus Americans. That \nmeans the President's tax cut, spread over six years, averages out to \nabout $4 per American per year. This amount is hardly consistent with \nthe promise that was made during Clinton's election campaign for \nsignificant middle-class tax relief. In fact, Mr. President, as I think \nabout it, it probably means one extra trip to McDonald's per year for \nthe average American family.\n  But that is not the worst part. The worst part is that, while \nPresident Clinton terminates his tax cuts, his tax increases are \npermanent. They go on forever. The net effect is another tax increase \non Americans. Between 1996 and 2006, President Clinton's budget would \nraise taxes on Americans by $50 billion. Add this new tax increase to \nthe previous tax increases, and this Presidency will have cost \nAmericans 465 billion additional dollars through the year 2002.\n  Contrast this tax increase with the Republican budget. Our budget \nincludes funding for the full-sized, permanent, $500-per-child family \ntax credit. Our goal is to reduce the tax burden for those taxpayers \nwho need it the most--parents attempting to raise young children. For a \nfamily earning $30,000 per year in my home State, Michigan, with two \nchildren, the child tax credit would reduce their 1996 Federal income \ntax burden 51 percent. That is real relief from what, under President \nClinton, has become the highest tax burden on families in the history \nof this country.\n  That is the difference between the direction that we perceive \nAmericans wanting to go and the direction they would have under the \nPresident's proposals. Our goal is to let American families earn more \nand keep more. Our goal is to give American families a chance to keep \nmore of the dollars that they earn and to be able to use those dollars \nto help their families, particularly those families in the middle class \nwho are struggling to make ends meet, working hard and playing by the \nrules.\n  I think the choice before the Senate is clear. On the one hand, you \nhave a resolution that is responsive to the American voters and \ntaxpayers in their desire to see a smaller, more effective Government \nwith its books balanced, and, on the other hand, you have the \nPresident's budget which is responsive to the status quo and inside-\nthe-beltway interests.\n  I would like to just close by thanking Senator Domenici for his \nleadership on this issue. This is my second opportunity to vote for a \nbudget resolution. Thanks to Chairman Domenici's resolve and guidance, \nI am once again proud to support and back a document that brings this \nGovernment's budget into balance. It has been 25-plus years since the \nCongress was able to do that, and it is under the leadership of Senator \nDomenici and the Republican majority that we accomplished this goal.\n  Last year we took this goal as close as we could to the finish line \nby making sure that Congress ultimately passed a budget that was in \nbalance. Unfortunately, the President chose to veto that budget. He \nchose to veto tax cuts for working families. He chose to veto reform of \nthe Medicare Program to help ensure the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund. And, he choose to veto a budget that will give Americans relief \nfrom the high interest rates that result from uninterrupted Federal \nbudget deficits. years.\n  Hopefully this year, when a balanced budget is presented to the \nPresident, we will have a different result. I hope he will sign that \nbudget, and I hope he will agree with us that it is time to truly put \nthe era of Big Government to rest and move in a different direction.\n  The President's budget does not really accomplish that. The budget \nwhich the Senate Budget Committee passed last week does. I look forward \nto working to see its adoption here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today as a member \nof the Budget Committee to talk about the differences between President \nClinton's budget, which I voted for in the Budget Committee, and the \nRepublican budget that passed on a partisan vote.\n  First, I wanted to point out that the Senator from Michigan complains \nabout the size of Government as a share of the economy, but he only \ntells half the story, if that. What he did not know is that President \nClinton has reduced the size of Government. There are fewer people \nworking for the Government now than at any time since John Kennedy was \nPresident.\n  Let me repeat that: There are fewer people working for the Government \nnow than at any time since John Kennedy.\n  Spending by the Federal Government now is 22 percent of the economy. \nBut what the Senator did not know is that this is the lowest percentage \nsince the 1970's--lower than it was when we had Republican Presidents. \nAs a matter of fact, the record level was set during the Reagan \nadministration.\n  So I think when we talk about this budget and the situation today, we \nought to put it into the context of where we have come from. We have \ncome from a time when there were hardly any new jobs created to a point \nwhere President Clinton has fulfilled his commitment to create more \nthan 8 million new jobs. We have come from a time where we talked about \ndeficit reduction but ran up more debt during George Bush and Ronald \nReagan than all the years since George Washington through Jimmy \nCarter. Now we have seen deficit reduction 4 years in a row.\n\n  There are many other facts about this economy that are important. The \nmisery index is at the lowest point. That is a combination of \nunemployment and inflation. It is at a very low point. As I said, we \nhave fewer Government employees than at any time since John Kennedy.\n  Does that mean everything is perfect? No, it does not mean everything \nis perfect. We have a long way to go. We should have started yesterday \nby passing an increase in the minimum wage. That is what we should be \ndoing. We should be reaching across the aisle to make life better for \nmillions and millions of working people who have seen that minimum wage \ngo to a 40-year low in terms of its purchasing power. Seventy percent \nof the American people think it is an issue of fairness, and we have a \nRepublican leader over in the House who says he really does not believe \nthere ought to be any minimum wage--there ought to be no minimum wage. \nCan you believe it?\n  The thinking that has taken over this Congress since 1994 never fails \nto amaze me. Yesterday, I said the passion that is being expressed on \nthe other side about reducing 4 cents on the gas tax should be matched \nby a passion to increase the minimum wage for our people.\n  We already know from the experts that the oil refiners will probably \nget that 4 cents a gallon. When that issue comes before us, we are \ngoing to work hard on the Democratic side to make sure that money does \ngo into the pockets of consumers, but even with that, we cannot ensure \nit. Let us say they got every penny, that is $27 a year, and the \ndeficit will go up. If it is made a permanent repeal, it will go up by \n$30 billion.\n  So how do the people view this Republican Congress when deficit \nreduction is supposed to be No. 1 and then we repeal a gas tax, which \nwill probably go into the pockets of the oil companies, and then we are \ngoing to have to find out how we are going to make up that money? The \nlatest plan is to do a one-time fee on banks. But the fact is, that fee \non banks is supposed to be put aside in case there are bank or savings \nand\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nloan failures, not to be used up on a gas tax repeal.\n  What does that all have to do with the budget? I think in many ways \nit is symbolic of the kind of budgets we are going to see presented. \nOne, in my view--and that is President Clinton's budget--really does \nput people first, and the other, the Republican budget, I do not think \nputs people first. Of course, it is up to the American people to \ndecide.\n  I am going to just show the differences in the budget, as I see them. \nI will use a chart to do that, because I think it is one thing to talk \nabout how we feel about the budget, which we all will do, it is another \nthing to put the numbers behind our statements.\n\n  So I have tried to highlight from my perspective as a Budget \nCommittee member some of the most important differences in the two \nbudgets. I want to talk about education and job training.\n  If people from another country were to ask me what makes our country \ngreat, I would say it is because we have a great middle class and \neveryone has a chance at the American dream.\n  And then if they asked, ``Why do people have a chance at the American \ndream,'' I would say, ``If I had to say one thing, it would be \neducation.''\n  I happen to be a product of public schools, all the way from \nkindergarten through college. I was very fortunate to have a good \neducation in public schools. In college, I went to the State \nuniversity. It cost me $12 a semester. It was amazingly affordable. Of \ncourse, as I go around my State, the people who like me say, ``Look at \nthat Senator, she's a product of public schools.'' Of course, the ones \nwho do not say, ``See what public schools can do; look at that \nSenator.''\n  The fact of the matter is, it is education that is the key to the \nAmerican dream, and today it is more than education, it is education \nand job training. As our President has said, many of us will have seven \nand eight jobs in a lifetime, and we need the constant retraining, the \nreeducation. I know people of my generation have had to learn how to \nuse the computer. It is not that easy, but it can be done.\n  The fact is, if you look at the two budgets, the President's budget \nand the Republican budget, the President adds $56 billion more to \neducation and training than does the Republican budget. That is a fact. \nBoth budgets balance in the timeframe of 6 years. Both budgets balance. \nSo we do not have to argue about that. That is resolved. The question \nis, what are your priorities? What do you want to invest in? And I \nthink that this Democratic President is correct in saying we must \ninvest in education.\n  What the Republicans do is actually, compared to 1996 levels, \ndecrease by $3.2 billion over the next 6 years what is spent on \neducation. I just have to say, if there were no other differences in \nthis budget, no other differences than this first point, $56 billion \nmore to education and job training in President Clinton's budget than \nin the Republican budget, if there was not one iota of difference other \nthan that, I would say vote for President Clinton's budget, which is, \nof course, what I intend to do.\n\n  There are more important things as well--Environmental Protection \nAgency enforcement. I see the Senator from Arkansas is on the floor, \nand yesterday I thought he made a spectacular statement about the \nimportance of clean air and clean water and an environment we can hand \ndown to our children that is at least as beautiful as the one we \ninherited. You cannot do that without enforcement.\n  We had this argument in the 1970's when, under President Nixon, we \nset up the Environmental Protection Agency. That was bipartisan. What \nhas happened to the environmental issue? We cannot find support for \nenvironmental protection on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  It takes inspectors to enforce the laws, to make sure that companies \nare not polluting and that when they do, they pay to clean it up. It \ntakes dollars to clean up Superfund sites, most of which are very close \nto our populated cities.\n  I visited one of them in San Bernardino, CA. The cleanup was stopped \nbecause of the Government shutdown. We could not get the money to clean \nit up, and the pollution and the toxic waste was about to penetrate \ninto the water table. Thank goodness we were able to get those funds \nafter the Government reopened to begin cleaning up that site. That is \njust one small example of the problems that we have.\n  Years ago we did not know that some of these chemicals were very \ndangerous, that they could sink down into the water table. But we know \nit now, and if we do not pay the price now, we will pay it later. How \nwise it is to clean up those pollutants now before they get into the \nwater table and people cannot drink the water, and if they do, they get \nsick. I just read a recent report that they have traced chemical \npollution in the water supply to childhood leukemia.\n  The fact of the matter is, it is shortsighted to shortchange the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and that is a difference in our \nbudget.\n  Let us get to the issue of Medicare. I thought we had the fight over \nMedicare in the sixties, and we decided it was shameful and morally \nreprehensible that half of our senior citizens had no health insurance.\n  We passed a good law, the Medicare law. It has worked. Do we have to \nmake sure that the Medicare system is sound? Do we have to make \ncorrections and reforms? We do. And the President does in his budget. \nHe makes that fund safe until at least 2005.\n  But what does the Republican budget do? It cuts $50 billion more out \nof Medicare than does President Clinton's budget--$50 billion more. It \nis hard to imagine what $50 billion would look like. But taking $50 \nbillion out of Medicare more than the President--more than the \nPresident--and saying that system can survive is simply not so. As I \nunderstand it, all of the costs would be put on to the hospitals in \nthis particular plan, and hospitals will start closing; we will lose \nemergency rooms and we will be in big trouble. I think our senior \ncitizens deserve better.\n  Republicans cut $18 billion more than the President out of Medicaid. \nI hope to have an amendment to talk about the Medicaid issue. Who is on \nMedicaid? The poor children, the poor families, and two-thirds of our \nsenior citizens in nursing homes are on Medicaid, our grandmothers and \nour grandfathers.\n  What do you suppose is going to happen when you take $18 billion more \nthan the President did out of Medicaid? Nothing good will happen, I can \nassure you. We have already had the scandals in the nursing homes in \nthe 1980's. I do not want to live through that again. We cannot take \nthese kinds of dollars out of Medicare and Medicaid and have a system \nthat functions and a system that works. Then if you do the medical \nsavings accounts on top of that, which is also, as I understand, \nassumed in this budget, the healthiest and the wealthiest will leave a \nlot of our plans, including Medicare, and it is going to make matters \nfar worse when the healthiest and the wealthiest leave the big \ninsurance pool.\n  The earned income tax credit. Republicans cut $12 billion more than \nthe President in the earned income tax credit. What is the earned \nincome tax credit? It is a credit given to those in our community who \nwork very, very hard for very low wages. And the purpose of it is to \nensure that they do not have to go on welfare. And it is really a very \nimportant, very important tax credit for those at the bottom of the \nscale who work so hard and do not want to be on welfare. Yet, the \nearned income tax credit, which was really praised highly by President \nReagan, President Bush, bipartisan, is hurt deeply in the Republican \nbudget.\n  However, there is one area where the Republicans spend more. Guess \nwhat it is? It is the Pentagon. They spend $11 billion more than the \nDepartment of Defense asked for. Let me repeat that. In this budget, if \nyou vote for it, you are voting for $11 billion more than the \nDepartment of Defense, the admirals and the generals, asked for. I do \nnot get it. I do not get it.\n\n  We have the strongest military in the world, and we should keep it \nthat way. We spend more than any other nation. I am going to tell you \nexactly what we spend compared to other countries.\n  Here is a chart that shows that the U.S. military budget spends more \nthan the next five countries combined. I want to thank Senator Simon \nfor sharing this chart with me. He had used it\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\nin the Budget Committee. So here we see the United States, $264 \nbillion; Russia, $98 billion; Japan, $54 billion; France, $41 billion; \nthe United Kingdom, $35 billion; and Germany, $34 billion.\n  Let me make a point. Let us just say for purposes of this that Russia \nis not our friend. Of course, the cold war is over and she would like \nto join NATO. But for the purposes of this conversation, let us say \nRussia was not our friend, because there are elections coming up and we \nare nervous about it, I understand. All the other countries--Japan, \nFrance, the United Kingdom, and Germany--are our very close allies. So \nif you take what America spends, and you add what our best friends \nspend, I mean, we are up there in the stratosphere. We do not have to \nlose sleep at night about the size of our military budget.\n  And the fact of the matter is, the kinds of threats we now face are \nvery different than the threats that we faced in the height of the cold \nwar, when we worried about intercontinental ballistic missiles and we \nworried about nuclear weapons. Thank goodness times have changed. Are \nthey risky times? Yes. Are they dangerous times? Yes. We can never not \nbe vigilant. But the threats are different. And the costs should \nreflect the different types of threat.\n  We are far more threatened by terrorism, for example, than we are \nfrom an intercontinental ballistic missile. And you need different \nthings to prepare for that than you do that type of a star wars threat \nthat we used to feel in the cold war days. So with all of this \ninformation, the Republican budget adds yet another $11 billion.\n  I want to hearken back to what Dwight Eisenhower said, general and \nPresident, a Republican. He said, it is very important to educate our \nchildren; that the defense of our Nation is not only in the size of its \narsenal, but how educated our children are. He is the one who brought \nto the Congress in the 1950's the National Defense Education Act. He \ncalled it the National Defense Education Act because he knew, if we are \ngoing to be strong, if we are to defend America and its principles and \nits democracy, it takes an intelligent country and it takes young \npeople who are ready to learn.\n\n  I will tie that into a conversation I had with the entrepreneurs in \nthe Silicon Valley. I am so proud to represent them here in the U.S. \nSenate. When I went to see them when I was running for the Senate back \nin 1992, I said, ``Tell me the one thing I could do for you if I become \nyour Senator.'' I fully expected them to say something like, ``Well, \ncut our taxes.'' They did not say that. They said, ``If you become our \nSenator, get us an educated work force. Get us an educated work \nforce.'' Today they are hiring foreign workers because they are not \ngetting the skills here that they need. The answer lies in this budget.\n  That is why this debate is so exciting and so important. It can sound \na little boring when you talk about technical terms such as ``real \nfreezes'' and ``hard freezes'' and all the rest and technical \nassumptions, ``CBO'' and ``OMB,'' and all the things we talk about in \nour budget meetings.\n  But behind all those words is reality. The reality is, what do we \nbelieve in? What do we believe will make us great? If we can, in our \nbudget, invest in those things that will make us great, in the context \nof a balanced budget, because we need to do that--we need to do that. \nWe are wasting so much on interest payments on the debt. We have to get \na handle on that. And we do in both of the budgets before us. The \ndebate can now focus on these differences, these things.\n  So, Mr. President, it is indeed an honor for me to partake in the \ndebate. I want to thank Senator Exon, our Democratic ranking member, \nfor all the hard work that he has done and the staff has done. I want \nto thank the President of the United States for giving us a budget that \nI think we can be very proud to vote for. It is fiscally responsible. \nIt makes the tough and hard choices. It comes to balance, but it does \nit in a way that makes the right investments: Education, environment, \nMedicare, Medicaid, the earned income tax credit, and a sensible number \nfor defense.\n  You put that altogether, and I think you have a pretty good roadmap \ninto the next century, one in which America will truly be the economic \nleader of the world, and also the moral leader of the world.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Budget \nCommittee in strong support of the 1997 balanced budget resolution. I \nwant to commend the diligent work of our chairman on that committee in \nmoving this legislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  As we begin our debate, I hope we will keep our Federal debt in \nperspective. As of today, the Federal Government is $5 trillion in \ndebt, more than $19,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. The \nwhole concept of $1 trillion is so difficult to understand. An analogy \nI use to explain how much a trillion is, I go back to a very simple way \nof thinking about it. That is, if you started a business on the day \nthat Jesus Christ was born, almost 2,000 years ago, and on the day he \nwas born you lost $1 million and you lost $1 million every day since \nthe day he was born--$1 million every day--you still would not have \nlost $1 trillion.\n  We in this country have a $5 trillion debt. Looking at this problem \nfrom another angle, a child born today owes $187,000 just on interest \non the debt over his or her lifetime. We clearly cannot sustain this \ncourse of unrestricted, unrestrained Federal spending. That is why we \nare here today to introduce a balanced budget which will protect those \nchildren and that opportunity for an American dream for those children.\n  It really boils down to the whole concept of long-term thinking. We, \nin this town, too often think in terms of 1 year or 2 years. It is time \nfor all of us to come together and think in terms of that long term. In \nmy own career of medicine, before coming to this body, you do an \noperation to possibly get through a short-term, acute problem, but you \ndo it for the long-term quality of life for that individual. It is this \nlong-term thinking that all of us need to engage, bring to the table in \nthis budget debate.\n  Long-term thinking clearly means reducing spending and reforming \nentitlements, something that is tough to do--and this is a political \nyear--really any year. All of us are dependent on reaching out to the \npublic. Telling the public, broadly, that entitlements, or benefits \nestablished by law and paid to any eligible beneficiary--and we define \nthat the eligibility requirements, regardless of cost, are what are \ndriving this country to higher and higher debt and larger deficits over \ntime --it is the result of the automatic-pilot spending that causes \nentitlements to be the largest and fastest growing portion of our \nFederal budget.\n  On this chart--and it is a familiar chart to many of us on the budget \ncommittee, but it is one that is worth imprinting in our minds because \nit shows the problem that we have, not just in 1996 and 1997, but on \ninto the next century. The chart is very simple. It shows Federal \nspending; that is the height of each of the bars. It starts in 1970 and \ncomes to where we are right now, 1990, then to the year 2000, and on \ninto the next century, the year 2030.\n  The green line is the revenue that comes in to Washington, DC, the \ntaxpayer dollars, the amount of money that is coming in. We can see, \nover time, as a percent of GDP--gross domestic product--that is \nconstant. It has been constant for decades and will be for decades, \nright at 19 or 20 percent of GDP. We can see, of interest, that the \nincome coming in, the revenues, matched in 1970--the last time it \nmatched--Federal spending. Why? We have not had a balanced budget in \nalmost three decades in this country.\n  We can see through the 1980's and the 1990's that the Federal \nspending outpaced the revenues. That is why we have the deficit each \ntime. We add up each of the deficits, and we get the $5 trillion debt. \nIn red are the entitlements. There are basically five entitlements--\nthere are really more than that: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \npensions, and welfare spending.\n  Look at the dramatic increase, historically, over time, to where we \nare today, in the red, in entitlements. They are on autopilot. The \ninterest is the amount of money, the interest on\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\nthe Federal debt. It is the amount of money that we are paying each \nyear we have to pay on the $5 trillion debt that is out there. As the \ndebts increase, the amount of increase over time has increased.\n  In the blue, looking at 1970, we have discretionary spending. \nDiscretionary spending is that spending that is for the sorts of things \nthat we just talked a little bit about earlier. That is our national \nparks, defense of this country, education, roads and infrastructure. \nNotice how, over time, the blue is getting smaller as the red gets \nlarger on autopilot.\n  What is frightening--and the reason why I want to show this chart--is \nwhat happens in 4 years, 10 years, in the year 2000, 2010, and 2020. \nRevenues stay the same and there is a huge growth in overall Federal \nspending. Unless we do something, this is inevitable. This is agreed to \nin a bipartisan way. These are data that are generated by a number of \nsources that, again, both sides of the aisle accept. It is inevitable. \nThe reason it is inevitable in some part is because of our aging \npopulation, because we had a baby boom back 30 years ago now which will \nbe traveling through, which at the year 2010 will hit.\n\n  Now, 2010 sounds a long way away, but in truth it is 14 years away. \nYou can see in the year 2010, 14 years away, that entitlements, in the \nred, and on the debt, in the yellow, consume all Federal revenues in 14 \nyears unless we do something. The last year and a half we have not done \nanything. Unless we do something, we will have no money left over for \nthe discretionary spending. This is education, national parks, \nresearch, science, and defense of this country. That is why we must \ncome together and act in a reasonable way.\n  The growth of mandatory spending we can look at differently to drive \nhome the problems that we have. That is really in this second chart. \nMandatory spending--what we spend if we do nothing--on entitlements and \ninterest on the debt are consuming an increasing portion of our Federal \nbudget pie. This chart, I think, describes that and explains that very \nwell. We have mandatory spending in 1965, overall spending in 1965; \noverall spending in 1995 is shown by the middle pie; and then looking \non into the future. This is our overall budget. The red is \nentitlements; the yellow is interest on the debt; and the discretionary \nspending is in the light blue.\n  Look what happens between 1965 and 1995: Entitlements and interest on \nthe debt in 1965 consumed about one-third of our overall budget; by \n1995, the discretionary spending and the mandatory spending have \nflipped. We can see entitlements and interest on the debt now consume \nalmost two-thirds of the overall budget, with the discretionary \nspending having consumed before two-thirds, now only one-third. We must \nact.\n  Again, why do we need to act today for the long term and not just the \nshort term? Because if we look out again in 14 or 15 years, in the year \n2012, the entire Federal budget will be spent for entitlements and \ninterest on the debt, with absolutely no money left over for defense, \nmedical research, roads, national park, and infrastructure. This is \nwhat happens if we do not act, if we do not act in this body, in a \nbipartisan coming-together, in a reasonable way.\n  Clearly, we face a monumental fiscal crisis if we do nothing. This \n1997 balanced budget resolution, which came out of the Budget \nCommittee, begins to solve this long-term problem by reducing spending \ngrowth and reforming entitlements. Over the next 6 years, our \nresolution will slow spending by $441 billion. More importantly, 85 \npercent of these spending reductions target mandatory programs, those \nautomatic pilot entitlements that are driving us deeper and deeper into \ndebt.\n  Our budget, unlike the President's budget, addresses this problem of \ngrowth in entitlements and interest over time, which ultimately \neliminates discretionary spending. Now, long-term thinking also means \nstrengthening and improving programs that are critical to the health \ncare of our Nation.\n  Of the 400 entitlement programs in the budget, I want to briefly \ncomment on two--Medicare and Medicaid. It is the long-term decisions \nthat we make about these programs that are crucial because it is they \nthat are the fastest growing entitlements, and it is they that provide \nthe critical health care services that over 37 million senior citizens \ndepend upon and over 30 million people below the poverty level. It is a \nlittle disappointing because I have been in this body about a year and \na half to 2 years, and we have made absolutely no headway in saving, \nstrengthening, and simplifying Medicare. Yet, the problem has been laid \nout for us now almost 2 years ago.\n  Politicians all too often have been negligent in telling people the \ntruth about Medicare's really precarious financial situation. Let me \nsay at the outset that, as a physician, I have taken care of thousands \nof Medicare patients personally, day in and day out. It is the world's \nlargest insurance program. It is hugely popular among 37 million \nparticipating Americans. It is giving seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities unprecedented access to the great health care system that \nwe have today. It has prolonged and improved the lives of millions and \nmillions of Americans. Thus, we must work together to strengthen and \nsave this program.\n  The truth is depicted again in this chart, though. This is the \nMedicare hospital trust fund, the so-called part A trust fund. It \nstarted going broke last year. If I were to come into any small \nbusiness and say, ``You are going broke right now,'' what would they \ndo? They would react, go back and develop a strategic plan. They would \nreact on that day. Yet, we sit in this body and have not yet done one \nthing to reverse Medicare going broke in a few short years.\n  This chart shows overall assets of the trust fund in billions of \ndollars. You can see that we were spending more than we were taking in \nbeginning last year. This is 1994. In 1995, we went into the red in the \nMedicare trust fund spending, the actual cash flow going in and out. \nThat deficit spending has increased this year, will increase this year, \nthe year after that, and the year after that. Meanwhile, this trust \nfund is going down, down, and down, where in 4 to 5 years the trust \nfund will be bankrupt.\n\n  I should add that these projections have gotten worse over the last \nyear. Last year, we said it is not going to start going bankrupt for a \nyear and will not really go bankrupt until 2002. Well, over the last 14 \nmonths of doing nothing in the U.S. Congress, Medicare is going \nbankrupt more quickly.\n  This chart shows this whole concept. We sort of looked at cash flow \nin the last part, how much is coming in and going out. If we look at \nactual bankruptcy--I took a chart that we used last year, based on the \nMedicare trustees' report of last April, and updated that chart. This \nchart looks at, in billions of dollars, how much the trust fund has in \nassets. When it gets down to this line, Medicare is actually going \nbankrupt. This is 1985 to 1995. It projects out to the year 2004. The \nline that I used last year, which was in the Medicare trustees' report, \nwas the blue line. From 1985 to 1995, as you can see, the Medicare part \nA trust fund looked better and better and better. However, we saw, \nbeginning last year--not this year, and we saw it on the previous \nchart--we started deficit spending. This is what we projected last \nyear. This is 1995. That is, Medicare would be bankrupt in the year \n2002. I should add, when Medicare goes bankrupt, by law, no hospitals \ncan be paid. So when it goes bankrupt, that means that care will \nactually be denied. That is inevitable, unless we act. Well, last year, \nwe presented a plan to the President of the United States that would \nsave Medicare, would change the course of this line on out into the \nfuture. Yet, it was vetoed by the President. Now we have yet another \nopportunity to salvage, to save and strengthen Medicare.\n  Look what has happened in the course of the last year and a half of \ndoing nothing. That is where I have updated this chart. That is where \nthe red line comes in. Based on the predictions by the Congressional \nBudget Office, we see that Medicare is not going to go bankrupt in the \nyear 2002. But now it is going to be going bankrupt in the year 2000--\nand nothing else has changed--unless we act. In this balanced budget \nresolution, I will show you, shortly, how we will extend these lines \nout and preserve Medicare.\n  Surely, we must save and strengthen and simplify this program. We \nhave to lay aside the politics and focus on protecting those Americans. \nI think of\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nthose thousands of patients who I have taken care of myself, and who \nwere treated for heart disease, lung disease, emphysema, and had lung \ncancers taken out, and who have gone through coronary bypass surgery. \nThose are the people I have seen and the people we have to be \nresponsible to in preserving this program.\n  This chart shows the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund with what \nwe have before us today in this balanced budget resolution, with what \nthe President has proposed and will be talking about later today, and \nwhat we will discuss on this floor today and tomorrow. Under current \nlaw, again, this shows that Medicare will be going bankrupt in the year \n2000 if we do nothing. That is the red line. Well, the President, in \nhis proposal--once you get rid of the gimmicks of moving home health \ncare and part A of the trust fund elsewhere, which is a gimmick--if you \nput that aside, you can see that under the President's proposal, in \ngreen on the chart, the hospital trust fund is extended for 1 year.\n  We have to get away from this short-term thinking and look on into \nthe next century. The baby boom does not even hit until 2008. We have \nto be prepared for the year 2008 and extend solvency for 10 years. That \nis what our balanced budget proposal does. The balanced budget \nproposal--the one we will be debating and discussing--extends the life \nof the part A trust fund, which is the heart of Medicare, out for 10 \nyears. That is an objective that the President said he would like to \nsee out there. It is something I feel strongly about. Remember, out in \nthe year 2006, we are going to have a whole new set of problems we have \nto address. In the proposal before us, we extend for 10 years the \nsolvency. The President extends it only for 1 year. If we do nothing, \nit will be going bankrupt in the year 2000.\n  With regard to Medicaid, which is the second area I want to discuss, \nI think we have a historic opportunity to work together to preserve \nwhat has become and needs to be a real safety net for women, children, \nsenior citizens, and our disabled population.\n  Let me, again, say that about 35 percent of the people who I have \ntransplanted hearts into are below the poverty level and benefited by \nhaving Medicaid. So, again, my experience with this whole health care \nissue is pretty real in that 35 percent of all the people I have \ntransplanted benefited by having Medicaid, which served them very well. \nThe problem is that Medicaid, today, takes up 6 percent of total \nFederal spending and about one-fifth of State spending. Unless we act, \nwe will see about a 155-percent increase in just 10 years.\n  This increase in Medicaid spending, if you look at it just from last \nyear to this year, is more than we spent in whole on mass transit, on \nall criminal investigations, on pollution control and abatement, and on \nthe National Science Foundation. That is just how much the increase has \nbeen. Unfortunately, Medicaid, with this inexorable growth, is \nbankrupting our State budgets, who have Medicaid being the largest \nsingle entity in the States' budgets, driving out spending on other \nvery useful causes, like police, crime, and education.\n  Let me say at the outset that nothing in our balanced budget \nresolution constitutes a cut in Medicaid--absolutely nothing.\n  President Clinton and Republicans both attempted to rein in growth \nand spending and protect the eligible population. The differences are \ngoing to be hammered out in the committee. But let me just say what we \nstarted with.\n  We started with the bipartisan cooperation in working with the \nNation's Governors, 48 of whom got together and passed out unanimously \na proposal that we agree with. Their plan was designed to protect all \ncurrent law eligibles and included in the umbrella a fund for \nemergencies.\n  To preserve the important safety net which must be there, Medicaid \nspending under our plan, our proposal, will increase 25 percent over \nthe next 6 years. There are $54 billion more in our bill than in last \nyear's budget resolution. It is not a cut. The program will continue to \ngrow at a rate of about 6.5 percent under our proposal, which is \nimportant--two times the rate of inflation--and it will grow a total of \n46 percent from 1996 to the year 2002.\n  Let me also add that as we strengthen Medicare, improve Medicare, and \nsave Medicare for the future, and as we improve, simplify, and \nstrengthen the Medicaid programs, we must also recognize that \nbiomedical research must and will remain a priority for our Nation's \nlong-term health care needs, again going back to the importance of \nthinking long term and not just short term. In this field of biomedical \nresearch, shortsightedness would only yield some quick remedies that \nwould really, I think personally and based on my experience, \npotentially endanger lifesaving breakthroughs from continuing research.\n  The 1997 budget resolution allows us to maintain funding for the NIH, \nthe National Institutes of Health, at the level of funding secured last \nyear and an increase of 8.8 percent, or almost $1 billion, more per \nyear than in last year's budget resolution. Their commitment will help \nto preserve our position as a world leader in biomedical research.\n  Finally, Mr. President, long-term thinking means avoiding budget \ngimmicks. Earlier I spoke very quickly about a gimmick that I find very \ntroubling in the administration's budget of transferring home health \ncare, which is growing at about 17 percent a year, from one part of \nMedicare to another to make us feel better about part A. Medicare is \npart A, the hospital trust fund we have talked about, and part B, which \nis physician services, we focused on a lot over the last year and a \nhalf.\n  Part A, the hospital trust fund, and the data that we just talked \nabout, is the hospital part A trust fund. We cannot solve that problem \nwithout some fundamental reform. What the President has done, \nunfortunately, is take assets out of the part A trust fund, move them \nelsewhere and say, now the trust fund is going to be solved long term. \nIt is just not right. It is just not true. That is a gimmick. We have \nto have fundamental structural reform if we are going to look at the \nlong-term solvency of that part A trust fund.\n  I guess I want to comment lastly on the President's ``spend now, save \nlater,'' proposals for discretionary spending. This chart looks just to \nthe nondefense discretionary outlays, the spending that is out there. \nThe red is the President's plan. The green is the Senate-reported plan \nthat we have on the table now. It is $270 billion in overall spending, \nfiscal year 1996, where we are today, going out to the year 2002 over \nthe next 6 years. The difference in this plan is very clear--increased \nspending in these early years by the President's plan in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending where we have real numbers coming in addressing \nthe problem today, not focusing on just the first 2 years, but the long \nterm.\n  The President has certain trigger proposals which will come into play \nthese last few years, and I think they really defy common sense. The \nAmerican people need to recognize these proposals as gimmicks that are \nantithetical to our efforts to balance the budget. No American family \nor individual would conduct their financial affairs in this manner, and \ntheir Government should not either. The problem is now. Let us address \nthe problem now, not increase spending hoping, hoping, that it will be \naddressed in the future.\n  I look forward to offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the \nfloor that will oppose these discretionary triggers and support \ncommonsense budgeting.\n  Our constituents deserve nothing less than a courageous forward \nthinking leadership here in Washington. All of us know that today they \nwant us to balance the budget. Today they want us to save Medicare from \nbankruptcy, which is inevitable if we do not act. They want us to \nreform Medicaid to return welfare to workfare, to provide tax relief \nwithout resorting to budgetary gimmicks. We do need to transform \nWashington from that 2-year town that looks to the next election to a \n20-year town that looks to the next generation.\n  We can start that today as we get this whole budget discussion \nunderway this morning and in the afternoon, over the next 50 hours, by \neventually passing this 1997 balanced budget resolution.\n  I would like to briefly yield time, if I might, out of my time to \nSenator Grams, my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to the \nremarks and comments of my friend and colleague from Tennessee.\n  Could I see that chart that he just had there about the trust fund \ngoing broke?\n  Mr. President, here is one of the things that I am most concerned \nabout. I think we all recognize that we have a problem, and we all are \ntrying to work together to solve it. I do not think it is particularly \nhelpful for us to show on television charts that scare the devil out of \nthe senior citizens of America.\n  The Medicare fund is not going to go broke. Everybody knows it is not \ngoing to go broke because the Congress, whatever it has to do, is going \nto step in and stop it. The fact of the matter is that while we keep \ncriticizing what the President of the United States has done, as I \ndemonstrated by charts earlier on today--listening to people on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate that have recently come into the Congress, you \nwould think they are the only ones who have any expertise or knowledge \non how to balance the Federal budget--as I showed vividly with charts \nthis morning, it was the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nwho has come on board and at the urging of some of us who have been \nfiscal conservatives for a long, long time and very much concerned \nabout the skyrocketing budget deficits annualized at about $300 \nbillion, Bill Clinton is the one who has reversed that course. For the \nfirst time since man's mind runneth to the contrary, we have seen a \ndramatic turnaround in the annual deficits of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I only say, once again, that all of these things that are being \nthrown around by those on that side of the aisle who fought without a \nsingle Republican vote against the deficit reduction proposal advanced \nby the President of the United States and supported by Democrats was \nthe only time in 30 years that we have had a turnaround in the annual \ndeficits.\n  When I see people talking about the trust fund going broke, \nunfortunately, I feel it is a means of scaring senior citizens. I tell \nthe senior citizens that the fund is not going to go broke. Of all the \ncriticisms that have been made about how bad and how gimmickry the \nPresident of the United States is with his proposal, I cite once again, \nand, if necessary, I will read it once again.\n  Let me repeat what June O'Neill said on May 9, 1996, in a letter to \nme after I made a request for her, June O'Neill, the Republican \nappointee as head of the Congressional Budget Office that we all look \nto as a guiding light today and the umpire, if you will, on disputes \nbetween the political parties. She said, ``Under the law, the trust \nfund is projected to become insolvent by 2002.''\n  So we agree with that part. But when we talk about going busted, that \nis something else--going bankrupt, projected to go bankrupt.\n\n  June O'Neill goes on to say that the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich, I say again, is run by the Republicans--it has a director who \nmakes these decisions after listening to staff that are Republicans--\nJune O'Neill says in that May 9 letter to me, ``The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that the administration's proposal would \npostpone this date,'' or the date when it could be in some trouble, \n``to the year 2005.''\n  I simply say, Mr. President, it is not necessary for us to talk about \nthis going broke and indicate that the Democrats and the President of \nthe United States are doing nothing about it when that is not the case.\n  The Senator complains about backloading, about backloading in the \nPresident's budget. Take a look at the Republican budget. It is like \nthe kettle calling the teapot black. There is little difference with \nregard to the backloading in either the Democratic plan or the \nRepublican plan, and we should be honest about it and not mislead the \nAmerican people. It seems to me you would have to agree that under my \ncalculations, both budgets, both the Democratic budget of the President \nand the Republican budget, achieve exactly the same amount of deficit \nreduction--82 percent of it in the last 3 years.\n  Let me repeat that. You hear this talk about backloading. Backloading \nmeans that you do not make the cuts upfront now. You wait until the 6th \nand 7th year of the budget. So that is after Bill Clinton will have \nfinished his second 4-year term as President of the United States or \nthat is after our good friend, Senator Bob Dole, would finish his first \n4 years as President of the United States. But both are guilty of the \nsame thing. And I wish to lay down the marker now, that when you hear \nabout backloading, it is a plague on both of our houses.\n  Mr. President, 82 percent of the deficit reduction or savings in both \nthe President's plan and the Republican plan is in the last 3 years. So \nI simply say that there is probably little to be gained if you want to \ntalk honestly about who is the worst backloader.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me just very briefly respond because I know we have a \nnumber of colleagues here. I guess the one element that I would like to \nrespond to is the scare tactics, because it has been a fascinating year \nfor me. I have only been here for a year and a half, and I do not have \nall the answers to the budgetary problems that we have today, but if we \nlook at the issue of scare tactics, the numbers that I showed you in \nterms of the chart and Medicare going bankrupt were given to us, given \nto this body, by the Medicare trustees, a bipartisan group, three \nmembers of President Clinton's Cabinet, and that is the chart that \ncomes directly out of their numbers. They tell us that it is an urgent \nproblem; it is going bankrupt--again, bipartisan.\n\n  The numbers that have been released recently are that things are \ngetting worse, that part A--40 percent of the overall Medicare Program \nis part A--is going to be insolvent. We were told in 7 years. Now we \nknow it is going to be 6 years, which, since it has been a year, is \nonly 5 years from now. That is scary. That is scary.\n  But contrast that with the number of things you see on television. \nEvery time I go back to Tennessee they say, ``What are you people \ntrying to do with our budget and Medicare, trying to slow the growth \nfrom 7 percent to 6 percent,'' which is what we were trying to do last \nyear and that is what we are trying to do this year.\n  That scares seniors. That scares seniors. If we do not do anything, \nthat program is going broke. It is gone. The 70-year-old people who \nneed heart surgery, who I operate on, are not going to get it.\n  I have not been around that long, but maybe by the year 2000 they \nwill come in with some huge tax increase or strip back benefits in the \nyear 2000, but that is the only thing that will save the program. \nNothing else will do it because it is inevitable; it is going bankrupt, \npart A, the hospital part of the trust fund.\n  So we have seen a lot of scare tactics out there over the past year \nand a half. Those scare tactics have been on television, paid \nadvertising. They scare every senior citizen. Every person over the age \nof 50 will come up, because they are scared, and say, ``Don't touch \nanything, because what we can see on the television ads, if you reform \nthe system, we are not going to have a health care system at all.''\n  Those are the scare tactics I am afraid of. I have just presented the \nfacts in terms of bankruptcy. I agree with Senator Exon. We need to \nwork together. Clearly, both budgets have their real problems. These \nnumbers came from CBO scoring, that right now, if you look at the \nhospital trust fund--these are CBO numbers, Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, that came from June O'Neill's staff to our staff that have \nbeen released and part of the record we talked about in the \nBudget Committee--it is going bankrupt in 5 years--the red line--if we \ndo nothing.\n\n  Under the President's plan, if you remove the gimmickry of the $55 \nbillion in home health care--it is just moved to the side--CBO said it \nextends the life of the trust fund for 1 year.\n  Our proposal, according to CBO, June O'Neill's group, says we have 10 \nyears in our report. This, again, comes from the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, in business to come before the \nSenate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess today \nfrom the hours of 1:30 to 3:30 and that the time\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nduring recess then be charged equally from the budget resolution. By \nthe way, this does have the approval of the minority side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. There is no objection on this side, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise today with great pride in supporting the budget resolution for \nfiscal year 1997, and I commend the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and my colleagues on the \ncommittee for drafting a piece of legislation of which every American \ncan be proud.\n  This bill, more than anything else, is about promises, making \npromises and keeping them. The American people have every reason to be \ncynical about political promises. They hear so many of them, and they \nhear them repeated so often that it is easy to begin to tune them out. \nYet, something resonated with the voters when we went to the people \nback in November of 1994 and we promised that we would take this \ncountry in a better direction if they elected a new majority to \nCongress.\n  Last year we redefined the role of the Federal Government when we \nlaid out a plan for the Nation's future unlike anything that the people \nhave seen over the last 40 years. Up until then, they had always been \ntold that big Government was good Government; that we could keep \nspending as much as we wanted and never get stuck with the bill; that \nWashington knew best.\n  That was nothing more than a fairy tale. Our budget pointed toward a \nmore realistic, more responsible path, and we passed that into law only \nto have it vetoed by a ``pie crust'' President whose promises are \neasily made and easily broken.\n\n  Now the second installment of our balanced budget promise is before \nus and we have a second opportunity to take our case to the people. Our \nbudget recognizes that we do have a responsibility to guarantee our \nchildren a debt-free future and that balancing the budget without \nraising taxes must be a priority of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, it is ironic that we begin debate on the budget \nresolution today, May 15. Each year, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation \ncalculates its tax freedom day, and that is the day on which Americans \nstop working just to pay their State, Federal, and local taxes and \nactually begin keeping their earnings for themselves.\n  Now let us go back to 1925. Tax freedom day arrived on February 6. \nBut this year, Americans had to wait until May 7 before they were \nallowed to keep the first dime of their own money. Mr. President, 1996 \nmarked the latest arrival ever for tax freedom day. In fact, tax \nfreedom day has just jumped ahead an entire week since President \nClinton took office because under Bill Clinton's watch the Government \nis taking more from the paychecks of middle-class Americans than ever \nbefore.\n  Let me repeat that. Despite all the claims you hear about Bill \nClinton doing well with the budget and the deficit, tax freedom day is \na week later under Bill Clinton than ever before because, under the \nwatch of President Bill Clinton, he is taking more money out of the \npockets of American taxpayers than ever before.\n  I also want to make a couple of notes on some of the charges or \nresponses we have heard today from some of our Democratic colleagues, \nand I will just go back to Senator Exon and some of the comments he \nmade, that Congress will step in to save Medicare. Senator Frist of \nTennessee is more of an expert on this than I am, and he has done a \ngood job of laying it out and trying to explain what happens, but we \nknow the President is using smoke and mirrors when he says he is going \nto take $55 billion out of Medicare and move it into the general fund \nso it will make it look like it is solvent. And when Mr. Exon says \nGovernment or Congress will step in to save it, what does he mean? The \nPresident has ignored the issue. How they would step in and save it \nwould be to raise your taxes.\n  Let us not talk about it today, but if we get the opportunity we will \ncome in and we will raise our taxes. Also, about the claims that they \npassed the 1993 budget plan without a single Republican vote, we are \nvery proud of that, that we were not part of raising taxes in 1993.\n  My colleague from California, a few minutes ago, was talking about a \nsmaller Government today under President Clinton than ever before, and \na higher Government level under President Reagan in the 1980's. But I \nthink that is when you take into consideration all military personnel \nas well. The truth is, under this administration we have more \nbureaucrats and more people working in Government outside of the \nmilitary than at any time in history. So they have not shrunk the size \nof the Federal Government. They have shrunk the size of the military in \norder to come up with those numbers.\n  Then lower deficits, the reason we have lower deficits today is \nbecause of higher taxes. They are taking more money from the average \ntaxpayer to offset the increase in spending. Also, we have enjoyed some \nlower interest rates over the last couple of years. But when we are \ntalking about spending, it continues to grow out of control, so we have \nnot reduced the size of the Government, we have not eased the spending \nburden on Americans, especially when you look again at the fact that \ntax freedom day comes 1 week later today than it did 3 years ago.\n  And then the gas tax. I tell you, some just cannot stand to let go of \na tax no matter how small they try to make it look. They are saying the \n4.3 cents is going to go into the pockets of oil companies. That is \ndoubtful. When they reduced the excise tax on air fares, when the \nGovernment tax went off, that was immediately passed on to the consumer \nin a rebate. But no matter what that question might be, we do know one \nthing, the $5 billion in that increased gas taxes come out of the \npockets of taxpayers and it has gone into the pockets of bigger \nGovernment.\n  When we talk about cutting and backloading our budgets, and we are \ncharged we do not do any better than what the President has proposed in \nhis budget--there are some very stark differences. Our budget, over the \nlife of 7 years, begins to trim the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment and we will enjoy compounded savings in the fourth, fifth, \nsixth, and seventh year of our budget. But the President's plan takes \n100 percent of its backloading reductions in the last 2 years, and it \ntakes it directly out of discretionary spending. I do not think there \nis one Member of this Congress who could stand up and tell the mayors \nand Governors of this country and others they are going to make that \ndeep of a cut in the last 2 years. That will not happen.\n  So we do have some differences in how we achieve the balanced budget. \nIt seems they always try to find some good out of a bad situation. On \nthe farm you would call that trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's \near. But the news is more discouraging for taxpayers of Minnesota \nbecause national tax freedom day came and went 8 days ago, but \nMinnesotans do not keep their own dollars until today. That is, 136 \ndays into 1996, because of higher State and local taxes, and the \ndifferences in the Federal tax burden, Minnesota is tied with Wisconsin \nin having the fourth latest tax freedom day in the Nation. Only the \nresidents of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey pay higher taxes \nthan we do in Minnesota. That is nearly 20 weeks, over 800 hours on the \njob, just to pay Uncle Sam.\n  By imposing his record-breaking $255 billion tax increase in 1993, \nagain, President Clinton bears the responsibility for ever-increasing \ntax burdens from singles to families to seniors to job providers. Every \nsegment of society has felt the pinch. Motorists were hit especially \nhard by the President's gas tax increase, which again boosted the cost \nof gasoline by nearly $5 billion every year.\n  So, whatever you call it, the Clinton crunch or the middle-class \nsqueeze, as long as taxes keep rising, the dollars Americans have left \nover to provide for their families will keep falling. It must be the \ngoal of Congress to help Americans earn more money and keep more money \nso they can do more for themselves, their kids, their communities, and \ntheir churches.\n  The budget resolution we begin debating today will go a long way \ntoward ensuring tax freedom day arrives earlier next year for all \nAmericans. Mr. President, its cutting taxes provisions\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\ncould not come at a better time. Government has become a looming \npresence in the lives of the American people. Each year the people are \nasked to turn more responsibilities over to the Federal Government for \nGovernment regulation, for Government support. From the time they get \nup in the morning until they go to bed at night, there are very few \naspects of American daily life that are not touched now by the hand of \ngovernment.\n  So government has been forced to grow just to keep up. Consider that \ngovernment spending at the Federal, State, and local level has jumped \nfrom 12 percent of the national income in 1930 to 42 percent today, and \nthe burden for keeping these ever-ballooning bureaucracies in operation \nhas fallen on the taxpayers, of course, through more and higher taxes.\n  The increase has been dramatic. Between 1934 and 1995, individual \nFederal income taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product rose \n1,114 percent.\n  Today, the typical American family faces a tax burden from all levels \nof government of 38 percent, and most middle-class American families \nare turning more money over to the government than they are spending \nfor their family's food, clothing, shelter, and transportation \ncombined. Families with children are now the lowest after-tax income \ngroup in America, below elderly households, single persons and families \nwithout children.\n  A significant number of families are relying on a second job just to \npull themselves above the poverty line and to meet their annual tax \nobligations. The majority of families who have reached a middle-class \nstandard of living are families with two incomes. They are still trying \nto pursue the American dream, but the ever-increasing tax burden keeps \npushing it out of reach.\n  According to the Gallup organization, 67 percent of the people say \nthey are handing over too much of their own money to the Federal \nGovernment. They might feel differently if they were getting a fair \nreturn on the investment, but Americans see their hard-earned dollars \nbeing wasted by the Federal Government. They look at the services they \nare getting in return and they feel like they have been taken to the \ncleaners.\n  It has always been easy for past Congresses to be generous with \nsomebody else's money. This Congress, however, is no longer willing to \nlet the Government gamble away the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. In \nfact, we are going to keep those dollars out of the Government's hands \nin the first place. The centerpiece of our balanced budget plan is the \n$500 per child tax credit, and I am proud this desperately needed \nprovision remains at the heart of our legislation. The tax credit alone \nwill allow 28 million taxpaying households to keep $23 billion of their \nown money each year.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the tax credit would return $477 \nmillion every year to families who work hard, pay their bills, and \nstruggle every day to care for their children without relying on the \nGovernment.\n  In addition another 3.5 million households nationwide will find the \n$500-per-child tax credit tax liability has eliminated their tax \nliability entirely; 3.5 million households. President Clinton has \npromised a middle-class tax cut of his own, but, again, it is virtually \nnonexistent in his 1997 budget. Let us look at what he calls for.\n  To qualify for the President's version of the child tax credit your \nchild has to be under the age of 13--meaning that just about the time \nyou need that tax relief the most, it would dry up. In addition, it \nwould only be $300 per child for 3 of its 5 years, and then it would be \nabruptly terminated 2 years early. The $122 billion in tax relief \nCongress is offering in our budget resolution is real tax relief. It is \nnot a paper gimmick.\n\n  The second plank of the legislation before us is the promise to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. Every year the Federal Government \nis spending billions and billions more than it takes in. Because of 4 \ndecades of fiscal insanity, the national debt has today eclipsed $5 \ntrillion and continues to rise. Just the interest alone on a debt that \nmassive is accumulating at the rate of $4 million an hour. If our \nnational debt were shared equally among all Americans, each of us would \nhave to pay up $19,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country. \nEvery child born today in the United States of America comes into the \nworld already saddled with a debt of more than $19,000. The share for \nan average family is $75,000.\n  So the first, most important result of a balanced budget would be to \nfree our children and grandchildren from the economic burden they will \ninherit from this generation, a burden they did not ask for and one \nthey certainly do not deserve. Because we have been able to begin \nreining in spending over the past year, our budget reaches balance in 6 \nyears, not 7 as we first proposed a year ago. By contrast, the \nPresident's 1997 budget plan never achieves balance. It achieves an \nannual budget deficit of $84 billion by the year 2002. Our plan \nachieves its goals without dramatic cuts of any kind--except in the \ndeficit.\n  Spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, welfare programs, \nand the earned income tax credit will all continue to grow to meet this \nNation's needs over the 6-year life of our budget.\n  Keeping promises may be considered out of style here in the Nation's \nCapital City, where promises are a dime a dozen among the professional \npoliticians, but back in Minnesota a promise is something a person does \nnot back down on, even if it was made by a politician.\n  With our budget resolution and its meaningful tax relief, its \nprotections to ensure the solvency of the Medicare Program, its reform \nof the welfare system, its commitment to a balanced budget by the year \n2002, this Congress is keeping the promises that we made to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Michigan will withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5025-5", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time, I yield to the Senator from \nMissouri such time as he may need, up to 15 minutes, to speak on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my sincere thanks to the acting floor \nmanager and to the Chair.\n  A comment was made a few minutes ago when I was on the floor that \nmaybe some of the newer Members of the Senate did not really understand \nhow we have to balance the budget in the Federal Government.\n  I am one who is not new around here, and I would like to say that I \nappreciate very much the interest and enthusiasm and commitment brought \nby the acting floor manager, the previous speaker, the Senator from \nMinnesota; the previous acting floor manager, the\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\nSenator from Tennessee; and the occupant of the chair, a junior \ncolleague from Missouri, all of whom have shown great dedication to the \nneed to balance the budget and to come to this body without any \npreconceived notions that the old ways are the only way we can do it.\n  Frankly, we have broken new ground. I do a little bit of sowing of \nseeds, and I know how difficult it is to break new ground. If you have \ntried breaking up sod that has not been broken up before, you realize \nthat is not an easy task. We have benefited a great deal by the fact \nthat we brought in people and we have in this body new Members who \nrepresent their constituents and who believe, as our constituents \noverwhelmingly do, that there is no reason why the old way of spending \nmore and more than the Federal Government takes in is good enough for \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, we have put $5 trillion of debt on the backs of our \nchildren. Each year's deficit, if it is running $100 or $200 billion, \nadds to that debt. The interest rates build up, and our children are \ngoing to be looking at a time when they are working to pay tax dollars \nthat could go almost exclusively to pay interest on the debt that our \ngeneration has run up because we are unable to balance the budget.\n  Today, we are involved in what I consider to be maybe not the most \nexciting but perhaps the most important series of discussions and \ndebates we have had on this floor. How do we get our national budget \nback on track? How do we ensure that continuing deficits do not \nbankrupt the Federal Government, do not allow vital programs, like \nMedicare part A, to go broke and do not ruin the economy by bringing \nback high rates of inflation, stagflation, high unemployment, and \nstagnating wages?\n\n  It is very important that we be clear and that our colleagues and the \npeople we serve understand what we are talking about.\n  My good friend from Nebraska, the ranking member on the Democratic \nside on the Budget Committee, has said that there is little difference \nbetween the numbers in the Senate committee-passed budget and the \nPresident's budget. He gave us the admonition, ``Let's be honest,'' and \nI agree with him. I do not agree on the numbers that he presents, but I \nagree with him on the need to be honest. We both agree on the need for \nthe St. Louis Cardinals to improve their record, but that is for \nanother day's discussion. We do have many things in common, just a \ndifferent set of figures that we are using.\n  What we are working from are two different sets of numbers. I came to \nthis floor yesterday with the very simple proposition that numbers do \nnot lie. Or do they? It is the numbers that count. We heard in the 1992 \ncampaign, ``It's the economy, stupid,'' but when you are talking about \nthe budget, it is the numbers that count.\n  The President and his staff and the Office of Management and Budget \nhave given us the numbers to work with. This is the budget supplement; \nthis is the appendix. This has all the numbers the President is \nrecommending. This puts forward the President's priorities. They are \ndifferent from the priorities that have been included in the numbers in \nthe budget passed by the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Even though some may say they are close, I think there are very \nsignificant differences. That is why we have these debates. We do have \nan independent scorekeeper to keep us honest. I well remember President \nClinton's stirring call in 1993 at the State of the Union Message that \nwe needed to find a way that we could agree on what our proposals did, \nand he said we should use the Congressional Budget Office as the \nindependent, objective professional scorekeeper, and that is what we \nhave done. In the budget proposal passed out of the Budget Committee \nunder the direction of Chairman Domenici, we have produced a budget \nthat reaches balance, according to CBO, in the year 2002.\n  The President sent us initially a budget which he obviously was not \nsure whether it was going to get to balance, because in his budget \nmessage, he included some fail-safe mechanisms. There is nothing wrong \nwith fail-safe mechanisms, but when it comes to the point that you have \nto use these fail-safe mechanisms, it is important to recognize what \nthey do.\n\n  In this book, ``Budget Supplement: A Vision for the Future,'' page \n13, it says:\n\n       In case the new assumptions produce a deficit in 2002, the \n     President's budget proposes an immediate adjustment to the \n     annual limits or caps on discretionary spending, lowering \n     them enough to reach balance in 2002. The President is \n     committed not only to proposing a budget that reaches balance \n     according to CBO, but reaching an agreement with Congress to \n     enact such a budget.\n\n  I think that is very forthright and that is good. The problem is that \nthe numbers presented by the President to CBO do not really reach a \nbalance in the year 2002. There are almost $77 billion in cuts or \nincreases in revenue that have to be made in the final years to get to \na balance.\n  So the CBO, in scoring the President's budget, has assumed what the \nPresident put into his budget, and that is, he will put a tax increase \nfor families in it, as well as a $53 billion cut in discretionary \nspending outlays in the years 2001 and 2002.\n  Let us be very clear about it. The President's budget has said, if \nCBO does not score us as reaching balance, then here are the automatic \nsteps that must be taken to get to balance. CBO found, in fact, the \nbudget did not get to balance; therefore, CBO said, we will impose the \ncuts he proposed as an automatic offset to the deficit. That, Mr. \nPresident, is what we need to talk about.\n  Some of my colleagues earlier today on the other side have presented \nbudget charts showing the spending initially proposed by the President. \nIt does not look like much difference. But those are not the charts \nthat reflect what happens when the CBO performs its duty under the \nPresident's budget to cut spending to bring it to a deficit of zero in \n2002.\n  I remind my colleagues on this side and the other side that if we are \ntalking about the President's budget, any time a colleague puts up a \nbudget showing the President's number, if I am on the floor, I will ask \nif that budget reflects the CBO cuts as directed by the President in \nhis budget message. For those of my colleagues who may be here, I \ninvite them to do the same thing, because I think it is very, very \nimportant that we talk about apples and apples. If we are going to get \nto a balanced budget as the President says, then how we get there is \nthe vitally important number that we have to consider as we go forth \nand vote on these competing proposals for the budget for the next 6 \nyears.\n  These are the numbers the President has proposed. These are the \nnumbers in these books. Mr. President, unless and until he sends up to \nthis body and to the House another set of books and releases them to \nthe press to say that they have come up with a new budget, then this is \nthe budget we have to work with. These are the figures that he has \npresented to us.\n  Let me take my colleagues through a description of some of the things \nwhat the Clinton budget, as scored by CBO, would actually do and see \nhow it measures up to some of the claims that are made for it in the \ntext.\n  In the description of the budget plan, a little book called, ``A \nCitizen's Guide to the Federal Budget,'' this book says, ``The \nPresident's 1997 budget would reach balance over the next 7 years by \ncutting unnecessary and lower priority spending.'' Remember that; \n``lower priority spending'' is going to be cut.\n  It goes on to say, at the bottom of page 31, or down in the lower \npart of it:\n\n       The budget saves $297 billion in discretionary spending, \n     cutting unnecessary and lower priority spending, \n     but investing in education and training, the environment, \n     science and technology, law enforcement and other \n     priorities that will raise living standards and improve \n     the quality of American life.\n\n  Mr. President, I also serve as chairman of the Senate appropriations \nsubcommittee dealing with a number of these important areas. I think it \nmight be well to take a look at some of these more interesting areas \nand also some of the areas funded in other budgets which are handled by \nother subcommittees on which I serve.\n  Let us start off with the Food and Drug Administration. It is vitally \nimportant for ensuring safety in the food supply and drugs. This green \nline across the top shows what the Senate Budget Committee reported \nout. Essentially that is a flat line. That is tough. That is holding \ntheir feet to the fire.\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\n That is making them absorb inflationary increases, additional \nworkload. That is tough, but that is doable.\n  But take a look at what happens to this spending when CBO implements \nits cuts. It drops from over $850 million down to just below $700 \nmillion, just above $650 million, by the year 2000. This is, I would \nsay, about a 30 percent cut in the Food and Drug Administration. That \nis 25 percent. This is in the body that is supposed to keep our food \nsupply safe and make sure we get good quality, reliable, efficacious \ndrugs. That is something I challenge. Can we afford to cut the FDA that \nmuch? I do not think so.\n  Let us take another one. This one is very important. We are talking \nabout the research that is done to deal with diseases and promoting \ncures for many of the diseases we have and the things that are of great \nconcern to many people--the National Institutes of Health.\n  The President starts off with a nice little increase, but you can see \nby the year 2000, that has to fall off the table. That is almost a $2 \nbillion cut in the budget of NIH to reach balance by the year 2002. \nOverall it is a 14 percent cut. Are we not going to need the research \ndone by the National Institutes of Health in the year 2001 and 2002? I \nthink we will. I am optimistic that we are going to discover cures. But \nI do not think we are going to make all the progress we can possibly \nmake and then be able to shut down research at NIH. So I question the \npriority of slashing the NIH budget.\n  How about some of the other priorities? I have a responsibility for \nacting on, in our appropriations subcommittee, the budget for EPA. You \nall heard a great deal about the President and his support for EPA. Who \nwould have believed just a few months ago that the President's budget \nwould leave EPA with less money 6 years from now than it got from \nCongress last year, and well below the budget proposal we are \npresenting this year? As I have said many times over, numbers do not \nlie.\n\n  This is what happens to funding under our Senate-passed budget \nresolution. We hold EPA at a flat line. We want to work to improve the \nway that EPA does its business. We think that there are new ideas that \nare being developed both within EPA and by groups supporting EPA that \ncan give us tremendous progress as we shift more responsibilities to \nState and local governments and maintain a vitally important monitoring \nfunction at the national level and using more flexible means of \nachieving goals.\n  The President said it well in his budget: ``If industry can come up \nwith a better way, a cheaper way of doing it, let's do it the most \neffective way.'' We can live with it. But take a look at what happens \nto the President's budget under the numbers presented by the President \nand as scored by CBO. This EPA budget takes a very sharp drop from just \nabove $7.2 billion to below $6.4 billion by the year 2002.\n  This is a tremendous slash for the environment. He said, I thought, \nin his message in here that one of his priorities is making sure we \ntake care of the environment. I do not think his budget does that. He \nsays, ``We need to invest in education, training, the environment, \nscience and technology.'' I think our budget does a lot better job of \ndoing that than his does.\n  Oh, yeah, by the way, science and technology. Our subcommittee also \nfinances the National Science Foundation. We provide funding for it. \nLook what happens to the funding in the National Science Foundation. \nThe Senate budget includes a slow but steady upward path. The \nPresident's budget gives us a little bump up here and then it drops off \nthe table again because it has to. The President himself ordered that \ncuts be made to bring the budget in balance in the year 2002. Under CBO \nscoring that is the only way it is going to get to balance.\n  Finally, I addressed yesterday the budget of the Veterans' \nAdministration, the agency which provides care to the medically \nindigent veterans and those veterans who have been injured in the \nservice of their country, a very, very important group of people who \ndepend solely on the Veterans' Administration.\n  These people would see the money devoted to their health care cut by \nalmost 25 percent. The Clinton budget cuts $12.9 billion out of the VA \nbudget by the year 2002. We maintain essentially level funding. That is \na cut that the veterans of this country cannot live with, and we in \ngood conscience cannot live with.\n\n  I mentioned to this body yesterday that the President's people have \nsaid, ``Don't believe these numbers.'' The Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration, Jesse Brown, when he testified before my subcommittee, \nsaid, ``The President has assured me that these will not be the \nnumbers. He is going to negotiate with us.'' A representative of the \nWhite House Office of Management and Budget was quoted in the papers in \nour home State saying these numbers that are being presented, we are \nmisrepresenting, because we took the numbers out of the book and out of \nthe CBO. He said, ``Those are just rough general guidelines. Don't \nbelieve them.''\n  So it is the official policy of the administration not to believe the \nofficial policy. Until they send us up new numbers, send us a new \nbudget, that is what we have to work with. That is what the priorities \nare: Cutting veterans, cutting national science, EPA, NIH.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way to get to the balanced budget we \nneed. We can do so by following the plan outlined by Chairman Domenici. \nI urge all my colleagues to look at the contrasting numbers and make up \ntheir mind. I hope they will support the budget supported by the Senate \nBudget Committee.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I just watched Senator Dole make his \nannouncement. I want to join with Senator Daschle in his comments. I \nhave worked with Bob Dole from my days in the House and have come to \nhave great respect for the huge contribution he has made here in the \nSenate and to our country. I think sometimes we get so partisan here \nthat we forget the contributions that people are making.\n  Let me add one other thing, because media coverage is so negative all \nthe\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\ntime on candidates and officeholders that I think one thing is ignored, \nwhich is that we have a good choice between two outstanding candidates \nfor President in Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. For philosophical reasons, \nbecause of who might be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and that \ntype of thing, I am supporting Bill Clinton. But I am not going to buy \na one-way ticket to Canada if Bob Dole gets elected. I think the \nAmerican people have a choice between two very fine, substantial \ncandidates. That is the way our system should work.\n  In all the negatives that people will hear between now and November \n5, the American people should not lose sight of that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield whatever time is needed off of our \ntime to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nchairman of the committee and of the ranking member of the committee. I \njust want to say at the outset what an outstanding job I think the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, has done with \nrespect to the budget that we are now considering. I was privileged to \nbe very supportive of his position in the committee, and continue to be \nso. I want to thank him for the leadership that he provided on our side \nof the aisle.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take just a moment or two to sound what may \nbe an alarm bell in the night and take what is perceived as not the \nmost popular position. But I want to talk a little bit about the 150 \naccount--that is the international affairs account in this budget--and \nto simply sound a warning that I think we have been reducing that 150 \naccount in successive years in such a way that we are now impeding upon \nour ability to perform as a great power in the world.\n  The budget that is before us and that has been brought out of \ncommittee would cut the international affairs portion of the budget by \nmore than $1 billion from the President's request. The President \nrequested $19.2 billion, and the bill reported from the committee cuts \nit to $18.1 billion.\n  The actual international affairs spending in this particular account \nin the budget, which covers all of our responsibilities abroad other \nthan the military, was $20.8 billion in fiscal year 1994, and $20.1 \nbillion in fiscal year 1995. It is estimated at $18.5 billion for \nfiscal year 1996. So we are making a very significant cut from \nhistorical levels.\n  In other words, international affairs spending has been brought down \nfrom $20.8 billion in fiscal year 1994 to $18.1 billion in fiscal year \n1997, which is a cut of almost $3 billion just in that short period of \ntime. That represents a cut of about 15 percent in the budget that we \nhave to carry out our responsibilities internationally.\n  In fact, our international affairs budget has been reduced by 50 \npercent in real terms over the last decade. In other words, if you \nadjust for inflation and take a 10-year period, we, in effect, are \ncutting by 50 percent our ability to carry out programs in the \ninternational arena. We are in the process now of asking the \ninternational affairs budget to do more and are providing less with \nwhich it can be done.\n  During the 1980's, we did not have democratic, market-oriented \nregimes in Eastern Europe. At that time we were building nuclear \nweapons instead of trying to help the Russians destroy and dismantle \nthem. We had one Embassy to cover a country, the Soviet Union, where we \nnow have 15 separate countries. At that time neither Jordan nor the \nPalestinians recognized Israel's right to exist, so we had no stake in \ntheir economic vitality. We had economic sanctions against South \nAfrica; now we are trying to help South Africa rebuild. All of these \nare new responsibilities and opportunities over the last few years.\n  So, in fact, our responsibilities increased rather than diminished, \nand particularly if the arena of competition or concern shifts from the \nmilitary into the political and economic arena.\n  Only about 1 percent of the Federal budget is spent on foreign aid, \nand less than half of that goes to humanitarian and development \nprograms. In fact, the United States ranks dead last among 21 \nindustrialized members of the OECD in the percentage of GNP that we \nspend on development assistance. All of these other countries have made \nthe judgment that they have an important interest in helping the rest \nof the world to develop; so much so that they are prepared to commit a \nlarger percentage of their GNP than we are to development assistance.\n  I know these are not popular facts to bring before the country, but I \nthink it is important for those of us who carry the responsibility \nwhich comes with being Members of the U.S. Senate to stop and consider \nit because we have to square the rhetoric about being the world's \nleader with the reality of how that is accomplished.\n  In fact, there is, apparently, a great deal of misconception across \nthe country. A nationwide poll done last January by the University of \nMaryland found that a majority of Americans, when asked what percentage \nof the budget they think is spent on foreign assistance said 15 percent \nor higher. The majority said 15 percent or higher. When they were asked \nhow much they thought should be spent, they said on average about 5 \npercent. In fact, we spend about 1 percent. There is a tremendous \ndisparity in perception. The majority think we spend more than 15 \npercent of our budget for this purpose when we in fact spend about 1 \npercent.\n\n  I am very frank to say to my colleagues that if the United States is \ngoing to continue to be a great power, we have to commit the resources \nto carry out our responsibilities as a great power. This is \nparticularly true in the post-cold-war era, when a range of complex \nproblems faces us. That means coming up with adequate funding for the \nconduct of our foreign affairs. In my view, we have already cut well \nbelow the minimum level that is necessary to sustain American \nleadership in the world.\n  I really want to sound that warning. I am persuaded that over time, \nif this trend continues, it will become obvious to everyone what we \nhave done to ourselves. But I think we need to apply some analysis and \nattention now in order to ascertain that situation, and I am frank to \nsay I think we have crossed the danger point and are now in the zone \nwhere our leadership ability is being eroded and undermined.\n  The various cuts have very detrimental effects on our ability to \nconduct an effective foreign policy. It would be one thing if people \nwere saying we want a little America, something with which I do not \nagree. But if they say we are going to have a little America and we are \ngoing to shrink back from the responsibilities and, therefore, we are \ngoing to shrink resources, that at least would be a consistent \nposition.\n  But to articulate a rhetorical position in terms of America being the \nworld leader and playing the first and foremost role in exercising \ninternational responsibilities, and then have a huge gap between that \nstatement and the resources with which to carry out those \nresponsibilities, is illogical and inconsistent.\n  The United States now is the largest debtor at the United Nations. As \nthe Washington Post put it in a recent editorial, we are the ``global \ndeadbeat.'' We are so far behind in paying our assessments to some of \nthe international financial institutions that our arrearages exceed our \nscheduled annual payments. We are, indeed, exasperating and \ndisappointing our friends and allies who desire and support American \nleadership. They desire and support American leadership. But we \ncontinually dictate ever longer lists of demands and provide ever \nshorter resources with which to carry them out.\n  Aid to the poorest countries has been reduced by nearly 30 percent \nfrom last\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nyear, jeopardizing the progress we have made in reversing environmental \ndegradation, slowing population growth, preventing the spread of deadly \ndisease, building economic self-sufficiency, promoting democracy, \nresolving conflicts peacefully, stemming the flow of illegal drugs and \ncountering the threat of nuclear proliferation. All of these are very \nimportant objectives.\n  Consulates have been closed and embassy staffs reduced all over the \nworld, making it impossible to provide the services that Americans \nabroad expect and deserve. We have closed 30 posts abroad since 1993, \nand 13 more are slated for closure this year.\n  Some of this scrubdown of posts needed to be done. But once again, I \nthink we have gone beyond the point of diminishing returns and we now \nare really eroding our capacity to carry out an effective foreign \npolicy.\n  While some question the importance of ambassadors and embassies in an \nera of CNN, supersonic travel, and instant global communication, I \nthink this skepticism is misplaced. We need to have our ambassadors and \ntheir embassy teams on the ground, around the globe promoting human \nrights, conflict resolution, antiterrorism and counter- narcotics \ncooperation, U.S. economic interests and U.S. exports, for example. \nMany of the embassies have significantly improved their performance by \nworking with the American business community in a very significant and \nsubstantial way.\n  We need consular officers to assist U.S. visitors and business \npeople, to issue visas, replace lost passports and cut through redtape \nwhen Americans run into difficulties abroad. We need them to spread \ngood will, to exemplify American values and to deal with sensitive \nsituations before they become full-blown emergencies. This experienced \ncorps of professionals is the face of our Nation around the world.\n  Yet our diplomatic service is forced to rely on computer software, \noffice equipment, buildings and services that are outmoded, unreliable, \ninefficient, and sometimes even unsafe. Diplomacy in the 1990's is \nbeing carried out on the technology of the 1960's and 1970's, and no \nrelief is in sight.\n  These cuts are particularly troubling when juxtaposed to very large, \nunrequested increases in defense spending. The budget adds almost as \nmuch for defense, over and above the amount the Pentagon asked for, \nthan is spent on the entire foreign aid budget for a year. In other \nwords, we are cutting substantially the 150 account, our diplomacy \naccount, our political and economic interest account, at the same time \nthat we are increasing the military account over and above what the \nPentagon sought.\n  It seems to me a matter of common sense that by investing a little \nbit in preventive diplomacy you may be able to address situations while \nthey are amenable to economic and political solutions rather than wait \nuntil they become full-blown crises and require the presence of our \nmilitary. By sacrificing investment in preventive political and \neconomic measures, we will only be postponing and probably escalating \nthe ultimate costs.\n  Of course, effective diplomacy is enhanced by a strong military and \nthe readiness to apply it, but our military strength ought not to \nbecome our prime recourse for influencing situations in the \ninternational arena. In fact, I think the task of the next century will \nbe to hone our diplomatic, economic, and political skills so that we \ncan protect our interests without having to put our troops in harm's \nway.\n  It is increasingly clear that in the 21st century American interests \nin the world will be heavily economic and political. We need to ensure \nopen markets and fair trade to promote American prosperity. We need to \navert conflicts that will cause human suffering, refugee flows, \nenvironmental destruction, and economic dislocation. We must combat \ninternational terrorism and prevent the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  None of these goals can be achieved on a unilateral basis. None of \nthem can be undertaken by military action alone. And none of them can \nbe achieved without sufficient resources. The 150 account is important \nto meeting our responsibilities as a world leader. By not allocating \nadequate resources, we may indeed encounter disastrous consequences. \nFurther cuts are not just ill-conceived; they are downright dangerous \nto our national security and to achieving American objectives around \nthe world.\n  I urge my colleagues, although I know it runs against a perception of \npopular sentiment, to examine carefully what we are doing to our \nability as a nation to carry out our responsibilities as a world \nleader. It cannot be done if we do not commit the resources with which \nto do it. And we now have reached the point where I think we have so \ndrastically reduced our commitment in this area that we are markedly \naffecting our ability to act as a world leader.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished \nranking member for yielding me time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator want to speak at this point?\n  Mr. EXON. No. I was just going to try and get embodied in an \nagreement what we had arranged for. The Senator from Delaware would \nlike 3 or 4 minutes on another subject. I would like time likewise. \nThen we had general agreement that we would go to Senator Grassley with \nhis amendment. We have all agreed to that, and I would just like to \nsuggest it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Delaware wanted to 2 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. OK. I will follow the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the news by our esteemed majority leader \nthat he will be resigning both his leadership post and his Senate seat \nis, indeed, bittersweet. I am sure I speak for all of my colleagues \nwhen I say that the Senate will miss Bob Dole--his intelligence, his \ncourage, his love for his country, and his unparalleled leadership \nskills. In Europe, 50 years ago, as a young lieutenant, Bob Dole was \nwilling to make the ultimate sacrifice for his country in war. And \ntoday for the sake of his country and the Congress, Bob Dole is willing \nto leave the job he loves because he loves his country and Congress so \nmuch. This is a bold move by a man whose life has been the ultimate \nstory of courage. America needs his courage, his moral compass, his \nleadership in the White House, and this move will enable him to focus \nmuch more on the road to the White House.\n  Because of Bob Dole's leadership, the 104th Congress will be \nremembered as the Congress which finally said enough is enough. No more \nexcuses. No more Washington gimmicks. Balance the budget. With Bob \nDole's leadership we have forever altered the debate. The question is \nno longer whether to balance the budget, but how; not whether to cut \ntaxes, but how; not whether to reduce the size of the Federal \nbureaucracy, but how; not whether to reform welfare, but how; and not \nwhether to return power to the States, but instead how.\n  Under Bob Dole's leadership, the Congress for the first time in four \ndecades passed legislation to balance the Federal budget. Bob Dole's \nlegacy of leadership in the Senate will only be surpassed by what he \nwill do for America from the White House. I am proud to be a Member of \nthe Dole team, and I will be even prouder to assist a Dole \nadministration next year in carrying out Bob Dole's agenda for America: \nlower, fairer, simpler taxes, less Government and a balanced budget.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, my few remarks about my friend Bob Dole and \nhis announcement today will be devoid of any political motivations \nwhatsoever.\n  Bob Dole has been a friend of mine ever since I came into the Senate. \nWe have differed frequently on many issues, but we have been together \non many issues. The announcement today that we heard about this morning \ncame as a considerable shock to this Senator because whatever the \nfuture holds, the Senate in my view has lost a tremendously dedicated \nindividual, a talented leader on the Republican side of the aisle, a \nman I never hesitated a moment in going to on any subject. He\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nhas always been fair to this Senator. We have clashed from time to time \non issues. But fairness and confidence and being a very capable Senator \nand a Senate leader has been the hallmark of Bob Dole.\n  I simply say that we will miss him very much in the U.S. Senate, and \nI would have preferred that he not take the additional step that he \nannounced today with regard to resigning from the Senate. I recognize \nthat in running for President of the United States, it was most \ndifficult to be here, to be a leader. However, I thought the \nannouncement that I read in the papers this morning with regard to \nSenator Dole, recognizing that he could not do justice to his \nPresidential race and be a full-time leader of the Senate and the \nsuggestion that he turn this over to other Members of the Republican \nmajority, seemed to make sense to me. But, for whatever reason, Bob \nDole has made the decision that I think he had to make. I only thank \nhim for the friendship.\n  I will value the few remaining weeks, week or two or three, that I \nwill have the privilege of serving together with him in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want Senator Grassley to think \nwe are procrastinating and trying to put his amendment off. He is going \nto have to be absent for just a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will use just a few minutes here as in morning \nbusiness. I ask my remarks be as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5048-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE RESIGNATION OF BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the last 3 or 4 hours have been a time \nof very mixed emotions for many of us. A while ago when we were \ncrammed, all of us Republican Senators, in Bob Dole's office, when he \ntold us of his desires and wishes, I can say that was a room where \ngrown men, more than one, had a few tears in their eyes, including our \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  I, for one, will miss him very, very much here in the Senate. But I \nthink when we finally take stock of the U.S. Senate--we are now 208 \nyears old, but if we were to take stock, now, of the 208 years of the \nU.S. Senate, looking for the giants of the Senate, I am not the least \nbit reluctant to say that whatever short list one chooses as part of \nhistory, Bob Dole will be among the giants and the real leaders of the \nU.S. Senate. There is no doubt in my mind, if you take just the last \n100 years, that Bob Dole would once again show up in the top three, \nfour, five U.S. Senators of this entire modern century.\n  So, obviously, you cannot take somebody like that out of here and not \nhave a big void. We will clearly miss his leadership and his marvelous \nability to tell funny stories and get us off guard and get things done. \nBut essentially his life has been one of real sacrifice for the \ncountry. Most Americans do not know that. They have to find out.\n  Bob Dole dedicated weeks and months and years to getting his body in \nthe position where he could conduct business and be a Senator after his \ntragic World War II accident on the front lines. In that, he learned \nabout determination and about fortitude and about strength, and how \nmuch strength he really had. He has been giving since then, giving and \ngiving and giving--not to the Senate, but to the American people. And, \nsince he has made the decision that he wants to be President, I, this \nSenator, wholeheartedly support what he has chosen to do. I hope it is \neverything he plans it to be, and I think it will be.\n  He will go to the American people not as the majority leader or \nSenator, but as a man from Kansas who has sacrificed more than once for \nthis country and will try to do it one more time. I have nothing but \ngreat admiration and respect.\n  My comments to him today are: The very best to you, Bob Dole. \nHopefully, this decision will take you to the White House. If it does, \nit will be the greatest decision you ever made, and a great decision \nfor America.\n  But, indeed, there is no question the American people are going to \nget to find out who Bob Dole is and what he is all about. And if that \nis done, it will be a fair election. For if he cannot do that, if the \npeople do not get to know him as he is, it will not be a fair election, \nnot one where he will have the right kind of chance to be President.\n  So those are my few remarks for today. In time I will say more about \nhim, recalling some of the things we have done together.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Grassley for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5049-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5049-S5070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, could I pose a question now so we could \nestablish this? This is the first amendment that is being offered. Do \nwe have time agreements on amendments?\n  I remember in the opening remarks, the chairman of the committee \nindicated some time limits on the amendments. For the information of \nthis Senator and the Senate as a whole, will the Chair please indicate \nhow much time is allotted to the amendment, the first degree? I assume \nthat timeframe would continue unless we get unanimous consent at some \nfuture time to change it. What is the agreement on time limits?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Budget Act, there are 2 hours equally \ndivided on first-degree amendments, 1 hour equally divided on second-\ndegree amendments.\n  Mr. EXON. So there are 2 hours, and 1 hour, half an hour a side, on \nany amendments to it. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Second-degree. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $8,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $2,300,000,000.\n       On page 8, line 3, decrease the amount by $8,300,000,000.\n       On page 8, line 4, decrease the amount by $2,300,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 11, decrease the amount by $8,300,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 12, decrease the amount by $2,300,000,000.\n       On page 59, at the end of line 2, insert ``This section \n     shall not apply to defense discretionary budget authority and \n     budget outlays caps for fiscal year 1997.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 15 minutes, Mr. President, off of my \ntime.\n  For those on the Budget Committee, this amendment attempts to do \nalmost exactly what I did in the Budget Committee, somewhat lower \nnumbers, but also the numbers are not fenced in the truest sense of the \nword because, under the budget resolution, that would be subject to a \npoint of order, and we wanted to make sure the amendment was germane.\n  So to the Budget Committee members, we are still trying to reduce the \ndeficit by the amount we are saving on defense. For the rest of the \nSenate, I want to say my approach is the same, the same goal, lower \nnumbers. We are\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nspeaking about reducing the defense numbers, and we are speaking about \nreducing the deficit when we save money on defense. The exception to \nthat would be the President of the United States capability of \ndeclaring that he needs more money for defense and having that be \nconsidered, in an emergency, and not having to have offsetting numbers.\n  It strikes a balance, I believe, between administration proposals for \ndefense spending and that proposed in the budget resolution.\n  The amendment would reduce the budget authority for defense for \nfiscal year 1997 by $8.3 billion below the budget resolution. Outlays \nfor defense in fiscal year 1997 would be reduced by $2.3 billion. The \nsavings are earmarked for deficit reduction.\n  Some of my friends might be concerned that down the road, we will \nneed more funds for national security. In that case, this amendment \nallows the President to propose emergency spending for defense without \nrequiring offsets.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this amendment as my main cosponsor by \nSenator Exon, a member of the Armed Services Committee and ranking \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee, as well as Senators Kohl, Kerry, \nFeingold, and my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. I should note \nthis amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, one of the \ntop deficit hawk groups in Washington, DC, and I ask unanimous consent \nto print that letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for contacting the \n     National Taxpayers Union (NTU) regarding the amendment you \n     plan to offer to the FY 1997 Budget Resolution in an effort \n     to control defense spending.\n       Your amendment would ``fence'' $11.3 billion in budget \n     authority and $2.9 billion in outlays (the difference between \n     the President's proposal and the Committee's mark for FY \n     1997), making the additional funding contingent upon the \n     President's certification that the funds are necessary for \n     national security. If the President fails to make that \n     certification the funds would be used to reduce the deficit.\n       America's taxpayers deserve a more fiscally responsible and \n     cost effective federal government, as well as the lower taxes \n     that should result from spending reductions.\n       Your legislation will be helpful in that regard, and \n     therefore NTU is pleased to endorse it and urge your \n     colleagues to support it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Al Cors, Jr.,\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just so everyone understands the history \nbehind this amendment, let me call your attention to this chart. I want \nto call your attention to this chart because with the budget authority \nside of the chart, it lays out the history of where we are and where \nbudget resolutions take us and where the President is.\n  Last year, the Senate budget resolution proposed that in fiscal year \n1997, we should have this figure of $253.4 billion. What is important \nand significant about what we did last year and this year is that we \nhad 60 Senators on a very bipartisan vote last year reject an amendment \nthat would have increased the dollar amount of $253.4 billion, a \nbipartisan vote in the Senate not to go above $253.4 billion.\n  Now we have this budget resolution which has disregarded the Senate's \naction last year and disregarded last year's vote, practically the same \nmembership in this body, and has proposed $265.6 billion for defense. \nThat is the number in the resolution that is before us, $265.6 billion.\n  Simple arithmetic. That is $11.3 billion more than the President's \nmark. The President's mark is this middle figure. What he proposed to \nus in his budget this February, $254.3 billion. You can see the \ndifference, $11 billion; $11.3 billion, to be exact.\n  It is also $12.2 billion more than the level voted by 60 Members of \nthis body last year.\n  What the amendment offered by this Senator and my colleagues would do \nis provide a compromise by allowing defense to increase $3 billion \nabove the President's mark and nearly $4 billion above the level voted \nby the Senate last year. That would be $4 billion above this figure of \n$253.4 billion.\n  So I hope that you realize that we are trying to do a compromise \napproach here, not just one of these take it or leave it, we want \neverything or we don't want anything approach.\n  It is a good compromise, I believe, that will address the concerns of \nthose who want to ensure adequate spending for defense and also ensure \nthat defense spending does not grow out of control.\n  I want to give some background and rationale for this amendment. It \nprobably does not differ from the background and rationale that I would \ngive for similar amendments I have offered over the many years that I \nhave been in the Senate.\n  Every so often, since the 5th century B.C., some bright scholar \nstates the obvious. The most recognized statement was by philosopher \nGeorge Santayana when he said, and we have all heard it so many times:\n\n       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \n     it.\n\n  He goes on to say some very crucial and insightful things about \nlearning from our experience. He says:\n\n       Progress . . . depends on retentiveness . . . [W]hen \n     experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is \n     perpetual.\n\n  Mr. President, this body, the U.S. Senate, is coming dangerously \nclose to what George Santayana described. We are close to acting like \nchildren. I know that might shock the public. At issue is whether the \nSenate is condemned to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's; specifically, \nwhether we will pump up the defense budget with no justification and \nwith no control over it and, in the process, we would be getting less \ndefense than planned.\n  Last year during conference discussions--that is ironing out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate on the budget resolution--\nwe were promised Defense Department reforms. We were forced to support \nhigher defense numbers, but the quid was that we would get reforms this \nyear. We were told that there would be complete top-to-bottom reform of \nthe Pentagon, so much so that it would change the Pentagon into a \ntriangle.\n  Mr. President, I drive by the Pentagon each night that I go to my \nhouse that I occupy here in Washington--not my home, but my house. My \nhome is in Iowa. Each night since last June 28 when we heard that in \nthat conference--that is when we voted that conference report--I \nwatched and waited. As of last night on my drive home, it is still a \npentagon, it is not a triangle.\n\n  The justification for my amendment is to stop the raping and \npillaging of the Treasury under the guise of national security. There \nis a very sophisticated con job going on with this defense budget, and \nI would like to describe it so that the taxpayers know exactly how it \nworks, how the defense industrial military complex picks their pockets.\n  There are two facets of this con job. The first is bureaucratic; the \nsecond is congressional. Congress collaborates with defense bureaucrats \nin an extortion of the taxpayers who think they are paying for national \nsecurity. Instead, they are paying for pork for Members of Congress.\n  The game the bureaucrats play is the most sophisticated. It took me a \ncouple of years to figure this one out. First, the bureaucrats \ndeliberately underestimate the cost of everything in the budget. That \nway, everything they want gets squeezed in. Nothing gets turned down. \nYou can have it all, just like you can have your cake and eat it, too, \nalmost. ``Just get all the programs approved,'' the bureaucrat says, \n``we'll worry about the money later on.''\n  You see, once a program gets started, programs hardly ever end. You \nmight say they never end. Too many jobs and too many careers are at \nrisk. When the actual bills come in, they say, ``Oops, we've \nunderestimated the costs. By gosh, we've got to do something about \nthat. We need more money to buy all this stuff that we've committed.''\n  That creates then constant pressure to raise the defense budget, but \nit does something else as well: there is not enough money to cover all \nthe cost overruns, so we buy fewer quantities. This drives up the \nprices even further. Over time, because of bad management, we buy less \nfor much more. This hurts our ability to defend our country. That is \nthe bureaucrats' game.\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\n  Here is how it is handled when it gets to the Hill. We saw it last \nyear, and we are seeing it again this year:\n  The Armed Services Committee collaborates with the Budget Committee. \nThey find a nice fat defense number that can accommodate everyone's \ninsatiable appetite for pork. The numbers start to move through the \nBudget Committee. Meanwhile, the Armed Services Committee starts to \ncram all their pet programs into the budget, all the way to the brim. \nThere is even some overflowing, Mr. President.\n  The budget resolution then goes to the Budget Committee; from the \nBudget Committee to the floor. That is where we are today.\n  Some Senators offered amendments to squeeze the defense budget, to \nrid it of pork and waste, just like the Grassley amendment. But such an \namendment is put at a great political disadvantage. The taxpayers are \nunaware of this, but members of leadership and members of the \ncommittees are busy behind the scenes twisting the arms of undecided \nSenators. They confront undecided Senators with a newly drafted defense \nbill crammed in with all the pet programs.\n  The undeciders are told, ``If you vote to squeeze the defense budget, \nas Mr. Grassley wants to do, we'll take program A, B, or C out of the \nbill. Your State will suffer. You'll lose jobs.'' Of course, that is \nintimidation. And some people are intimidated and vote then for fatter \ndefense numbers.\n  What Senator wants to lose potential jobs in his or her State? These \nSenators might be intimidated, but for taxpayers it is extortion. They \nare really getting the shaft. The same thing happened last year. This \nyear the Senate committee wised up and did the same thing as was done \nin the House last year. The bottom line is, bureaucratic and political \ngames are wreaking havoc with the taxpayers' bottom line, all in the \nname of national security. They are conspiring against the taxpayers' \ninterests, pure and simple.\n  I remind my colleagues of the promise accompanying last year's budget \nconference report, with the bloated defense budgets that I pointed out \nhere--$265.6 billion. They said, you will get reforms next year. The \nreforms were supposed to be of infrastructure and base closures. The \nsavings would then be used for modernization. This was the specific \npromise of the Secretary of Defense as well.\n  But we have the General Accounting Office out there, that nonpartisan \ngroup of people that are to make sure that we use honest numbers in \nGovernment. The General Accounting Office just completed a review of \nthe infrastructure savings. The GAO's findings are truly amazing.\n  Despite four rounds of base closures since 1988, there are no \nsavings. And now, despite very dramatic cuts in our force structure, \nthere are no savings. DOD infrastructure costs are going up, not down.\n  On April 25, I spoke about this in detail on this floor, Mr. \nPresident, laying out all the facts. The promise was that we would have \nsavings. The reality, Mr. President--there are no savings. It is not \nthat there were not modest savings, the problem is, it has all been \nspent. It has been spent on new infrastructure projects like public \naffairs and headquarters and, in other words, creating more spin and \nfattening up headquarters. Overhead--that does not come very cheap. It \nsoaked up all of the savings.\n  So as the force structure of our armed services gets smaller and \nsmaller and smaller, headquarters gets bigger and bigger. It is still \nthen a pentagon; it is not a triangle.\n  Once again, Mr. President, the Pentagon is proving that it cannot \nallocate money sensibly. Once again it is proving it cannot save money \neven with such golden opportunities given by base closures. That means \nthat we will not have the money promised for the modernization so that \nwe can meet the needs of our national security in this new budget \nenvironment we are in to balance the budget.\n  The question is, do we reward this bad management with even more \nmoney or do we hold the Department of Defense's feet to the fire? Do we \nsupport the defense budget in this resolution or do we put a meaningful \nconstraint around it so that it will be managed better?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is the essence then of my amendment. It is an \nattempt to better manage the Pentagon's resources, because enough is \nenough. Promised reforms are not the same as real reforms. We shovel \nbillions into the defense budget on the promise of reforms. \nHistorically the reforms have failed to materialize, yet we still throw \ngood money after bad.\n\n  If we fail to learn the lessons of the past, as George Santayana \npreaches to us, ``We're doomed to repeat them ad nauseam.'' If we do \nthat again this year, Mr. President, we will be falling into the \nfamiliar trap once again expressed by the great philosopher Georg \nHegel. He said, ``We learn from history that we learn nothing from \nhistory.''\n  So I urge my colleagues to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. \nI ask them to vote for the bipartisan amendment, the Grassley-Exon \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Iowa \nfor yielding me time. I simply say that there undoubtedly will be \nopposition to this Grassley-Exon amendment. I certainly do not think it \nis proper for me to be managing the time in opposition to an amendment \nthat I am a cosponsor of. So I just alert Senators who are likely \nopposed to this amendment that they should come here, and someone \nshould assume the responsibility for managing the time against the \namendment.\n  First, Mr. President, I am reminded of a couple years ago when the \nDemocrats were the majority party in the Senate. And I teamed up with \nSenator Grassley for an Exon-Grassley amendment at that time that \nproposed to cut $26 billion in outlays and $42 billion in budget \nauthority over a 5-year period. We were working on a 5-year proposition \nthen.\n  Do you remember the wailings at the time? The Secretary of Defense, \nwho is still the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, who is now Director of the CIA, and others, moaned and \ngroaned, and the wailing went on about how Exon-Grassley was \ndevastating our defense budget.\n  Well, they did not have the horses. Exon-Grassley at that time \npassed. And it was a modest step at that time dedicated to reducing the \ndeficit.\n  This year, with the Republicans in the majority in the Senate, I was \nvery pleased when my friend and colleague from the neighboring State of \nIowa came and asked me my advice on this amendment. It is true that \nSenator Grassley offered in the Budget Committee on which I serve an \namendment that eliminated the $11.3 billion increase over the \nPresident's budget. And I supported that in the Budget Committee. And \nit lost on a 12-to-12 vote.\n  When we conferred upon the proper course of action here, we agreed \nthat--I think, and I think a near majority of the U.S. Senate feels, \nthat the amount authorized over the President's budget for defense, \nwhich was $12.9 billion, $12.9 billion, I say, in the Armed Services \nCommittee, and $11.3 billion over the President's budget, as it came \nout of the Budget Committee, is more than we need to spend, because it \nis more than the President requested; it is more than the Pentagon \nrequested; it is more than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has \nrequested. So I simply say that I think that the Grassley amendment, \nand others, this time is in good form and proper taste.\n  I suggested to my friend from Iowa, in our conversation about this, \nthat probably rather than duplicating the effort in the Budget \nCommittee by eliminating all of the $11.3 billion increase, that we \nwould possibly recognize that maybe we would garner some support if we \nwould not cut the whole $11.3 billion, but allow for a modest $3 \nbillion increase to the President's numbers.\n  I have no definite word on this from the White House, but I am quite \nconfident that the President would accept a modest $3 billion increase \nthat we are suggesting over the recommendations that he has made. I do \nnot know whether he would veto the defense authorization bill if faced \nwith an $11.3 billion\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nincrease, which I think may be veto bait. I do not think this slight \nincrease would be veto bait, and I appreciate the fact that the Senator \nagreed and thought that was the right figure to go with.\n  Certainly, I simply say the amendment, in technical terms, reduces \nthe defense numbers in the Republican mark by $8.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $2.3 billion in outlays. This still represents an \nincrease, once again, of $3 billion over the President's budget request \nand the budget authority and $600 million additional in outlays. It \nseems to me this Grassley-Exon amendment has something in it for almost \neveryone because it is the ultimate in reality, I believe, at this \ntime.\n  Let me summarize this amendment, although the Senator from Iowa has \nbasically gone through it. This amendment does two things. First, it \nreduces defense numbers by $8.3 billion in budget authority and $2.3 \nbillion in outlays. Second, it revises the budget resolution language \nthat eliminates designating appropriations as emergency by creating an \nexception for defense. This allows the President and the Congress to \napprove increased defense funding over and above Grassley-Exon by the \nuse of an emergency designation.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa stipulated what this is about. This is \nsimply saying in another fashion that with the $3 billion over and \nabove the defense numbers suggested by the President and the Pentagon, \nthere is a means in the case of an emergency, if that should occur, for \nthe President and the Congress to go up to the $11 billion figure, if \nsuch an emergency occurs.\n  Is that the right interpretation of this, I ask the Senator from \nIowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. The Republican defense budget for 1997 is excessive in a \ntime when we are desperately trying and seeking to balance the budget.\n  This amendment would scale back the Republican overzealous $11.3 \nbillion increase to the President's request but still provide a modest \n$3 billion increase to try to satisfy some, if not all, of the \npriorities that have been expressed in the Congress on both sides of \nthe Hill. At a time when we are trying to balance the budget, such an \nexorbitant increase of $11-plus billion is uncalled for. We cannot \nreturn to an era of just throwing money at the defense problem at will, \nespecially when the experts in the administration and the Pentagon have \nnot requested it.\n  This action recently taken by the defense authorizing committees, I \nthink, demonstrates the point that I am trying to make. In the House \nNational Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nthe majority added $4 billion in procurement and R accounts that was \nneither in the Pentagon's 1997 request nor in the Pentagon's 5-year \nfuture years defense plan. That means that the authorizing committees \napproved $4 billion for programs that the Pentagon would never have \nbought even if it had had the money.\n  The real issue, Mr. President, is not how much to give defense but \nhow to distribute it over a 6-year timeframe. Both the Republican \nbudget resolution and the President's request propose to spend $1.6 \ntrillion--that is $1.6 trillion on defense between 1997 through the \nyear 2002.\n  The real allocation for defense differs by only $11 billion. The \nRepublican plan increases defense dramatically in the first few years \nand then flattens it out in the outyears. How we will pay for the \nassociated rise in operation and support costs and still balance the \nbudget is a mystery. The present budget at least increases the outyears \nto reflect defense budget realities to the point that it is $11 billion \nmore than the GOP plan in the year 2002. And the President still \nbalances the budget by the year 2002, as certified by the Congressional \nBudget Office, as I said earlier today.\n\n  This amendment leaves open the possibility to increase defense \nspending, as I have outlined and as Senator Grassley has outlined, if \nnecessary. By reinstating the ability to declare supplemental \nappropriations of defense budget by emergency, a simple majority in \nCongress with the approval of the President will still be able to \nincrease the defense budget if it truly is an emergency and truly in \nthe national interest.\n  Mr. President, I have just received a letter from Director Alice \nRivlin that the administration states its position on the defense \nnumbers in the resolution that Senator Grassley and I are trying to \nreduce. In that letter from the Office of Management and Budget, \nDirector Alice Rivlin states: ``The resolution provides $11 billion \nmore in the defense budget than the President's budget in 1997 which \ncommits historically high levels of resources through readiness as \nmeasured in funding for the troops. Further, in the critical years of \ndefense modernization at the turn of the century, the resolution does \nnot provide enough budget authority compared to the President's defense \nprogram.''\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Grassley amendment. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time have I used or has been \nused in opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. None at this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will speak for a few moments. The word should go out \nthere are a number of Senators on our side who want to speak against \nthe amendment. We have plenty of time, but we do not want to be here in \nquorum calls. We have sought not to do that once we go to work on the \nresolution. I hope they will come to the floor and be heard.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, let me first indicate \nunequivocally that Senator Grassley is consistent. He has consistently \ncalled for reduced spending and he has consistently been concerned \nabout whether or not the spending on defense is being done in the most \nefficient manner. In many ways, he has been successful. We have \nconsistently reduced defense spending since 1987. Since 1987, defense \nspending has declined 34 percent after inflation.\n  On the other hand, since 1987, the rest of the discretionary programs \nof America have increased by 31 percent. For those who say, in the last \nfew years, domestic spending has been cut, the truth of the matter is--\nand these are in constant dollars in this chart behind me--1987, this \nred bar is defense discretionary; domestic discretionary is the green \nbar; the big, big expenditure, sort of the blockbuster is the purple \nbar, which is entitlements.\n  Moving over a decade we will find in real dollars defense is down 34 \npercent; domestic discretionary is up 31 percent, and, of course, the \nentitlement programs are a 41 percent increase. So that is the story of \nspending as it relates to defense and domestic in the United States.\n\n  So, in a very real sense, Senator Grassley's concern about getting \nspending down has not fallen on deaf ears. Obviously, some big events \noccurred in the world, but many, many things have happened for the \nbetter in the Defense Department in terms of efficiency, in terms of \nbetter contracts, less waste, less loopholes, less opportunities to \ntake advantage of the taxpayer.\n  This budget resolution reduced defense spending from last year's \nassumption over the next 6 years by $14.3 billion. That is, over the \nnext 6 years we have reduced defense over what we assumed last year as \nwe produced a 7-year trend line--reduced it by $14.3 billion.\n  Senator Grassley would reduce defense spending next year from that \nnumber that we have by $8.3 billion. That will be the 12th straight \nyear of decline.\n  Now, I agree with Senator Grassley in one important way. He has said \nin the Budget Committee--and while I was not here for his entire \nspeech, I believe it is fair to say that the Clinton administration has \nplayed politics with this year's national security budget, the defense \nbudget. The President has proposed a significant reduction in defense \nspending this year, despite his 1995 State of the Union Address that \ndrew a line on further defense cuts.\n  Now, it is interesting, and the President will probably say, along \nwith those who defend his budget, that looking out over the next 6 \nyears, the President lets defense grow a little bit. Well, this is so \ntypical of the budgets coming out of the White House. For domestic \nspending, which he wants to say he is not cutting, those go up in the \nfirst few years and then come tumbling off the wall in years 4, 5, and \n6 from now. On defense, we turn it the other\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nway and say, do not worry, we are going to cut it this year, but it is \ngoing to go up. We think both of those approaches are inconsistent with \nwhat is good for the men and women who are in the armed services, the \noperation and maintenance, and seeing to it that they have good \nequipment, as modern as possible.\n  Now, cut defense spending so you can show big add-ons in the \nnondefense budget, but then send your military chiefs of staff to the \nHill. They come to the Hill and they ask for more money. In fact, our \nadding up of what the chiefs--the Chief of the Air Force, a four-star \ngeneral; the Chief of the Marines; and the head admiral of the Navy--\nthey have come up here and said, ``Yes, we are a part of the \nPresident's budget, but we sure would like some more money, because we \nneed it.'' They asked for $15 billion. We could not do that. We gave \nthem less.\n\n  So, in a sense, I agree with the distinguished Senator, except I do \nnot have enough confidence in trusting the President to ask for money, \nfrom now until the election, if they need it. One of my friend's--\nSenator Grassley--ideas is let us give him his budget, and let him have \nto come up here and ask for more. Frankly, I do not think that will \nhappen until after November, even if we did. I do not want to take that \nrisk.\n  I figure we can just as well go ahead and analyze the requests made \nin the committees. The authorizing committee of the U.S. Senate, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--I believe Senator Exon is a member, \nand if my recollection is wrong, and he can correct me--voted 20-0 to \nreport out a Defense authorization bill that is consistent with the \nRepublican mark and the Republican budget, not the mark or the dollar \nnumbers the President asks for in his budget.\n  So maybe some would like us not to bail out the President, but I \nbelieve it is not bailing out the President. If that happens to be a \nside-effect of doing what is right by the Defense Department, and by \nthe men and women of the military, who need our help--incidentally, Mr. \nPresident, when we voted in the all-volunteer military--the All-\nVolunteer Army and Navy and Air Force and Marines, during the Nixon \nera, we said we were going to pay them the equivalent wage of what they \nwould make in the civilian sector. I am very pleased that we are having \na very powerful commission evaluate this to see if we are really doing \nthat. I merely make the point that I am quite convinced that they are \ngoing to tell us we have to pay our men and women more.\n  I make that rather bold pronouncement because I feel confident it is \ngoing to happen. I am not interested in seeing more than the 12,000 \nmilitary men and women who are already on food stamps. In fact, I am \nhopeful they will tell us how to get them off of food stamps and pay \nthem what they are entitled to. That is not a large number, you will be \ntold, and our laws are strange on Medicaid and food stamps. But I \nbelieve that is not consistent with the pledge made when we decided to \nhave an All-Volunteer Army. Just on its face, it is not consistent.\n  I also comment that many of the vehicles that the Air Force is \noperating under are extremely old. You recall, much is being made in \nthe news today of a plane that is 27 years old. I think the plane that \ncrashed was 27 or 29 years old. Many are suggesting that we better be \ncareful when they get up there at that age.\n\n  Well, fighter aircraft, at this point, are as follows: In 2001, the \nAir Force pilots will be flying aircraft 15 years old, on average. This \nmeans that some of those aircraft will be 30 years old. I do not know \nwhat that means, but I have been led to believe that is getting pretty \nclose to critical time. If it is critical on the civilian side, and if \nwe do not want to have 30-year-old planes on the civilian side, I do \nnot think we want a lot of our men and women in the military flying 30-\nyear-old aircraft. We do not have any big money in this budget, nor did \nthe President put any in, to have a systematic approach to ameliorating \nthat situation.\n  I could go on. Squadrons of airplanes are shrinking. They used to be \n24, and we are down to 15, in many cases, and even 12. So we have more \nsites for them but fewer airplanes. I understand we do not want to \nclose down installations, but, obviously, the cost of maintaining and \noperating smaller units like that is very, very high in comparison to \nlarger units. Ultimately, something will be done about that.\n  Now, I want to close with this. Once again, so there will be no \nmisunderstanding, I have nothing but the highest respect for the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Charles Grassley. He is \nconsistent. He believes what he says, and he works at it. He believes \nfirmly in this position. I understand how he feels and what he is \nthinking. But I believe that in this case it is too risky; it is too \nrisky for our men and women and our national defense to allow this \namendment to pass. And I hope it does not.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman one thing \nabout the chart that is up here. The 1987 that he referenced there is \nsome kind of a benchmark. Is it not true that in 1987 there existed \nsuch a thing as a very powerful and threatening Soviet Union and a \nWarsaw Pact that is not here today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not say we cut it just to eliminate waste. I said \nit has been cut. For those who say it is always increasing while \ndomestic is not, I just want to say it has been coming down for 1 \ndecade. That is all.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  He also would like to be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire? Can I then ask that \nfollowing in sequence Senator Hutchison from Texas have 5 minutes and \nSenator Cohen from Maine have 10 minutes in that order?\n  Will the Senator have additional speakers?\n  Mr. EXON. We will have additional speakers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kyl and Senator Inhofe.\n  How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Four minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we agree on 5 minutes for Senator Inhofe?\n  Will Senator Hutchison control time for me for the next 15 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I first want to commend my colleague from \nIowa. As Senator Domenici said, through the years we have to be more \nprudent in defense spending.\n  I am for this amendment for two reasons: One is it reduces the \ndeficit.\n  Some of us on this floor right now are members of the Budget \nCommittee. Let me tell you without a constitutional amendment to \nrequire a balanced budget the 7 years that both sides are talking about \nwill not result in a balanced budget. We put all the tough decisions \noff to the end. Not all of them but most of them. So we are not going \nto achieve a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment, and \nthis at least moves in the direction of reducing the deficit.\n\n  Second, I am for it because the budget as it is constituted has an \nimbalance. What the Grassley amendment does is gives the Defense \nDepartment $3 billion more than they requested.\n  Frankly, if I were to put the budget together--for example, in \nyesterday's New York Times is a story, ``U.N. Says North Korea Will \nFace Famine as Early as This Summer.'' And in today's Washington Post \nit says ``No Help Set for N. Korea.''\n  I do not think that we ought to be using hunger as a political tool. \nI think we would be much smarter saying we want to help feed people who \nare hungry whether they are Communists, anarchists, or what their \nbackground.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put these two items in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1996]\n\n                        No Help Set for N. Korea\n\n            (By Mary Jordan) Washington Post Foreign Service\n\n       Tokyo.--Reclusive North Korea will not receive any \n     immediate new shipments of rice or other food from the United \n     States, Japan or South Korea despite new reports of \n     widespread malnutrition there.\n       ``With respect to food aid and [the easing of economic] \n     sanctions, we have no plans at this time to go forward,'' \n     said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, \n     concluding two days of talks with top Japanese and South \n     Korea officials over what policy to adopt toward the \n     deteriorating north. ``We will keep the situation under \n     review.''\n       The three countries issued a joint statement saying they \n     agreed to continue efforts to persuade the North to accept \n     four-nation peace talks proposed by Washington and Seoul last \n     month.\n       The three-nation talks, held on the South Korean island of \n     Cheju, again pointed out the difficulty these three allies \n     have maintaining a united front to deal with the Communist \n     regime in Pyongyang. The issue of food aid is seen as \n     critical because some experts believe an increasingly hungry \n     North Korea could opt to use its 1.2 million-man army to end \n     its crisis in a hail of missiles and bullets.\n       Others argue that offering help only rewards the missile-\n     exporting nation, Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole and \n     others have criticized President Clinton for ``coddling'' \n     this Stalinist regime whose military threat keeps 37,000 U.S. \n     troops on its border.\n       Generally, the United States has favored sending food aid \n     to ward off an immediate crisis. Even in the last few days, \n     U.S. Ambassador James Laney and State Department spokesman \n     Nicholas Burns indicated that the United States was \n     considering new aid and easing sanctions.\n       U.N. food aid officials Monday issued fresh alerts that \n     ``food stocks are critically low,'' that there is ``no \n     further food assistance in the pipeline'' and that peasants' \n     rations are being cut in half.\n       The United States has enforced economic sanctions against \n     North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But it \n     has also donated more than $2.2 million in aid since floods \n     last summer exacerbated the food crisis in the crumbling \n     state, which lacks heat for homes and cash for imports.\n       South Korea, whose capital city, Seoul, lies minutes away \n     from the missiles that North Korea has aimed at it, sees the \n     situation differently. South Korean officials oppose food aid \n     because they say the military will likely divert the food for \n     its own stockpiles. They also doubt the severity of the \n     hunger. An official in Cheju today said that although the \n     food shortage is serious, he did not think it would lead to \n     an ``African-style famine.''\n       The chief Japanese delegate, Deputy Foreign Minister Shunji \n     Yanai, told reporters at the end of the talks that at the \n     moment Japan had ``no plans to extend food assistance.'' It \n     had earlier sent 500,000 tons of rice. But Japanese officials \n     have also indicated they might pursue a more independent \n     dialogue with their unpredictable neighbor.\n       Lord stressed the need for talks involving the two Koreas, \n     the United States and China to hammer out a formal peace \n     treaty to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean \n     War.\n       Lord, Chung and Yanai agreed that such talks had the best \n     chance of achieving stability on the Korean peninsula.\n       Beijing has not committed itself to the proposal, first \n     suggested last month by President Clinton and South Korean \n     President Kim Young Sam, but has indicated it would back the \n     move once North Korea accepted.\n       North Korea, which until now has refused to discuss a peace \n     treaty except in bilateral talks with Washington, a condition \n     rejected by Washington and Seoul, has not agreed to the \n     proposal.\n       Shortly after a similar conference among the three nations \n     held in Hawaii earlier this year, the United States gave $2 \n     million in food assistance to North Korea. Since then, there \n     have been some encouraging signs in the U.S.-North Korean \n     diplomatic relationship.\n       Just in the past few days, the two countries reached a \n     breakthrough agreement that will allow the first joint effort \n     to recover the remains of U.S. soldiers unaccounted for since \n     the Korean War. More than 8,100 servicemen are still missing, \n     and many of them are believed to be buried in North Korea. \n     The recovery effort could begin before the end of the year.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 14, 1996]\n\n     U.N. Says North Korea Will Face Famine as Early as This Summer\n\n                        (By Nicholas D. Kristof)\n\n       Tokyo--Hunger in North Korea is growing more intense as the \n     country's economy continues to deteriorate, so that \n     malnutrition could become widespread in the coming months, \n     some experts say.\n       In the latest sign of the country's crisis, the World Food \n     Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \n     United Nations warned today that ``the food supply is \n     becoming increasingly desperate'' in North Korea, and that \n     without emergency food imports, ``the consequences are likely \n     to be devastating for large segments of the population.''\n       In their statement, the two agencies said that the \n     situation had deteriorated just in the last few months and \n     that the shortages were likely to grow worse this summer.\n       ``There are some cases of malnutrition, but it is not \n     widespread at this time, as far as we can tell,'' Trevor \n     Page, the country director for the World Food Program, said \n     by telephone for the organization's office in Pyongyang, the \n     North Korean capital. ``However, with levels of rations that \n     are now being distributed, malnutrition will develop and \n     become widespread in the coming months unless there are \n     substantial food aid shipments.''\n       North Korea, with the world's last Stalinist government, \n     remains virtually sealed off from the rest of the world, and \n     few foreigners are allowed to visit. But many Western \n     diplomats, business executives, academic experts and visitors \n     to the country say there are growing signs that the economy \n     is deteriorating.\n       Even in Pyongyang, which has by far the best standard of \n     living in the country, visitors say that power outages are \n     now routine and that water is often cut off for much of the \n     day.\n       Some Western diplomats and military officials worry that \n     North Korea's economic crisis could make it unpredictable \n     or even lead it to attack South Korea and the American \n     forces stationed there.\n       North Korea, with a population of about 24 million, was the \n     better-endowed part of the Korean Peninsula when Japan ended \n     its occupation in 1945. The North has a wealth of minerals \n     and other natural resources, but it has been hobbled by its \n     rigid Communist model, by huge spending on its 1.2 million-\n     member armed forces, and by the collapse of trading partners \n     in the former Communist world. Now many North Korean \n     factories are idled by lack of oil and electricity, and \n     collective farms are returning to draft animals because there \n     is no fuel for tractors.\n       The American Ambassador to South Korea, James T. Laney, \n     warned in a speech on Saturday of ``serious risks,'' \n     including the possibility that ``the North may look for other \n     ways of using the only remaining asset it possesses which \n     commands international respect--its military might.''\n       In a speech that seemed to signal a shifting direction in \n     American policy, Mr. Laney suggested that the old approach of \n     simply emphasizing deterrence against North Korean attack was \n     no longer sufficient. Now, he said, deterrence must be \n     augmented by inducements to get North Korea to cooperate with \n     the West.\n       Senior officials from the United States, Japan and South \n     Korea are now meeting in South Korea to discuss policy toward \n     the North. Diplomats say that they are expected to agree on \n     an assistance plan on condition that the North agrees to \n     President Clinton's proposal last month for four-party peace \n     talks involving both Koreas, the United States and China.\n       North Korea's economy has been deteriorating for years and \n     was further devastated by widespread flooding last year. \n     Rations have already been halved, and experts say that some \n     peasants are eating bitter wild grasses and roots that have \n     not been part of the diet since 1951, during the Korean War.\n       But one such emergency food, a grass called naengi, stops \n     growing this month and so will be unavailable in the crucial \n     summer months, until the next grain harvest is ready in the \n     fall. This year's harvest is also expected to be poor, \n     because bad weather delayed planting by about two weeks.\n       Experts say there are other signs of economic desperation, \n     including the sale by peasants of anything they have--even \n     human hair--to China in exchange for wheat flour. Russia is \n     said to have cut freight train service for lack of payment of \n     bills, and that may complicate North Korea's trade picture.\n       Most staple foods are distributed in North Korea by the \n     Government, but the alert today said that this system ``is \n     perilously close to collapse.'' Moreover, foreign \n     assistance--which eased the shortages over the winter--is \n     coming to an end.\n       Foreign shipments averaged about 50,000 tons of grain a \n     month since late last year, but plunged to 12,200 last month \n     and an anticipated 9,300 this month. Next month, 2,500 tons \n     are anticipated, and the nothing is in the pipeline.\n       Some North Korea watchers have suggested that the hunger \n     could lead to a revolt or to the disintegration of the \n     system, and there have indeed been a growing number of North \n     Koreans who risk being shot by sneaking across the border \n     into China. But visitors say they have seen no sign of \n     political unrest in North Korea, perhaps the most tightly \n     controlled society in the world.\n       ``Although food shortages are all over, there are no signs \n     that this will cause the political collapse of the country,'' \n     Mr. Page of the world food Program said.\n       The food shortage in North Korea may become perennial, \n     experts say, unless the rigid Communist economic system \n     changes dramatically. The Government appears to be bending \n     its rules a bit by turning a blind eye as peasants plant \n     larger private plots than they are allowed or sell food in \n     informal markets in some parts of the country. Likewise, in \n     the cities some residents are planting crops on spare bits of \n     land or raising chickens on their balconies. But North Korea \n     has given no indication that it is contemplating any major \n     opening.\n       Another problem for North Korea may be declining cash \n     transfusions from ethnic Koreans living in Japan. Nicholas \n     Eberstadt, a\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\n     scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, \n     has concluded that the transfusions were never as great as \n     widely believed and have plunged since the late 1980's.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me point out what is happening in \ndefense spending.\n  Here is the United States. Here are the next five countries in \ndefense spending: Russia, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, and \nGermany. We are spending more on defense than the next five countries \ncombined. The cold war is over, as Senator Exon just pointed out.\n  Let me take you back to the year when Senator Grassley and I came to \nCongress, fiscal year 1975. Do you know what the defense budget was \nthen adjusted for inflation? It was $234 billion, $32 billion less than \nwe are requesting here. Then we faced the nuclear confrontation with \nthe Soviets. We had a war in Vietnam, as my friend from Iowa will \nremember. We had all kinds of challenges. Today we do not need to spend \nanywhere near this amount.\n  If we were to cut the defense budget in half--and I do not advocate \nthat--but if we were to do that, we would still be spending appreciably \nmore than any other country on the face of the Earth. A little prudence \nas this amendment suggests is just common sense.\n  I hope the Senate will listen to our friend from Iowa with his \namendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. I think it makes sense \nfiscally. I think it makes sense from the viewpoint of what we ought to \nbe doing in the defense area.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Grassley \namendment, and I hope there will be enough Senators who say let us look \nat our real needs. Let us look at our deficit situation. The Grassley \namendment logically ought to be overwhelmingly supported. I know that \nis not going to be the case. If we win it will be by a narrow vote. But \nwe ought to vote for the people of this Nation on this next vote. And I \nthink that is a vote for the Grassley amendment.\n\n  I yield back the balance of the time to Senator Grassley.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respect Senator Grassley very much. \nI respect Senator Simon, and Senator Exon. But I serve on the Armed \nServices Committee, and I think they are wrong on this issue.\n  In fact, let us cut to the chase. We are not talking about allowing \nthe President to come back in and certify that he needs more money. The \nPresident has said that he does not want the money. His budget came in \n$11 billion lower this year in real terms than it was last year, and \nthat was after telling the American people in his State of the Union \nMessage that he did not think we should cut defense spending any more.\n  Mr. President, we have had testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee from every single high ranking military and civilian official \nin this administration; the President's own administration. Every chief \nof every service has said we cannot continue to train our forces and \nmodernize our forces if we do not have the money to do it. This is the \n12th straight year of declining defense spending; the 12th straight \nyear. Weapons procurement is down 70 percent since 1985.\n  It is proper after the cold war that we would draw down our military \nspending. But, Mr. President, we have gone far enough. If we maintain \nkeeping the funding level that Senator Grassley is suggesting that we \ncut, the $8.3 billion, what would it take away from our Armed Forces? \nWhat would it do to us?\n  First, it would stop the increasing modernization that we must have \nas we are drawing down our force numbers. It is essential that we have \nthe modernization, equipment, and technology to make up for the smaller \nnumbers of people that we will have in the field. That is what the \ndrawdown requires if we are going to be able to fight and win two \nsimultaneous major regional conflicts. We must have the technology and \nthe equipment to do it.\n  It will pay for an improved quality of life for the men and women who \nrisk their lives to serve our country. We are asking for a 3-percent \npay raise for our military; 3 percent. These are the young men and \nwomen who volunteer to fight for the freedom and independence of our \ncountry. We must assure that they have a better quality of life that \ndemonstrates to them that they have the complete support of the \nAmerican people.\n  We will also not be able to increase our commitment to counter the \nballistic missile threats; the threat of ballistic missiles launched at \nour country. The Secretary of Defense testified that we do not have a \ndefense to ballistic missiles fired at the United States. He said that \nthis year. The Secretary of Defense, himself, thinks that we need to go \nforward with the technology for a ballistic missile defense for our \ncountry. At least 30 countries throughout the world have ballistic \nmissile technology and capabilities. Many of those have nuclear, \nbiological and chemical weapons capability as well. So, of course, we \nought to be able to defend our shores, or any of our troops in the \nfield against incoming ballistic missiles. Yet, if you cut $8 billion \nthat Senator Grassley wants to cut, we will not be able to go forward \nin that technology.\n\n  Mr. President, we should have learned a lesson from our experiences \nin previous wars. That is what history is for--to teach us lessons. We \nshould learn the lesson of the Korean war. We should not forget the \nlessons of Task Force Smith, when we had drawn down our forces after \nWorld War II, and we did not have the equipment and the training going \ninto the Korean war, and Task Force Smith was a unit that was rushed \ninto combat in the early days of the Korean war and were obliterated by \nthe North Koreans. They were brave soldiers who fought courageously but \nbecause they were not equipped with up-to-date equipment and their \ntraining was woefully short they suffered terrible casualties. We \ncannot forget the sacrifice of those who died in Task Force Smith and \nnow once again repeat those same mistakes today by undercutting the \nability of our troops in the field to have the equipment and the \ntraining and the technology they need to do the job when they signed up \nto protect our freedom.\n  We saw in Desert Storm an almost perfectly executed war, but we had \nalmost 6 months to prepare for that war. Our enemies will not always \ngive us 6 months to prepare for a war. They saw what happened to Saddam \nHussein when he did that. So when you talk about cutting $8 billion out \nof our defense budget, you are talking not about fat; you are talking \nabout muscle and bone. You are talking about cutting the critical \nsupport for our military that we must continue to provide if we are \ngoing to maintain the strength of our military.\n  As President Reagan once said, we got peace through strength. Being \nweak and unprepared and technologically inadequate is not what America \nis about. If we are going to have the greatest nation on Earth and the \nlast superpower status on Earth, we must have the equipment and the \ntechnology and the upgrading to do the job. So cutting our military \nbudget to the level that the President asked for is certainly not going \nto do that.\n  I implore my colleagues to look at the big picture and to remember \nthe lessons of Task Force Smith. Let us not let the deaths of those \nbrave men go unheeded. Let us keep our freedom and our strength, and \nlet us keep our commitment to our troops in the field for a quality of \nlife and let us have a ballistic missile defense for our country going \ninto the 21st century.\n  Now, Mr. President, according to the previous order, I yield 10 \nminutes to Senator Cohen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I was interested in listening to the \ncomments of my colleague from Illinois when he held up several press \naccounts that the North Koreans may be heading for starvation, and so \nthe solution, I suppose, is to send food.\n  Mr. President, the North Koreans would not be headed for starvation \nif they were spending less on weapons, less on putting half a million \npeople right on the DMZ, having 1.2 million under arms, and doing more \nto grow food.\n  So the word ought to be to the North Koreans, ``Make food, not war.'' \nYet we are being called upon here for us to\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nnow feed the North Korean Army, because that is where the food is \ngoing, it is not going to feed the general population.\n  Let me suggest to my friends who now would adopt the policy of send \nfood and not prepare for defending South Korea that the North Koreans \nhave not been responsive to date to these sorts of gestures. We have \nbeen sending them fuel oil so they would not go forward and build a \nnuclear weapons capability, and now we are being told they are on the \nverge of starving, so, therefore, we must cut back, we must in fact \ntrim our procurement needs in order to accommodate the needs of the \nNorth Korean people whose military regime continues to spend them into \nbankruptcy.\n  It was also suggested with a chart over there that there are some \nfive countries that we spend more in defense than the total of these \nfive countries. Well, which countries are they? Is it Russia? Is it \nChina? Can anyone on the Senate floor tell me how much China spends on \ntheir military? Can you tell me how much Russia spends for its \nmilitary? If any of you can even establish that in nominal terms?\n\n  Would you like to compare what it costs the United States taxpayer to \nacquire a fighter aircraft from McDonnell Douglas versus the Chinese \nGovernment?\n  Mr. President, there is no sense in trying to compare our \nexpenditures to those of five countries when we cannot even identify \nthe true costs of what those countries are spending. Assuming that you \ncould, are we going to take the position in the Senate that we now \nwould like to see the Japanese, for example, increase their defense \nspending so they can assume a greater responsibility in the field of \nseapower, and extend their seapower capabilities throughout that \nregion?\n  Do we want to see Germany, for example, have a much greater \nexpenditure in defense to adopt much greater responsibility than they \ncurrently have? Are we willing to see that our stabilizing presence \nthroughout the world should be diminished with all the consequences we \nhave seen during the history of warfare during the 20th century; that \nevery single time the United States has cut back and cut back and cut \nback we have seen the seeds of future wars sewn?\n  Mr. President, it has been talked about here of how the peak of \nspending has gone down over the past 10 years. I have a chart here as \nwell that can show very clearly how it has dropped significantly since \n1985--70 percent.\n  We think back to our capability in World War II. I ask this question \nfrequently: How many ships did we have during World War II? Take a wild \nguess. Five thousand warships. How many are we headed for today? Three \nhundred forty-six.\n  Bismarck indicated that there are only two things that do not change \nin life. One is history and the other is geography.\n  We still are required to sail the same seas. We still are required to \ndefend this country's interests globally. That has not changed. So we \nnow are required to cover the globe with our sea power capability with \n346 ships, not 5,000. Indeed, these 346 ships are more capable than \nthose 5,000 we had in World War II, but we have to continue to \nmodernize them.\n  The fact is we are operating them at a greater operational tempo. \nThey are wearing out faster. So what we are asking our young men and \nwomen to do is to sail in ships that are operating at a higher tempo, \nthat are wearing out faster, that need replacement, need repairs, and \nwe put their lives in jeopardy because we are cutting back and cutting \nback.\n  We are doing so in contradiction to what the President promised. This \nis what is most ironic. For years, the administration has been telling \nus that the procurement budget is going to turn around. Just wait until \nnext year. It is sort of like us in New England; we keep saying about \nthe Red Sox: Next year we are going to get the pennant. Just wait one \nmore year.\n  That is precisely what has been said about the defense budget: Next \nyear it is coming. We know it is going to an all-time low. It has to \ncome up because we are sacrificing our qualitative edge here, folks, so \nit has to come up. Two years ago, Secretary Perry testified, and I am \ngoing to quote:\n\n       We cannot sustain these low levels of procurement for long, \n     and we are projecting an increase beginning next year, fiscal \n     1996.\n\n  Mr. President, it did not happen. Last year, the Clinton \nadministration said that the upturn in the procurement budget will \nbegin next year, in 1996. Now they say that it is not going to happen. \nLast year, the administration said it was going to be requesting $44 \nbillion in fiscal 1997 for procurement. We got the budget, and it was \n38.9 for procurement. Now here we go again. The administration says the \nprocurement upturn is going to start next year, fiscal 1998. So we were \npromised in 1996. They broke the promise. We were promised in 1997. \nThey broke the promise. Now they say wait, just hold on; if we can just \nget to 1998, it will start to upturn.\n  Mr. President, when is that going to happen? The reason we are here, \nthe reason we have added this funding for our defense capability is \nthat we cannot rely upon empty promises. We have had military adviser \nafter military adviser come forward and say, ``Yes, we support the \nPresident's budget,'' but when pressed, ``Yes, we could use a little \nbit more.''\n  Let me just quote something else for you. Last fall, General \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, began banging the \ndrum pretty loudly for a ramp up in procurement, saying we need to get \nthe procurement budget up from this year's $42 billion to $60 billion \nby fiscal 1998.\n  If you started reading the trade press accounts in the last couple of \nmonths, you would have seen a series of articles quoting General \nShalikashvili and other senior officials saying maintaining our \nmilitary edge depends on achieving $60 billion in procurement by fiscal \n1998. Yet, the President's budget calls for procurement spending in \n1998 essentially unchanged from this year and not reaching the $60 \nbillion mark until after the turn of the century.\n  So, all told, this year's budget calls for $26 billion less for \nprocurement over the next 5 years than the Department of Defense said \njust last year that it needed.\n  So, Mr. President, the reason we are here in opposition to this \namendment is that we cannot afford to take the chance, we cannot afford \nto put the lives of our young men and women on the line with equipment \nthat is wearing out, wearing down, and needs to be replaced. That \nequipment needs to be kept up to the best level that we can possibly \nmaintain it.\n  When the call comes to go to Bosnia, we are the ones who have to go \nover there with the best equipment. When the call came to send two \naircraft carrier battle groups over to Taiwan, when the Chinese were \nthreatening with missiles headed toward Taiwan's territory, we were the \nones who sent two aircraft carrier groups over. Every time there is an \nemergency that affects our interests or that of our allies, we are the \nones who are called upon. Do we send our people over with deficient \nequipment or marginal equipment? No, we say we send them with the best. \nWe are not going to put our people in harm's way under circumstances \nthat put them at a great disadvantage.\n  Mr. President, we are asking that we reject this amendment. We think \nit is necessary to begin the procurement, not next year and not in \nfiscal 1998, but now. This is a commitment that was made by the Clinton \nadministration 2 years ago. It was not kept. It was made again last \nyear. It was not kept. This year we intend to see that the commitment \nis adhered to.\n  Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to reject this amendment and that \nwe do so with an overwhelming vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. I also rise to oppose \nthis amendment. I have to ask the question, what is this obsession that \nwe seem to have around this place for cutting the military, for putting \nourselves in a defenseless posture?\n  I am just shocked every time this discussion comes up, and hardly a \nday comes by when there is not talk about this. It is interesting that \na President who ran on a balanced budget, ran on a strong national \ndefense, ran on all of these things, wants to cut only defense. He has \nincreased spending in every\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nother program. The only area where he has suggested, in his budget, he \nwants dramatic cuts is in defense.\n  When he promised, prior to the 1994 budget, that he was going to ask \nfor $62 billion, he ended up asking for $48 billion. For the 1995 \nbudget, he promised he would ask for $55 billion and he only asked for \n$46 billion.\n  The Senator from Maine talked about the various missions that are \ntaking place around the world today. I opposed it even back during the \nRepublican administration, in December 1992, when we sent troops to \nSomalia, even though they sent them over for 90 days and they did not \ncome back until after 18 of our troops were murdered and their corpses \nwere dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. I opposed sending troops \nthere then. I opposed sending troops to Bosnia. I opposed sending \ntroops to Haiti. Not because I am not compassionate, not because I am \nnot concerned for the plight of these people all around the world, it \nis just we do not have the military assets to go out and take care of \nall these social problems around the world and be able to defend \nourselves.\n  So I think we have a twofold problem here. We are dramatically \nreducing, year after year after year, our military budget, and at the \nsame time we are taking on additional responsibilities. Currently, we \nhave more troops deployed around the world than we have had at any \nother time that is supposedly nonwartime, and we have taken huge cuts \nin our defenses. Since 1985--this is 12 years--for 12 consecutive years \nwe have taken cuts in our Nation's defense.\n\n  What makes it even worse, it was pointed out by the Senator from \nMaine, our defense spending has fallen 41 percent since 1985. It is \nreally worse than that, because procurement has dropped 72 percent \nsince 1985. So, if overall defense spending has dropped 41 percent, \nprocurement 72 percent, that is where the modernization is, that is \nwhere the new equipment is, that is where the accounts are that make us \ncompetitive. We have watched, year after year--1985, $405 billion using \n1997 dollars, down to roughly $250 billion. We cannot afford any more \ncuts.\n  One of the things that has been stated is that the Pentagon did not \nmake these requests. It is interesting, I heard not more than a month \nago when we had testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee--\nit was also before the House committee--that we had the four Chiefs all \nin agreement that we have to have an additional $20 billion in our \nreadiness account in order to be competitive. Yet, that is the first \ntime I can remember in my recollection of American history when the \nChiefs themselves came out and said, ``No, the President is wrong. We \nare sorry. He is the Ccommander in Chief, but we are the ones \nresponsible for protecting America, and we are not able to do it.''\n  Look what has happened. You want to talk about administrations? \nDuring the Democratic administration of 1961, President Kennedy, in the \npercentage of the total budget, 50 percent was for defense, 16 percent \nfor social spending. Now it is just reversed: 17 percent for national \ndefense, 60 percent for social spending.\n  The areas where we are going to be suffering are the very areas that \naffect our troops that are in combat situations, preparing for combat \nsituations--quality of life, black boxes for aircraft. Time and time \nagain I get in 141's and 130's and I look down there--I have been a \ncommercial pilot for 40 years, and I look down and see they actually \nhave equipment I have not seen in 20 years. We are sending our people \nout without GPS's, a very inexpensive piece of equipment. It is because \nwe are cutting down those procurement accounts to a level that we are \nnot going to adequately take care of those individuals who are in the \nfield.\n  I would just make one more comment about what has been said over and \nover again on the floor. It was said most recently by the very \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, that this amendment is still $3 \nbillion more than the Pentagon requested. All I can say is, I hope all \nof America knows--certainly we know in this body here--that the \nPresident speaks for the Pentagon. He is the one, and they carry out \nhis orders. But when you stop and ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the \nChiefs of the services--I will quote right here, ``Unless we \nrecapitalize''--I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator use 2 more minutes? I yield 2 more \nminutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. ``Unless we recapitalize, we are not going to be ready to \nmeet the threats of the future.'' That is the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, Ron Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n  In the same meeting: ``If we do not modernize, we ultimately place \nfuture readiness at risk.'' That was Adm. Michael Boorda, same meeting.\n  ``Further deferral of modernization will incur significant risks to \nfuture readiness.'' This is Gen. Dennis Reimer of the U.S. Army, March \n13, 1996.\n  It is there. The Senator from Texas talked about another great \nproblem, and that is the problem that we have cut back, as a result of \nthe veto of the DOD bill last year, on our ability to defend ourselves \nfrom a national missile attack. We do not have a National Missile \nDefense System in place. Most of the people in America believe we have \none, and when they find out we do not have one, it scares them to \ndeath. Why are they scared? Because such great people as Jim Woolsey, \nwho was the CIA Director under two Democrat Presidents, said that \ncurrently we have a great threat out there. We know of 25 nations that \nhave or are in the final stages of completion of a weapon of mass \ndestruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear, and are \ndeveloping the missile means of delivering it.\n  So we are imperiled, Mr. President. We have a great deal to do to \nrebuild our defenses, to go back and take us out of the posture we were \nin in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts. What we are doing \ntoday is trying to get ourselves into a position where we have adequate \nspare parts, adequate procurement, so that our troops out there can be \ncompetitive with the others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds, and then I \nwill change with Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Inhofe that I just want to \ncongratulate him on his remarks and on his steadfastness on the Armed \nServices Committee. I want to compliment you for the learning that has \ntaken place in a very short period of time. Many Senators look to you \nfor information on the Defense Department.\n  My accolades go out to you because I think it is clear that you are \ngenuinely interested, and it shows. I want to just tell you we all \nunderstand it and appreciate it very much.\n  I do not know what the arrangement was. Would you like Senator \nBumpers to go next? We have had two or three of ours.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Just for 5 minutes if the Senator from Iowa will yield \nto me.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, so that we will have things lined up, \nafter his 5 minutes, could we go 10 minutes for Senator Kyl and Senator \nStevens wants 10 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. But I will be happy to wait for someone on the other \nside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there are no Democrats, they can go in between and \nthen we can go to Senator Stevens. I ask that be the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President I want to congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa for a very sensible amendment, one that ought to \nreceive the unanimous approval of this body.\n  This budget contains just over $500 billion in discretionary \nspending. I want my colleagues to think about this for a moment. We are \nlooking at a total budget of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion \nand only a bit over $500 billion of that is for discretionary spending. \nUnder this budget, about $265 billion of that is for defense. That does \nnot leave much for programs that go to the very heart of the values of \nthe country and the things that really make this Nation strong, like \neducation and transportation. I can tell you that the number of \nexplosions you can set off with weaponry is not necessarily related to \nthe real strength of this Nation. I am always nonplused and puzzled \nwhen so many people jump\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\nunder their desks every time somebody mentions cutting defense. You can \nsavage education, which this budget does, you can savage the \nenvironment, which this budget does, you can savage the programs that \npeople depend on for their very livelihood, earned-income tax credits, \nand on and on it goes, you can deal with those programs and you can ask \nfor a whopping tax increase for the wealthiest among us, but if you ask \ndefense to take one single dollar less, everybody goes berserk.\n  Now, there are some politics in this. But I want you to remember that \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa is well above the \nadministration's request. There is not any reason why Republicans ought \nto join in lockstep to vote against this. It is well above what the \nPresident has requested for the Pentagon, it is well above what the \nDefense Department says it needs.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Texas a moment ago, a woman \nwhom I admire and respect, saying that we just simply cannot weaken our \ndefenses. I want to ask my colleagues this: Who are the enemies you are \ngoing to spend this money for? Who are they?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the question.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Pardon?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The question is, who are the enemies against whom we \nmust spend $265 billion? Who are the enemies that we feel constrained \nto spend over $1.6 trillion over the next 6 years to defend against? \nThe Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Simon], said a moment ago that we spend \nas much on defense in this Nation as the top five possible adversaries, \nincluding China and Russia. It is worse than that. We spend as much as \nthe top 10, and if you add NATO, we spend almost twice as much as the \ntop 10 and there is not an enemy in sight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Do you want to yield on that?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No, I am not going to yield until I finish.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Then the Senator from Texas proceeded to talk about how \nweak we could become. I will tell you how you get weak. You get weak by \npaying interest on a national debt that we incurred during the 1980's \nwhen defense spending went from $150 billion to $300 billion in 8 \nyears. If we had not been so foolish, we would not be fighting about a \nbalanced budget these days. It is because of the interest on that \nstaggering debt increase that we cannot balance the budget.\n  There is not anybody here that I will yield to on supporting our \ndefense needs. I served 3 years in the Marine Corps during World War \nII, and I learned a little bit about defense first hand, and now I sit \non a defense appropriations subcommittee. I know how it all works, and \nI know how it happens. But I can tell you, this amendment will save the \ntaxpayers of this Nation billions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have to admit that over the period of this budget \nresolution, there is a sum total of $11 billion difference between the \nRepublican budget proposal and this amendment--$11 billion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The President cuts back on defense spending now and the \nbudget resolution cuts back on it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to respond to some of \nthe challenges just raised by the Senator from Arkansas. They are good \nquestions. They deserve a response, and I think we have the response.\n  Before doing that, though, let me pay a compliment to the Senator \nfrom Iowa for raising this amendment, even though I strongly oppose it. \nThe Senator from Iowa cares very much about the spending of taxpayer \ndollars in this country, and he knows that there are some places in the \ndefense budget where we could make savings, and he is right in that. \nBut I believe it is also the case that if that money were to be cut, we \nwould not make the savings in the places where they ought to be made, \nbut rather would continue to cut on important research and development, \non readiness and on procurement, on the things that we have to spend \nmore money on, and that is why I will end up opposing the amendment of \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  I would like the attention of the Senator from Arkansas because he \nraised some important questions a moment ago. He said, ``Who is our \nenemy?'' Mr. President, the United States of America is now the only \nsuperpower in the world. We are the country to whom everyone else in \nthe world looks to for protection, not only of themselves but for the \ndemocratic ideals that animate many countries' pretensions to become a \npart of the civilized world.\n  I just returned from a conference in Prague, the Czech Republic, in \nwhich Central European nations said to the United States, ``Please \ncontinue to assist us to help bring us into the European Community, \nbecause we have the same basic ideals that you do.'' We cannot do that \nif we do not have a strong defense.\n  Who are our enemies? Well, it all depends. If we want to come to the \ndefense of Kuwait, then our enemy in that situation is Iraq. If we want \nto protect Taiwan, then our enemy might be China. If we want to protect \nSouth Korea, then our enemy is North Korea. If we want to stand up to \nQadhafi, then our enemy is Libya. If we want to stop the terrorism from \ncoming from Teheran, then Iran may be our enemy.\n  The point is, there is not any other country in the world that \neverybody looks to to stop this kind of aggression than the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget what Dick Cheney said when \neveryone was patting him on the back for winning the gulf war. \nSecretary of Defense Dick Cheney at that time said, ``It wasn't Dick \nCheney who won the war. It wasn't George Bush. It wasn't Norman \nSchwarzkopf.'' He said, ``As great as they were, it wasn't even just \nour great troops that won this war. We won the gulf war because of \ndecisions that were made by courageous members of previous \nadministrations and previous Congresses 10 and 12 and 15 years ago to \ngive us the weapons, the high-tech weaponry and to provide for the \ntraining of our troops,'' so that we would be prepared to win a \nconflict that nobody could have even predicted back then, could not \neven have predicted just a few weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, in \nfact, apparently was not predicted by anybody until the invasion \noccurred.\n\n  So the point is, Mr. President, you cannot say that until we have \nidentified a specific enemy, in the sense that we have been attacked, \nwe should not be spending money on defense. That argument is absolutely \nwrong. Dick Cheney was absolutely right. What he said is, ``I hope that \nthe decisions that I'm making as Secretary of Defense today will enable \nmy successor's successor, maybe 10 or 12 years from now, to win a \nconflict that nobody today can predict but which, as surely as we're \nsitting here, will occur.''\n  Mr. President, that is the challenge of all of us sitting in this \nbody today. We cannot predict who the enemy is. But we have an \nobligation to provide for that basic research, that readiness, that \nprocurement that we know will win the next conflict wherever it is. To \nthose who say we are savaging education, savaging the environment, \nspending overall on those accounts has not gone down, has not gone up \nmuch, but it has not gone down.\n  Defense spending has gone down now for 12 straight years, the only \ndepartment of Government where that has occurred. As a matter of fact, \ndefense spending last year and this year will be less than we spent \nbefore Pearl Harbor. Either as a percentage of the Federal budget or as \na percentage of gross national product, we will be spending less on \ndefense than we did the year before Pearl Harbor.\n  Now we are the only acknowledged superpower in the world. We are the \ncountry that everybody else turns to. Before my time is out, Mr. \nPresident, let me simply note that there are numerous reports, \nstatements, pieces of testimony from representatives of the \nadministration who say that we are already spending too little. If we \nwere to cut the Republican committee request even further, as our \nfriend from Iowa is suggesting that we do here, we would be setting our \nprocurement program\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nback by years and we would not be in a position to win that kind of \nconflict of which I spoke.\n  One of the people who I think we should rely upon here is the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili. He stated \nin his 1996 Force Readiness Assessment report a little bit earlier this \nyear:\n\n       As overall defense spending has been reduced, permanent \n     accounts have been the bill payer for other readiness-related \n     spending. We can no longer afford to push procurement into \n     the outyears.\n\n  Specifically with regard to the spending and the amounts, General \nShalikashvili summarized the situation this way:\n\n       We are now fast approaching the time when we will no longer \n     be able to rely on what we built in the 1980's, and so we \n     must commit ourselves to a sufficient procurement goal, a \n     goal I assess to be approximately $60 billion annually, if \n     our force is to remain as ready tomorrow as it is today.\n\n  Mr. President, despite General Shalikashvili's assessment, the \nadministration's 1997 request devotes less than $40 billion to \nprocurement spending, less than at any time since the Korean war. What \nthat means is, we are still going to be $20 billion short. Now the \ncommittee has added $11 billion back. That is still $9 billion short \njust with regard to procurement. If we were to adopt the amendment of \nthe Senator from Iowa, we would be back to the point where we are at \nleast $20 billion short just in the area of procurement, according to \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Without reading the statements made by other members of the Joint \nChiefs and other representatives in the military, let me just summarize \nit this way. There is not anybody in the military who does not believe \nwe could make good use of the money that the Armed Services Committee \nhas put back in. There is a list here presented by each of the services \nthat spends more than that amount of money. They would like to have it \nif they could.\n  They are good soldiers, following the Commander in Chief, who sent \nhis budget up and said, we are not going to spend any more than the \namount requested. But if you ask them, they will give you the list of \nthings they say they need.\n  That is why I conclude again by answering the question of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. We know who our potential enemies are. We know who we \nhave to be prepared to defend against. What we are doing, in as best a \nway as we can, in the budget of the Armed Services Committee, in the \nauthorization from the Armed Services Committee, is to request the \nminimal amount that we think we are going to need to sustain those \nrequirements.\n  To go back to what Secretary Cheney said when he was Secretary of \nDefense: If we have the courage today to make the kind of decisions \nthat people 10 and 15 years ago did that permitted us to be able to win \nthe cold war, and win the first hot war since then in Iraq, then we \nwill be able to say that at the time that it counted we stood up and we \ndid the right thing. We had the foresight, we had the courage, and we \nwere willing to defend the position to spend the money necessary to \nfulfill the first and most important obligation of the U.S. Government, \nof the Federal Government, and that is to defend the people of \nthe United States.\n\n  That is why at the end of the day I support the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and \nthe work of his committee in bringing forth their requests and \nrespectfully oppose the amendment of our good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is now recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Thurmond, the previous \norder has Senator Stevens to speak for 10 minutes and then the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to defer to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, if he wishes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Go ahead.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \nproponents of this amendment. I spent this morning, as chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Committee, in a classified session, meeting with \nmembers of the Department of Defense, uniformed members, considering \nwhat we do about replacing our fighter force. The F-15 will be 30 years \nold in 2003, Mr. President. We have a situation where, after the turn \nof the century, the C-141's and the C-5's will be retired. They will be \nretired. They also will be about 30 years old, one of them 30-plus \nyears old. We have to find a way to replace them, too.\n  I find it interesting to listen to people who propose this amendment, \nbecause they are unwilling to take the step that would be necessary to \naccomplish what they want to do, and that is restore the draft. Over 60 \npercent of our money spent for defense, sometimes almost 70 percent, \ndepending upon the year involved, goes to pay for the Volunteer Force, \nthe best force in the world. It is the force of a superpower, but it is \nan expensive force. The remainder of the money goes for research and \ndevelopment, for acquisition of new systems.\n  What this amendment will mean is the people that have come to our \ncommittee already and said they want add-ons for this budget, they want \nthings changed in the President's budget, they will not only be denied, \nbut a series of things that are in the budget have to be taken out \nbecause the President's budget is not an honest budget.\n  It does not fund for contingencies, just as last year he did not fund \nfor Bosnia at all. We have to find $5 to $6 to $7 billion every year to \npay for things this President has ordered that he spends out of the \nmoney that we provide for defense under his power as Commander in \nChief.\n\n  But what we are doing right now is ignoring our duty as Members of \nCongress if we do not follow the Constitution, which says we must \nprovide for the common defense. To provide for the common defense of \nthis country requires that we make the investment now to be assured \nthat in the next century we will be as successful as we were in the \nPersian Gulf war.\n  That Persian Gulf war demonstrated, as was just said by the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the wisdom of the decisions that were made in the 1970's \nand in the 1980's to acquire the F-15, to finance the Tomahawk, to \nproduce the Stealth 117. All of those were possible because of the \ndiscretionary spending that was available then.\n  If the amendment of the Senator from Iowa is adopted, we lose our \nadvantage, we lose our capability to invest in the future, to invest in \nthe research and development that is necessary, or we have to go to a \ndraft, we have to start drafting people. I joined Senator Goldwater in \nopposing the draft in peacetime. We brought about the end of the draft \nin peacetime.\n  We do not believe in drafting our people in peacetime. I hope we will \nnever be forced to do it. But we certainly will be forced to do it if \nwe adopt this amendment, because the testimony I heard this morning, as \nI said, in a classified session, demonstrates that we must have the \nmoney to invest in the systems that are being researched now, some of \nthem in a development stage, so that we can have the systems to keep \nour country in a position of being No. 1 in terms of capability out \ninto the next century.\n  Now, I do not know any way to do it if we constantly have erosion on \nthis budget, as mentioned by the Senator from Arizona. There has been \nan erosion on the budget every year. When Jack Kennedy was President of \nthe United States, 51 percent of the budget of the United States went \nto defense. It is nowhere near that because of the growth of \nentitlements, the growth in interest rates. We get a portion of the \ncontrollable expenses for defense. It is a sizable portion, but nowhere \nnear what we need.\n  In terms of need, if we really defined need and came in here and \nasked for the replacement of all the systems that are aging, this \nbudget would be much higher. It cannot go down, as was projected by the \nPresident, and maintain the defense of this country into the next \ncentury. We are not talking now. People ask, who is the enemy now? The \nenemy will be met with the investments we made in the 1970's and \n1980's. For the next century, it will be the investments of the balance \nof this decade. To cut the investments means we weaken the United \nStates in its ability to make commitments around the\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\nworld to protect our interests. I cannot get more worked up about \nanything than the continued demand that we try to defend this budget in \nterms of what is the threat now.\n  Look at Iraq. We had sitting Members of the Senate visiting Saddam \nHussein about 5 months before he moved into Kuwait. Would anyone have \ncome to the floor and when asked to define the threat, come up with \nIraq, as we debated the bill, the year before that trip? I cannot \ndefine who is going to be the next country that we have to call an \nenemy.\n  I can say to the Senate that if this amendment is adopted--I can see \nthe Senator from Massachusetts here--I can tell you the money will not \nbe there for Patriot. It will not be there for Patriot, which is being \nupgraded to a new, better system than that which we had at the time of \nthe Persian Gulf war. It will not be there for improving the Aegis \nsystem, which will provide area defense for our Navy.\n  I went with the Senator from Hawaii during the last recess to Hawaii \nand looked at some of the systems that are being tested now. They are \njust being tested, Mr. President. They are not capable of going into \nproduction yet. We went to classified bases and saw some of the things \nthey are doing. They are very good. We have to have those systems to \ncombat what is out there now.\n  Russia is selling arms to the world. So is France. Many of our people \nare selling arms out there. We talked about this problem that happened \nin the Persian Gulf war when we found systems our allies were using \nwere in the hands of Iraq at the same time.\n\n  We have to design and produce and deploy systems that are capable of \nmeeting any challenge that you can conceive now, in the next century. \nThe difficulty is, some of the challenges we face we might not be able \nto conceive. So we continue our research. We continue our basic \nresearch to develop new systems to defend this country's interests.\n  I think if we do not have the money called for in this budget--and I \ncongratulate the Senator from New Mexico for his wisdom in putting it \nout--we will face a series of reductions in our effort before the turn \nof the century.\n  The Senator from Arkansas says, ``Look at the budget. The President's \nbudget is just $11 billion different from the budget that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has presented over the 6-year period.'' That is true. \nThat is true. But if you want to look at it in terms of defense, it \ndeclines continually until the year 2000. What is the year 2000? The \nend of the next Presidential term.\n  What happens in 2001 and 2002? Mysteriously, substantial funds are \nready for defense; more money than cut in the last 5 years is ready for \nthe Presidency, starting in 2001. Is that not a miracle? A real \nmiracle. Whoever is President in 2001 will have to have a new monetary \nsystem to finance what is proposed in the President's budget for \ndefense. It is a false, phony budget. We need to correct that now.\n  We cannot have a decline in defense over a period of 4 more years and \nexpect in 2 years, magically, after the turn of the century, we will \nhave an enormous increase in spending. That is false. It is fake. You \ncannot rely on it. You cannot rely on it in terms of the defense of \nthis country and our interests well into the next century.\n  I will say in terms of the comments made by the Senator from \nArkansas, we have some very basic differences even when we look out \ninto the future, because I want systems that will be capable of meeting \nthose threats that we can project now through analyzing what we know \nother countries are doing.\n  My area of Alaska is adjacent to the north Pacific. Six of the seven \nlargest armies of the world are active in the Pacific region today, Mr. \nPresident. If you look at the national intelligence estimate, it says \nthe continental United States does not have any threat for missiles for \n15 years. Senator Inouye and I say: What about Alaska and Hawaii? Well, \nthat is another thing. North Korea and Iran have missiles that can \nreach our States now, and the President wants to ignore the missile \ndefense systems of this country.\n\n  I say defeat this amendment and get back to the business of restoring \nthe capability of our military well into the next century. That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has control of the \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have we agreed on the order of any others?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. The unanimous consent has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to Senators, any Senator that wants to speak \non the defense amendment on our side, and I think I am speaking for \nyour side, we want to try to vote here early in the evening, not late \nin the evening. If they could let us know if they want to debate so we \ncan start allocating enough time.\n  Senator Exon is here and is willing to take that up with his side. \nSenator Grassley has 20 minutes left.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I promised the Senator from Massachusetts I would give \nhim 4 minutes, but while I am standing here and have the floor, I will \nsay I hope that if you are going to take time off of your bill, that \nSenator Exon would take time so we could have equal time on my \namendment--if there is time coming off the bill after our time runs \nout.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Iowa made a point that I would like to \nmake. Everyone wants to know when we will vote. We have 21 minutes left \non the allotted time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I was not planning on going over.\n  Mr. EXON. It all depends on how much time you continue to yield in \nexcess of the amount that was allotted to your side of the debate. We \nare not going to sit here and let you keep yielding time and then beat \nus over the head because you do not have a vote. We have 21 minutes \nleft under the original agreement by the Senator from Iowa. I hope we \nintend to use that time, but no more. I will yield time off if you are \ngoing to continue to yield 10 and 15 minutes to people to speak against \nit. All I am asking for is fairness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, it may be fair. If we need more time, you can \nhave more time. That is fairness. We have Senators that want to speak \non this amendment. We will accommodate them. There is a lot of time on \nthis budget resolution. We will accommodate you. How much time has the \nmajority used in opposition to the Grassley amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has used 62 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have three additional speakers on our side. The \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, how much time did you want?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 5 for the Senator from New Mexico, so we \nneed 20 additional minutes. Also, Senator Cohen wants 6 minutes, so we \nwill need 30 minutes on our side.\n  Senator Exon, however you want to handle it, if you want to use 30 \nmore minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. If we are not going to go over that, we would allow you to \ncontinue, but it is we who are trying to expedite the matter. If \nSenator Grassley controls the time, and, as I understand it he has 21 \nminutes left, if we have now reached an agreement on how much time you \nare going to continue to yield, I say to the chairman of the committee, \nthen we might be able to hold to our side to 21 minutes, which I point \nout gives your side considerably more time in opposition to the \namendment than the time we are using in support of it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe, for the benefit of all the Senators, not just \nthose on the floor, we can reach an agreement. If we need 30 minutes \nand the Senator has 20, if we extend that to 30, that would be an hour. \nCould we plan to vote at 7 o'clock? I think your side desires that. Or \nmaybe we can make it 6:50. That is an hour. You get half an hour and we \nget half an hour.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould like to inquire. Was there an order of speaking being asked for, \nor might we have an alternative process here, seeking proponents and \nopponents?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to work it out as fairly as we can. We do \nnot intend to keep anybody here. Other Senators have been waiting a \nlong time. If\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\nwe can get the hour locked in, a half hour each, Senator Exon and I can \nwork out the order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour, equally divided, on the \nGrassley amendment, after which we vote on or in relation to that \namendment, and that we control 30 minutes, and Senator Grassley and \nExon control the other 30 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Does that include the 21 minutes Senator Grassley has \nremaining?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes; a total of 1 hour, and at 6:50 we would vote.\n  Mr. EXON. What the Senator is saying is that although you have used \nmore time than we have, you want to divide the remainder of the time \nequally?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, [Mr. Grassley], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield me 10 \nseconds?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, the distinguished Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I request that I follow \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina with 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Following the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from South \nCarolina will be recognized for 10 minutes, followed by the Senator \nfrom Virginia for up to 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa, as a cosponsor thereof. I begin my comments by \nsaying that, like most of us here, we all care enormously about the \nability of the United States to carry out its responsibilities and to \nhave a military that is second to nobody in the world. I believe we \nhave that military, and I think that it is vital in the post-cold-war \nperiod to begin to make a tougher set of judgments about how we are \nspending money, what our priorities are within the military, to \nguarantee that the reforms that we are promised are delivered on, and \nto guarantee that we are making choices about technology that are \ntotally connected to the nature and definition of threat. I agree with \nthe Senator from Alaska that nobody can say with specificity exactly \nwhich country will emerge, but we can make some pretty good judgments \nabout what is happening in the world.\n  I have a chart here, and, regrettably, it is not blown up, but it \ndoes not take very much vision to see that there is only one \nsignificant bar on the entire graph. All of the others are very, very \nsmall compared to the expenditure of the United States in the $260-\nbillion-plus mark.\n  China is the next largest expenditure in the world, with somewhere in \nthe vicinity--it is hard to figure out exactly--of $30 billion-plus. So \nwe have $30 billion or so in China. The People's Liberation Army today \nis engaged in making CD's and engaged in pirating intellectual property \nin order to support the military. We know that their modernization \nprogram is not, by most intelligence analysts' determination, geared \nfor expansionism. It is geared toward modernization. Most military \nintelligence analyst experts do not suggest that there is, at this \nmoment, some enormous threat. We are supplying arms to Taiwan, and I \nthink our combined threat with respect to Taiwan is fairly significant.\n  China is the first of those sort of potential adversaries--if we \nwanted to put them in that category--that comes even close in terms of \nthe next expenditures. But before China, the next highest expenditures \nin the world are Russia, now an ally; France, an ally; Japan, an ally; \nGermany, an ally; Britain, an ally. After China, you go to Italy, an \nally; Saudi Arabia, an ally; South Korea, an ally; Taiwan, an ally; \nCanada, an ally; India, an ally; Spain, an ally; Australia, an ally; \nTurkey, an ally; Netherlands, an ally; Brazil, an ally; Israel, an \nally; Sweden, an ally; and finally you get to North Korea.\n\n  So you can look at all the potential threats of the world, and when \nyou add the expenditures of all of our allies to the United States of \nAmerica, you have to stop and say to yourself, ``What is it that we are \nreally preparing for in a post-cold-war world?''\n  Mr. President, if you look at the potential weapons of most of these \npotential threats, you look at Syria, or North Korea, or China. The \nrelative difference between Iraq, prewar, and those countries' weapons \ntoday is not really that enormous. Iraq, prewar, had 338 combat \naircraft and 700 tanks. Iran, today, has less aircraft and marginally \nmore tanks. North Korea has significantly less aircraft and maybe 3 \ntimes as many tanks. But we saw what the military of the United States \nwas able to do in a matter of hours, let alone days, let alone weeks. \nThe notion that we have to be proceeding to invest at a rate that is \ncommensurate with the pre-cold-war period is simply irrational.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest that all the talk about the United \nStates' military capacity being threatened by this amendment is just \ntalk. It has no relationship to the reality of the threat or to what is \nhappening in the world. We in the U.S. Senate ought to make a tougher \nset of judgments about our military expenditures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, prior to my remarks on this bill, I \ncommend the able Senator from New Mexico for the fine job he does on \nthe Budget Committee, and especially his attitude and what he has done \nfor defense.\n  I rise to oppose the Grassley amendment, which would reduce defense \nspending from the $265.6 billion of the proposed budget resolution to \n$257.3 billion. I understand that the amendment would, however, make \nadditional funds available to the President if he certifies a \nrequirement for such additional funds. This is an unprecedented \napproach and an unnecessary and inappropriate transfer of power and \nauthority from the legislative branch to the executive branch.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. The amendment of the Senator from \nIowa is really a nullification of 75 percent of the Budget Committee's \nrecommended increase to the President's budget request. Why would the \nPresident, who has already submitted his budget request, certify to the \nCongress that he needs additional funds for quality of life, \nmodernization or readiness programs? Further, if he did request \nadditional funds, those funds would likely be for programs that have \nnot been directed by the Congress. We must all remember that the \nConstitution gives the Congress, not the President, the power to \n``raise and support armies,'' and ``to provide and maintain a navy.''\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Budget Committee has acted wisely \nand prudently in recommdending an increase to the President's \ninadequate request for defense.\n  In order to buy the same level of national security in 1997 as we did \nin 1996, we would have to spend $273 billion. The President's request \nis $18.6 billion below this. The budget resolution proposes to increase \nthe budget for defense by $11.2 billion; therefore, we are still $7.4 \nbillion below the fiscal year 1996 level of funding in real terms. Does \nthe Senator from Iowa believe that our Armed Forces will be asked to do \nless in fiscal year 1997 than they did in fiscal year 1996? I ask him \nto answer that.\n  The question we should be asking, therefore, is not whether we should \nincrease the President's inadequate budget request by a minimal amount; \nrather the question should be: What risks are we taking by not adding \nmore? Our Nation's top military leaders answer that question.\n\n  General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, says he is \n``very concerned that our procurement accounts are not where they ought \nto be.''\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n  General Reimer, Army Chief of Staff, says that ``further deferral of \nmodernization will incur significant risk to future readiness.''\n  Admiral Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations, says ``If we do not \nmodernize, we ultimately place future readiness at risk.''\n  General Fogleman, Air Force Chief of Staff, says that ``Unless we \nrecapitalize, we are not going to be ready to meet the threats of the \nfuture.''\n  And General Krulak, Marine Corps Commandant, says that ``The Marine \nCorps * * * cannot absorb further reductions without sacrificing \ncritical core capabilities.''\n  These statements of our top military officers were made in open \ncommittee hearings. If they were free from political concerns, one \ncould expect an even more candid, and dire, assessment. Even Secretary \nof Defense Perry has acknowledged that ``we have to start increasing \nthe modernization program or, we will start to have a real problem of \nobsolescence in the field.'' The Clinton administration has certainly \nachieved consensus among the services and the Department of Defense, \nbut in a way that the Goldwater-Nichols Act never envisioned.\n  Our defense needs are underfunded, from both a historical and \noperational point of view. We are at the lowest level of defense \nspending since 1950. Procurement has been reduced by 70 percent since \n1985, and by more than 40 percent under the Clinton administration. \nPrograms to support our servicemen and women's quality of life are \ninadequate. Our ability to protect our soldiers from ballistic missile \nattacks suffers from lack of funding and commitment. Our military \nresearch and development is anemic. If anything, we should be \nconsidering amendments which provide floors--not ceilings--on defense \nfunding.\n  I realize that our great Nation has numerous domestic and \ninternational obligations. But none--I repeat none--of these \nobligations rises to the level of our responsibility to provide for the \ncommon defense. Protection of our Nation's citizens is the Federal \nGovernment's first order of business. Without meeting this paramount \nobligation, the basic guarantees of ``life, liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness'' can easily become empty promises.\n  Defense spending is now at its lowest level in the second half of \nthis century. This half century has been the era of American superpower \nstatus. Our superpower status is not something we can maintain cheaply. \nWe won the cold war through our steadfastness and robust military \ncapabilities. Yet, we are asked by the administration and supporters of \nthis amendment to continue undermining our military capabilities.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate will agree with me that we cannot \nafford for our Nation to be less vigilant, less capable, and less \nready. I strongly urge the Senate to vote against the Grassley \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is now recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to follow on the statements of the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee when he said the modernization \nfor the 1996 fiscal year decline represents the 40-year low since 1950. \nSo I went back and I looked at a chart which shows exactly what we \nbought just 10 years ago. To give you an example, 10 years ago, in \n1986, the number of tanks we purchased in the field was 840. This year \nwe purchased zero tanks. In 1986, tactical aircraft, 399 tactical \naircraft; this year, 1997, 34. Most alarming of all, Mr. President, is \nthe purchase of naval ships. In 1986, we purchased 40; in 1997, a mere \n6. That is a clear indication, Mr. President, of the decline in the \nequipment.\n  When the members of the Joint Chiefs came before our committee, I, \ntogether with other Senators, asked each this question: First, what is \nthe condition, say, of the Navy today? And the answer very proudly \ngiven by the Chiefs is it is in the best condition, it is ready, and it \nis well equipped. Then we asked with this level of procurement, what \nwill your successor be able to say 10 years hence? And it is 10 years \nfrom the drawing board to the operational status of most of your major \nweapons systems, ships, aircraft, tanks, and the like. Each and every \none of those Chiefs looked at the members of the committee, and you \ncould read their faces. ``We cannot give you an answer as to what our \nsuccessor a decade hence with this level of procurement would be able \nto testify today with respect to the Armed Forces of the United \nStates.''\n  Mr. President, I am quite puzzled over this amendment because it is \nso clear that we need these forces. We need this money.\n  But I went back and looked at some polling data as to how the United \nStates say 10, or 15 years ago viewed our defense situation. And \nclearly about half of the people ranked up there at No. 1, or No. 2, in \ntheir concerns about the security of the United States and how that \nappears in polling data today. Mr. President, the top item is the \nbalanced budget, 26 percent; morale, 14 percent; crime, 11; taxes, 10; \nwelfare, 10; jobs, 8; national defense--only 4 percent of the people \nare concerned; that low level of people, directly in conflict with the \ninformation that has been discussed on this floor about the threat that \nis poised against the United States.\n  The Defense Intelligence Agency looked back 10 years and found but \nmaybe 30 different spots of the world which we termed as ``hot spots'' \ninto which our troops might be called. That was 10 years ago. Today, \nthat is number is 60 areas of the world into which our troops might be \ncalled to defend freedom, or the security interests of the United \nStates.\n\n  So, Mr. President, while the public may think that we are safe and \nsecure today, the reality is this is a very troubled world. I think it \nis our obligation to ensure that today, tomorrow, and in the years to \ncome we are buying adequate numbers of ships, aircraft, and other items \nsuch that the men and women of the Armed Forces will remain as they are \ntoday--the best equipped in the world. We owe no less obligation to \nthose who volunteer to proudly wear the uniform of the United States.\n  This amendment would cut $8.3 billion from the defense budget number \nreported out by the Budget Committee, and bring us almost back down to \nthe inadequate level of defense spending requested by the President.\n  We have heard a lot during this debate about the increase in the \ndefense budget contained in the budget resolution. There is no \nincrease. What the Budget Committee has done is simply slow the rate of \ndecline.\n  But even with the defense number reported out of the Budget \nCommittee--$265.6 billion--the defense budget will decrease in real \nterms from the fiscal year 1996 level by $7.4 billion. This year will \nmark the 12th straight year of declining defense budgets--even without \nthe additional cuts proposed in this amendment. Enough is enough.\n  U.S. troops are currently deployed in 10 separate military operations \noverseas. From Bosnia to the Persian Gulf, from the Adriatic Sea to the \nTaiwan Strait, we are calling on the men and women of the Armed Forces \nat an ever-increasing rate. The end of the cold war did not bring peace \nand harmony to the world.\n  It is our responsibility to provide our troops with adequate \nresources so they can effectively and safely perform their missions. We \nmust not condemn them to enter the battlefield ill-prepared, with \noutdated equipment. As Army Chief of Staff Reimer told the Armed \nServices Committee in March, ``In the event of a conflict, a lack of \nmodern equipment will cost the lives of brave soldiers.''\n  In testimony this year before the Armed Services Committee, our \nmilitary leaders were candid about their assessment of funding \nrequirements, and their concerns with the level of funding proposed by \nthe President.\n  They recognize that today's military is second to none as a result of \nactions taken 10 years ago. I told all of the service chiefs that their \nchallenge today is to ensure that the military leaders 10 years hence \nhave the forces and equipment they will need to protect our Nation's \ninterest. It was clear from their testimony that the budget submitted \nby the President would not provide for that capability.\n  Because of the Armed Services Committee's concerns with the low level \nof funding contained in the President's request, the committee \nrequested each\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\nof the services to provide a list of urgent requirements that were \nunfunded in the administration's request. These lists totaled over $20 \nbillion, and were used as a guide by the committee in adding $12.9 \nbillion during our recent markup.\n\n  I was particularly concerned that the Clinton budget would continue \nthe precipitous decline in the procurement accounts--or as Admiral \nOwens has called it, the crisis in procurement.\n  Despite promises last year from Administration officials that the \nmodernization ramp up would begin in fiscal year 1997, the decline \ncontinues. We are now at a 40-year low--not since the start of the \nKorean war have we spent so little on purchasing new weapons for our \ntroops.\n  To give just a few examples--in fiscal year 1986, we purchased 840 \nnew tanks, this year, no new tanks were requested; in fiscal year 1986, \nwe purchased almost 400 new tactical aircraft, this year, 34 new \ntactical aircraft were requested; and in fiscal year 1986, we purchased \n40 new ships this year, only 6 new ships were requested.\n  Even though the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously recommended a \nprocurement budget of $60 billion as soon as possible, the \nadministration proposed a budget of only $38.9 billion for procurement \nin fiscal year 1997. Ten years ago, the procurement budget was over \n$100 billion in 1997 dollars. If the administration has its way, the \n$60 billion procurement budget recommended by the Joint Chiefs will not \nbe seen until fiscal year 2001.\n  We cannot afford to further delay the recapitalization and \nmodernization of our military equipment. Our troops in the field a \ndecade hence will inherit outdated, obsolete equipment if we allow this \nprocurement decline to continue.\n  During markup, the Armed Services Committee added almost $8 billion \nto these vital procurement accounts. This will not solve the problem, \nbut it is a step in the right direction. We must not backslide now from \nour determination to adequately modernize the force.\n  I share my colleagues' desire for deficit reduction. But placing at \nrisk the security of this Nation and the lives of our troops is not the \nway to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Our defense budget is already at its lowest level--in real terms--\nsince 1950. We cannot afford to go any lower.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, did we not have any other agreements?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order that was the last speaker, the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am perfectly willing to wait for the Senator from \nIowa, if he wants to use some of the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will be glad to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, we have been hearing from \na lot of very competent Senators who are members of Defense \nAppropriations, who are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nwho have the responsibility to make sure that we meet our defense \nneeds.\n  I compliment them for doing that. We have people on the Armed \nServices Committee who are using budget arguments rather than national \nsecurity arguments. I think if they want more money for defense, they \nhave to be able to justify it on national security grounds. While I \nhave these good friends of mine who are members of this committee \nsaying why we ought to spend more, one of the reasons I feel very good \nabout having Senator Exon as a cosponsor of my amendment is because he \nbrings good judgment to this issue because he sits both as a senior \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee and he is also the senior \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee. So I believe that Senator Exon as \nwell has a point of view that he can bring to this, and I thank him for \ndoing that, but I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle who \noppose what I am doing know that we have taken both the national \nsecurity argument and the budget argument into consideration.\n  Senator Stevens has suggested that the defense budget should not be \ndefined and sized to the threat as we know it today. There may be some \nunknown threat out there, I would have to admit, but we do not know \nabout it. But that is not how it is done. We always determine the size \nof the budget by the threat that we see today and in the future. What \nwe see is a dramatic decrease in the threat, so why should the budget \ngo up? The budget should not go up. That is why I have my amendment \nhere.\n  I say to my good friend from New Mexico, the remarks that he made in \nthe opening of the debate against my amendment are macrobudget \narguments, not national security arguments. The fact is the Soviet \nthreat is history. In constant dollars, we are still very close to the \ncold war spending average. What is more, this budget is not based on a \nvalid national security strategy. It is based on an outdated strategy. \nIt is a cold war strategy.\n  Furthermore, history shows more money does not mean defense if \nreforms are not made. And they have not been made despite the promises. \nThe Secretary of Defense has said modernization would be paid for \nthrough reform savings. That would take care of the concerns of the \nSenator from New Mexico. But we have not seen the savings. The \nresponsible way is to force the savings to occur so we will have the \nmoney for modernization. Otherwise, we are just throwing good money \nafter bad.\n  When will we learn, I ask my colleagues, that it is not the proper \nway to do things, that it just encourages more abuse of the taxpayers' \ndollars. I guess I would beg my colleagues, particularly those on this \nside of the aisle, to consider the same sort of intense look at \nspending that you do when you look at domestic programs. You always \nwant to make the other side of the aisle understand that throwing money \nat a problem does not solve the problem. We tell them, the liberals of \nthis body, that it is how you spend the money, not how much you spend.\n\n  When are we going to learn that that same principle which fiscal \nconservatives use against the liberals of this town on domestic social \nprograms also applies to the defense budget?\n  Those arguments that are made by my colleagues are more budget \narguments than they are national security arguments, and I think that \nis why they miss the point. Many of my colleagues then want to keep \npumping up the defense budget. I say it makes no sense at all. Not only \ndoes it make no sense; it defies reason. It defies understanding.\n  Threats to our national security, that is the engine that is supposed \nto drive the defense budget, but in this debate we do not see it \ndriving. It is strictly a budget argument: More dollars are going to \naccomplish more defense. Not so. That point was brought home nicely in \nColin Powell's book, ``My American Journey.'' This is what General \nPowell said he learned during a tour of duty with the National Security \nCouncil, and I quote from page 340:\n\n       Overarching all other concerns was our relationship with \n     the Soviet Union. Our defense strategy and budget were almost \n     wholly a reflection of Soviet capabilities and intentions as \n     we read them. The size and the state of the Red Army were the \n     measures against which we built our forces.\n\n  So for Senator Cohen, who raised the question of, do we know about \nthe Soviet threat, well, Colin Powell says we know about that threat. \nWe made our judgments based on that threat. That is the word from the \nlast Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The military power of the Soviet Union was a principal driver behind \nour defense budget. Well, the Soviet Union is history. Russia might not \nbe history, but things are changing there. The threat is gone. We all \nagree the cold war is over. Using General Powell's ruler as a guide, \nthe defense budget should be coming down, not going up. When the Soviet \nUnion went down, our defense budget should have come down.\n  Now, I know we still live in a dangerous, unstable world. I admit \nthat. I know we have vital interests overseas that we want to be able \nto give direction to, and the military is one way of doing that. I \nsuppose I have to realize the live fire maneuvers of Communist China \nover the Taiwan Strait is a\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\nharsh reminder of that. We need a strong defense. We can have a strong \ndefense, but that defense has to be defined within the concept of our \nbudget needs. It has to be defined in a way that is attainable. It is \ndifferent now than it was before the fall of the Soviet Union. I think \nPresident Clinton is providing one.\n\n  For those of you who have some doubt, I have given you the benefit of \nthat doubt. In fact, the numbers in this amendment are dictated through \nour cooperation with Senator Exon because, sitting on the committee, he \nfelt that there should be maybe some leeway. I am willing to give that \nleeway based upon the judgment of a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  President Clinton has the defense budget on the right track. He has \nit on the right glidepath. A smaller threat requires a smaller defense \nbudget. President Clinton's $254.3 billion request for fiscal year 1997 \nreflects that change in threat. His budget addresses our real defense \nneeds in the post cold war. There is just one problem, though, with his \nbudget. The bureaucratic machine at the Pentagon is still running on \ncold war inertia. Pentagon bureaucrats are trying to craft a cold war \nprogram with a post-cold-war budget. That is going to lead us to \ntrouble. It is going to lead us to another hollow force like we had in \nthe 1970's. The cold war warriors will have to rob the readiness \naccount to pay for all their cold war programs. They have to rob the \nreadiness account because the cold war programs are all underfunded. \nThey are all underfunded because their outrageous price tags cannot be \njustified without a Soviet threat.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Cohen desired some additional \ntime. How much did the Senator want?\n  Mr. COHEN. How much time does the Senator have?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes. Does Senator Stevens want 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes each, all right, in that order.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, it is curious, and I should say \n``curiouser,'' as I sit in the Chamber and listen to this debate. My \ncolleague from Iowa says we are going to throw good money after bad.\n  Are you saying that we are throwing bad money at our systems? Is that \nwhat we tell the American people? Is that what we tell the men and \nwomen in the service, that we have been throwing bad money at them? Was \nit bad money that we spent on the stealth fighter aircraft that were \nable to take out the Iraqi defense in a matter of a few hours? Was it \nbad money that we spent on cruise missiles that we used to take out \ntheir weapon storage facilities? Was it wasted money we spent on Aegis \ndestroyers, one of the most sophisticated systems that we have?\n\n  General Powell did not fight the Soviets. He fought the Iraqis in 4 \ndays. He fought them in 4 days because we had the strategy and the \ncapability to take down their army in that period of time with limited \nloss of life. I daresay, if we want to quote from pages other than page \n320 of General Powell's book --we should not engage in selective \nquotation because a quote taken out of context can be used as a \npretext. I doubt very much whether General Powell is saying that the \nPresident's budget is adequate to meet the threats of the future.\n  I have page after page of statements coming from our service Chiefs. \nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, ``I am very concerned our procurement \naccounts are not where I think they ought to be * * * [We] must commit \nourselves to a sufficient procurement goal, a goal I judge to be \napproximately $60 billion annually.''\n  Chief of Staff of the Air Force: ``Unless we recapitalize, we are not \ngoing to be ready to meet the threats of the future.''\n  Chief of Staff of the Army, General Dennis Reimer: ``Further deferral \nof modernization will incur significant risk to future readiness.''\n  Adm. William Owens, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, ``I want to \ntalk about procurement because I believe it is the crisis in the \ndefense budget today,'' and on and on, page after page. These are the \npeople who are seeking to throw good money after bad?\n  Mr. President, it is really ironic, this whole debate. Last year we \nhad the same thing, the same sort of approach. We have people coming \nup, supporting an amendment such as this--the same people who get on \nthe floor here and vote to cut back on defense spending because they \nthink it is too much, and yet they send us letters. I will not take the \ntime or embarrass the Members who have sent these letters. Here is the \ncompilation of all the letters Members sent to us, ``Please, we need \nmore money for defense.''\n  I have talked to my colleague from Alaska. Mr. President, 60 percent \nof the people who wrote these letters here to the Defense Authorization \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee --their requests were \ncomplied with--they come on the floor and they vote against the \nspending. And they say, ``By the way, do you think you can help us out, \nwe think we need more assistance in these systems?'' So the same people \nwho are cutting the defense budget request here end up getting the \nsystems funded so they can stand proudly on the floor and say, ``I am \nfor lower defense but, my God, please help spend some more money for \nour projects.''\n  I think it is time we put an end to that. I think it is time we put \nan end to Members saying ``We need more for defense'' who then come to \nthe floor and posture, saying, ``We are for lower defense spending, the \ncold war is over.''\n  I do not think there is anybody on the floor who can tell you what \nthe threats are going to be in the future, 5 or 10 years out. We have \nto start procuring today to meet those threats as best we can. You \ncannot wait until the threat occurs and then decide you want to build \nmore submarines or cruise missiles or aircraft or tanks. We have to \nstart the procurement now.\n  The President of the United States said we were going to increase \nprocurement 2 years ago, in 1996. He did not do it. He broke that \npromise. He said wait until next year, 1997. He broke that promise, \ntoo. Now we are told just give us until 1998 and once again procurement \nwill go on the upswing.\n  It is our responsibility to listen to the service Chiefs, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the ones who are writing us saying, ``We can use more. \nYes, we can live with this budget the President has submitted if we \nhave to. We are on the ragged edge right now. We do not know what \ntomorrow will bring. You have to give us more assistance here. We need \nmore assistance if you can give it to us.''\n  That is what they have been saying. For the first time this year, as \ncompared to all other years where they have previously said we can live \nwithin the budget, now they are saying we could use a little bit more. \nThey have been honest about it. They have come to us.\n\n  I have a list some two pages long totaling $21.1 billion that the \nservice Chiefs have indicated to us they could use for modernization \nand procurement accounts, funding that is needed to meet the future \nthreats. Yet, sure, they will come up and swear, take an oath, and say, \n``We can live with it if we have to. But we are telling you we need \nmore.''\n  The Members who write to us saying give us more, they ought not come \nto the floor today and vote for this amendment and say we are going to \nvote to cut defense and then come back later and say we want our \nsystems funded.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you from this Member's point of view, I am \ngoing to see to it that all of those requests are denied and deleted, \nif that is the case, because they cannot have it both ways. You cannot \nsay you want more for defense privately and get on the floor and say we \nare going to cut it publicly.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a chart here that shows the \nsituation in the last 10 years. We have three basic types of spending: \nDefense discretionary, domestic discretionary, mandatory spending. In \n1987, in terms of 1997 dollars, we had almost $375 billion in defense \nmoney. The discretionary spending was considerably less than that, and \nthis the entitlement, the mandatory spending in this year. In our \nbudget it is down 34 percent from\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\n1987 for defense. It is up 31 percent in terms of discretionary \nspending, domestic discretionary. And it is up 41 percent in terms of \nmandatory spending. We have, in fact, as the Senator from Iowa \ndemanded, reduced spending. We have reduced spending by 71 percent in \nterms of procurement in defense. Our money for defense is 71 percent \nless than it was before. We have reduced manpower down. Even though it \nis voluntary, we still have reduced manpower by 33 percent.\n  I have the same comment that the Senator from Maine has made. I have \nhere the list of last year, the requests from Members that came to the \ndefense appropriations subcommittee, for Members' add-ons. About 20 \npercent of them were actually mentioned in the President's budget, but \neven those, most of them, the request was to increase the President's \nbudget. This is the book of all the letters that we received from \nMembers. We accommodated, as the Senator from Maine said, approximately \n60 percent, almost every request we got from Members and, I might say, \nabout 60 percent to the Armed Services or the Appropriations Committee \nwere added on.\n  There you are, the Members who want to see how they succeeded last \nyear in adding money to the budget, there it is. The reason we are able \nto do that is because we won the battle with the President. We added \nmoney last year.\n  This time the President has come down from even the amount that he \nagreed to for 1995. In any event, we are going to be cutting from the \n1995 level for next year.\n  I agree with the Senator from Maine, there is no way that we can \naccept the concept of having people vote to cut the money and then come \nin and tell us their State absolutely needs additions to even the \nbudget prepared by the Budget Committee. We did that. We even added to \nthe levels of the Armed Services Committee in the appropriations \nprocess, and Members will remember that argument on the floor.\n  But this is unconscionable. When you look at it--just take the C-17. \nRight after the turn of the century the only airlift we will have to \ntake our Armed Forces overseas will be the C-17. We originally were \ngoing to order 240 of them. The President's request comes down to 120. \nMind you, that will be the only transport beyond the year 2006. I do \nnot understand people when they say you have to cut that even further. \nThe President's level will take it to 120. There is no way we can \nproject our capability to defend this country with these continued \nchanges.\n  The Senator from Virginia was here. He mentioned to us about the time \nfour of us here, Senator Inouye, myself, Senator Warner, and Senator \nNunn, sat in Israel when we awaited the incoming Scud, the missile that \nwas shot at Tel Aviv while we were there. Thank God there was a Patriot \nthere and thank God it did glance off that Scud and the four of us are \nhere because of that.\n  But the President's budget cuts missile defense and 77 percent of the \npeople think we now have the capability of defending this country \nagainst missiles, which is not true. Not unless we spend some of the \nmoney that is absolutely necessary.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Did the Senator want to ask a question?\n  Mr. COHEN. I was just going to ask, my understanding was that the \nPresident went to California and said we needed more C-17's, not fewer. \nSo we have people going out to the local districts, or States which are \npolitically populous, and appealing for votes in the fall, saying, \n``Gee, how can we help you? Can we keep that base open? We are not \ngoing to shut down a facility in Texas or California, we are going to \nkeep it open,'' in order to purchase votes. I think the time has come \nfor us to listen to what the service Chiefs and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs are saying, I say to my colleague from Alaska: They need \nmore not less.\n  The President submitted a budget, and that budget has defined the \nnational security needs. What the military people are really saying is, \n``We're at the edge. We have to start ramping up on procurement. We \nshould have done it 2 years ago. We don't need it next year; we need it \nnow.''\n  I support what the Senator from Alaska is saying. We cannot afford to \ncontinue to do this. When my colleague from Massachusetts says what \nhappens when we are spending more money than our friends from Germany, \nJapan, Italy, or all of our allies, when the 911 call goes out, are we \ngoing to send the British fleet to Taiwan? Are we going to send the \nItalian fleet or the German fleet?\n  The fact of the matter is, we are the superpower. If we can change \nthat, we can say, ``We don't want to be a stabilizing force in Europe \nor Asia.'' If that is the case, let us make that determination, but we \nought not to do what we are doing now, and that is, constantly rob \nprocurement in order to keep ready and then keep ready by overutilizing \nthe ever-diminishing inventory that we have.\n  We have to make procurement changes. The President is unwilling to do \nso in an election year, saying, ``Wait until next year; wait until I \nget by 1996; wait until 1997 or 1998.'' We cannot afford to do that \nunless we are willing to place our men and women in jeopardy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Beyond that, I wonder how many people drive to work in \nthe Senate in 30-year-old vehicles. The people who are flying our \nplanes are flying planes made 30 years ago. By the turn of the century, \nevery plane we have in the inventory will be 30 years old, except for \nthe B-2 and F-117.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I have finished my \ncomments. I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, you just heard the last two arguments. The basis of \nthose arguments is blue smoke. The savings promised--now I am talking \nabout savings promised--by the Defense Department through \ninfrastructure reforms should have occurred regardless of all these \nletters that have been referenced here, all the letters that my friends \nare referring to.\n  The money was supposed to go toward modernization, but it did not \nmaterialize. I will not tolerate throwing good money after bad, and \nthat is why I am offering this amendment.\n  I want to elaborate just a little bit on savings promised that never \nmaterialized. I want to say that there is another good colleague of \nours, Senator John McCain, who is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He put out a white paper entitled ``Ready Tomorrow: \nDefending America's Interest in the 21st Century.'' On page 23, he had \nthis to say:\n\n       We must, therefore, look for ways to do more with less, and \n     we must make the hard choices to ensure the best military \n     force within the limited resources available for defense.\n\n  That is the essence of my amendment. I am not saying Senator McCain \nis for my amendment. I am just saying Senator McCain is a member of the \nArmed Services Committee and in that one sentence and throughout his \nentire paper lays out a basis to end this belief that we have around \nhere, particularly on this side of the aisle, that all you have to do \nis throw more money at defense and you get more defense.\n\n  If I thought that the Defense Department was trying to save money, I \nmight feel differently about adding $11.3 billion to the defense \nbudget. The extra $11.3 billion would be used primarily for \nmodernization.\n  The weapons and equipment that the military purchased over the past \n20 years obviously is starting to age. If we are to maintain our \nmilitary edge in the future, then we must begin to replace all this \nstuff at some point. I agree, but my Republican colleagues want the \nextra $11.3 billion to get the ball rolling, and I do not think that \nball is ever going to roll.\n  From day one, senior defense officials, like Secretary Perry, have \nbeen making an important promise: New weapons would be bought with \nsavings from lower infrastructure costs.\n  Mr. President, all the evidence indicates that the promised savings \nare nowhere on the horizon. The General Accounting Office has just \ncompleted a review of the defense infrastructure costs. Infrastructure \ndollars are spent to maintain the bases, facilities, and activities \nthat house and sustain the armed services. They are support costs.\n  In a nutshell, this is what the GAO found:\n\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\n\n       Despite four rounds of base closures and dramatic and \n     continuing cuts in force structure, there are no savings.\n\n  Defense infrastructure costs are going up, not down. The driving \nforce behind the base closure effort was to save money by reducing \noverhead. Our base structure exceeded the needs of our sinking force \nstructure. The whole idea was to close excess bases and to save money.\n  Once again, savings promised by the Pentagon have evaporated into \nthin air. Here was a golden opportunity to save money, and the Pentagon \nblew it.\n  I know base closings require upfront costs, in some cases \nsubstantial. But upfront costs are supposed to be followed by \ndownstream savings. That is Mr. Perry's promise; that is Mr. Perry's \ntestimony before the committee. He has identified $10 billion in \nsavings. Mr. Perry promised the money would be used for the \nmodernization that my colleagues are calling for here.\n  That is fine and dandy, but where is the $10 billion in savings? The \nGAO cannot find the money. It has audited the books and finds \ninfrastructure costs will rise significantly in the outyears.\n  It is true, base closings did, in fact, produce some real savings, \nbut underscore ``did,'' which is past tense. Unfortunately, as soon as \nthose savings popped up on the radar screen, Pentagon bureaucrats \ngrabbed the money and spent it. The money is not being plowed into \nmodernization and readiness, as Mr. Perry promised. Those savings are \nbeing diverted into new infrastructure projects, like new headquarters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I give myself 1 more minute, and the \nlast minute I give to the Senator from Nebraska to close.\n  If we do not hold the Defense Department's feet to the fire, the \nsavings will be frittered away on pork projects. Base closures and \ncontinued shrinkage in the force structure should have one inescapable \nresult: lower infrastructure costs. I hope my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee will make sure that that happens.\n  I have referred to Senator McCain's white paper. Right at the top of \nSenator McCain's list of places to save money are infrastructure \nrequirements. This is what he has to say:\n\n       Infrastructure and military force structure need to be \n     brought back into balance. Elimination of excess \n     infrastructure would reduce operating costs and free up funds \n     to maintain force readiness and to modernize our smaller \n     force.\n\n  I agree with my friend from Arizona 100 percent. I only hope that \nwhen we get to the defense authorization bill, he will help me find an \nenforcement mechanism. We need an enforcement mechanism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding. Everybody \nwants to know about when we are going to vote. As far as I am \nconcerned, it looks like we can vote shortly after or about 6:45. I am \ngoing to take 5 or 6 minutes, whatever additional time I need, after \nthe 1 minute allotted to me by my friend from Iowa, and I yield myself \nthe time off the bill.\n  I have been listening in total amazement to the statements that have \nbeen made here. First, I want to say in answer to the statement that \nhad been made by the chairman of the committee early on that the \ncommittee of jurisdiction for authorization, the Armed Services \nCommittee, already voted 21 to 0 for the change that we are suggesting \nhere now. I speak for myself and several other members of the Armed \nServices Committee who voted 21 to 0 for the bill, because we thought \nbasically it was a pretty good bill, but just before that vote was \ntaken, this Senator and others indicated that they would be offering \nsome amendments on the floor, including amendments with regard to the \nlevel of funding over the President's mark. That is what I am doing \nnow.\n  I have heard in total amazement here General Shalikashvili, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who put his seal of approval on \nthe President's budget, being quoted tonight as if you would think \nGeneral Shalikashvili was for the increase. He is not. He is not for \nthe increase.\n  These Senators that have been up on the floor saying, ``Well, the \nmilitary says they need it.'' You show me a military man worth his \nsalt, and you go to him and say, ``You know, what more could you use?'' \nI would be shocked and disappointed if such a military man would not \nsay, ``Well, I want this and this and this and this.''\n  The facts are, the President's budget has the stamp of approval of \nGeneral Shalikashvili, the other members of the Joint Chiefs, and the \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States. All of these \ncomments that I have heard on the floor would lead one to believe that \nthis is a group of people who were trying to destroy our national \ndefense.\n  The amendment that I am cosponsoring with my friend from Iowa is \nbeing attacked exactly as was the Exon-Grassley amendment 2 years ago. \nThe same type of phraseology, the same type of wording--``devastating \nnational defense.'' I simply say that if you believe the President of \nthe United States, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Joint \nChiefs themselves, and the Pentagon would put their stamp of approval \non a level of defense spending outlined in the President's budget that \nwas not sufficient, then you are indirectly accusing them of destroying \nthe national defense of the United States of America, if you listen to \nsome of these people on the floor tonight.\n  I think too much of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint \nChiefs to think they would put their stamp of approval on something \njust to kowtow to the President of the United States. I think they are \nbetter, I think they are bigger men than that.\n  I simply say, any time you want to spend more money for defense and \ncall in some military people and say, ``If you had more money, how \nwould you use it?'' of course, they would come up with something. I \nwould be surprised if they did not.\n  I simply say, also, that you would think that Senator Grassley's \namendment, cosponsored by myself and others, was a further cut in \ndefense. It is an increase of $3 billion. It is an increase of $3 \nbillion over what was recommended by the Pentagon. But you have people \non this floor who are so expert, who have sacrificed themselves to be \nin Israel and were saved by a Patriot missile. You know, it is a little \ntoo much for this Senator, who has stood stalwart for defense spending \never since I have been here.\n  So what we are doing with the Grassley amendment is to provide $3 \nbillion more than the Pentagon and the President said was needed. These \npeople who are criticizing this amendment have decided on their own \nthat they are the experts, that they are the ones who know how much \nmoney we should spend for defense, regardless of what the Pentagon and \nthe Commander in Chief says. They want an $11 billion increase.\n  The Grassley amendment says, ``All right. We don't think that much is \nnecessary. Some of us would like to go down to what the Pentagon says \nis needed, but we'll go along with the $3 billion increase.'' But that \nis not enough, evidently, by what I have heard here tonight.\n  I also heard statements--the Senator from Texas, for example, \ncomplained that if the Grassley amendment is adopted, military \npersonnel would not get their 3 percent pay increase, as I understand \nit. The fact of the matter is, that is not accurate. The facts are that \nthe 3 percent increase to the military personnel is included in the \nPresident's budget. The Grassley amendment provides $3 billion over and \nabove that.\n  I simply say that I never have been very much impressed by a group of \nSenators getting together saying they know more about everything, the \nneeds of the national defense, than even the Pentagon. I want to make \nit clear once again that the Pentagon agreed to and gave a stamp of \napproval to the President's budget. It is only these people, who I know \nare well-intentioned--and I know of their good intentions--that have \nsaid, ``No. That's terribly wrong. It will destroy our national \ndefense. So arbitrarily we have come up with $11 billion more that we \nneed for this.'' I would rather trust the real military\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\nleaders and experts in the Pentagon. But I am willing to say, OK, let \nus add $3 billion.\n  I have heard here tonight that if the Grassley amendment is not \ndefeated, it will end all of the work that is being done on Star Wars \nor a version of it. I would simply point out that all of the Star Wars \ntechnology that has been paraded out here in speeches tonight would \nlead one to believe that Star Wars, or a version of it, would not go \nahead if the Grassley amendment is adopted. But the increases that the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the House National Security \nCommittee approved above the President's request were only $300 million \nand $330 million, respectively.\n  Senator Grassley and I are adding $3 billion. So everything that \nthese people who are out here attacking the Grassley amendment as \nending the star wars research is not true. We can do everything they \nwant to do because their requests are only about $300 million in 1997 \nabove the President's request. We could do all of what they want to do, \nhave all the Patriots we need to protect Senators who are in Israel \nwith the $3 billion. We could spend the $300 million that they want for \nStar Wars for this year and still have $2.7 billion on top of that.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, there is room for argument on all of \nthese things. But there is not room, I do not think, to conclude that \nothers are in bad faith. It is wrong to say that General Shalikashvili \ndoes not support this budget, because he does. Senator Grassley and \nSenator Exon are saying, ``OK, we give you some leeway. We'll add $3 \nbillion on top of what the Pentagon said is needed. That should be \nenough.'' I urge the support of the Grassley amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of our time if we have any \nleft and proceed to go to a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I listened with great interest the \ncomments made by the senior Senator from Iowa--especially those that \nreferenced my defense white paper. For the record, I strongly oppose \nthe Grassley amendment. And while I am flattered that he choose to \nquote from my paper, the report makes the clear case that funding for \nour Nation's military is far too little to fully meet our vital \nnational security needs.\n  Even though we are seeking to add $11 billion to secure our national \ndefense, these limited resources are being stretched to the limit. I \nintend to insert into the Record a more complete statement to rebut all \nof the comments made by my friend from Iowa.\n  In closing, let me again emphasize my strong opposition to the \nGrassley amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Grassley to urge \nmy colleagues to support this very simple amendment to put some \nrestraint in our defense budget.\n  In effect, our amendment accepts the higher defense spending levels \nfor fiscal year 1997 currently in the budget resolution. However, it \nplaces a fence around $8.3 billion in budget authority and $2.3 billion \nin outlays. If the President certifies that, in fact, these additional \nfunds, are required for our national security, the funds will be \nreleased. If the President does not make this certification, the funds \nwill go toward deficit reduction.\n  This is a reasonable amendment. It gives the President every \nopportunity to use these funds for defense should there truly be a need \nto do so.\n  Last year, when the Senate passed its version of the fiscal year 1996 \nbudget resolution, the Senate endorsed the administration's defense \nspending level for fiscal year 1997. When proponents of more defense \nspending tried to increase defense spending over the next 5 years, the \nSenate rebuffed that effort.\n  The vote last year gives me confidence that our amendment will \nsucceed today, for there is bipartisan support for maintaining defense \nspending at reasonable levels. On May 23, 1995, in a strong bipartisan \nvote, the Senate defeated an amendment to last year's budget resolution \nwhich would have increased defense spending above the level requested \nby the administration. Sixty Senators voted against that amendment to \nincrease defense spending not only for fiscal year 1996 but for fiscal \nyear 1997 too. Unless they have changed their minds, the same 60 \nSenators should support this amendment. It offers another chance for \nthe Senate to support reasonable defense spending levels.\n  Let us review some of the numbers for a minute, in case anyone is \nconcerned that the proposed level of defense spending in our amendment \nis anything less than robust. Our amendment does not reject the $266.4 \nbillion in budget authority and $264.6 billion in outlays as called for \nin the budget resolution reported out by the Budget Committee. Should \nthe President determine that the money we fence is not needed for \ndefense then, eventually, $8.3 billion in budget authority and $2.3 \nbillion in outlays will be returned to the Treasury, a mere 1-percent \nreduction in the spending level endorsed by the Budget Committee.\n  Let me say a few words about inflation adjustments. Senators should \nrealize that thanks to adjustments in the cost of doing business for \nthe Pentagon we are really talking about an increase that surpasses the \n$11.3 billion added by the Budget Committee in terms of buying power.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Perry announced that the Defense \nDepartment had discovered $45.7 billion in inflation savings after \nreestimating the defense budget for FY1997-2001 using lower inflation \nrates from the Bureau of Economic Analyses. The administration gave the \nDefense Department the green light to plow $30.5 billion of these funds \nback into the defense budget even though the additional buying power \nprovided by these funds was not anticipated by the Defense Department \nnor was it requested. $4.3 billion of these inflation savings are built \ninto the administration's fiscal year 1997 defense budget.\n  I am concerned that in the rush to increase defense spending, we have \nignored the fact that in terms of buying power, the administration has \nalready proposed significant increases which we are now building into \nour own numbers without any acknowledgment or discussion. Senator \nGrassley, Senator Bradley, and I raised this issue with the Budget \nCommittee earlier this year and I ask unanimous consent that a letter \non this subject be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KOHL. If we are serious about reducing the deficit and achieving \na balanced budget, we cannot increase spending when favorable economic \nconditions bring down the costs of Federal programs. We must use these \nsavings to help pay off our burgeoning debt. Yet, here we are turning \naround and giving the Defense Department even more.\n  And with all due respect to my colleagues, there never seems to be a \nspecific goal here: It is always just more defense spending. Two years \nago, we had a readiness crisis, now we have a so-called modernization \ncrisis. Unfortunately, the only crisis we have here is a crisis of \nhemorrhaging tax dollars.\n  No one has made an effective case as to why we must be spending even \nmore on defense. After more than four decades of building up a defense \ninfrastructure to respond to the menace of the Soviet Union and its \nEastern bloc allies, we are now pumping even more money into this same \ninfrastructure without any real effort to reassess the basic \nassumptions underlying our national security posture. Is our defense \nspending relevant to the threats of the future? We cannot possible \nanswer that question for the real conundrum is that we have no idea \nwhat these threats are. And, we are having a hard enough time \narticulating what we need to face the current threats.\n  Frankly, we are facing no major threats today. When the American \npeople talk today about insecurity, they are talking about job \nsecurity, personal security, and perhaps moral security. Even the \nthreats to our national security posed by episodes of regional \ninstability and conflict are less likely to be resolved with military \nforce and more likely to be resolved through political or diplomatic \nintervention. To be sure, we need a strong defense. We need to develop \na strategy and maintain a force structure to protect and advance our \ninterests in the new global environment. If we could start over again \nand create a new force structure from scratch to meet the new \nchallenges of this era, I am confident that\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nwe would have a leaner, more mobile and more efficient force at far \nless cost.\n  I must confess, I am perplexed by arguments made that we must provide \nadditional funds to the military because the service chiefs have said \nthey want these funds. Of course they do. Are there any Federal \nagencies, when asked if they want additional funds, that would say no? \nI am certain that if we asked each Cabinet Secretary to lay out his or \nher unmet requirements we would have equally impressive shopping lists \nto compete with those sent over by the services.\n\n  I am also puzzled by arguments that we must front load defense \nspending in the early years of a 7-year plan because spending in the \nout years cannot be relied upon. Mr. President, the spending we vote \nfor today--much of it devoted to new procurement and new research and \ndevelopment projects--lays the groundwork for increased spending down \nthe road. Frankly, the spending proposed today ensures that reductions \nproposed for the out years will not occur.\n  If we allow this tremendous increase in defense spending to stand, we \nare reinforcing a disturbing trend. Last year, for the first time in 14 \nyears, Congress ultimately increased defense spending well above the \nlevel identified by the Defense Department as necessary for our natonal \nsecurity. During consideration of last year's Defense authorization \nbill, Senator Grassley and I attempted to bring defense spending back \nto the level in the Senate's budget resolution by cutting $7 billion. \nOur amendment was endorsed by a variety of groups focussed on deficit \nreduction and included in the annual scores generated by the Council \nfor a Livable World and the Concord Coalition.\n  Although the amendment received bipartisan support, it was narrowly \ndefeated.\n  I should note that this year the National Taxpayers Union and \nTaxpayers for Common Sense have already endorsed our efforts. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from the Taxpayers for Common Sense be \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, no one has explained to me how we can \nmaintain these high levels of defense spending and reduce the deficit. \nWe cannot continue to spare the Defense Department from the deep \nregimen of cuts we are asking the rest of our society to absorb. If we \nare committed to reducing the deficit and balancing our budget, we must \nmake the hard votes.\n  I know for some this will be a hard vote. However, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this responsible approach to defense spending.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our strong \n     concern about the Defense Department proposal to spend some \n     $30.5 billion dollars in ``inflation savings'' realized \n     because of lower inflation estimates over the next five \n     years. We urge you to raise this issue during your hearings \n     on the FY 97 budget and to direct these funds toward deficit \n     reduction.\n       Inflation estimates used by the Defense Department over the \n     years have been grossly inaccurate. In the 1980's, \n     overestimates of inflation resulted in a $50 billion \n     windfall. That money disappeared. Then two years ago, the \n     Defense Department told Congress that it had underestimated \n     inflation and needed another $20 billion to execute future \n     defense programs. Now, just two years later, the Defense \n     Department is telling us that it has once again overestimated \n     inflation--this time to the tune of $45.7 billion. This \n     history undermines the credibility of the Defense \n     Department's financial estimates.\n       In its FY 97 budget submission, the Defense Department is \n     proposing to use $30.5 billion of these inflation savings to \n     buy more weapons systems.\n       We are troubled by the notion that any agency should be \n     able to keep such a large windfall and increase its total \n     spending because inflation estimates were inaccurate. \n     Responsible budgeting demands that these funds be returned to \n     the Treasury and that the Defense Department not be rewarded \n     for changes in economic conditions.\n       Furthermore, purchasing more programs with inflation \n     windfalls creates tremendous instability in program \n     management.\n       If we truly intend to reduce the deficit, no area of the \n     budget should be exempt from cuts. Cuts must be shared by all \n     segments of our society. The Defense Department is no \n     exception as long as threats to our national security \n     continue to decline. In fact, given that the defense budget \n     constitutes as much as 18 percent of the federal budget, we \n     cannot afford to make the Defense Department an exception. \n     And, we certainly cannot afford to give the Defense \n     Department an unexpected $30.5 billion.\n       We urge you to direct these funds toward deficit reduction \n     before the Budget Committee finalizes its FY 1997 budget.\n           Sincerely,\n     Herb Kohl,\n     Bill Bradley,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common Sense,\n\n                                                     May 15, 1996.\n\n   Taxpayers Say Support Grassley-Kohl Amendment on Defense Spending\n\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Kohl: Taxpayers for Common Sense \n     is pleased to support your amendment to the FY97 Budget \n     Resolution to ``put the brakes'' on the Pentagon's budget. In \n     particular, we support your amendment that would fence the \n     Budget Committee's $11.3 billion increase to the \n     Administration's request. We understand that the fence would \n     apply to the FY 1997 request only.\n       We understand that your amendment provides that the funds \n     would be released only if the President certified that the \n     additional amount was necessary for national security. If \n     that certification is not made, the funds would go to help \n     reduce the national deficit.\n       According to a recent GAO report, there have been no \n     savings in the DoD infrastructure despite several base \n     closures and significant cuts in force structure. At this \n     crucial time, with our nation struggling to balance its \n     budget all government agencies must share the burden of cost \n     cutting.\n       We would urge the Senate to approve your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jill Lancelot,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, for offering an amendment to the fiscal year 1997 budget \nresolution which seeks to reign in some of the excess defense spending \nin the Senate budget resolution and bring a little common sense to our \nNation's defense budget.\n  The Grassley amendment seeks to reduce $8.3 billion in new budget \nauthority and $2.3 billion in budget outlays of the Senate Budget \nCommittee's markup for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1997, \nunless the President certifies that these additional funds are needed \nto ensure the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. President, while I feel this amendment does not go far enough in \ncutting all of the $11.3 billion added by the Senate Budget Committee \nover and above the President's fiscal year 1997 request for defense \nspending, I feel it is a necessary first step in beginning to bring \nsome sanity to our Nation's defense spending. As every other budget \naccount is on a glidepath to reduction, the largest budget of them \nall--the defense budget--is reversing course and moving to return to \nits artificially high levels. The budget resolution funds the Defense \nDepartment at a level of more than $11 billion over the Clinton \nAdministration's fiscal year 1997 request. The Pentagon is seeking \n$254.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 budget authority and $260.8 billion \nin budget outlays in defense spending, while the Senate Budget \nCommittee has recommended $265.6 billion and $263.7 billion, \nrespectively. Already our military budget is more than 3 times that of \nRussia's; 17 times larger than the combined budgets of North Korea, \nIraq, Iran, Cuba, Libya, and Syria who are most often identified as our \nmost likely enemies; and is above the level spent by Germany, France, \nEngland, Russia, China, South Korea, India, Japan, and Australia \ncombined.\n  Mr. President, this budget plan for the Department of Defense is a \nrecipe for fiscal havoc, and the Senate should insist upon more \nrationality. We simply cannot afford to continue spending at current or \nincreased rates for defense, as this budget resolution seeks to do to a \ntune of $11.3 billion. Nor can we afford to insulate any department, \nincluding the Defense Department, from scrutiny as we seek to reduce \nthe Federal debt. In a year when we are cutting programs and fighting \nfor deficit reduction, increasing the defense budget is simply \nirresponsible. We cannot achieve a balanced budget by bloating defense \nspending. Deficit reduction requires that we make very hard\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nchoices and defense programs cannot be insulated in this manner.\n  For these reasons, I have cosponsored Senator Grassley's amendment to \nthe budget resolution, supported by the National Taxpayers Union, which \nseeks to begin to bring our fiscal house in order and to budget a \nlittle more wisely for the future. We simply cannot afford to \njeopardize our country's economic health and to mortgage our future by \nspending tens of billions of dollars in additional funding beyond that \nwhich the Pentagon and the Clinton administration have requested.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Grassley amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nGrassley amendment to the fiscal year 1997 budget request.\n  The budget provides the Congress with a framework in which it must \nwork. By overly restricting the margins of that framework, we eliminate \nour ability to make the broad budget decisions necessary to meet our \nfuture defense needs. Senate Concurrent Resolution 57 preserves the \nSenate's flexibility to consider funding for those programs in the \ndefense budget that should be eliminated and to make increases based on \nmilitary evaluations and needs for the future.\n  The level of funding the President requested this year has been \nquestioned by many individuals, including the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili and the service Chiefs. We \nneed the flexibility in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution to \nconsider the additions these leaders of our Armed Forces have requested \nand accept or reject them on their own merits, not through a sweeping \nbudget cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on or in \nrelation to the Grassley amendment occur at 6:55, and the time between \nnow and then be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. That is all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am not sure that I need that much time. I \ndo not believe the Senator has that much time, if I am looking at the \nclock correctly and dividing the time in half. I will take just a \ncouple minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Grassley amendment to \nreduce the defense spending levels in this budget resolution.\n  For several years I have been expressing my concern that the \nprojected declining budgets in defense are not sufficient from four \nstandpoints: First, to maintain the current readiness of our forces; \nsecond, to provide the standard of living that military personnel and \ntheir families expect and deserve; third, supporting the force \nstructure necessary to carry out the full range of missions that we \nexpect our military to perform; and, fourth, to provide for the \nmodernization that is the key to the future capability and future \nreadiness of those forces. Mr. President, modernization today is our \ngreatest deficiency.\n  We are living off the capital of previous investment. The men and \nwomen in the military continue to perform superbly every time they are \ncalled on. We call on them all the time, as we can see every day. We \nowe it to them to give them the support they need to do the job.\n  We also have to ensure that the men and women who will be called on \n5, 10 or 20 years from now will have the same advantages vis-a-vis \ntheir potential opponents that our military forces have today, \nincluding technological superiority.\n  That latter point is where we are having problems today. You can live \noff the corpus for awhile. I think our force structure has been brought \ndown about right. We have done a superb job in bringing it down, the \nmilitary has, and keeping up the morale of our people.\n  The readiness of our forces is in good shape today. I do not agree \nwith those who say that we have declined in readiness. I think our \nreadiness is in good shape. What we are really doing, though, is \nborrowing from the future. We do not have enough money in the outyears \nof defense projections to be able to maintain the kind of research and \ndevelopment and procurement that we must have.\n  I do believe that the Budget Committee has it about right. I think \nthis amendment would take the defense number down too low. It is \nimportant for all of us to realize that even with the Budget Committee \nnumber, which is higher than the President's, it is less in real dollar \nterms than last year.\n  When we are talking about this budget increasing defense spending, we \nare talking about relative to the President's budget, not relative to \nreal dollars last year. This is still a defense cut, but it is moving \ntoward stabilization. I think we do need to move toward stabilizing the \ndefense budget in real dollar terms. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Grassley amendment.\n  While I believe the funding levels requested for readiness, military \npay raises, and quality of life initiatives in the President's budget \nare about right, I think there are clearly insufficient funds going \ninto modernizing our force. Modernization, for the most part, is \ndelayed into the outyears under the current future years defense \nprogram. And we all know from experience how illusory these budget \nprojections become 4 or 5 years down the road.\n  For the past few years, the Air Force has bought virtually no new \nfighter aircraft. The Air Force has no bomber modernization program. \nThe Navy is not buying enough ships to modernize even a 300 ship Navy. \nThe Marine Corps is years away from having a replacement for its aging \namphibious assault vehicles. For the Army it would probably be quicker \nto list the modernization programs they do have left than to list the \nones they don't.\n  The fiscal squeeze on the defense budget is already intense. As we \nseek to balance the budget--especially if we try to enact tax cuts at \nthe same time, which I hope we will not do--the pressure will get even \nmore intense. This gives me even less confidence in the outyear funding \npredictions that show funds for defense modernization increasing.\n  In my view, we need to increase the defense topline now, to restore \nthe balance to our defense program. We also need to preserve the \nfirewalls that the Senator from New Mexico has included in both last \nyear's budget resolution and in the budget resolution that is before \nthe Senate today to protect any defense increases we are able to \nachieve and to provide some stability in the defense budget. Firewalls \nhave not and will not mean defense cannot be cut, but they ensure that \nif it is cut the savings go to reducing the deficit and not to spending \non other programs.\n\n  We have been reducing the defense budget for a long time. The current \nbuildown started during President Reagan's second term, even before the \nfall of the Berlin Wall, and continued, accelerated, throughout the \nBush administration and the current administration. However, the time \nhas come to stabilize the defense budget as much as possible, since the \ndefense budget has already made a greater contribution to deficit \nreduction than any other part of the budget.\n\n\n               Modernization Funding Should Be Increased\n\n  The future readiness and future capability of the Defense Department \nrequires modernization and it requires research and development, and \nthose are the programs that have been cut most deeply during the \ndefense drawdown.\n  The pressure to achieve and maintain a balanced budget will make it \nvery difficult to increase the defense budget above current levels, yet \ncurrent levels are still somewhat artificially low as we work our back \ntoward a normal level of procurement and a normal level of \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Because we were reducing the size of the force and were able to keep \nthe most modern equipment as we downsized, a temporary decline in \nprocurement was appropriate. But we are now reaching the point where we \nhave to get our modernization budget back up to a long-term level that \nwill sustain our forces for the future. We have to start increasing the \nprocurement budget to prevent the average age of our weapons technology \nfrom reaching unacceptable levels.\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\n  Similarly, during the BRAC era we underinvested in facilities \nmodernization because nobody wanted to waste a lot of money modernizing \nfacilities we might be about to shut down. But now that we have made \nthose decisions and the BRAC process is over we are going to have to \nput more money in modernizing and maintaining the facilities we have \nleft.\n  So our challenge will be to have a budget that is slightly larger \nthan the ones now planned, if we are going to balance the budget it is \nunrealistic to plan for more than a slight increase, and the budget \nplan in this resolution only increases the budget by about 1 percent \nover the levels in the administration's request--in order to have \nadequate funds for capital investments in weapons and facilities.\n  This is why I oppose this amendment which would eliminate the \nincrease in the defense topline number that the Armed Services \nCommittee has recommended. This increase has gone almost entirely to \nmodernization. I think my colleagues will find that the funds the Armed \nServices Committee added to the modernization accounts have gone \nmostly, not completely, to programs the service chiefs have requested, \nand generally these are things the administration was already planning \nto buy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, many of my colleagues share my concern \nthat we have cut the defense budget too far, too fast and that we are \nmortgaging our future by sacrificing the capability of our forces 10 \nyears down the road in order to fully fund current readiness. This \namendment would eliminate our ability to fund modernization programs \nvital to the future capability of our military forces, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself that time.\n  I hope one thing that all my colleagues will remember comes out of \nthis debate. We have heard the argument from the other side that \ndollars define our defense. That is an upside-down way of making \nnational security policy and the budget that is necessary to carry it \nout.\n  The way we decide how much money we are going to spend in defense is \nto define our national security policies, define our needs, have policy \nto fit those needs, and finance those policies. The other side has not \nmade that argument. They have only made an argument that we need x \nnumber of dollars more for defense. That is upside-down reasoning.\n  Now, the other point I hope my colleagues remember from this debate \nis that we have been promised savings because of reforms. The General \nAccounting Office has told us--the nonpartisan General Accounting \nOffice--has told us those savings have not materialized. They have not \ngone into modernization. That is what Secretary Perry said he was going \nto do. They have gone into administrative overhead and things of that \nnature.\n  If we are going to be promised reforms, we should see those reforms \nbefore we give more money. Whatever money we give should be based upon \na policy determination of carrying out our national security goals and \nour interests. The other side has not made the case for more money.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I gather the consent agreement has \nalready been arrived at that we will vote at 6:55?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. We will vote at 6:55.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank all the Senators that came to \nthe floor this evening and today. I think it was an excellent debate. I \ncommend my friend, Senator Grassley, but I do not believe we should \nadopt this amendment.\n  Obviously, he is consistent. From what I can tell, this is not the \ntime to expect the President to ask for increases if they are needed. I \nbelieve that will not happen and we will get a budget that is \npolitically motivated, not really one that the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ntotally support. As evidence of that, they have come to the Hill, \nsingularly and together and asked for an additional $15 billion. I do \nnot think they did that lightly. I think that is what they need.\n  Clearly, we ought to go with the Budget Committee's number and in due \ncourse debate can occur on how we spend it. I believe it will be spent \nwisely.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa.

We would very much appreciate it if Senators who \nhave amendments could begin to tell us what the amendments are by noon \ntomorrow and perhaps begin to turn in amendments by noon tomorrow so we \ncan begin to schedule the amendments in some kind of sequence.\n  Having said that, Senator Exon and I have conferred. Senator Exon is \ngoing to lay down the President's budget at 9:30 in the morning. There \nwill be ample time to debate. There is plenty of time on the \nresolution. Indeed, there is time for amendments to the President's \nbudget, and we will have some of those ready on our side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5049-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5070-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5070-S5089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Background\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     Congressional employees and employing offices. Section 220 of \n     the CAA concerns the application of chapter 71 of title 5, \n     United States Code (``chapter 71'') relating to Federal \n     service labor-management relations. Section 220(a) of the CAA \n     applies the rights, protections and responsibilities \n     established under sections 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, \n     7119 through 7122 and 7131 of title 5, United States Code to \n     employing offices and to covered employees and \n     representatives of those employees.\n       Section 220(d) authorizes the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance (``Board'') to issue regulations to \n     implement section 220 and further states that, except as \n     provided in subsection (e), such regulations ``shall be the \n     same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority [``FLRA''] to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except-(A) \n     to the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section; or (B) as the Board deems necessary to avoid a \n     conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest.''\n       Section 220(e) further authorizes the Board to issue \n     regulations on the manner and extent to which the \n     requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 should apply to \n     covered employees who are employed in certain specified \n     offices, ``except . . . that the Board shall exclude from \n     coverage under [section 220] any covered employees who are \n     employed in [the specified offices] if the Board determines \n     that such exclusion is required because of (i) a conflict of \n     interest or appearance of a conflict of interest; or (ii) \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities.''\n       This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking sets forth proposed \n     regulations under section 220(d) of the CAA. A Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking with respect to regulations under section \n     220(e) is being published separately.\n\n                B. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n       On March 6, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance (``Office'') issued an Advance Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``ANPR'') that solicited comments from interested \n     parties in order to obtain participation and information \n     early in the rulemaking process. 142 Cong. R. S1547 (daily \n     ed., Mar. 6, 1996). In addition to inviting comment on all \n     relevant matters and/or specific questions arising under \n     section 220 of the CAA, the Office sought consultation with \n     the FLRA and the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management with regard to the development of these \n     regulations in accordance with section 304(g) of the CAA. The \n     Office has also consulted with interested parties to further \n     its understanding of the need for and content of appropriate \n     regulations.\n       The Board received 5 comments on the ANPR: one from the \n     Secretary of the Senate and four from various labor \n     organizations. Based on the information gleaned from its \n     consultations and the comments on the ANPR, the Board is \n     publishing these proposed rules, pursuant to section 220(d) \n     of the CAA.\n       1. Substantive Regulations Promulgated by the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority.--In the ANPR, the Board invited comment \n     on the meaning of the term ``substantive regulations'' under \n     sections 220 and 304 of the CAA and further asked commenters \n     to identify which of the regulations promulgated by the FLRA \n     should be considered substantive regulations within the \n     meaning of section 220 of the CAA. In this regard, the Board \n     noted that certain of the FLRA's regulations relate to \n     processes that implement chapter 71, while others relate to \n     principles or criteria for making decisions that implement \n     chapter 71. The Board invited commenters to discuss whether, \n     in their view, the term ``substantive'' as used in sections \n     220 and 304 of the CAA might be intended to distinguish such \n     regulations from those that are ``procedural'' in nature or \n     content. In addition, the Board specifically invited comment \n     on whether and, if so, to what extent the Board should \n     propose the adoption of the FLRA regulations set forth in 5 \n     C.F.R. sections 2411-2416.\n        a. Summary of comments: Two commenters addressed the \n     meaning of the term ``substantive regulations.'' One of these \n     two commenters suggested that the term ``substantive \n     regulations'' means ``only those regulations promulgated by \n     the [FLRA] that are necessary to implement the provisions of \n     chapter 71 made applicable'' by section 220 of the CAA. In \n     this commenter's view, the term ``substantive regulations'' \n     should exclude FLRA regulations that address procedural \n     processes already provided for by the CAA. For example, \n     because sections 405 and 406 of the CAA and the Office's \n     procedural rules promulgated under section 303 set forth the \n     procedures for hearings and Board review of hearing officer's \n     decisions, in this commenter's view, provisions of the FLRA's \n     regulations that purport to govern those matters should not \n     be adopted by the Board. In support of its position, the \n     commenter cited to Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 \n     n.9 (1977).\n       This commenter further asserted that the term ``substantive \n     regulations'' should neither include FLRA regulations that \n     are procedural in nature, such as those addressing filing \n     procedures, nor FLRA regulations that address processes \n     already provided for in procedural rules issued by the Office \n     pursuant to section 303 of the CAA, because ``their adoption \n     is not necessary to implement the provisions of chapter 71 \n     made applicable by the CAA.'' The commenter stated that the \n     Board has issued regulations, pursuant to section 303, that \n     provide procedures for submissions under Part A of the CAA; \n     the commenter urged that, to the extent possible, the same \n     procedures should be used for submissions under Part D \n     (section 220) of the CAA. The commenter suggested that, if \n     any modifications to the Office's procedural rules are \n     required to implement section 220, the Board should issue \n     additional procedural regulations under section 303 of the \n     CAA, rather than adopt assertedly ``non-substantive'' \n     regulations of the FLRA.\n       Based on these views, this commenter took the position \n     that, with certain modifications, all regulations set forth \n     in subchapters C and D of the FLRA's regulations are \n     substantive and should be adopted by the Board. Within those \n     subchapters, this commenter suggested the exclusion of those \n     regulations that the commenter deemed ``purely procedural.'' \n     Finally, this commenter opined that the regulations in \n     subchapter B, set forth at sections 2411-2416, should not be \n     adopted by the Board as those sections do not implement \n     provisions of chapter 71, as applied by the CAA.\n        The other commenter did not propose to define the term \n     ``substantive regulations.'' Rather, this commenter asserted \n     that, at present, it is not necessary for the Board to decide \n     which of the FLRA's regulations are substantive. Instead, \n     this commenter suggested that, although the FLRA's \n     regulations may or may not be ``substantive regulations,'' \n     the regulations are sound procedural guides that the Board \n     is free to follow in the exercise of its general \n     rulemaking authority under sections 303 and 304 of the \n     CAA. The commenter pointed to the approach to rulemaking \n     followed by the FLRA and the National Labor Relations \n     Board (NLRB) as models for the Board, arguing that both \n     the FLRA's and the NLRB's regulations include the various \n     processes by which unfair labor practice and \n     representation cases may be brought and considered and \n     that neither the FLRA nor the NLRB has sought to ``define \n     substantive rights by regulation.''\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\n       Finally, one other commenter, while not addressing the \n     meaning of the term ``substantive regulations,'' suggested \n     that the Board should adopt all of the FLRA's regulations, \n     including sections 2411-2416.\n       b. Board consideration and conclusion: The Board first \n     examines the question of the meaning of the term \n     ``substantive regulations'' under sections 220 and 304 of the \n     Act. Under settled principles of administrative law, \n     substantive regulations are regulations implementing an \n     underlying statute that are issued by a regulatory body \n     pursuant to its statutory authority. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). Such regulations are \n     generally promulgated in accordance with the Administrative \n     Procedure Act, which requires that substantive rulemaking \n     generally be preceded by a general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking at least thirty days before the effective date of \n     the proposed rule, and further requires that the agency \n     afford interested persons an opportunity to participate in \n     the rulemaking by submitting written comments. Regulations \n     issued pursuant to this process are substantive because they \n     ``have the force and effect of law,'' id., and because, among \n     other things, they ``grant rights, impose obligations, or \n     produce other significant effects on private interests,'' or \n     . . . `effect a change in existent law or policy.' '' \n     American Hospital Assoc. v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1044 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).\n       That regulations may arguably be procedural in content is, \n     in the Board's view, not a legally sufficient reason for not \n     viewing them as ``substantive regulations.'' Procedural rules \n     can in fact be substantive regulations. Process is frequently \n     the substance of law and regulation; indeed, in the labor \n     laws, process is the predominate means by which substantive \n     regulation is effectuated. Moreover, in administrative law, \n     it is commonplace for regulations covering procedures to be \n     considered substantive regulations; as noted above, the \n     Administrative Procedure Act generally treats regulation of \n     process as substantive regulation. There is no evidence that \n     Congress intended a different approach in the context of the \n     CAA. Thus, it is the Board's conclusion that all regulations \n     promulgated after a notice and comment period by the FLRA to \n     implement chapter 71 are appropriately classified as \n     substantive regulations for the purposes of rulemaking under \n     sections 220 and 304 of the CAA.\n       In light of the foregoing, the Board has considered the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA in order to determine \n     which of the regulations are ``substantive'' regulations. The \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA ``are designed to \n     implement the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code . . . [and] prescribe the procedures, \n     basic principles or criteria under which the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority or the General Counsel'' will carry out \n     their functions, resolve issues and otherwise administer \n     chapter 71. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2420.1. In addition, these \n     regulations were issued according to the requirements of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, with a public notice and \n     comment period. Therefore, it is the Board's judgment that \n     all the regulations promulgated by the FLRA and published at \n     5 C.F.R. 2411-2416, 2420-2430 and 2470-2472 are \n     ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning of sections \n     220 and 304 of the CAA.\n       A review of the FLRA's regulations demonstrates, however, \n     that not all of the FLRA's substantive regulations are ones \n     that the Board need adopt. Certain of the FLRA's regulations \n     were promulgated to implement provisions of statutes other \n     than provisions of chapter 71 made applicable by the CAA. In \n     this regard, in the ANPR, the Board noted that sections 2411-\n     2416 of the FLRA's regulations treat, among other things, the \n     implementation and applicability of the Freedom of \n     Information Act, the Privacy Act and the Sunshine Act in the \n     FLRA's processes. Although one commenter suggested that the \n     referenced statutes and the FLRA's implementing regulations \n     should govern the processes of the Office of Compliance, \n     these statutes were not incorporated in the CAA and the Board \n     thus is not proposing the adoption of sections 2411-2416 of \n     the FLRA regulations.\n       Similarly, the Board does not propose to adopt either \n     section 2430 of the FLRA's regulations, which establishes \n     procedures for applying for awards of attorney fees and other \n     expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, \n     or section 2472, which implements provisions of section 6131 \n     of title 5 of the United States Code. As neither 5 U.S.C. 504 \n     nor 5 U.S.C. 6131 is applied by the CAA, sections 2430 and \n     2472 were not promulgated to implement statutory provisions \n     that are applied by section 220 and, accordingly, the FLRA's \n     regulations implementing them need not be adopted.\n       2. Proposed Modification of Substantive Regulations of the \n     FLRA.--In the ANPR, the Board invited comment on whether and \n     to what extent it should, pursuant to section 220(d) of the \n     CAA, modify the substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     FLRA. Section 220(d) provides that the Board shall issue \n     regulations that are the same as applicable substantive \n     regulations of the FLRA ``except to the extent that the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with \n     the regulations, that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section'' (emphasis added). \n     Section 220(d) also provides that the Board may modify the \n     FLRA's substantive regulations ``as the Board deems necessary \n     to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict \n     of interest.''\n       a. Summary of comments: A number of commenters urged that \n     the FLRA's substantive regulations should be adopted without \n     change. One of these commenters particularly stressed, in its \n     view, the need to adopt without change the regulations that \n     treat recourse to the Federal Service Impasses Panel and the \n     Merit Systems Protection Board. But another commenter \n     suggested several modifications to the substantive \n     regulations. In addition to a variety of technical changes in \n     nomenclature and terminology, this commenter specifically \n     suggested the following modifications:\n       (1) Regulations implementing provisions of chapter 71 not \n           made applicable by the CAA\n       The commenter stated that section 2423.9(b) should not be \n     adopted on the ground that it sets forth procedures \n     implementing 5 U.S.C. section 7123(d), a section not \n     incorporated into the CAA.\n       (2) Provisions inapplicable under the CAA\n       The commenter further suggested that the definition of the \n     term ``activity'' under section 2421.5 of the FLRA's \n     regulations should be deleted on the ground that it has \n     no applicability in the legislative branch. Further, this \n     commenter suggested that the term ``Government-wide rule'' \n     found throughout the regulations should be changed to \n     ``Government-wide rule applicable to the Senate \n     [Legislative Branch]'' because not all government-wide \n     rules apply to the legislative branch. Similarly, this \n     commenter proposed the deletion of section 2425.3(b) \n     because it relates to civil service employees, of which \n     there are none in the legislative branch. The commenter \n     further suggested that Section 2429.2, relating to \n     transfer and consolidation of cases, should also be \n     deleted because it has no applicability in light of the \n     structure of the Office of Compliance. Finally, according \n     to the commenter, part 2428 of the FLRA's regulations, \n     which relates to enforcement of decisions of the Assistant \n     Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations, should \n     not be adopted because the Assistant Secretary has no \n     authority under the CAA and neither covered employees nor \n     employing offices are bound by the decisions of the \n     Assistant Secretary.\n       (3) Regulations addressing procedures governed by 405 and \n           406 of CAA\n       The commenter also contended that section 220 of the CAA \n     directs that all representation and unfair labor practice \n     matters that arise under section 220 be referred ``to a \n     hearing officer for decision pursuant to subsection (b) \n     through (h) of section 405.'' Further, according to the \n     commenter, sections 220(c)(1) and (2) require that decisions \n     of the hearing officers be reviewed by the Board under \n     section 406 of the CAA. Consequently, in this commenter's \n     view, the Board should not adopt any FLRA regulation relating \n     to the conduct of hearings on representation petitions or \n     unfair labor practice allegations or relating to Board review \n     of decisions. For example, this commenter suggested that \n     sections 2422.18-22 of the FLRA's regulations should be \n     omitted because they relate to the procedures for the conduct \n     of pre-election investigatory hearings on representation \n     petitions; according to the commenter, procedures for these \n     hearings are governed by section 405 of the CAA and by the \n     Board's procedural rules.\n       (4) Consultation Rights\n       The commenter additionally suggested that the threshold \n     requirement in section 2426.1 of the FLRA's regulations that \n     a labor organization hold exclusive recognition for 10% or \n     more of the personnel of an employing office in order for \n     that labor organization to obtain consultation rights be \n     modified for good cause. Because of the small size of many \n     employing offices in the legislative branch, the commenter \n     expressed the concern that employing offices would be \n     required to engage in consultation when only one or two \n     employees are represented by a union. Such an obligation to \n     consult would, in this commenter's view, ``interfere with the \n     rights of unrepresented employees because it would \n     necessarily cause delay in implementation of new terms of \n     employment.''\n       (5) Posting of Materials\n       The commenter suggested that sections 2422.7 and 2422.23 of \n     the FLRA's regulations be modified to prohibit the posting of \n     any material relating to a labor organization in any area \n     open to the public on the basis that such a display of \n     material would create a conflict of interest ``insofar as it \n     may appear that Congress is unduly influenced by particular \n     labor organizations.''\n       b. Board Consideration and Response to Comments: Based upon \n     the comments received and the Board's understanding of \n     chapter 71 and the institutions to which it is being made \n     applicable through the CAA, the Board is proposing to adopt \n     the FLRA's regulations published at 5 C.F.R. 2420-29 and \n     2470-71 with only limited modifications. The Board has \n     proposed to delete provisions of the FLRA's regulations \n     that were promulgated to implement provisions of chapter \n     71 that are not applied by the CAA. In this regard, \n     sections 2423.9(b)(c) and (d) have been deleted because \n     they implement section 7123(d) of chapter 71, a provision \n     that is not applied by the CAA. Similarly, section 2429.7 \n     of the FLRA's regulations, relating to the issuance of \n     subpoenas, has been deleted because it implements section \n     7132 of chapter 71, a section of chapter 71 that is not \n     applied by the CAA. Finally, as statutory provisions in \n     title 5 that\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\n     permit executive branch employees to have access to the \n     Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) were not applied by \n     the CAA, references to the MSPB have also been deleted. \n     The Board finds that there is good cause to make these \n     modifications for the reasons herein stated.\n       In addition, the Board has proposed to make technical \n     changes in definitions, nomenclature and prescribed processes \n     so that the regulations comport with the CAA and the \n     organizational structure of the Office of Compliance. In the \n     Boards judgment, making such changes satisfies the Act's \n     ``good cause'' requirement. However, contrary to one \n     commenter's suggestion that the terms ``activity'' and \n     ``Government-wide'' rule be omitted or modified, the Board is \n     of the view that these concepts have applicability in the \n     context of the CAA and therefore should not be deleted or \n     modified. Of course, the Board welcomes additional comment on \n     these issues as part of interested parties' comments on the \n     proposed rules.\n       In addition to the foregoing, the Board has concluded that \n     there is good cause to propose certain other modifications to \n     the FLRA's regulations. These proposed modifications are \n     discussed below.\n       (1) Exercise of Investigative and Adjudicatory \n           Responsibilities\n       In issuing these proposed regulations to implement section \n     220, the Board has had to determine how it may best exercise \n     its investigative and other authorities and responsibilities \n     under section 220 of the CAA. In this regard, the Board notes \n     that section 220(c)(1) of the CAA provides that the Board \n     shall exercise the authorities of the three member Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority (Authority) under various \n     provisions of chapter 71 and that any ``petition, or other \n     submission that, under chapter 71 . . . would be submitted to \n     the . . . Authority shall, . . . be submitted to the Board''. \n     The Board further notes that section 220(c)(1) provides that \n     the Board ``shall refer any matter under this paragraph to a \n     hearing officer for decision pursuant to . . . section 405''; \n     and yet it also states that the Board may direct that the \n     General Counsel carry out the Board's ``investigative \n     authorities''. Finally, the Board notes that section \n     220(c)(3) limits judicial review to Board actions on unfair \n     labor practice complaints. As an initial matter, therefore, \n     there is a question as to whether section 220(c)(1) should be \n     read to require that all representation, arbitration, \n     negotiability and unfair labor practice issues that come \n     before the Board first be referred to hearing officers for \n     decision under section 405, or only to require referral of \n     those matters that require a formal adversary hearing \n     (involving, among other things, discovery and adherence to \n     formal rules of evidence) in order to resolve the matter in \n     dispute and create a record for judicial review. After \n     considerable reflection, the Board is persuaded that Congress \n     did not intend in the CAA to require that all issues first be \n     presented to a hearing officer under section 405.\n       By its terms, section 220(c)(1) of the CAA expressly \n     contemplates a distinction between investigative issues and \n     those issues requiring referral for an adversary hearing. \n     Specifically, section 220 expressly acknowledges that the \n     Board possesses and may exercise investigative \n     authorities, and explicitly states that the Board may \n     direct the General Counsel to carry out such investigative \n     authorities. A fortiori, the Board does not have to refer \n     matters involving these ``investigative authorities'' to a \n     hearing officer (but rather may direct the General Counsel \n     to carry them out or carry them out itself).\n       The textual reference to the Board's investigative \n     authorities is, in fact, only one of the statutory signals \n     that Congress did not intend to require the Board to refer \n     all issues to a hearing officer for initial decision under \n     Section 405. Section 220(c)(3) further specifies that there \n     shall be judicial review of only Board actions on unfair \n     labor practice complaints. Since one of the key purposes of \n     the section 405 hearing process is to create a record for \n     judicial review, this limitation of the judicial review \n     process is another textual suggestion that Congress intended \n     to require referral to a hearing officer of only those \n     matters that require a hearing of the type contemplated by \n     section 405--i.e., a formal adversary hearing that \n     establishes a record for Board and then judicial review.\n       Indeed, in section 220, Congress purported to impose upon \n     the legislative branch the labor law applicable to the \n     executive branch. In that scheme, representation issues, \n     negotiability of bargaining proposals, and review of arbitral \n     awards are not subject to elaborate adversarial procedures. \n     Rather, they are subject to different investigative and \n     decisional process better suited to expeditious and effective \n     resolution of the issues presented. A determination by the \n     Board that the resolution of exceptions to arbitral awards, \n     negotiability of bargaining proposals, and representation \n     petitions, must first be referred to a hearing officer for an \n     adversarial hearing under section 405 would result in an \n     overly cumbersome system that would undermine considerably \n     the effective implementation of Section 220. The Board would \n     not hesitate to implement such a scheme if Congress had \n     clearly commanded it; but, when read in context, the \n     statutory language does not so require, and the legislative \n     history contains no suggestion that Congress intended such a \n     striking departure from the underlying statutory scheme that \n     it was purporting to impose on itself. In such circumstances, \n     the Board cannot find good cause to modify the FLRA's \n     regulations to require formal adversarial proceedings where \n     they are not presently required under chapter 71.\n       Accordingly, the Board has examined the range of \n     investigative and adjudicatory functions carried out by the \n     FLRA and its officials under chapter 71 and the FLRA's \n     regulations. The Board has further examined the manner in \n     which those functions may most effectively and appropriately \n     be carried out by the Office under the CAA. The Board has \n     considered the suggestions of the commenters, the differences \n     in organizational structure between the Office of Compliance \n     and the FLRA, and the language and underlying statutory \n     schemes of chapter 71 and the CAA. And, having done so, the \n     Board has concluded that, consistent with the language of \n     section 220(c)(1) and the scheme envisioned and implemented \n     under chapter 71, issues that are presented directly to the \n     Authority may and should also be presented directly to the \n     Board. Likewise, the Board has determined that issues that \n     are submitted to administrative law judges in the chapter 71 \n     scheme should be submitted to hearing officers in the CAA \n     scheme. Thus, the Board will decide representation issues, \n     negotiability issues and exceptions to arbitral awards based \n     upon a record developed through direct submissions from the \n     parties and, where necessary, further investigation by the \n     Board (through the person of the Executive Director); and it \n     will refer unfair labor practice complaints to hearing \n     officers for initial decision under section 405 (and then \n     review by the Board and the courts).\n       Contrary to one commenter's assertion, 220(c)(1) does not \n     require that pre-election hearings on representation \n     petitions be conducted pursuant to section 405 of the CAA. \n     Such hearings are investigatory in nature; and they do not \n     require formal adversarial proceedings. They are to be \n     conducted as part of the Board's authority to investigate \n     representation petitions pursuant to the provisions of \n     chapter 71 that are applied by the CAA. They thus need not be \n     conducted by hearing officers under section 405.\n       (2) Procedural matters\n       The Board has further concluded that there is good cause to \n     modify the FLRA's substantive regulations by omitting \n     provisions that set forth procedures which are already \n     provided for under comparable provisions of the Office's \n     procedural rules. There are obvious benefits to having one \n     set of procedural rules for matters arising under the CAA. \n     Indeed, one commenter suggested this beneficial outcome in \n     arguing why certain rules should not be considered to be \n     ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning of section \n     304. While the Board believes that the rules are in fact \n     substantive regulations, it believes that the benefits of \n     having one set of procedural rules provides the ``good \n     cause'' needed to modify the FLRA's substantive regulations \n     in this respect.\n       Accordingly, provisions of Part 2423 relating to the filing \n     of complaints and the conduct of hearings on allegations of \n     violations of section 220 have been deleted or modified, as \n     appropriate, where there is a specific regulation on the same \n     matters in the Office's procedural rules. Similarly, \n     provisions of Part 2429 of the FLRA's regulations relating to \n     such matters as service, interlocutory appeals, computation \n     of time, and methods of filing have been deleted or modified, \n     to the extent that they are the same as, or specifically \n     provided for under, procedural rules already issued. Finally, \n     section 2429.9 relating to presentations by an amicus curiae \n     and section 2429.17, which provides procedures for seeking \n     Board reconsideration, have also been deleted. Although these \n     subjects are not now covered by the Office's procedural \n     rules, they have general applicability to Board proceedings \n     under the CAA. The Board has determined that it would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under the CAA to propose and issue rules relating \n     to amicus filings and reconsideration in all matters before \n     the Board as part of a rulemaking under section 303 of the \n     Act.\n       (3) Arbitral awards on adverse actions\n       The Board also agrees with the commenter who suggested the \n     deletion of section 2425.3(b), a provision that precludes the \n     FLRA's review of arbitration awards involving certain adverse \n     actions. Under chapter 71, Congress generally provided for \n     the review of arbitration awards by the FLRA. However, for \n     awards relating to matters in which an employee has an option \n     of either filing an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection \n     Board (or another adjudicative body) or of filing a grievance \n     under a negotiated grievance procedure, Congress provided for \n     judicial review of the award under the same standards of \n     review that would be accorded to a decision of the MSPB or \n     another appellate body. Therefore, there is a symmetrical \n     framework for the review of arbitration awards involving \n     certain adverse actions in the general Federal civil service \n     in which decisions on such matters, whether made by an \n     arbitrator or an adjudicative body, are subject to the same \n     judicial review. In contrast, there is no such symmetry of \n     review under the CAA because legislative branch employees \n     have no recourse to the MSPB or other similar administrative \n     agencies and there is no judicial review of arbitrators' \n     awards. If section 2425.3(b) were not deleted, employees and \n     employing offices under the CAA would be deprived of a forum \n     for review of arbitration awards involving certain adverse \n     actions. Accordingly, the Board concludes that\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n     there is good cause to modify the FLRA's regulations by \n     deleting section 2425.3(b).\n       (4) Consultation rights\n       Under section 2426.1(a) of the FLRA's regulations, an \n     agency or an agency's primary national subdivision shall \n     accord national consultation rights to a labor organization \n     that ``[h]olds exclusive recognition for either: (i) Ten \n     percent (10%) or more of the total number of civilian \n     personnel employed by the agency and the non-appropriated \n     fund Federal instrumentalities under its jurisdiction, \n     excluding foreign nationals; or (ii) 3,500 or more employees \n     of the agency.'' The Board has determined that the 10% \n     threshold requirement should not be modified for good cause, \n     as one commenter suggested. The Board agrees with the \n     commenter that the small size of many employing offices in \n     the legislative branch must be considered. However, the FLRA \n     considered 10% of the employees of an agency or primary \n     national subdivision to be a significant enough proportion of \n     the employee complement to allow for meaningful \n     consultations, no matter the size of the agency or the number \n     of its employees. No convincing reason has been provided by \n     the commenter why the FLRA's judgment is not workable here, \n     or why there should be a different threshold requirement for \n     small legislative branch employing offices from that \n     applicable to small executive branch agencies.\n       By contrast, the same concern for the small size of many \n     employing offices has prompted the Board to conclude that \n     good cause exists to modify the alternate threshold \n     requirement--i.e., the requirement that a labor organization \n     hold exclusive recognition of 3,500 or more of an agency's \n     employees in order to be accorded national consultation \n     rights. Although the Board has been unable through its \n     research to determine the reasoning of the FLRA in choosing \n     the number 3,500 as a threshold requirement, the number \n     corresponds to the considerable size of many of the executive \n     branch agencies. Because none of the employing offices has as \n     many as 35,000 employees, the 3,500 employee threshold is \n     irrelevant in light of the existence of the other threshold \n     requirement, discussed above, of 10% of the employee \n     complement. The Board thus finds that it is unworkable in \n     this context and that there is good cause to delete it.\n       Section 2426.11(a) requires that ``[a]n agency shall accord \n     consultation rights on Government-wide rules or regulations \n     to a labor organization that . . . [h]olds exclusive \n     recognition for 3,500 or more employees.'' The Board has \n     determined that this threshold requirement should also be \n     deleted for good cause, since many of the employing offices \n     in the legislative branch are considerably smaller than \n     executive branch agencies. However, once this requirement is \n     omitted, there is no other requirement in the regulations by \n     which to determine whether consultation rights on Government-\n     wide rules or regulations should be granted to a labor \n     organization. Therefore, the Board has concluded that the 10% \n     threshold requirement should be employed in this section as \n     well. The 10% figure is used as an alternate criterion to \n     3,500 in according national consultation rights, and it is an \n     appropriate standard to use for according consultation rights \n     on Government-wide regulations as well.\n       (5) Enforcement of Decisions of the Assistant Secretary of \n           Labor\n       As noted above, one commenter asserted that part 2428 of \n     the FLRA's regulations is inapplicable under the CAA and \n     should be omitted from the Board's regulations. Part 2428 of \n     the FLRA's regulations provides a procedure for the Assistant \n     Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations to petition \n     the FLRA to enforce decisions and orders of the Assistant \n     Secretary with respect to labor organization conduct.\n       The Board has concluded that, although the Assistant \n     Secretary has no enforcement authority over covered employing \n     offices or covered employees, nothing in the CAA removes the \n     Assistant Secretary of Labor's authority to regulate the \n     conduct of labor organizations, even those that exclusively \n     represent legislative branch employees. Indeed, 5 U.S.C. \n     7120(d) authorizes the Assistant Secretary of Labor for \n     Labor-Management Relations to regulate the conduct of labor \n     organizations and is specifically incorporated into the CAA. \n     Further, nothing in the CAA would preclude the Assistant \n     Secretary from petitioning the Board to enforce a decision \n     and order involving a labor organization under the \n     jurisdiction of the CAA. In this regard, the FLRA promulgated \n     part 2428 as part of its authority under section 7105 of \n     chapter 71 to ``take such actions as are necessary and \n     appropriate to effectively administer the provisions'' of \n     chapter 71. Under the CAA, the Board has specifically been \n     granted the same authority to administer the provisions of \n     chapter 71 as applied by the CAA. Accordingly, there is not \n     good cause for the Board to omit part 2428 in its entirety or \n     to decline to permit the Assistant Secretary to petition the \n     Board in accordance with the procedures set forth therein.\n       However, the Board proposes not to adopt section 2428.3(a), \n     which would require the Board to enforce any decision or \n     order of the Assistant Secretary unless it is ``arbitrary and \n     capricious or based upon manifest disregard of the law.'' In \n     light of section 225(f)(3) of the CAA, which states that the \n     CAA does not authorize executive branch enforcement of the \n     Act, the Board should not adopt a provision that would \n     require the Board to defer to decisions of an executive \n     branch agency. Accordingly, the Board has modified the \n     provisions of part 2428 by omitting section 2428.3(a).\n       (6) Production of evidence in pre-election investigatory \n           hearings\n       As noted in section I.B.2. above, section 7132 of chapter \n     71, which authorizes the issuance of subpoenas by various \n     FLRA officials, was not made applicable by the CAA. Moreover, \n     as pre-election investigatory hearings are not hearings that \n     are conducted under section 405 of the CAA, subpoenas for \n     documents or witnesses in such pre-election proceedings are \n     not available under the CAA. Nonetheless, in order to \n     properly decide disputed representation issues and \n     effectively implement section 220 of the CAA, a complete \n     investigatory record comparable to that developed by the FLRA \n     under chapter 71 is necessary. Accordingly, there is good \n     cause to modify section 2422.18 of the FLRA's regulations in \n     order to ensure that such a record is made in the absence of \n     the availability of subpoenas. To this end, the Board is \n     specifically proposing the inclusion of section 2422.18(d), \n     which provides that the parties have an obligation to produce \n     existing documents and witnesses for the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing in accordance with the instructions of \n     the Executive Director; and the Board is further proposing \n     that a willful failure to comply with such instructions may \n     in appropriate circumstances result in an adverse inference \n     being drawn on the issue related to the evidence sought.\n       (7) Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the \n           negotiability procedure\n       The Board has determined that there is also good cause to \n     delete the concluding sentence of sections 2423.5 and 2424.5 \n     of the FLRA's regulations because, in the context of the CAA, \n     they would serve improperly to deprive judicial review in \n     certain circumstances. Generally, when an employing office \n     asserts it has no duty to bargain over a proposal, a labor \n     organization may seek a Board determination on the issue \n     either through an unfair labor practice proceeding or a \n     negotiability proceeding. However, the concluding \n     sentences of the referenced regulations preclude a labor \n     organization from filing an unfair labor practice charge \n     in cases that solely involve an employing office's \n     allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not \n     extend to the matter proposed to be bargained and that do \n     not involve actual or contemplated changes in conditions \n     of employment. In such cases, those sentences of the \n     regulations provide that a labor organization may only \n     file a petition for review of a negotiability issue.\n       Unlike chapter 71, the CAA does not provide for direct \n     judicial review of Board decisions and orders on petitions \n     for review of negotiability issues. Rather, judicial review \n     of Board determinations as to the negotiability of collective \n     bargaining proposals is only available through an unfair \n     labor practice proceeding involving a dispute over an \n     employing office's duty to bargain. Accordingly, if sections \n     2423.5 and 2424.5 were not modified, a labor organization \n     would, in certain circumstances, be precluded from electing \n     to file an unfair labor practice charge and possibly \n     obtaining judicial review of a Board decision. Rather, the \n     labor organization would be required to file a petition for \n     review of the negotiability issue and any unfavorable \n     decision would be unreviewable. The Board concludes that it \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under section 220 to delete the two specified \n     sentences, thereby allowing a labor organization to use the \n     unfair labor practice procedures in all circumstances.\n       (8) Official time\n       Section 2429.13 of the FLRA's regulations requires \n     employing offices to grant ``official time'' to employees \n     when the employees' participation in investigations or \n     hearings is deemed necessary by hearing officers or Office \n     officials. The Board has determined that section 2429.13 of \n     the FLRA's regulations should be modified by striking the \n     last sentence, which would require the payment by employing \n     offices of transportation and per diem expenses associated \n     with employees' participation in investigations or hearings \n     on official time. The Board finds good cause to modify the \n     provision in light of the decision of the United States \n     Supreme Court in Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority, 464 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 439 \n     (1983), in which the Supreme Court held that the FLRA had \n     exceeded its authority by requiring federal agencies to pay \n     such per diem allowances and travel expenses. This regulatory \n     requirement has been authoritatively and finally invalidated \n     by the Supreme Court and thus has no applicability under the \n     laws that have been incorporated by the CAA.\n       (9) The Board's exercise of the authorities of the Federal \n           Service Impasses Panel\n       Section 2470 of the FLRA's regulations defines the Federal \n     Service Impasses Panel as all members of the Panel or a \n     quorum thereof and thus permits formal actions to be taken on \n     behalf of the Panel by less than the Panel's full complement \n     of members. The Federal Service Impasses Panel is composed of \n     seven members. The Board, which will exercise the authorities \n     of the Panel pursuant to section 220(c)(4) of the CAA, is a \n     five-member body. It is the Board's determination that it \n     will be more effective for the implementation of section \n     220(c)(4) to provide for the full Board, rather than a quorum\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\n     thereof, to carry out its authorities under that section. \n     Section 2470 of the regulation has been modified accordingly.\n       (10) Conflict of Interest\n       As noted above, one commenter asserted that sections 2422.7 \n     and 2422.23 of the FLRA's regulations should be modified \n     pursuant to section 220(d)(2)(B). The two referenced sections \n     of the FLRA's regulations provide, respectively, that an \n     employing office may be directed to post a notice advising \n     affected employees of the filing of a representation petition \n     and that an employing office will post a notice of election \n     when an election is to be conducted. In both instances the \n     notices, which in the context of the CAA will be prepared by \n     the Office of Compliance, must be posted in places where \n     notices are normally posted for the affected employees or \n     they may be distributed in a manner by which notices are \n     normally distributed. The commenter urges that these \n     regulatory provisions be modified to prohibit the publication \n     of any material relating to a labor organization in any area \n     open to the public. In support of the proposed modification, \n     the commenter states only that display of such material in \n     public view creates, at the very least, an appearance of a \n     conflict of interest insofar as it may appear that Congress \n     is unduly influenced by particular labor organizations.\n       In the ANPR, the Board requested commenters to fully and \n     specifically describe the conflict of interest or appearance \n     thereof that they believe would exist were pertinent FLRA \n     regulations not modified and to explain the necessity for \n     avoiding the asserted conflict or appearance of conflict. The \n     Board further asked commenters to explain how they interpret \n     220(d)(2)(B) and, in doing so, identify the factual and \n     interpretive materials upon which they are relying. The \n     commenter has not discussed section 220(d)(2)(B) or explained \n     why the proposed modification, a specific prohibition on \n     posting an Office of Compliance notice in a public area, is \n     necessary to avoid an appearance of conflict; indeed, the \n     commenter has not explained how the posting of a notice \n     announcing the filing of a petition or an upcoming election \n     would create the appearance of undue influence asserted by \n     the commenter.\n       In the Board's view, no appearance of conflict of interest \n     or undue influence is created by an employing office posting \n     a notice, prepared by the Office of Compliance, advising \n     covered employees of a pending petition or an election under \n     a statute that Congress has specifically applied to itself, \n     similar provisions of which apply in the private and public \n     sectors. Nothing in the FLRA's regulations requires that \n     notices be posted in public areas; the referenced notices \n     must only be posted or distributed in the manner that other \n     information affecting employees is posted or distributed. \n     Moreover, since the notices are prepared by the Office of \n     Compliance, which is an independent office in the legislative \n     branch, no reasonable person could even begin to find undue \n     influence from the posting itself.\n       The Board thus concludes that, contrary to the commenter's \n     suggestion, it is not necessary to modify sections 2422.7 and \n     2422.23 of the FLRA's regulations to avoid a conflict of \n     interest or appearance of conflict of interest. The Board \n     therefore proposes to adopt those provisions with only \n     technical changes in nomenclature.\n\n                         II. Method of Approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees \n     and employing offices be approved by the Congress by \n     concurrent resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 14th day of May, 1996.\n\n                                                Glen D.

Where a collective bargaining \n     agreement with a term of three (3) years or less has been \n     extended prior to sixty (60) days before its expiration date, \n     the extension will not serve as a basis for dismissal of a \n     petition seeking an election filed in accordance with this \n     section.\n       (h) Contract requirements. Collective bargaining \n     agreements, including agreements that go into effect under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA, and those that \n     automatically renew without further action by the parties, do \n     not constitute a bar to a petition seeking an election under \n     this section unless a clear and unambiguous effective date, \n     renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date \n     are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant \n     accompanying documentation.\n     Sec. 2422.13  Resolution of issues raised by a petition.\n       (a) Meetings prior to filing a representation petition. All \n     parties affected by the representation issues that may be \n     raised in a petition are encouraged to meet prior to the \n     filing of the petition to discuss their interests and narrow \n     and resolve the issues. If requested by all parties a \n     representative of the Office will participate in these \n     meetings.\n       (b) Meetings to narrow and resolve the issues after the \n     petition is filed. After a petition is filed, the Executive \n     Director may require all affected parties to meet to narrow \n     and resolve the issues raised in the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.14  Effect of withdrawal/dismissal.\n       (a) Withdrawal/dismissal less than sixty (60) days before \n     contract expiration. When a petition seeking an election that \n     has been timely filed is withdrawn by the petitioner or \n     dismissed by the Executive Director or the Board less than \n     sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of an existing \n     agreement between the incumbent exclusive representative and \n     the employing office or activity or any time after the \n     expiration of the agreement, another petition seeking an \n     election will not be considered timely if filed within a \n     ninety (90) day period from either:\n       (1) The date the withdrawal is approved; or\n       (2) The date the petition is dismissed by the Executive \n     Director when no application for review is filed with the \n     Board; or\n       (3) The date the Board rules on an application for review; \n     or\n       (4) The date the Board issues a Decision and Order \n     dismissing the petition.\n       Other pending petitions that have been timely filed under \n     this Part will continue to be processed.\n       (b) Withdrawal by petitioner. A petitioner who submits a \n     withdrawal request for a petition seeking an election that is \n     received by the Executive Director after the notice of pre-\n     election investigatory hearing issues or after approval of an \n     election agreement, whichever occurs first, will be barred \n     from filing another petition seeking an election for the same \n     unit or any subdivision of the unit for six (6) months from \n     the date of the approval of the withdrawal by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (c) Withdrawal by incumbent. When an election is not held \n     because the incumbent disclaims any representation interest \n     in a unit, a petition by the incumbent seeking an election \n     involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit \n     will not be considered timely if filed within six (6) months \n     of cancellation of the election.\n     Sec. 2422.15  Duty to furnish information and cooperate.\n       (a) Relevant information. After a petition is filed, all \n     parties must, upon request of the Executive Director, furnish \n     the Executive Director and serve all parties affected by \n     issues raised in the petition with information concerning \n     parties, issues, and agreements raised in or affected by the \n     petition.\n       (b) Inclusions and exclusions. After a petition seeking an \n     election is filed, the Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, may direct the employing office or activity to furnish \n     the Executive Director and all parties affected by issues \n     raised in the petition with a current alphabetized list of \n     employees and job classifications included in and/or excluded \n     from the existing or claimed unit affected by issues raised \n     in the petition.\n       (c) Cooperation. All parties are required to cooperate in \n     every aspect of the representation process. This obligation \n     includes cooperating fully with the Executive Director, \n     submitting all required and requested information, and \n     participating in prehearing conferences and pre-election \n     investigatory hearings. The failure to cooperate in the \n     representation process may result in the Executive Director \n     or the Board taking appropriate action, including dismissal \n     of the petition or denial of intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.16  Election agreements or directed elections.\n       (a) Election agreements. Parties are encouraged to enter \n     into election agreements.\n       (b) Executive Director directed election. If the parties \n     are unable to agree on procedural matters, specifically, the \n     eligibility period, method of election, dates, hours, or \n     locations of the election, the Executive Director, on behalf \n     of the Board, will decide election procedures and issue a \n     Direction of Election, without prejudice to the rights of a \n     party to file objections to the procedural conduct of the \n     election.\n       (c) Opportunity for an investigatory hearing. Before \n     directing an election, the Executive Director shall provide \n     affected parties an opportunity for a pre-election \n     investigatory hearing on other than procedural matters.\n       (d) Challenges or objections to a directed election. A \n     Direction of Election issued under this section will be \n     issued without prejudice to the right of a party to file a \n     challenge to the eligibility of any person participating in \n     the election and/or objections to the election.\n     Sec. 2422.17  Notice of pre-election investigatory hearing \n         and prehearing conference.\n       (a) Purpose of notice of an investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, may issue a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing involving any \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (b) Contents. The notice of hearing will advise affected \n     parties about the pre-election investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director will also notify affected parties of the \n     issues raised in the petition and establish a date for the \n     prehearing conference.\n       (c) Prehearing conference. A prehearing conference will be \n     conducted by the Executive Director or her designee, either \n     by meeting or teleconference. All parties must participate in \n     a prehearing conference and be prepared to fully discuss, \n     narrow and resolve\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\n     the issues set forth in the notification of the prehearing \n     conference.\n       (d) No interlocutory appeal of investigatory hearing \n     determination. The Executive Director's determination of \n     whether to issue a notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing is not appealable to the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.18  Pre-election investigatory hearing procedures.\n       (a) Purpose of a pre-election investigatory hearing. \n     Representation hearings are considered investigatory and not \n     adversarial. The purpose of the hearing is to develop a full \n     and complete record of relevant and material facts.\n       (b) Conduct of hearing. Pre-election investigatory hearings \n     will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the \n     Executive Director or her designee. There is no burden of \n     proof, with the exception of proceedings on objections to \n     elections as provided for in Sec. 2422.27(b). Formal rules of \n     evidence do not apply.\n       (c) Pre-election investigatory hearing. Pre-election \n     investigatory hearings will be conducted by the Executive \n     Director or her designee.\n       (d) Production of evidence. Parties have the obligation to \n     produce existing documents and witnesses for the \n     investigatory hearing in accordance with the instructions of \n     the Executive Director or her designee. If a party willfully \n     fails to comply with such instructions, the Board may draw an \n     inference adverse to that party on the issue related to the \n     evidence sought.\n       (e) Transcript. An official reporter will make the official \n     transcript of the pre-election investigatory hearing. Copies \n     of the official transcript may be examined in the Office \n     during normal working hours. Requests by parties to purchase \n     copies of the official transcript should be made to the \n     official hearing reporter.\n     Sec. 2422.19  Motions.\n       (a) Purpose of a motion. Subsequent to the issuance of a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing in a \n     representation proceeding, a party seeking a ruling, an \n     order, or relief must do so by filing or raising a motion \n     stating the order or relief sought and the grounds \n     therefor. Challenges and other filings referenced in other \n     sections of this subpart may, in the discretion of the \n     Executive Director or her designee, be treated as a \n     motion.\n       (b) Prehearing motions. Prehearing motions must be filed in \n     writing with the Executive Director. Any response must be \n     filed with the Executive Director within five (5) days after \n     service of the motion. The Executive Director shall rule on \n     the motion.\n       (c) Motions made at the investigatory hearing. During the \n     pre-election investigatory hearing, motions will be made to \n     the Executive Director or her designee, and may be oral on \n     the record, unless otherwise required in this subpart to be \n     in writing. Responses may be oral on the record or in \n     writing, but, absent permission of the Executive Director or \n     her designee, must be provided before the hearing closes. The \n     Executive Director or her designee will rule on motions made \n     at the hearing.\n       (d) Posthearing motions. Motions made after the hearing \n     closes must be filed in writing with the Board. Any response \n     to a posthearing motion must be filed with the Board within \n     five (5) days after service of the motion.\n     Sec. 2422.20  Rights of parties at a pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Rights. A party at a pre-election investigatory hearing \n     will have the right:\n       (1) To appear in person or by a representative;\n       (2) To examine and cross-examine witnesses; and\n       (3) To introduce into the record relevant evidence.\n       (b) Documentary evidence and stipulations. Parties must \n     submit two (2) copies of documentary evidence to the \n     Executive Director or her designee and copies to all other \n     parties. Stipulations of fact between/among the parties may \n     be introduced into evidence.\n       (c) Oral argument. Parties will be entitled to a reasonable \n     period prior to the close of the hearing for oral argument. \n     Presentation of a closing oral argument does not preclude a \n     party from filing a brief under paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n       (d) Briefs. A party will be afforded an opportunity to file \n     a brief with the Board.\n       (1) An original and two (2) copies of a brief must be filed \n     with the Board within thirty (30) days from the close of the \n     hearing.\n       (2) A written request for an extension of time to file a \n     brief must be filed with and received by the Board no later \n     than five (5) days before the date the brief is due.\n       (3) No reply brief may be filed without permission of the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.21  Duties and powers of the Executive Director in \n         the conduct of the pre-election investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Duties. The Executive Director or her designee, on \n     behalf of the Board, will receive evidence and inquire fully \n     into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters \n     that are the subject of the investigatory hearing, and may \n     make recommendations on the record to the Board.\n       (b) Powers. During the period a case is assigned to the \n     Executive Director or her designee for pre-election \n     investigatory hearing and prior to the close of the hearing, \n     the Executive Director or her designee may take any action \n     necessary to schedule, conduct, continue, control, and \n     regulate the pre-election investigatory hearing, including \n     ruling on motions when appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.22  Objections to the conduct of the pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Objections. Objections are oral or written complaints \n     concerning the conduct of a pre-election investigatory \n     hearing.\n       (b) Exceptions to rulings. There are automatic exceptions \n     to all adverse rulings.\n     Sec. 2422.23  Election procedures.\n        (a) Executive Director conducts or supervises election. \n     The Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will decide \n     to conduct or supervise the election. In supervised \n     elections, employing offices or activities will perform all \n     acts as specified in the Election Agreement or Direction of \n     Election.\n       (b) Notice of election. Prior to the election a notice of \n     election, prepared by the Executive Director, will be posted \n     by the employing office or activity in places where notices \n     to employees are customarily posted and/or distributed in a \n     manner by which notices are normally distributed. The notice \n     of election will contain the details and procedures of the \n     election, including the appropriate unit, the eligibility \n     period, the date(s), hour(s) and location(s) of the election, \n     a sample ballot, and the effect of the vote.\n       (c) Sample ballot. The reproduction of any document \n     purporting to be a copy of the official ballot that suggests \n     either directly or indirectly to employees that the Board \n     endorses a particular choice in the election may constitute \n     grounds for setting aside an election if objections are filed \n     under Sec. 2422.26.\n       (d) Secret ballot. All elections will be by secret ballot.\n       (e) Intervenor withdrawal from ballot. When two or more \n     labor organizations are included as choices in an election, \n     an intervening labor organization may, prior to the approval \n     of an election agreement or before the direction of an \n     election, file a written request with the Executive Director \n     to remove its name from the ballot. If the request is not \n     received prior to the approval of an election agreement or \n     before the direction of an election, unless the parties \n     and the Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, agree \n     otherwise, the intervening labor organization will remain \n     on the ballot. The Executive Director's decision on the \n     request is final and not subject to the filing of an \n     application for review with the Board.\n       (f) Incumbent withdrawal from ballot in an election to \n     decertify an incumbent representative. When there is no \n     intervening labor organization, an election to decertify an \n     incumbent exclusive representative will not be held if the \n     incumbent provides the Executive Director with a written \n     disclaimer of any representation interest in the unit. When \n     there is an intervenor, an election will be held if the \n     intervening labor organization proffers a thirty percent \n     (30%) showing of interest within the time period established \n     by the Executive Director.\n       (g) Petitioner withdraws from ballot in an election. When \n     there is no intervening labor organization, an election will \n     not be held if the petitioner provides the Executive Director \n     with a written request to withdraw the petition. When there \n     is an intervenor, an election will be held if the intervening \n     labor organization proffers a thirty percent (30%) showing of \n     interest within the time period established by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (h) Observers. All parties are entitled to representation \n     at the polling location(s) by observers of their own \n     selection subject to the Executive Director's approval.\n       (1) Parties desiring to name observers must file in writing \n     with the Executive Director a request for specifically named \n     observers at least fifteen (15) days prior to an election. \n     The Executive Director may grant an extension of time for \n     filing a request for specifically named observers for good \n     cause where a party requests such an extension or on the \n     Executive Director's own motion. The request must name and \n     identify the observers requested.\n       (2) An employing office or activity may use as its \n     observers any employees who are not eligible to vote in the \n     election, except:\n       (i) Supervisors or management officials;\n       (ii) Employees who have any official connection with any of \n     the labor organizations involved; or\n       (iii) Non-employees of the legislative branch.\n       (3) A labor organization may use as its observers any \n     employees eligible to vote in the election, except:\n       (i) Employees on leave without pay status who are working \n     for the labor organization involved; or\n       (ii) Employees who hold an elected office in the union.\n       (4) Objections to a request for specific observers must be \n     filed with the Executive Director stating the reasons in \n     support within five (5) days after service of the request.\n       (5) The Executive Director's ruling on requests for and \n     objections to observers is final and binding and is not \n     subject to the filing of an application for review with the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.24  Challenged ballots.\n       (a) Filing challenges. A party or the Executive Director \n     may, for good cause, challenge the eligibility of any person \n     to participate in the election prior to the employee voting.\n       (b) Challenged ballot procedure. An individual whose \n     eligibility to vote is in dispute will be given the \n     opportunity to vote a challenged ballot. If the parties and \n     the Region are unable to resolve the challenged ballot(s) \n     prior to the tally of ballots, the unresolved\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\n     challenged ballot(s) will be impounded and preserved until a \n     determination can be made, if necessary, by the Executive \n     Director or the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.25  Tally of ballots.\n       (a) Tallying the ballots. When the election is concluded, \n     the Executive Director or her designee will tally the \n     ballots.\n       (b) Service of the tally. When the tally is completed, the \n     Executive Director will serve the tally of ballots on the \n     parties in accordance with the election agreement or \n     direction of election.\n       (c) Valid ballots cast. Representation will be determined \n     by the majority of the valid ballots cast.\n     Sec. 2422.26  Objections to the election.\n       (a) Filing objections to the election. Objections to the \n     procedural conduct of the election or to conduct that may \n     have improperly affected the results of the election may be \n     filed by any party. Objections must be filed and received by \n     the Executive Director within five (5) days after the tally \n     of ballots has been served. Any objections must be timely \n     regardless of whether the challenged ballots are sufficient \n     in number to affect the results of the election. The \n     objections must be supported by clear and concise reasons. An \n     original and two (2) copies of the objections must be \n     received by the Executive Director.\n       (b) Supporting evidence. The objecting party must file with \n     the Executive Director evidence, including signed statements, \n     documents and other materials supporting the objections \n     within ten (10) days after the objections are filed.\n     Sec. 2422.27  Determinative challenged ballots and \n         objections.\n       (a) Investigation. The Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, will investigate objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots that are sufficient in number to affect \n     the results of the election.\n       (b) Burden of proof. A party filing objections to the \n     election bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the \n     evidence concerning those objections. However, no party bears \n     the burden of proof on challenged ballots.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation, the \n     Executive Director will take appropriate action consistent \n     with Sec. 2422.30.\n       (d) Consolidated hearing on objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots and an unfair labor practice hearing. When \n     appropriate, and in accordance with Sec. 2422.33, objections \n     and/or determinative challenged ballots may be consolidated \n     with an unfair labor practice hearing. Such consolidated \n     hearings will be conducted by a Hearing Officer. Exceptions \n     and related submissions must be filed with the Board and the \n     Board will issue a decision in accordance with Part 2423 of \n     this chapter and section 406 of the CAA, except for the \n     following:\n       (1) Section 2423.18 of this Subchapter concerning the \n     burden of proof is not applicable;\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may not recommend remedial action \n     to be taken or notices to be posted; and,\n       (3) References to charge and complaint in Part 2423 of this \n     chapter will be omitted.\n     Sec. 2422.28  Runoff elections.\n       (a) When a runoff may be held. A runoff election is \n     required in an election involving at least three (3) choices, \n     one of which is no union or neither, when no choice receives \n     a majority of the valid ballots cast. However, a runoff may \n     not be held until the objections to the election and \n     determinative challenged ballots have been resolved.\n       (b) Eligibility. Employees who were eligible to vote in the \n     original election and who are also eligible on the date of \n     the runoff election may vote in the runoff election.\n       (c) Ballot. The ballot in the runoff election will provide \n     for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest \n     and second largest number of votes in the election.\n     Sec. 2422.29  Inconclusive elections.\n       (a) Inconclusive elections. An inconclusive election is one \n     where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the \n     outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:\n       (1) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one \n     of which is no union or neither and the votes are equally \n     divided; or\n       (2) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the \n     choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive \n     a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next \n     highest and same number of votes; or\n       (3) When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two \n     labor organizations and results in the votes being equally \n     divided; or\n       (4) When the Board determines that there have been \n     significant procedural irregularities.\n       (b) Eligibility to vote in a rerun election. A current \n     payroll period will be used to determine eligibility to vote \n     in a rerun election.\n       (c) Ballot. If a determination is made that the election is \n     inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices \n     that appeared on the original ballot.\n       (d) Number of reruns. There will be only one rerun of an \n     inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another \n     inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will indicate a \n     majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice \n     and a certification of results will be issued. If necessary, \n     a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.\n     Sec. 2422.30  Executive Director investigations, notices of \n         pre-election investigatory hearings, and actions; Board \n         Decisions and Orders.\n       (a) Executive Director investigation. The Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will make such \n     investigation of the petition and any other matter as the \n     Executive Director deems necessary.\n       (b) Executive Director notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing. On behalf of the Board, the Executive Director will \n     issue a notice of pre-election investigatory hearing to \n     inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact \n     exists, where there is an issue as to whether a question \n     concerning representation exists, and any time there is \n     reasonable cause to believe a question exists regarding unit \n     appropriateness.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation and/or \n     hearing, when a pre-election investigatory hearing has been \n     ordered, the Executive Director may, on behalf of the Board, \n     approve an election agreement, dismiss a petition or deny \n     intervention where there is an inadequate or invalid showing \n     of interest, or dismiss a petition where there is an \n     undisputed bar to further processing of the petition under \n     law, rule or regulation.\n       (d) Appeal of Executive Director action. A party may file \n     with the Board an application for review of an Executive \n     Director action taken pursuant to section (c) above.\n       (e) Contents of the Record. When no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing has been conducted all material \n     submitted to and considered by the Executive Director during \n     the investigation becomes a part of the record. When a pre-\n     election investigatory hearing has been conducted, the \n     transcript and all material entered into evidence, including \n     any posthearing briefs, become a part of the record.\n       (f) Transfer of record to Board; Board Decisions and \n     Orders. In cases that are submitted to the Board for decision \n     in the first instance, the Board shall decide the issues \n     presented based upon the record developed by the Executive \n     Director, including the transcript of the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing, if any, documents admitted into the \n     record and briefs and other approved submissions from the \n     parties. The Board may direct that a secret ballot \n     election be held, issue an order dismissing the petition, \n     or make such other disposition of the matter as it deems \n     appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.31  Application for review of an Executive Director \n         action.\n       (a) Filing an application for review. A party must file an \n     application for review with the Board within sixty (60) days \n     of the Executive Director's action. The sixty (60) day time \n     limit provided for in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f), as applied by the \n     CAA, may not be extended or waived.\n       (b) Contents. An application for review must be sufficient \n     to enable the Board to rule on the application without \n     recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its \n     discretion, examine the record in evaluating the application. \n     An application must specify the matters and rulings to which \n     exception(s) is taken, include a summary of evidence relating \n     to any issue raised in the application, and make specific \n     reference to page citations in the transcript if a hearing \n     was held. An application may not raise any issue or rely on \n     any facts not timely presented to the Executive Director.\n       (c) Review. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an \n     application for review when the application demonstrates that \n     review is warranted on one or more of the following grounds:\n       (1) The decision raises an issue for which there is an \n     absence of precedent;\n       (2) Established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or,\n       (3) There is a genuine issue over whether the Executive \n     Director has:\n       (i) Failed to apply established law;\n       (ii) Committed a prejudicial procedural error;\n       (iii) Committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a \n     substantial factual matter.\n       (d) Opposition. A party may file with the Board an \n     opposition to an application for review within ten (10) days \n     after the party is served with the application. A copy must \n     be served on the Executive Director and all other parties and \n     a statement of service must be filed with the Board.\n       (e) Executive Director action becomes the Board's action. \n     An action of the Executive Director becomes the action of the \n     Board when:\n       (1) No application for review is filed with the Board \n     within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive \n     Director's action; or\n       (2) A timely application for review is filed with the Board \n     and the Board does not undertake to grant review of the \n     Executive Director's action within sixty (60) days of the \n     filing of the application; or\n       (3) The Board denies an application for review of the \n     Executive Director's action.\n       (f) Board grant of review and stay. The Board may rule on \n     the issue(s) in an application for review in its order \n     granting the application for review. Neither filing nor \n     granting an application for review shall stay any action \n     ordered by the Executive Director unless specifically ordered \n     by the Board.\n       (g) Briefs if review is granted. If the Board does not rule \n     on the issue(s) in the application for review in its order \n     granting review, the Board may, in its discretion, afford the \n     parties an opportunity to file briefs. The briefs will be \n     limited to the issue(s) referenced in the Board's order \n     granting review.\n     Sec. 2422.32  Certifications and revocations.\n       (a) Certifications. The Executive Director, on behalf of \n     the Board, will issue an appropriate certification when:\n       (1) After an election, runoff, or rerun,\n       (i) No objections are filed or challenged ballots are not \n     determinative, or\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\n       (ii) Objections and determinative challenged ballots are \n     decided and resolved; or\n       (2) The Executive Director takes an action requiring a \n     certification and that action becomes the action of the Board \n     under Sec. 2422.31(e) or the Board otherwise directs the \n     issuance of a certification.\n       (b) Revocations. Without prejudice to any rights and \n     obligations which may exist under the CAA, the Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will revoke a recognition \n     or certification, as appropriate, and provide a written \n     statement of reasons when an incumbent exclusive \n     representative files, during a representation proceeding, a \n     disclaimer of any representational interest in the unit.\n     Sec. 2422.33  Relief obtainable under Part 2423.\n       Remedial relief that was or could have been obtained as a \n     result of a motion, objection, or challenge filed or raised \n     under this subpart, may not be the basis for similar relief \n     if filed or raised as an unfair labor practice under Part \n     2423 of this Chapter: provided, however, that related matters \n     may be consolidated for hearing as noted in Sec. 2422.27(d) \n     of this subpart.\n     Sec. 2422.34  Rights and obligations during the pendency of \n         representation proceedings.\n       (a) Existing recognitions, agreements, and obligations \n     under the CAA. During the pendency of any representation \n     proceeding, parties are obligated to maintain existing \n     recognitions, adhere to the terms and conditions of existing \n     collective bargaining agreements, and fulfill all other \n     representational and bargaining responsibilities under the \n     CAA.\n       (b) Unit status of individual employees. Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (a) of this section and except as otherwise \n     prohibited by law, a party may take action based on its \n     position regarding the bargaining unit status of individual \n     employees, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(2), 7112(b) and \n     (c), as applied by the CAA: provided, however, that its \n     actions may be challenged, reviewed, and remedied where \n     appropriate.\n\n              PART 2423--UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDINGS\n\n     Sec.\n     2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n     2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n     2423.3  Who may file charges.\n     2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n     2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or \n         the negotiability procedure.\n     2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n     2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n     2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n     2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n     2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n     2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n     2423.12  Filing and contents of the complaint.\n     2423.13  Answer to the complaint.\n     2423.14  Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing.\n     2423.15  Intervention.\n     2423.16  [Reserved]\n     2423.17  [Reserved]\n     2423.18  Burden of proof before the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.19  Duties and powers of the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.20  [Reserved]\n     2423.21  [Reserved]\n     2423.22  [Reserved]\n     2423.23  [Reserved]\n     2423.24  [Reserved]\n     2423.25  [Reserved]\n     2423.26  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n         Office.\n     2423.27  Appeal to the Board.\n     2423.28  [Reserved]\n     2423.29  Action by the Board.\n     2423.30  Compliance with decisions and orders of the Board.\n     2423.31  Backpay proceedings.\n     Sec. 2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n       This part is applicable to any charge of alleged unfair \n     labor practices occurring on or after October 1, 1996.\n     Sec. 2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n       (a) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of \n     all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be \n     the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage \n     all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons \n     against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good \n     faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of \n     unfair labor practice charges.\n       (b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph \n     (a) of this section, and noting the 180 day period of \n     limitation set forth in section 220(c)(2) of the CAA, it \n     shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to \n     encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice \n     allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to \n     the filing of a complaint by the General Counsel.\n       (c) In order to afford the parties an opportunity to \n     implement the policy referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of \n     this section, the investigation of an unfair labor practice \n     charge by the General Counsel will normally not commence \n     until the parties have been afforded a reasonable amount of \n     time, not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the filing of the \n     charge, during which period the parties are urged to attempt \n     to informally resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n     Sec. 2423.3  Who may file charges.\n       An employing office, employing activity, or labor \n     organization may be charged by any person with having engaged \n     in or engaging in any unfair labor practice prohibited under \n     5 U.S.C. 7116, as applied by the CAA.\n     Sec. 2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n       (a) A charge alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. 7116, as \n     applied by the CAA, shall be submitted on forms prescribed by \n     the General Counsel and shall contain the following:\n       (1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) \n     making the charge;\n       (2) The name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office or activity, or labor organization against whom the \n     charge is made;\n       (3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting \n     the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the \n     section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 71 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code made applicable by the CAA alleged to have \n     been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the \n     particular acts; and\n       (4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving \n     the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, \n     including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) \n     has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has \n     been referred to the Board under Part 2471 of these \n     regulations, or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \n     Service, or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by \n     the charging party in a petition pending before the Board \n     pursuant to Part 2424 of this subchapter.\n       (b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall \n     contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under \n     the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its \n     contents are true and correct to the best of that person's \n     knowledge and belief.\n       (c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit \n     to the General Counsel any supporting evidence and documents.\n     Sec. 2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability \n     issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part \n     2424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same \n     negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case.\n     Sec. 2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n       (a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together \n     with one copy for each additional charged party named shall \n     be filed with the General Counsel.\n       (b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall \n     be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge \n     (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the \n     person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a \n     written statement of such service with the General Counsel. \n     The General Counsel will, as a matter of course, cause a copy \n     of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the \n     charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume \n     responsibility for such service.\n       (c) A charge will be deemed to be filed when it is received \n     by the General Counsel in accordance with the requirements in \n     paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. 2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall conduct such investigation of \n     the charge as the General Counsel deems necessary. Consistent \n     with the policy set forth in Sec. 2423.2, the investigation \n     will normally not commence until the parties have been \n     afforded a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed fifteen \n     (15) days from the filing of the charge, to informally \n     resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n       (b) During the course of the investigation all parties \n     involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence \n     and views to the General Counsel.\n       (c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all \n     persons are expected to cooperate fully with the General \n     Counsel.\n       (d) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all \n     parties involved and the voluntary submission of all \n     potentially relevant information from all potential sources \n     during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall \n     be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect \n     the identity of individuals and the substance of the \n     statements and information they submit or which is obtained \n     during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's \n     and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all \n     relevant information.\n     Sec. 2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n       Prior to the issuance of a complaint, the charging party \n     may amend the charge in accordance with the requirements set \n     forth in Sec. 2423.6.\n     Sec. 2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall take action which may consist \n     of the following, as appropriate:\n       (1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\n       (2) Refuse to file a complaint;\n       (3) Approve a written settlement and recommend that the \n     Executive Director approve a written settlement agreement in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 414 of the CAA;\n       (4) File a complaint;\n       (5) Upon agreement of all parties, transfer to the Board \n     for decision, after filing of a complaint, a stipulation of \n     facts in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2429.1(a) of \n     this subchapter; or\n       (6) Withdraw a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n       (a) If the General Counsel determines that the charge has \n     not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an \n     unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the \n     General Counsel may request the charging party to withdraw \n     the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a \n     reasonable time, decline to file a complaint.\n       (b) The charging party may not obtain a review of the \n     General Counsel's decision not to file a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n       (a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where \n     time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest \n     permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to \n     submit to the Executive Director or General Counsel, as \n     appropriate, for consideration, all facts and arguments \n     concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.\n\n                        Precomplaint settlements\n\n       (b)(1) Prior to the filing of any complaint or the taking \n     of other formal action, the General Counsel will afford the \n     charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time \n     in which to enter into a settlement agreement to be submitted \n     to and approved by the General Counsel and the Executive \n     Director. Upon approval by the General Counsel and Executive \n     Director and compliance with the terms of the settlement \n     agreement, no further action shall be taken in the case. If \n     the respondent fails to perform its obligations under the \n     settlement agreement, the General Counsel may determine to \n     institute further proceedings.\n       (2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses \n     to become a party to a settlement agreement offered by the \n     respondent, if the General Counsel concludes that the offered \n     settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as \n     applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel and the latter shall \n     decline to file a complaint.\n\n                    Post complaint settlement policy\n\n       (c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) \n     of this section, even after the filing of a complaint, the \n     Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may \n     be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. \n     The parties may, as part of the settlement, agree to waive \n     their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may \n     issue an order requiring the respondent to take action \n     appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily such a \n     settlement agreement will also contain the respondent's \n     consent to the Board's application for the entry of a decree \n     by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     enforcing the Board's order.\n\n                 Post complaint prehearing settlements\n\n       (d)(1) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging \n     party and the respondent enter into a settlement agreement, \n     and such agreement is accepted by the General Counsel, the \n     settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Executive \n     Director for approval.\n       (2) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging party \n     fails or refuses to become a party to a settlement agreement \n     offered by the respondent, and the General Counsel concludes \n     that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of \n     chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be \n     between the respondent and the General Counsel. The charging \n     party will be so informed and provided a brief written \n     statement by the General Counsel of the reasons therefor. The \n     settlement agreement together with the charging party's \n     objections, if any, and the General Counsel's written \n     statements, shall be submitted to the Executive Director for \n     approval. The Executive Director may approve or disapprove \n     any settlement agreement.\n       (3) After the filing of a complaint, if the General Counsel \n     concludes that it will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, \n     as applied by the CAA, the General Counsel may withdraw the \n     complaint.\n\n              Settlements after the opening of the hearing\n\n       (e)(1) After filing of a complaint and after opening of the \n     hearing, if the General Counsel concludes that it will \n     effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, \n     the General Counsel may request the Hearing Officer for \n     permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted \n     such permission to withdraw the complaint, may approve a \n     settlement and recommend that the Executive Director approve \n     the settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n       (2) If, after filing of a complaint and after opening of \n     the hearing, the parties enter into a settlement agreement \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, the General Counsel may request the Hearing \n     Officer and the Executive Director to approve such settlement \n     agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement \n     to the Board for approval.\n       (3) If the charging party fails or refuses to become a \n     party to a settlement agreement, offered by the respondent, \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, and the General Counsel concludes that the \n     offered settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter \n     71, as applied to the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel.

The exclusive representative shall request \n     such allegation in writing and the employing office shall \n     make the allegation in writing and serve a copy on the \n     exclusive representative: provided, however, that review of a \n     negotiability issue may be requested by an exclusive \n     representative under this subpart without a prior written \n     allegation by the employing office if the employing office \n     has not served such allegation upon the exclusive \n     representative within ten (10) days after the date of the \n     receipt by any employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations of a written request for such allegation.\n     Sec. 2424.4  Content of petition; service.\n       (a) A petition for review shall be dated and shall contain \n     the following:\n       (1) A statement setting forth the express language of the \n     proposal sought to be negotiated as submitted to the \n     employing office;\n       (2) An explicit statement of the meaning attributed to the \n     proposal by the exclusive representative including:\n       (i) Explanation of terms of art, acronyms, technical \n     language, or any other aspect of the language of the proposal \n     which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Where the proposal is concerned with a particular work \n     situation, or other particular circumstances, a description \n     of the situation or circumstances which will enable the Board \n     to understand the context in which the proposal is intended \n     to apply;\n       (3) A copy of all pertinent material, including the \n     employing office's allegation in writing that the matter, as \n     proposed, is not within the duty to bargain in good faith, \n     and other relevant documentary material; and\n       (4) Notification by the petitioning labor organization \n     whether the negotiability issue is also involved in an unfair \n     labor practice charge filed by such labor organization under \n     part 2423 of this subchapter and pending before the General \n     Counsel.\n       (b) A copy of the petition including all attachments \n     thereto shall be served on the employing office head and on \n     the principal employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations.\n       (c)(1) Filing an incomplete petition for review will result \n     in the exclusive representative being asked to provide the \n     missing or incomplete information. Noncompliance with a \n     request to complete the record may result in dismissal of the \n     petition.\n       (2) The processing priority accorded to an incomplete \n     petition, relative to other pending negotiability appeals, \n     will be based upon the date when the petition is completed \n     not the date it was originally filed.\n     Sec. 2424.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter which \n     involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization \n     also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the \n     same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case.\n     Sec. 2424.6  Position of the employing office; time limits \n         for filing; service.\n       (a) Within thirty (30) days after the date of the receipt \n     by the head of an employing office of a copy of a petition \n     for review of a negotiability issue the employing office \n     shall file a statement\n       (1) Withdrawing the allegation that the duty to bargain in \n     good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be \n     negotiated; or\n       (2) Setting forth in full its position on any matters \n     relevant to the petition which it wishes the Board to \n     consider in reaching its decision, including a full and \n     detailed statement of its reasons supporting the allegation. \n     The statement shall cite the section of any law, rule or \n     regulation relied upon as a basis for the allegation and \n     shall contain a copy of any internal employing office rule or \n     regulation so relied upon. The statement shall include:\n       (i) Explanation of the meaning the employing office \n     attributes to the proposal as a whole, including any terms of \n     art, acronyms, technical language or any other aspect of the \n     language of the proposal which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Description of a particular work situation, or other \n     particular circumstance the employing office views the \n     proposal to concern, which will enable the Board to \n     understand the context in which the proposal is considered to \n     apply by the employing office.\n       (b) A copy of the employing office's statement of position, \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     exclusive representative.\n     Sec. 2424.7  Response of the exclusive representative; time \n         limits for filing; service.\n       (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of the receipt \n     by an exclusive representative of a copy of an employing \n     office's statement of position the exclusive representative \n     shall file a full and detailed response stating its position \n     and reasons for:\n       (1) Disagreeing with the employing office's allegation that \n     the matter, as proposed to be negotiated, is inconsistent \n     with any Federal law or Government-wide rule or regulation; \n     or\n       (2) Alleging that the employing office's rules or \n     regulations violate applicable law, or rule or regulation or \n     appropriate authority outside the employing office; that the \n     rules or regulations were not issued by the employing office \n     or by any primary national subdivision of the employing \n     office, or otherwise are not applicable to bar negotiations \n     under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA; or that no \n     compelling need exists for the rules or regulations to bar \n     negotiations.\n       (b) The response shall cite the particular section of any \n     law, rule or regulation alleged to be violated by the \n     employing office's rules or regulations; or shall explain the \n     grounds for contending the employing office rules or \n     regulations are not applicable to bar negotiations under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA, or fail to meet the \n     criteria established in subpart B of this part, or were not \n     issued at the employing office headquarters level or at the \n     level of a primary national subdivision.\n       (c) A copy of the response of the exclusive representative \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     employing office head and on the employing office's \n     representative of record in the proceeding before the Board.\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\n     Sec. 2424.8  Additional submissions to the Board.\n       The Board will not consider any submission filed by any \n     party, whether supplemental or responsive in nature, other \n     than those authorized under Sec. Sec. 2424.2 through 2424.7 \n     unless such submission is requested by the Board; or unless, \n     upon written request by any party, a copy of which is served \n     on all other parties, the Board in its discretion grants \n     permission to file suchsubmission.\n     Sec. 2424.9  Hearing.\n       A hearing may be held, in the discretion of the Board, \n     before a determination is made under 5 U.S.C. 7117(b) or (c), \n     as applied by the CAA. If a hearing is held, it shall be \n     expedited to the extent practicable and shall not include the \n     General Counsel as a party.\n     Sec. 2424.10  Board decision and order; compliance.\n       (a) Subject to the requirements of this subpart the Board \n     shall expedite proceedings under this part to the extent \n     practicable and shall issue to the exclusive representative \n     and to the employing office a written decision on the \n     allegation and specific reasons therefor at the earliest \n     practicable date.\n       (b) If the Board finds that the duty to bargain extends to \n     the matter proposed to be bargained, the decision of the \n     Board shall include an order that the employing office shall \n     upon request (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties) \n     bargain concerning such matter. If the Board finds that the \n     duty to bargain does not extend to the matter proposed to be \n     negotiated, the Board shall so state and issue an order \n     dismissing the petition for review of the negotiability \n     issue. If the Board finds that the duty to bargain extends to \n     the matter proposed to be bargained only at the election of \n     the employing office, the Board shall so state and issue an \n     order dismissing the petition for review of the negotiability \n     issue.\n       (c) When an order is issued as provided in paragraph (b) of \n     this section, the employing office or exclusive \n     representative shall report to the Executive Director within \n     a specified period failure to comply with an order that the \n     employing office shall upon request (or as otherwise agreed \n     to by the parties) bargain concerning the disputed matter.\n\n   Subpart B--Criteria for Determining Compelling Need for Employing \n                      Office Rules and Regulations\n\n     Sec. 2424.11  Illustrative criteria.\n       A compelling need exists for an employing office rule or \n     regulation concerning any condition of employment when the \n     employing office demonstrates that the rule or regulation \n     meets one or more of the following illustrative criteria:\n       (a) The rule or regulation is essential, as distinguished \n     from helpful or desirable, to the accomplishment of the \n     mission or the execution of functions of the employing office \n     or primary national subdivision in a manner which is \n     consistent with the requirements of an effective and \n     efficient government.\n       (b) The rule or regulation is necessary to insure the \n     maintenance of basic merit principles.\n       (c) The rule or regulation implements a mandate to the \n     employing office or primary national subdivision under law or \n     other outside authority, which implementation is essentially \n     nondiscretionary in nature.\n\n                PART 2425--REVIEW OF ARBITRATION AWARDS\n\n     Sec.\n     2425.1  Who may file an exception;

Madam President, I rise today to express my great \nfrustration with the current state of aviation relations between the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom.\n  At a great cost to the United States economy, the highly restrictive \nUnited States/United Kingdom bilateral aviation agreement continues to \nbe an enormous barrier to free and fair trade between our countries. It \nis a barrier British negotiators have carefully crafted over the years \nthat, as intended, quite effectively limits competition in the United \nStates/United Kingdom air service market. Simply\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nput, it is an agreement which artificially manages air service trade in \na way that significantly benefits British carriers.\n  For U.S. passenger carriers serving the transatlantic air service \nmarket, these are both the best of times and the worst of times. On the \nbright side, the historic open skies agreement the United States \nrecently signed with the Federal Republic of Germany, combined with \nexisting open skies agreements with other European countries, means \nthat nearly half of all passengers traveling between the United States \nand Europe will be flying to or from European countries with open skies \nregimes. That truly is a remarkable statistic and great news for \nconsumers.\n  Our aviation relations with the British, however, stand in \ndisturbingly stark contrast. Although the British Government extols the \nvirtues of transatlantic free trade, its words ring hollow with respect \nto the United States/United Kingdom air service market. United States \ncarriers have proven themselves to be highly competitive in every \ninternational market they serve yet, all United States passenger \ncarriers combined have a smaller share of the United States/United \nKingdom air service market than just one British carrier, British \nAirways. Overall, two British carriers currently control nearly 50 \npercent more of the passenger traffic in that market than United States \ncarriers. As I have said before, I do not believe market forces are \nresponsible for this imbalance.\n  What adverse impacts does the highly restrictive United States/United \nKingdom bilateral aviation agreement have on the United States economy? \nFirst, each year our economy is losing hundreds of millions of dollars \nof export revenue United States carriers might otherwise capture if the \nUnited States/United Kingdom air service market truly was competitive. \nSecond, it is costing Americans new jobs which otherwise might be \ncreated if United States carriers could expand their services to the \nUnited Kingdom. Finally, consumer choice is badly restricted and \nconsumers are denied the most competitive air fares.\n  Several months ago I announced an initiative I hoped might jump start \nstalled air service negotiations with the British and remedy these \nadverse economic impacts. Regrettably, the British spurned that attempt \nand other good faith efforts by the administration to restart talks. \nFor that reason, I have decided to delay indefinitely my plans to \nintroduce legislation increasing the permissible level of foreign \nownership in the voting stock of U.S. carriers to 49 percent. That \nlegislation was the cornerstone of my initiative. If the British \nexhibit a genuine willingness to seriously address our air service \nconcerns, I will reconsider my decision.\n  Quite frankly, I am frustrated with the British intransigence in \naddressing this serious trade issue. They have long blamed a lack of \nreciprocal investment opportunities in the voting stock of U.S. \ncarriers as a stumbling block to progress in our air service \nrelationship. Finding some merit in that concern, I offered to \nintroduce legislation to address it and help clear the way for further \nliberalization of our aviation relationship. The British Government's \nreaction, however, calls into question whether reciprocal foreign \ninvestment opportunities ever were the concern the British have long \nplayed them up to be.\n  To underscore that skepticism, I noticed in recent months British \ncarriers have now moved onto criticizing United States policy on the \ngrounds of additional wish list rights such as cabotage and direct \nparticipation in the Fly America Program.\n  Madam President, it has become even more apparent in recent months \nthat British aviation policy is not driven by the goal of expanding \nrights for its carriers and moving forward in our aviation \nrelationship. Instead, the overarching goal of that policy seems to be \nnothing less than continuing to protect British carriers from vigorous \ncompetition with United States carriers.\n  In particular, the British Government wants to keep in place the \ncurrent system which blocks United States carriers from serving \nLondon's most popular airport, Heathrow, from most major passenger feed \nhubs in the United States. After all, under the current managed \ncompetition agreement, the British have totally blocked United States \npassenger feed to Heathrow from major United States hub airports \nincluding those located in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, \nDetroit, Houston, Minneapolis, Newark and St. Louis. No wonder United \nStates carriers do not use larger aircraft as the British often chide.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I hope the British \nGovernment will decide to get in step with the rest of Europe by \nfinally agreeing to take meaningful steps to liberalize the United \nStates/United Kingdom bilateral aviation agreement. The time for such \nliberalization is long past due.\n  Let me also add that I for one believe there will come a time when \nthe British truly want some significant aviation rights or regulatory \nrelief from the United States. When that time comes, I fully expect the \nadministration will use that leverage to the fullest extent possible \nand demand a very high price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5089-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

SCRUSHY AND THE SPORTS MEDICINE COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, last week, one of Alabama's outstanding \ncitizens and great success stories came to Washington in his effort to \ngive something back to his country. Richard Scrushy is founder, \nchairman, and CEO of Healthsouth Corp., the Nation's largest provider \nof medical rehabilitation and sports medicine. He is also founder of \nthe Healthsouth Sports Medicine Council, a nonprofit organization whose \ngoal is to educate young athletes and help them become champions--not \nonly in sports, but in every-day life.\n  The Sports Medicine Council is made up of top professional athletes \nand the Nation's leading sports medicine physicians and orthopaedic \nsurgeons. The group unites sports celebrities who know the importance \nof good attitude, team spirit, and competitiveness, with physicians who \nhave studied how the human body works, how to make it strong, and how \nto keep it well. Under Richard Scrushy's direction, this group has \ncrafted a program and message that ultimately will reach hundreds of \nthousands of school children between the ages of 8 and 18 in cities \nacross the United States. It will teach kids the importance of \nreceiving an education, staying away from drugs, and practicing good \nsportsmanship on and off the field.\n  Last week in Washington, the Sports Medicine Council's message \nreached nearly 14,000 kids through a series of field trips to Sports \nMedicine Council shows. They were hosted by such sports figures as Bo \nJackson, Herschel Walker, Kristi Yamaguchi, Cory Everson, and Lex \nLuger. The shows combined\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\nhigh-technology, interactive entertainment with the council's message \nand a hands-on opportunity for kids to meet their sports heroes and \nplay on a team with them.\n  In a time when many of America's youth are in urgent need of positive \nrole models and encouragement, Richard Scrushy's Sports Medicine \nCouncil is a wonderful idea and most welcome enterprise. It represents \none of the ways in which private individuals and good corporate \ncitizens can make a difference through their own initiatives. In this \nway, Richard Scrushy serves as a role model for all corporate CEO's.\n  Richard is truly one of the great American success stories. He is a \nself-made man who has never forgotten his roots. Part of his vision is \nto give back to his community. In the 12 years since the founding of \nHealthsouth Corp., he has led the company to employ over 33,000 people \nin over 900 locations across the United States. Healthsouth is an \nemployer of over 3,000 people in Alabama alone. The company's revenues \nrecently rose above the $2 billion mark. Not only has Richard Scrushy \nbeen a good citizen, he has been a great asset to the State of Alabama.\n  He has received such awards and honors as the 1994 Arthritis \nFoundation Humanitarian of the Year Award. He was named National \nHonorary Chairman of Multiple Sclerosis for the National Multiple \nSclerosis Society. He has worked as a fundraiser for such charities as \nUnited Cerebral Palsy, the Ronald McDonald House, and the American \nCancer Society.\n  As a modern-day, ``renaissance man,'' Richard is an accomplished \nmusician and also a commercial multiengine instrument pilot.\n  I congratulate Richard Scrushy on his tremendous success and on the \nrapid growth and contributions of the Healthsouth Sports Medicine \nCouncil. His is a tremendous example for others in the business \ncommunity to emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5090-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE GAINES FAMILY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, as we observe National Police Week, I \nwant to pay a special tribute to one police family in Massachusetts. \nFor the third year in a row, a group of 46 officers and friends from \nMassachusetts rode the 600 miles to Washington on their bicycles to \nattend ceremonies at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial to \nhonor those who have fallen in the line of duty. Among that group is \nOfficer Paul Gaines and his three sons, Kevin, 10 years old; Stephen, \n12; and Shawn, 14. Back at home, and missing her sons on Mother's Day \nis Sgt. Gladys Gaines, head of the Boston Police Department's domestic \nviolence unit.\n  This remarkable family is an inspiration to all of us. While \ndysfunctional families who raise troubled children make the news, Paul \nand Gladys Gaines have obviously imparted to their children high moral \nvalues and a sense of responsibility to family and community, their own \nfamily, the family of brother and sister law enforcement officers, and \nthe larger community of the Commonwealth. I want to pay tribute to the \nGaines family and to the work they do as police officers and as \nparents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5091-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO MISSOURI DEPUTY KEVIN M. MAYSE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                        OFFICERS KILLED IN 1995\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I rise today to honor the heroic \nservice of our Nation's law enforcement officers, especially those who \nhave paid the ultimate price in the line of duty. Facing increasingly \norganized and violent criminals, these brave men and women constitute \nthe first line of defense against those who threaten society. We should \nbe thankful that they do not shrink from this challenge. In the quest \nfor law and order, 161 of our Nation's finest citizens made the supreme \nsacrifice in 1995, laying down their lives so that the rest of us may \nenjoy peace and prosperity. It is to honor their memory that today is \nproclaimed National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  I wish to honor in particular a brave, young Missourian. Cass County \nDeputy Sheriff Kevin M. Mayse died on June 13, 1995, from injuries \nsustained while preserving and enhancing the quality of life enjoyed by \nhis fellow Missourians in Cass County. Deputy Mayse left behind a \nwidow, Scottie Sue, and four children, including his youngest daughter \nwhom he never had the joy to meet since she was born a month after \nKevin's death.\n  As we honor those who have fallen while protecting others, we should \nalso honor those such as Scottie Sue and her children who have paid a \nvery high price for our protection as well. In his autobiography, \nBenjamin Franklin wrote: ``The most acceptable service of God is doing \ngood to man.'' The Bible says that there is no greater love than ``when \none lays down his life for his friends.'' I can think of no greater \nservice to his fellow man than that given by Deputy Sheriff Mayse.\n  Three Missouri peace officers who died before 1995 have also been \nadded to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Officers \nGeorge M. McCready of Richmond Heights, Max W. Smith of Moniteau \nCounty, and George Adams of St. Louis County also gave their lives in \ndefense of their fellow citizens.\n  As we honor those lawmen slain in the line of duty, let us not forget \nthose who carry on as guardians of our peace. We must protect them in \nturn by providing them with the tools and the laws necessary to wage \nthe war against the ever-changing face of crime. Today, violent \njuvenile crime is growing at a phenomenal rate, yet our juvenile \njustice system is ill-prepared to cope with its dramatic rise or its \nbrutality. Major reconstruction of the Federal and State juvenile \njustice systems is needed to ensure that violent and hardcore \ncriminals, old and young, are identified, punished, and deterred. We \nalso need to ensure that our fallen heroes, such as Deputy Sheriff \nKevin Mayse, are not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5091-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5091-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ENTITLED ``SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATOR--1996''--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 145\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the \nCongress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and \nEngineering Indicators--1996.

A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nimprove the administration of the act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           The Packers and Stockyards Improvement Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nrepresents the first of several steps I am taking to get action on \nproblems facing our domestic cattle industry. For the past year, I have \nbeen pressing the Clinton administration to address meatpacker \nconcentration and utilize existing antitrust laws to make sure that \ncattle are sold in an open and competitive market. We have seen some \naction on the part of the administration to solve this problem. \nFrankly, its proposals offer nothing new. My bill is a necessary first \nstep to pry open the market.\n  Another step in the process is to get the Senate more engaged on the \nissue. As part of that effort, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nForestry, and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation will hold a series of hearings on this subject next \nmonth. Cattle producers are facing the worst economic times in recent \nmemory. The President has the authority to order immediate Justice \nDepartment action. Antitrust laws should be enforced now.\n  I have been saying that for months, but my words have fallen on deaf \nears. Only by taking action to enforce antitrust laws already on the \nbooks can we ensure the long-term economic viability of the U.S. cattle \nindustry.\n  South Dakota ranchers know that any real solution to beef prices must \ninclude antitrust action. It took only a few days and a 14 percent \nincrease in the price of gasoline for the President to ask the Justice \nDepartment to establish a five-person task force to investigate \npossible antitrust violations. The facts are these: first, cattle \nprices are at their lowest levels in years; second, only a handful of \nthe top packers control nearly 85 percent the market; and third, retail \nprices do not reflect the dramatically reduced price paid for cattle. \nSomething is not right.\n  The bill I am introducing accomplishes three things that South Dakota \ncattlemen have told me must be done. First, the bill would establish a \nlivestock dealer trust. This would protect sellers from any losses when \ncattle are sold on commission to a dealer or market agency that goes \nbankrupt. This was part of the Senate-passed farm bill, but was not in \nthe final version that was signed into law. Second, the bill would \nrequire the Packers and Stockyards Administration to include formula-\npriced cattle in the definition of captive supplies. During the Senate \nCommerce Committee hearing I held last year in Huron, SD, producers \nmade it loud and clear that this needed to be done. Finally, the bill \nwould require the Secretary of Agriculture to make timely reports on \nthe numbers of livestock and livestock products that are exported and \nimported, and also require the reporting of prices paid for livestock.\n  The Senate needs to carefully review this bill and other issues \nconfronting the U.S. cattle industry. Packer concentration, price \nmanipulation, possible price fixing and captive supply all must be \nlooked at and a definite course of action implemented. The introduction \nof this bill today is the first step in this process.\n  We need to keep in mind that old saying ``if it ain't broke, don't \nfix it.'' Well the U.S. cattle industry is broke and it needs fixing, \nnow. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n       By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n\n  S. 1759. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to require that \nwritten notice be furnished by the Office of Personnel Management \nbefore making any susbtantial change in the health benefits program for \nFederal employees; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n      The Federal Health Benefit Change Accountability Act of 1996\n\nMs. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with \nmy colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, the Federal Health \nBenefit Change Accountability Act. This bill is also being introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Ben Cardin. Our \nlegislation will ensure that Congress has an opportunity to respond to \nany proposed reductions in retired Federal employee health benefits.\n  I want to save lives, save jobs, and save money. The 1996 \nprescription plan for Federal retirees that Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nnegotiated with the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] is \njeopardizing jobs, and in some cases may be jeopardizing lives. I want \nthis policy changed for 1997, and I want to make sure that Congress is \nwell informed of any future changes in health benefits.\n  Our bill will protect retired federal employees from the type of \nattacks on their earned health benefits that we are seeing with this \nplan. The bill would require a new reporting process at OPM. OPM would \nhave to provide an annual report to Congress that would describe any \nsignificant changes in Federal retiree health benefits. The report \nwould explain how proposed changes would affect retirees--both \nfinancially and in quality of care. The report would also explain what \ncost savings OPM expected to achieve. Congress would have time to react \nif there were concerns with the changes.\n  This legislation is necessary because of the terrible situation \nour Federal retirees find themselves in today with their Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield prescription benefits. Retirees in this prescription plan \nhave a new 20-percent copayment at their neighborhood pharmacies. This \nis forcing retirees out of neighborhood pharmacy and away from the \npharmacists they know and trust. They are forced to use mail order for \nmost of their prescription needs, where there is no copayment, and \nwhere their care consists of an 800 number and a mail box.\n\n  I've been meeting with Federal retiree groups and with pharmacy \ngroups, and what I'm hearing about this plan has disturbed me greatly.\n  I'm hearing about elderly retirees who are confused about how and \nwhen to use mail order.\n  I'm hearing about local pharmacies that are losing as much as 30 \npercent of their business and that are going to have to lay off \nemployees. I'm hearing about jobs being lost because local pharmacies \nare being cut out of the business of providing care to Federal \nretirees.\n  I'm not antimail order, but I think it should be used under the right \ncircumstances. A person can't wait for mail order when a weekend ear \nache or a stomach virus strikes. A local pharmacist must be available \nright then. That is the safety net that allows mail order to work.\n  As my colleagues know, retirees have special health needs that are \ndifferent from the majority of younger Federal employees. They \nfrequently take more than one medication at a time, and they have \ncomplicated medical histories.\n  They also need the personal drug education and counseling that local \npharmacy is able to provide. When they don't get this education and \ncounseling, studies show they end up in the hospital because of \nnoncompliance with their drug directions.\n  Community pharmacy is the last health care professional a retiree \nwill see before taking that prescription. We need to think very \nseriously about what that means and what the consequences are to \nretirees. Unfortunately, OPM did not put enough thought into these \nconsequences when the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan was approved.\n  The very people who are unable to pay the 20-percent copayment \nbecause they are on fixed incomes and are forced to use mail order, are \nthe people who are most likely to need the face to face counseling and \ndrug education that they cannot get at mail order pharmacy.\n  That's why we need a drug benefit that achieves fiscal discipline but \nthat allows retirees choice in their pharmacy care. Otherwise we end up \ntreating prescriptions like a commodity. We end up managing the benefit \ninstead of managing the patient.\n  Federal retirees have served us honorably and we must value them. We \ndon't value them with words, we do it with actions. They earned and \ndeserve retirement security and health security, and I want to see this \ngovernment honor the promises that were made to them when they signed \nup for service.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help ensure that the \npromise of quality health care is not bargained away by the Office of \nPersonnel Management in the future.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Bradley, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1760. A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to improve child support enforcement services, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the child support improvement act of 1996\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Child \nSupport Improvement Act of 1996.\n  Fourteen months ago, Senator Dole and I introduced our bill, the \nChild Support Responsibility Act of 1995, which later became an \nimportant piece of the welfare reform bill. Since that time, Congress \nhas twice passed welfare reform, and twice it has been vetoed.\n  And now, we are in much the same place we were 14 months ago. While \nit is my sincerest hope that child support will pass as part of a \ncomprehensive\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nwelfare reform bill this year, I believe that we must seize this \nopportunity to move forward on child support. Because this issue is too \nimportant to the future of American children to stand by and wait any \nlonger.\n  For many of our Nation's children, the American dream is a rapidly \nfading mirage--one that they can see but are unable to firmly grasp. \nI'm talking specifically about the millions of children who suffer from \nthe neglect of deadbeat parents--those parents who help bring a child \ninto the world and then, for whatever reasons, renege on their \nresponsibilities as a parent to care for them and give them the tools \nnecessary to craft a better life than the one we enjoy today.\n  At a time when one in four children grow up in single-parent \nhouseholds, the crisis of unpaid child support remains a heavy burden. \nIt is a burden that has not only taken an emotional toll on single \nparents and their children, but an economic toll as well. And it is \nsapping the financial resources of our State governments.\n  While many single parents have had some success in winning child \nsupport, only half of those who succeed actually receive what is owed. \nThe other half receives partial payments or no payments at all. And an \nalarming 40 percent of single parents who seek child support do not \nsucceed in winning any order at all. That means that, while the \npotential for child support collections is estimated to exceed $47 \nbillion each year, only $15 billion or so is ever collected from \nnoncustodial parents.\n  Worse yet, those single parents who have never been married have a \ndifficult time receiving any child support payments at all. Data \ncollected from the 1990 census indicates that of all mothers who have \nnever been married, 75 percent did not have child support orders and \nmore than 50 percent had household incomes below the poverty level.\n  These statistics translate into unprecedented burdens for single \nparents and their children, many of whom struggle to find good child \ncare, quality medical care, warm clothes, or simply put food on the \ntable.\n  In all fairness, Congress has tried to strengthen child support \nenforcement mechanisms prior to this term. In 1975, Congress did pass \nthe Child Support Enforcement and Paternity Establishment Program as \npart of the Social Security Act, and then it enacted further \nimprovements to this effort by way of the 1984 Child Support \nEnforcement Amendments and the Family Support Act of 1988.\n  Despite these actions, States have been hard pressed to keep pace \nwith the virtual tidal wave of mothers seeking child support. States \nare faced with the daunting task of locating parents, establishing \npaternity, establishing child support orders, and collecting child \nsupport payments. Yet States have been hampered by a lack of leadership \nand technical support from the Federal Government.\n  As a former Member of the House of Representatives, I have a long \nhistory of working to change and improve Federal laws governing child \nsupport enforcement, and introduced my own legislation to help relieve \nsingle parents and their children of the institutional barriers to \nprogress on this issue. As cochair of the Congressional Caucus for \nWomen's Issues, we made child support enforcement one of our top \nlegislative priorities in previous Congresses, where some 30 bills were \nintroduced to address this problem. But I believe we have come to a \npoint where everyone agrees that child support enforcement is one of \nthe most important aspects of our campaign to revamp the welfare system \nof this country. It affects every State--children at every income \nlevel--and it affects both single mothers and single fathers. As a \nnational problem, child support enforcement merits a national solution. \nAnd we must demonstrate our leadership by providing it.\n  That's why I have joined forces again with the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, to introduce the Child Support Improvement Act of \n1996. I should add, Mr. President, that this bill has true bipartisan \nsupport, and is intended to complement the efforts of my House \ncolleagues, Congresswomen Nancy Johnson and Barbara Kennelly, who have \nintroduced companion legislation in the House. Together, we have \nintroduced the same child support provisions which received \noverwhelming support from both parties of Congress, as well as the \nadministration, during welfare reform.\n  By passing this legislation, we will send a clear signal to deadbeat \nparents that their days of irresponsibility are over. We will also send \nclear signal to States that the Federal Government will provide them \nwith the assistance they need to collect child support on behalf of \nmillions of American families.\n  The bill contains commonsense reforms which achieve the following:\n  To strengthen efforts to locate parents, it expands the Federal \nparent locator system by creating Federal and State data banks of child \nsupport orders, and allowing State-to-State access of the network. It \nalso creates Federal and State directories of new hires, to allow for \nbasic information supplied by employers from W-4 forms to be compared \nagainst child support data.\n\n  To ensure that collected funds go to families as soon as possible, it \nestablishes a centralized State collections and disbursements unit, and \nrequires employers that garnish wages from employees to pay those \nwithheld wages to the State within 5 days.\n  To increase paternity establishment, our approach simplifies \npaternity procedures, facilitates voluntary acknowledgement, and \nencourages outreach.\n  To ensure that child support orders are fair and equitable to \nchildren, it provides for a simplified process for review and \nadjustment of child support orders, and requires provisions for heath \ncare coverage to be required in child support orders. And to facilitate \nchild support enforcement and collection, it requires States to adopt \nthe Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, to encourage the seamless \nenforcement of child support orders across State lines.\n  Finally, this bill expands the penalties for child support \ndelinquency to include the denial of professional, recreational and \ndriver's license to deadbeat parents, and permits the denial of a \npassport for individuals who are more than $5,000 in arrears. My \nhusband, former Gov. Jock McKernan, pioneered a similar program in \nMaine in 1993. This program has been an amazing success in my home \nState. Between August 1993 and April 1996, $44 million was collected in \noutstanding child support payments from 15,000 individuals. In fact, in \none case, a long-haul trucker who owed the State $19,000 drove to the \nState capitol and paid the amount in one lump sum. In another case, a \nreal estate agent who owed more than $11,000 in child support money \ncontacted the State and agreed to sell off some land to pay off his \ndebt. Clearly, it's worth taking these steps. But we can do--and should \ndo--much more.\n  Mr. President, perhaps if we can replicate the successes of States \nlike Maine on a national level, we can begin to ease and eventually \nlift the economic and emotional burdens caused by delinquent child \nsupport payments, and at last bring the justice, security, and equity \nto millions of single parents and their children.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \nnoncustodial parents begin to accept and bear responsibility for their \nchildren, who will reap the financial support they so justly deserve \nand desperately need.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Bumpers):\n  S. 1761. A bill to eliminate taxpayer subsidies for recreational \nshooting transfer of federally owned weapons, ammunition, funds, and \nother property to the private Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle \nPractice and Firearms Safety; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n      the self-financing civilian marksmanship program act of 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Self Financing \nCivilian Marksmanship Program Act of 1996. I'm pleased that Senator \nBumpers is joining me in introducing this legislation.\n  The goal of this legislation is simple: to block the transfer of a \n$76 million Federal endowment to American gun clubs.\n  The Defense Department concluded long ago that the Army-run Civilian \nMarksmanship Program does not serve any military purpose. Even so, \nuntil recently the program was sustained by an annual $2.5 million \nFederal subsidy.\n  To extricate the Army from this program, while ensuring a steady \nstream\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nof firearms to gun enthusiasts, pro-gun Members of Congress established \na so-called private nonprofit version of the program in the fiscal year \n1996 Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  In reality, the new corporation is private in name only. In fact, \nCongress blessed it with a multimillion-dollar endowment.\n  When the corporation becomes fully operational in October 1996, it \nwill take control of 176,218 rifles worth more than $53 million. It \nwill receive $4.4 million in cash and be given property valued at $8.8 \nmillion. Even more remarkable, the corporation will be given control of \n146 million rounds of ammunition worth $9.7 million.\n  The old program was a flagrant example of government waste. The new \nversion makes even less sense, since it relinquishes government control \nover the program.\n  In 1993, the General Services Administration reconfirmed a long-\nstanding government policy. Under that policy, the Federal Government \ndoes not sell federally owned weapons to the public.\n  The Congress should not make an exception for the private, nonprofit \nCorporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety. \nThe U.S. Government shouldn't be an arms merchant.\n  Given the plethora of weapons readily available through the private \nsector, guns for which the federal government no longer has a use \nshould be destroyed, and the corporation should be abolished.\n  Our bill would do just that. It would abolish the so-called private \ncorporation, block the transfer of this $76 million endowment, and end \nthe federally run Civilian Marksmanship Program once and for all. It \nwould not prohibit gun clubs from operation, but it would not subsidize \nthem with federally owned weapons, ammunition, property, and cash.\n  This gift of millions of dollars' worth of weapons and ammunition is \nterrible public policy. In fact, it's outrageous. The Government must \nwork, to stem the rising tide of gun violence in this country, not aid \nand abet it.\n  I hope the Congress will approve this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the Washington Post article on this program and \na copy of the legislation be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1761\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It requires the Army to transfer \n     control over the rifles for free to a new nonprofit \n     corporation. The corporation will sell them to benefit \n     marksmanship programs and the yearly target tournament in \n     Camp Perry, Ohio, which is managed by the NRA.\n       The old Army-administered program also co-sponsored the \n     annual Ohio tournament with the NRA, and over the years the \n     NRA used its close relationship with the project to market \n     itself, critics of the group said.\n       Congress's action marked the death of the Army-administered \n     program, called the Civilian Marksmanship Program, which \n     critics called one of the U.S. government's oddest pork-\n     barrel projects. The Pentagon ran it for decades but has \n     sought to disentangle itself in recent years.\n       The program harkens to 1903, just after the Spanish-\n     American War. U.S. military officials were upset to learn \n     farm boys conscripted for that conflict were not the rustics \n     of romantic American novels who could nail a jack rabbit from \n     200 yards--in fact, they couldn't hit a barn. Congress \n     established the project, supported by U.S. military guns and \n     money, to promote sharpshooting in future wars.\n       ``The gift of millions of dollars worth of weapons and \n     ammunition is terrible public policy,'' said Sen. Frank R. \n     Lautenberg (D-N.J.) in a column in USA Today. ``In fact, it's \n     outrageous. The government must work to stem the rising tide \n     of gun violence in this country, not aid and abet it.''\n       ``This program historically has been a federal subsidy to \n     the NRA's marketing,'' said Josh Sugarmann, a gun-control \n     activist and author of a 1992 book critical of the NRA. \n     Congress's latest action, he added, is ``a new funding \n     mechanism'' that also helps the NRA.\n       The great majority of the gun clubs that take part in the \n     marksmanship program are affiliated with the NRA, he said. \n     For decades, in fact, the guns' buyers had to prove to the \n     Army they were NRA members--until a federal judge stopped the \n     requirement in 1979.\n       Promoters of the 93-year-old program say it's no more \n     sinister than the Boy Scouts, the Future Farmers of America \n     and other youth groups that have taken part in its \n     marksmanship training. The M-1s that are sold are not used in \n     crimes, they said, because the strict background probes of \n     the guns' potential buyers cull out criminals. They also \n     point out that nine of the 10 members of America's 1992 \n     Olympic shooting team learned marksmanship in the program.\n       ``Any link opponents try to draw between this program and \n     urban violence is comparable to linking Olympic boxing \n     competition with hoodlum street fighting,'' said Rep. Paul E. \n     Gillmor (R-Ohio), who sponsored the new measure and whose \n     district draws 7,000 visitors and $10 million in revenue \n     during the summertime rifle competition.\n       Gillmor added that it would cost the military $500,000 to \n     destroy the guns, while the cost is nothing if it gives them \n     away.\n       Chip Walker, a National Rifle Association spokesman, said \n     Lautenberg and other critics of the program ``don't want to \n     promote firearms safety and responsibility.'' He added that \n     it's ``ironic'' that gun-control advocates for years have \n     criticized the NRA for its harsh rhetoric, urging it to stick \n     to its traditional mission of teaching firearms safety--and \n     now raise questions about its efforts to pursue even that \n     goal.\n       Almost all the guns the Army is to give away are M-1s, the \n     bolt-action rifle lugged by GIs onto the beaches at D-Day and \n     Guadalcanal. Replaced in 1958 by the M-14 as standard \n     infantry issue, and later by today's M-16, the M-1 is \n     prized by collectors and war buffs--especially the \n     pristine guns sold in their original boxes by the Army.\n       Last year the Army charged $310 each for the M-1s stored at \n     its Anniston Army Depot in Alabama--an increase from its \n     recent price of $250. In any case, those are discounts, \n     because M-1s usually sell for $400 to $500. In recent years \n     the program sold a maximum of 6,000 guns a year.\n       The measure recently signed into law by President Clinton \n     in essence privatizes the program and transfers ownership of \n     the 373,000 rifles to the new Corporation for the Promotion \n     of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety, whose board is to be \n     named by the Army. It will then sell the weapons for whatever \n     price the market will bear, and at whatever rate it chooses. \n     (The guns will remain at the Anniston facility until they are \n     sold.)\n       The law requires the Army to transfer to the new \n     corporation $5 million in cash the Army program has on hand, \n     $8 million in computers and other equipment, about 120 \n     million rounds of ammunition and the 373,000 guns. It's \n     estimated that only about 60 percent of the guns--about \n     224,000--are usable, and they could fetch about $100 million.\n       The Pentagon has sought to remove itself as administrator \n     of the program, under which it sold 6,000 guns a year and \n     donated $2.5 million annually to the Ohio competition, \n     military officials said. The main reason, they said, is that \n     they concluded that the program years ago stopped \n     contributing to ``military readiness.'' Moreover, Pentagon \n     officials were uncomfortable being involved in an issue as \n     controversial as firearms.\n       Finally, last year, military officials were upset by the \n     taint the program suffered when it was learned that members \n     of a Michigan militia had formed a gun club that became \n     officially affiliated with the Army program. Using that \n     affiliation, the militia members\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n     had taken target practice at a Michigan military base until \n     they were stopped.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PELL:\n  S.J. Res. 55. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to the commencement of the \nterms of office of the President, Vice President, and Members of \nCongress; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    presidential and congressional terms inauguration date advance \n                        constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President. I offer a joint resolution to amend the \nConstitution to advance the Inauguration dates for the President and \nMembers of Congress from January 20th and 3rd to December 10th and 1st \nrespectively. In offering this resolution here in the 104th Congress, I \nnote for my colleagues that this is an effort I first began in 1981 and \nwith each succeeding set of national elections, I believe that the \nrationale and wisdom for changing these dates becomes more compelling.\n  The current date for the Inauguration of the President was set by the \n20th amendment to the Constitution in 1933. Prior to that, the \nInauguration date had not changed since being fixed by an act of the \nContinental Congress in 1788 commencing the proceeding of the \nGovernment of the United States under the newly ratified Constitution. \nUnder that act, March 4th was chosen simply because it happened to be \nthe first Wednesday in March of 1789 and it was thought at the time \nthat that amount of time was needed for each State to appoint \nPresidential electors to the Electoral College and for them to meet and \ncast their ballots. Additionally, there were practical and controlling \nconsiderations over the difficulty and length of time it took to travel \nto and from the Capital City, the necessity for time to allow newly \nelected officials to tend to the long-term organization of their \nprivate affairs prior to their extended departure from home for \nWashington, and the lack of sophisticated means for the verification of \npolling results and for communication of news. Thus, in the founding \ndays of our country, March 4th was seen as the earliest possible date \nby which the Government could, in an orderly and practical manner, \nbring about the will of the electors as expressed in congressional and \nPresidential balloting from the previous November.\n  By 1933, however, it had become clear that it was no longer necessary \nto postpone the Inauguration of the President and Members of Congress \nuntil March 4th. Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska, the Champion of \nthe 20th amendment to the Constitution which advanced the Presidential \nand congressional Inauguration dates to their current status, said on \nthe Senate floor in 1932:\n\n       When our Constitution was adopted, there was some reason \n     for such a long intervention of time between the election and \n     actual commencement of work by the new Congress. We had \n     neither railroads nor telegraphic communication connecting \n     the various States and communities of the country. Under \n     present conditions, however, the result of elections is known \n     all over the country within a few hours after the polls \n     close, and the Capital City is within a few days' travel of \n     the remotest portions of the country.\n       . . . The only direct opportunity that the citizens of the \n     country have to express their ideas and their wishes in \n     regard to national legislation is the expression of their \n     will through the election of their representatives at the \n     general election in November. . . . In a government ``by the \n     people'' the wishes of a majority should be crystallized into \n     legislation as soon as possible after these wishes have been \n     made known. These mandates should be obeyed within a \n     reasonable time.\n\n  Those words ring true today. With the further advancement in travel, \ncommunications, polling, and the ascertainment of election results \nsince 1933, their remains no justification for the present lengthy \nhiatus between Election Day and Inauguration Day. We now know election \nresults within minutes of the last closing of the polls, indeed, \nusually before they close through news projections, and travel to \nWashington is an affair that can be accomplished in a day. The \nElectoral College could easily complete its duties within a few days \ntime and there is no impediment to the commencement of the terms of the \nMembers of Congress by December 1st. necessary because of the role of \nthe House of Representatives in the ratification of the results of the \nElectoral College. It is clear then that no structural or logistical \njustification exists for delaying the implementation of the decision of \nthe voters made at the polls in early November.\n\n  With no physical barriers to a more rapid installation of the \nPresident and Members of Congress, are there policy reasons for waiting \n2 months and more before swearing them into office? In my opinion, the \ntypical arguments of preservation of tradition and the need for time \nfor transition organization are less than compelling. Indeed, I believe \nthat these justifications pale in comparison to the drawbacks of the \ncurrent state of affairs.\n  First and foremost, currently when a new President is elected, during \nthe protracted transition period to a new administration that follows, \nit is unclear for almost 3 months who speaks for the United States on \nmatters of national importance or crisis. As the undisputed leader in \nworld affairs, and in a world ever more closely intertwined and \ninfluenced by daily events occurring throughout the international \ncommunity, this is a needless peril into which we place ourselves. It \nis never wise not desirable for any country, particularly one with \nextensive power and influence such as ours, to tolerate any confusion \nor question about who runs and speaks for the affairs of State. Yet, \nwhenever we elect a new President, we needlessly allow just such a \nsituation to occur. We would substantially reduce the potential hazards \nof the current lengthy delay in the transition of our Government were \nthis proposal adopted.\n  Another pitfall of the current lengthy interregnum is that under the \npresent system, the next fiscal year's proposed budget is submitted by \nthe outgoing administration only to be subject to amendment and \nrevision once the new administration takes office. This is a needless \nduplication of effort and inevitably results in an unnecessary delay of \nthe budget process. Indeed, given the record of the current Congress \nwith regard to the Federal budget, it is clear that any additional time \nor lack of either redundant or pointless effort would be welcome. If \nthe new Congress were to be sworn in on December 1 and the President on \nDecember 10, the new administration would start with a clean slate with \nregard to the budget and the process would be off to a much smoother \nand more sensible start.\n  Another clear benefit of an advance in the dates of inauguration for \nthe President and Members of Congress would be that with the recently \ncompleted campaign season more fresh in the memories of the new \nadministration and Congress, the opportunity would be greater to take \nquicker action on the proposals which collectively brought them to \noffice. The populace, having listened to an extensive campaign and \nspoken their minds through the ballot box, deserve to have the views \nthey supported formulated into legislation and acted upon in a \nreasonable and timely fashion. Waiting for 3 months to even begin the \nprocess seems to me to be simply too long.\n  Other reasons for advancing the Inauguration of the President and \nCongress, while slightly more speculative, seem likely. For example, \nwith the advance, the President would prudently be inclined to have a \ngood idea of who he or she would choose for key positions in the \nCabinet prior to the election. Indeed, the composition of the Cabinet \ncould well become part of the preelection debate, something which I \nfeel would be healthy given the enormous influence Cabinet members have \nover the day-to-day functions of the executive branch.\n  Another potential benefit would be that given the much shorter period \nbetween Election Day and the commencement of the terms of the new \nCongress, the incentive or need to hold so-called lameduck sessions of \nCongress would be greatly reduced. This would produce the desirable \nresult of discouraging the opportunity for Members who had lost at the \npolls to still meet, vote, and decide upon matters on behalf of the \nconstituents who just turned them out. Again, in a democracy, it is the \nwill of the people that should be afforded the greatest chance of being \nheard and reducing the likelihood of a lame-duck session of Congress \nwould forward that goal.\n\n  For all of these reasons, I again propose the constitutional \namendment. For those unfamiliar with my earlier efforts to advance the \nInauguration dates, a couple of points. First, there is\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\nnothing magical about the dates of December 10th for the President and \nDecember 1st for Members of Congress. Indeed, when I first pursued this \neffort, I proposed earlier dates ranging from early to mid-November. \nHowever, at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1984, \nthere was a general feeling that perhaps that left too little time \nafter the election for an orderly transition. Likewise, there was \nresistance to interference with the Thanksgiving holiday so early \nDecember presents itself as the earliest reasonable and desirable \ntimeframe for setting these Inauguration dates. Incidentally, for those \nwho wish to cling to tradition, establishing a swearing-in date of \nDecember 1st for Congress would be somewhat of a return to previous \npractice. The Constitution originally established the meeting day for \nCongress on the first Monday of December and this was the practice \nuntil the 20th amendment changed it in 1933. Thus, it was not until \n1934 that Congress began its sessions in early January. Under my \nproposal, Congress would resume the commencement of its sessions in \nearly December.\n  Thus, I offer my joint resolution to advance the Presidential and \ncongressional Inauguration dates. This proposal is good government, it \nmakes common sense, and is both feasible and practical. Furthermore, I \nbelieve that failing to change the dates needlessly risks confusion \nover who speaks for the national government, facilitates undesirable \nlegislative scenarios such as the convening of lame-duck sessions of \nCongress, and unnecessarily delays the chance for those chosen by the \nelectorate to take their rightful offices and act upon the issues of \nthe day. I urge my colleagues to take the time to carefully consider \nthis proposal and that they join me in this effort to make these \nstraightforward and eminently reasonable changes in our governmental \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at this point a brief \nhistory of the 20th amendment as prepared for the Judiciary Committee \nin 1985 be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Amendments to the Constitution: A Brief Legislative History\n\n\n                              amendment xx\n\n                           Text of amendment\n\n       ``Section 1.

Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th \n     day of October following the ratification of this article.\n       ``Sec. 6. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall \n     have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the \n     legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within \n     seven years from the date of its submission.''\n\n                               Background\n\n       In accordance with the constitutional provisions written by \n     the Founding Fathers in 1787, the newly established U.S. \n     Government was to become effective when nine States ratified \n     the Constitution.\\1\\ After the ratification process was \n     completed in June of 1788, the existing Congress designated \n     March 4, 1789 as the official date when the Federal \n     Government, as outlined in the Constitution, would begin \n     operation. This date represented an estimate of the time \n     needed to appoint presidential electors in each State and \n     allow them to cast their ballots for President. In addition, \n     the States needed time to select both Representatives and \n     Senators to serve in the U.S. Congress. As mandated by the \n     Constitution, the President was to serve for 4 years, \n     Senators for 6, and Representatives for 2. All legislative \n     and executive offices, then and in the future, would commence \n     on March 4 and end in subsequent odd-numbered years on the \n     same date.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The problem inherent in this system was that the \n     Constitution, under Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, \n     stipulated:\n       ``The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, \n     and such a meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, \n     unless they shall by Law appoint a different day.''\n       This meant that, although Congressmen were elected to \n     office in November of even-numbered years, they were not \n     entitled to take office until after the terms of their \n     predecessors expired the following March. Moreover, the new \n     Congressmen would not assemble until the following December. \n     This left a thirteen month lapse from the time of election \n     until the new Congress first convened. In the meantime, \n     defeated or retiring Congressmen would meet in their regular \n     session in December of the election year and continue to hold \n     office until their term expired on March 4 of the next year. \n     This short session of Congress, from December to March, was \n     nicknamed the ``lame-duck'' session, deriving its title from \n     the stock exchange term meaning ``one who was unable to meet \n     his obligations.'' \\2\\\n       The ``lame-duck'' session of Congress was controversial for \n     a number of reasons. For instance, if the election of the \n     President were thrown into the House of Representatives, the \n     election would be decided not by recently elected \n     Congressmen, but by the ``lame-duck'' session. In addition, \n     should a session of Congress require more time to conduct its \n     business, the session could not be extended, since the terms \n     of many legislators expired on March 4. The pending business \n     would either have to be postponed until the following \n     December, or a special session of the new Congress would have \n     to be called. Consequently, the ``lame-duck'' session \n     provided parliamentary advantages for the majority party in \n     Congress. This is why constitutional amendments to eliminate \n     the ``lame-duck'' session continually faced opposition in \n     Congress.\n       Objections to the ``lame-duck'' session were heard long \n     before proposals leading to the Twentieth Amendment were \n     introduced. On the opening day of Congress' first ``lame-\n     duck'' session in March of 1795, Aaron Burr laid before the \n     Senate a motion introducing a constitutional amendment \n     extending the terms of Congressmen until the first day of \n     June.\\3\\ Again in 1840, Millard Fillmore introduced an \n     amendment that called for the elimination of the ``lame-\n     duck'' session. Fillmore's resolution provided for the terms \n     of Congressmen to begin on the first day of December, rather \n     than fourth day of March.\\4\\ Several other amendments to the \n     Constitution, which would have altered the terms of office \n     and dates of congressional sessions, were introduced during \n     the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Each of them was \n     defeated.\\5\\\n       In 1923, the first of several resolutions introduced by \n     Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska to eliminate the ``lame-\n     duck'' session was reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture and Forestry.\\6\\ The measure, S.J. Res. 253, \n     easily passed the Senate on February 13, 63 to 6, 27 not \n     voting.\\7\\ However, as would be the case with several of \n     Norris' resolutions, the House of Representatives defeated \n     the proposal by delaying further action until Congress \n     adjourned in March. The same thing happened in 1924 with S.J. \n     Res. 22 (68th Cong.), and again in 1926 with S.J. Res. 9 \n     (69th Cong.). In 1928, S.J. Res. 47 (70th Cong.) finally made \n     it to a vote in the House, where it gained a majority but \n     failed to receive the necessary two-thirds vote, 209 to 157, \n     66 not voting and 2 answering ``present.'' \\8\\\n       On June 8, 1929, another Norris amendment proposal, S.J. \n     Res. 3 (71st Cong.), passed in the Senate and was sent to the \n     House. Once in the House, the Resolution lay on the Speaker's \n     table until April 17, 1930, when it was finally referred \n     to a House committee. In the meantime, a similar House \n     Resolution, H.J. Res. 292 (7st Cong.), was introduced. \n     This proposal, as amended by Speaker of the House Nicholas \n     Longworth of Ohio, would have required the second session \n     of Congress, which convened in January, to adjourn by May \n     4 of even-numbered years.\\9\\ H.J. Res. 292 passed easily \n     in the House, 290 to 93, 47 not voting and 1 answering \n     ``present.'' \\10\\ In conference, representatives from the \n     House and the Senate failed to agree on a compromise \n     measure. As a result, hopes for an amendment to the \n     Constitution once again expired with the adjournment of \n     the 71st Congress.\\11\\\n\n                          Legislative history\n\n       The elections of 1930 resulted in a Democratic landslide in \n     the House. Unlike Longworth, the new Speaker, John N. Garner \n     of Texas, came out in active support of an amendment to \n     remedy the ``lame-duck'' problem. On January 6, 1932, the \n     sixth Norris Amendment, S.J. Res. 14 (72nd Cong.), was \n     reported in the Senate by the Committee on the Judiciary. \n     During floor consideration in the Senate on January 6, one \n     amendment to\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\n     limit the second session of Congress was rejected before the \n     Resolution passed, 63 to 7, 25 not voting.\\12\\\n       In the House, the Committee on Election of the President, \n     Vice President, and Representatives in Congress reported S.J. \n     Res. 14 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute \n     measure.\\13\\ Among numerous suggested alterations, the \n     substitute proposed ending presidential terms on January 24 \n     and congressional terms on January 4, providing for \n     succession in the event of the death or lack of qualification \n     of the President-elect or Vice President-elect, making \n     provision in case of the death of candidates from which \n     Congress might have to choose a President or Vice President, \n     and setting an effective date for the first two sections of \n     the amendment.\n       The House began consideration of S.J. Res. 14 under an open \n     rule on February 12, 1932.\\14\\ On February 13, numerous \n     amendments to the committee substitute were offered, all of \n     which were either rejected or withdrawn. The two amendments \n     withdrawn by their sponsors would have required ratification \n     of the amendment within 7 years of its submission to the \n     States and provided that Congress could, by concurrent \n     resolution, set an assembly date other than January 4.\\15\\ \n     The rejected amendments called for ratification of the \n     Twentieth Amendment by State conventions, extension of \n     Representatives' terms to 4 years, and limitation of the \n     second session of Congress.\n       After the House debate concluded, the Election Committee's \n     substitute was approved and recommitted to the committee, \n     with instructions to report it back with a new section \n     establishing a mandatory 7-year ratification period.\\16\\ Once \n     the Resolution was amended accordingly and again reported by \n     the Committee on Election, it passed the House 204 to 134, 43 \n     not voting.\\17\\ Minor differences between the House and \n     Senate versions were quickly resolved in conference.\\18\\\n\n                          Ratification history\n\n       The Twentieth Amendment was sent to the States for \n     ratification in March of 1932; and within 1 year, all 48 \n     States had ratified. Virginia was the first State to ratify, \n     on March 4, 1932; and on January 23, 1933, Utah became the \n     required 36th State to approve the Amendment.

Section 5 of the Amendment provided that \n     Section 1 and 2 would become effective on October 15, 1933; \n     therefore, the terms of newly-elected Senators and \n     Representaties began on January 3, 1934, and the terms of the \n     President and Vice President began on January 20, 1937.\\19\\\n       The Twentieth Amendment appears officially as 47 Stat. \n     2569.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ United States Constitution, Article VII.\n     \\2\\ Carl Brent Swisher, American Constitutional Development \n     (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Co., 1943), 723.\n     \\3\\ Annals of the Congress of the United States, 1795 \n     (Washington, D.C.: Gales & Seaton, 1849), 5: 853.\n     \\4\\ Congressional Globe, 26th Congress, 2nd Session, 1840, 9: \n     44.\n     \\5\\ Congressional Record, 70th Congress, 2nd Session, 1928-\n     1929, 70; 1-8; H.

Con. Res. 58\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Resolution may be cited as the ``Telephone Number \n     Ownership Resolution of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) under existing law, the Federal Communications \n     Commission is the administrator, not the owner, of telephone \n     numbers, and has no authority to auction, or impose user fees \n     for, any number within the North American Numbering Plan, nor \n     does any other Federal agency;\n       (2) auctions of toll-free numbers will increase consumer \n     fraud and confusion by allowing competitors to profit from \n     the established reputation associated with existing toll-free \n     numbers;\n       (3) there are a total of 21 countries in the North American \n     Numbering Plan, including\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\n     the United States of America, Canada, and most Caribbean \n     countries, and decisions affecting universally available \n     toll-free numbers should not be made without a consensus \n     among the participating nations;\n       (4) the value of a toll-free telephone number is derived \n     solely from the efforts of the holder to create value in it; \n     and\n       (5) the right of first refusal for companies with toll-free \n     numbers that have become a unique brand identity will ensure \n     that customers reach their intended service provider.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, President Clinton recently issued \nan executive order restricting welfare benefits to teenage parents. I \ncommend the President for taking this action to change welfare as we \nknow it. His work demonstrates his strong commitment to welfare reform. \nWe in Congress should build on his action by quickly passing a tough \nbipartisan welfare reform plan.\n  There is no doubt about the dramatic increase in births to unmarried \nteens. It is clear that we must take aggressive and immediate action to \naddress this serious problem.\n  The Clinton administration would change welfare policy to keep teen \nparents in school, require teen parents to sign personal responsibility \ncontracts and require minor mothers to live at home. While this \nexecutive order is not the comprehensive overhaul of the welfare system \nthat I feel is needed, it addresses a critical concern--the increase of \nbirths to unmarried teenagers. It is a good place to start.\n  Just last month, the Iowa welfare reform waiver was modified to \ninstitute similar changes. In the future, minor parents in Iowa will be \nrequired to stay in school and earn a high school diploma or GED and to \nlive with their parents or another responsible adult. These changes \nwill help build a welfare system that requires responsibility, \nstrengthens families, and promotes independence by making families \nself-sufficient.\n  Without at least a high school education, welfare parents are unable \nto get decent jobs that will make the family self-sufficient. \nTherefore, too many young families are consigned to years of welfare \ndependency because the parents do not possess the basic skills \nnecessary to get and keep a job. By requiring minor parents to stay in \nschool to earn a diploma or GED, we begin to break this devastating \ncycle of dependency.\n  Further, too many minor parents go out and establish separate \nhouseholds when a child is born. Unfortunately many of these young \nparents are still children themselves and do not possess the skills to \nproperly raise their children. By requiring these minors to remain with \ntheir own parents or live with another responsible adult, the young \nfamily will be in a more secure environment which will produce a stable \nfamily rather than a welfare dependent family for years to come.\n  Since January 1994, all Iowa welfare recipients, not just teen \nparents, have been required to sign family investment agreements which \noutline the steps the family will take to move off of welfare and a \ndate at which time welfare benefits would end. The Clinton personal \nresponsibility contract requirement is modeled on the family investment \nagreement which is working very well in Iowa.\n  Mr. President, as I have discussed many times before, Iowa instituted \na statewide reform of the welfare system in October 1993. Since then, \nmore families are working and earning income, the number of families on \nwelfare has been declining and the amount of money spent on cash grant \nis down. In short, welfare reform is working in Iowa. In 1993 and 1995, \nSenator Bond and I introduced a common sense bipartisan reform plan \nbased on the good work being done in Iowa and in Missouri on reforming \nwelfare.\n\n  Mr. President, in February, the National Governors Association \nannounced a bipartisan agreement on welfare reform. At that time, I \nviewed the proposal as the vehicle to jump-start the congressional \ndebate on welfare reform and restore bipartisanship to the process. \nThis does not seem to be happening and I am very frustrated by that \nreality.\n  There is no doubt that the current welfare system is badly broken and \nin desperate need of repair. Further, there is no question that there \nis strong, bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for welfare reform \nlegislation. I still hold out hope that we can and will enact \nbipartisan welfare reform legislation during the remaining days of the \n104th Congress.\n  The current dependency inducing welfare system must be replaced with \none that promotes independence and self-sufficiency. One that sends the \nclear message to families on welfare that if you can work, you must \nwork. One that requires every family to take responsibility, from day \none on welfare, to begin the journey off of welfare and into self-\nsufficient employment.\n  There is overwhelming support in the Senate for this kind of \ncommonsense welfare reform. This support was demonstrated last fall \nwhen 87 Senators voted for a bipartisan bill to reform welfare.\n  Mr. President, the American people desperately want us to address the \nmajor problems facing our country and stop the political game playing.\n  We should take the Senate passed plan backup, amend it to adhere to \nsome of the key recommendations of the National Governors Association \nsuch as increased funding for child care, and pass it. We clearly have \nan overwhelming bipartisan majority to do that. That's the clearest way \nto get comprehensive welfare reform signed into law this year.\n  Leaders in the House of Representatives have spoken in favor of \ntaking up the Senate bill. The President has said he could support the \nSenate bill and has said good things about the NGA plan. So it is very \nclear that there is a path available to us to enact welfare reform. We \nshould take it, and quickly.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned, however, that some seem to want \nto take a different course--one that is clearly destined to result in \nmore gridlock, political fingerpointing and no welfare reform. The \nbudget resolution passed out of the Budget Committee ties welfare \nreform to a poison pill--elimination of guarantees for elderly people \nin nursing homes to continued coverage of their care through Medicaid. \nBy block granting and severely cutting Medicaid, health care for \npregnant women and children would also be placed on the chopping block. \nAnd the President has rightly said that this is wrong and would force \nhim to veto a bill that contained it.\n  In an effort to clear the path for enactment of welfare reform, I \nwill be offering an amendment to the budget resolution that would take \nout the poison pill. My amendment will require consideration of welfare \nreform separate from ending guaranteed coverage for health care to \nmillions of elderly and other Americans. This is the only hope for \nwelfare reform this year. So I hope that all of my colleagues who share \nmy support for comprehensive welfare reform will join me in support of \nthis amendment.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on this and other \nimportant issues during the remainder of this session and ask that a \nsummary of the executive order be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n                   Executive Action on Welfare Reform\n\n  Today, President Clinton announced four measures to make \nresponsibility the law of the land, by ensuring that teen mothers on \nwelfare stay in school and live at home. These four executive actions \ninclude requiring all States to submit plans for requiring teen mothers \nto stay in school and prepare for employment; cutting through redtape \nto allow States to pay cash bonuses to teen mothers who finish high \nschool;\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nrequiring all States to have teen mothers who have dropped out of \nschool return to school and sign personal responsibility plans; and \nchallenging all States to require minor mothers to live with a \nresponsible adult. With these actions, we're focusing on one of the key \ncomponents of welfare reform: parental responsibility. And we're \nputting young mothers on the right path, toward employment and self-\nsufficiency.\n\n\n                requiring teen mothers to stay in school\n\n  Currently, 26 States require teen parents to stay in school to \nreceive assistance, 23 under waivers approved by the Clinton \nadministration. Ohio, for example, has a model program called LEAP: \nLearning, Earning, and Parenting. LEAP reduces checks of teen mothers \nwhen they don't go to school, and pays them a bonus when they do. Other \nStates are trying similar approaches with our support. For example, \nDelaware reduces benefits for truancy, and pays teen mothers a $50 \nbonus when they graduate from high school. Colorado pays bonuses when \nteen mothers graduate from high school or receive a GED.\n  These States are putting teen mothers on the right path, toward \nemployment and self-sufficiency--and all 50 States around the country \nshould follow their lead. That's why the President is directing all \nStates to submit plans to require school attendance among teens who \nreceive welfare. And to be sure they do, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services will do annual surveys of their success.\n\n\n    allowing states to reward teen mothers who complete high school\n\n  Today, President Clinton is also cutting through redtape to allow \nStates to reward teen mothers who stay in school and complete high \nschool, in addition to sanctioning those who don't. States would be \nable to give teen mothers cash bonuses for strong school attendance, \ngraduating from high school, or GED receipt--without requesting a \nwaiver.\n\n\n      requiring teen mothers to sign personal responsibility plans\n\n  Today, the Clinton administration is requiring all 50 States to \nensure that teen mothers on welfare who have dropped out of school both \nreturn to school and sign personal responsibility plans. These actions \nwill help teen mothers plan for their futures and turn their lives \naround.\n\n\n                requiring minor mothers to live at home\n\n  Under current law, States have the option to require minor mothers to \nlive at home--but only 21 States have such requirements, 11 initiated \nunder waivers granted by the Clinton administration and 10 adopted \nunder the State option. Today, the Clinton administration is \nchallenging all 50 States to put minor mothers on the right track by \nrequiring them to live at home or with a responsible adult in order to \nreceive assistance.\n\n\n                      ending welfare as we know it\n\n  The President's goals for welfare reform are clear: requiring work, \npromoting responsibility, and protecting children. With this new \ninitiative, President Clinton underscores his commitment to helping \nwelfare recipients become--and stay--self-sufficient. President Clinton \ncontinues to call for a national welfare reform bill that gets these \npriorities right. Under welfare reform waivers, we've already freed 37 \nStates from redtape to pursue innovative welfare reforms--more than \nunder any previous administration. State welfare demonstrations \napproved by the Clinton administration now cover 75 percent of all \nwelfare recipients nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5101-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING MARY WHITE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mrs. White is retiring this \nmonth after years of service to both her State and her country, by \nworking for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Mrs. White spent 21 years in public service. Her work for INS over \nthe past 6 years has been exemplary, and has set a very high standard \nfor her peers.

May she enjoy \nthis new stage in her life, and be ever mindful of the respect and \nesteem we hold her in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5102-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE ODELSON FAMILY\n\n Mr. SIMON. The late Sam and Rose Odelson of Chicago had 13 \nchildren, 8 of whom served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War \nII.\n  Four served in Europe, three in the Pacific, and one in the States. \nTwo were injured in combat, and altogether, they earned 20 battle \nstars. Oscar served in the U.S. Army in Italy. Sidney, an Army veteran \nwho landed at Omaha Beach served in France and Germany. Joe was also in \nthe Army, serving near the tail end of the war in southern France. \nIrving was one of the first sent overseas, serving in the South \nPacific. Julius was 89th Airborne, Roy was in the Army Air Corps, Ben \nserved with the 13th Air Force in the South Pacific for over 2 years, \nand Mike was an MP in the Philippines.\n  All the eight Odelson boys returned home after the war. A few stayed \nin Chicago, the others moved out to sunny California to work in the \ninsurance, furniture, or restaurant business.\n  With the recent commemoration of the 50th anniversary of World War \nII, it is fitting to recognize the achievements of this family. I \nsalute these brothers and their family for their selfless commitment to \nour country. Every year the Odelsons gather out West in Nevada for a \nreunion. I am sure that they, as do we, will celebrate their \ncontribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5102-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5102-S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GEN. CALVIN A.H. WALLER\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today a grateful nation paid tribute \nto one of its true patriots and finest soldiers, Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. \nWaller, U.S. Army (Retired), who died last Thursday. I was privileged \nto be at the Fort Myer Chapel today for General Waller's memorial \nservice, conducted by Chaplain (Major General) Donald W. Shea, with \nChaplain (Colonel) John Kaising. The homily was presented by Chaplain \nShea, and eulogy were offered by General Waller's son, Mark, and \nGeneral Waller's friend Lt. Gen. Julius W. Becton, Jr., U.S. Army \n(Retired). General Waller was then interred in Arlington National \nCemetary. It was a very moving and inspirational service.\n  Born in Louisiana, General Waller was a product of the Army Reserve \nOfficer Training Corps [ROTC] program at Prairie View A University in \nPrairie View, TX. It is approximately 45 miles from the place General \nWaller called home--Houston. His dad was also a Prairie View graduate, \nand General Waller attended college to study veterinary medicine, \nentering in 1955. Because Prairie View was a land grant college--part \nof the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College system--the first 2 \nyears of ROTC were mandatory. In 1957, young Cal Waller signed up for \nSenior ROTC status. As his friend and fellow Prairie View classmate, \nretired Lt. Gen. Marvin Brialsford, says, ``Being a senior cadet at A \nhad a certain attractiveness to it; it was prestigious, and we all \ncould put the $27.90 a month we were paid as senior cadets to good \nuse.'' A life in the Army, however, was far from his mind.\n  After being commissioned into the chemical corps and detailed into \nthe infantry, then-Lieutenant Waller attended the basic infantry \nofficer's course at Fort Benning, and then served in the 8th Infantry \nRegiment at Fort Lewis, WA. Before his initial tour of duty was over, \nLieutenant Waller had decided that the Army had the potential for a \ncareer, or, as Secretary of the Army Togo West puts it, ``Fortunately \nfor us, he took a liking to the Army.''\n  To better utilize his love of science, Cal Waller returned to the \nchemical corps, serving at Fort McCellan, AL; he went on to serve in \nthe Eighth Army in the Republic of Korea; and in the 82d Airborne \nDivision at Fort Bragg, NC. It was in the 82d Airborne, the All \nAmerican division, that the Army realized what a natural leader and \nexceptional planner he was. Cal was one of the youngest officers in \nArmy history to be selected for the Army's Command and General Staff \nCollege at Fort Leavenworth, KS, and upon graduation was immediately \nassigned to the staff of\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nthe U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam.\n  After a tour in Washington, then-Major Waller began his career as an \narmor officer--a tanker in Army jargon. He attempted to stay assigned \nwith soldiers and combat-ready units and served in the Federal Republic \nof Germany, Fort Carson, CO, Fort Stewart, GA, and Fort Bragg, NC. In \nthose assignments, his natural leadership abilities blossomed. A former \nArmy Chief of Staff Gordon Sullivan noted, ``Cal Waller loved soldiers. \nHe had a natural touch with soldiers, and soldiers loved him. I believe \nthere are some men who have the ability, by their very presence, to \ncalm the waters in crisis situations. Cal Waller was such a man.''\n  In 1987, it was time to return to the Federal Republic of Germany and \ncommand of the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized). It was there that I \nfirst met Cal Waller. I traveled with my staff director from the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Arnold Punaro, and then-Colonel Frank Norton \nof the Army Senate Liaison, who I am now fortunate to have on my staff. \nWe visited General Waller in Baumholder. After visiting soldiers and \nobserving training on the multiple launch rocket system, we then had \nlunch together with some local German supporters of the U.S. Army. It \nwas obvious they held Cal Waller in high esteem. For my part, I was \ngreatly impressed with Cal Waller's professionalism and confidence, his \ntechnical acumen, his caring attitude for his soldiers and their \nfamilies, and his wonderful, self-depreciating sense of humor. We \ndeveloped a friendship, and I was grateful that our paths crossed on a \nnumber of occasions during his career and each time I was with Cal, I \nlearned from him.\n\n  After his most successful tenure as Commander of the 8th Infantry \nDivision, General Waller returned to Fort Lewis as the Commanding \nGeneral of I Corps. He continued to be assigned to I Corps while \ndeployed from Fort Lewis to serve as Deputy commander in Chief of the \nU.S. Central Command, with General Norm Schwarzkopf, for Operations \nDesert Shield/Desert Storm. General Schwarzkopf writes of his \nrelationship with General Waller in his autobiography ``It Doesn't Take \na Hero.'' He says (pg. 392):\n\n       In mid-November Lieutenant General Cal Waller had reported \n     to Riyadh as my deputy commander in chief: now I had someone \n     to help me ride herd. Cal was a friend who had worked for me \n     in two previous commands. Shrewd, soft-spoken, and given to \n     quoting sayings he'd learned from his grandmother in \n     Louisiana, he was also tough and effective. He'd been my \n     first choice for the job: he'd come up through the Army as an \n     armor officer and understood logistics; also I knew I didn't \n     intimidate him at all. We trusted each other to such an \n     extent that he could walk into my office and say point-blank, \n     ``Hey, something's all screwed up, it's your fault, and you \n     need to know about it.''\n\n  After the success of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, General \nWaller returned to command I Corps, Washington, and began making plans \nto retire. His Army service spanned 32 years; he had gone from a \nplatoon leader commanding 40 soldiers to commanding general of I Corps \nand Fort Lewis, where he was responsible for over 100,000 personnel.\n  After retiring in 1991, General Waller returned to his love of \nscience and was active in environment restoration efforts for a number \nof companies. I last saw Cal in August 1995 at a conference in Aspen, \nCO. He drove down from Arvada, CO near Denver, where he made his home. \nHe was, as always, in a great mood and enjoying life. We played a round \nof golf, and had the opportunity for a lengthy visit. He noted how he \nwas both enjoying and contributing in his second life.\n  But he never really left the Army, and the Army never left him. As \nArmy Chief of Staff Denny Reimer notes, ``The performance of our \nsoldiers throughout the world * * * have their roots in (his) concerned \nleadership--making sure soldiers were properly trained for the task at \nhand and ensuring their families were well-cared for while they were \ngone. He was a patriotic American, a consummate soldier and a wonderful \nhuman being.''\n  His friend and fellow soldier, Gen. Colin Powell says, ``His ability \nto touch the lives of so many in such meaningful ways was legendary. We \nwill miss him greatly.'' I certainly agree.\n  Mrs. Waller and her sons Michael and Mark know better than any of us \nthe great loss our Nation has experienced. They bear their grief with \ndignity and courage--I know that Cal Waller is proud of them.\n  His unselfish service to the Army and our Nation is a testament to \nCal Waller's sense of duty and honor. Our military forces have been \nstrengthened by his contribution, and America has been enriched by his \nmany accomplishments. I can offer no farewell to Cal Waller better than \nthat extended by his son mark in his eulogy: ``Ride swiftly, great \nBuffalo soldier.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5102-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 16, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, apparently at this point in the order \nof the day, it is appropriate to make some remarks about a very special \nman who\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nhas made a very dramatic announcement today. Let me just say that I \nspeak from perhaps a little special vantage point because I served as \nthe assistant leader to Bob Dole for 10 years. Those were 10 of the \nfinest years I have spent in public life, and I have had some very \nexciting times, and some less exciting times, in public life. But the \n10 years serving as first lieutenant to Bob Dole as he served as our \ncaptain were tremendously satisfying and gratifying years for me.\n  Let me just say that the decision he has made today is one that is \ntypical of Bob Dole in that he thought that thing through for a long \ntime. He talked with people he respects and admires and cares for, and \nhe came up with a decision which is going to be very good for him and \nvery good for the United States of America because the greatest part of \nit will be that he will be out in the land and the people of America \nwill see him and the people of America will see Liddy Dole at his side. \nBob Dole and Liddy Dole will be deeply impressive to the American \npeople.\n  The greatest pleasure I have is knowing that they will get to know \nhim in the same way that we here know him, in the same way that I know \nhim as an extraordinarily deep, complex, competitive, compassionate, \ncomplete man, a steady man of great, great sensitivity. I have seen all \nthose attributes. Many of us who have worked with him have.\n  So it is going to be a wonderful thing to see him go forward from \nthis place where we will no longer have the usual stuff. We would pull \nthe same tricks if we would have had the same lay of the land. It is no \nreflection upon the fine leadership of the minority, Senator Daschle. I \nwish to compliment him in a very class act in being there at the press \nconference today, along with Senator Bradley, along with Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska, along with Senator Harkin and Senator Wellstone. Those \nwere acts of political grace. We do that with ourselves and among \nourselves.\n  You have to remember that when we do this act, and we do some of \nthat--a little bit of theater--as I say, we would have been doing some \nof that had the tables been reversed, but finally it does get to be \nrather an exhausting process. It is like getting pecked to death by \nducks and you want to get away from it as fast as you can. He has, and \nhe is smart to do it, and now the show can start.\n  For me, it has a western vernacular. It is like taking the hood off \nof a hunting falcon and now the prey is being observed and the prey is \nright there at the end of 1600 Pennsylvania. That is a pretty dramatic \nreference, but it is like an eagle with the tether off. It is like a \nrace horse without the leg irons, and that is Bob Dole. Boy, I tell \nyou, he is going to run quite a race, and the people of America are \ngoing to be very proud and very, very impressed by Bob and Liddy Dole \nas they leave this particular arena and go out into the land, not as \nthe Senator from Kansas or the majority leader of the Senate but as an \nAmerican citizen from Kansas, who, as he said so very beautifully, is \neither headed for the White House or home. I intend to invest a great \ndeal of my efforts in seeing that he gets to the former location rather \nthan the latter.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I, too, rise to join in expressing my \ngreat respect and admiration for our majority leader, Bob Dole. We all \nknow here in this institution of his great leadership. We know that he \nalready holds the record of being the leader of the Republican Party \nlonger than any other man in the history of the Senate. We know he has \nbeen in the Congress some 35 years, I believe, and that he has been \nelected six times to be the leader of the Republican team, having \nalready served 11 years in that very critical position.\n  But there is a lot more to Bob Dole and his career than those \nrecords. His is a remarkable career that will go down in history, I \nthink, as one of the ones who will be remembered and pointed to as \nexemplary as a Senator and a leader who really loved the institution \nand did the job magnificently.\n  There are some words that come to mind when I think about what I have \nobserved in Bob Dole serving these past 16 months as his whip, and I \nhave come to really appreciate the tremendous insight and leadership \nthat he does have. So leadership clearly is one word that Bob Dole has \nexhibited over all these years. He has never shied away from the tough \nissues, whether it was bipartisan efforts to save Social Security, to \ntax reform, to critical foreign policy responsibilities our Nation has \nhad to face. Many times he stepped up and endorsed a position which \nmight not necessarily have been the popular position in the country or \nhere in the institution with his own colleagues, but he did what he \nthought was right and the responsible thing to do for our country, \nparticularly in foreign policy.\n  Bob Dole is clearly recognized on both sides of the aisle as a man of \nhis word and a man of fairness. When Bob Dole tells you you can count \non something, whether it is in the Finance Committee or between \nleadership, you do not have to worry about it. He will stick to his \nword. Fairness is a cornerstone that I have seen.\n  Certainly we all know of his courage, both on the battlefields in \nEurope and the rough and tumble of American politics. Bob Dole has \nfought the good fights. He has been a local elected official. He was in \nCongress. He was head of the Republican National Committee.\n  As a young Senator he was the patrolman back in the back of this \nChamber who was willing to get involved in the fights that sometimes it \ntakes a young Senator to wade into. Then he has had these distinguished \nleadership positions as minority leader, as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and now as majority leader. But always he exhibited the will \nto fight and he showed the courage to get the job done.\n  Knowledge is a word that comes to my mind with Bob Dole. I have been \nabsolutely amazed at the awareness and the knowledge he has of the \nintricacies of this institution. They are not easy to understand and \nvery difficult to master, but he has a sixth sense of how this body \nworks, has worked, and, maybe even more important, should work. So I \nthink his knowledge of this institution, his great reservoir of memory \nand experience, will be something we truly will miss.\n  And humor: Those across the country who do not see Bob as we see him \nevery day may not be so familiar with that Kansas wit that he has, that \ncrack, that moment when he says something that breaks the tension. He \nhas a unique sense of humor and it has been greatly, mightily employed \nto help this place work over the years.\n  Now he has made another tough and courageous decision, to leave the \nlife of public service that he has known so well and loved so much here \nin the Senate. As our Republican nominee, he has decided to leave the \nSenate and focus all of his time and attention on the quest for the \nPresidency, and that is as it should be. Up and out--he has taken the \nultimate political risk. He has given up his Senate seat and his \nposition of leadership to energize his efforts and to focus his \nattention on the needs of our Nation. It is an act of principle. He has \nmade a personal sacrifice that we all know means a great deal to Bob \nDole and tells us so much about the man.\n  Serving his country in wartime and peace, Bob Dole has sacrificed for \nAmerica. He has taken a bold action and, as he said today in his speech \nwhen he announced that he was making this move: With all due respect \nfor Congress, America has been my life.\n\n  I think that truly speaks well of what Bob Dole has done today. I do \nnot believe we have seen the last of Bob Dole in the Senate or in \nservice to our country. We will see and hear much more from him. And we \nall join in expressing our great love and appreciation for what he has \ndone for us individually, for this institution, for our party, and for \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from \nMississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my \ngood friend and State colleague, and the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming, in saying how sincerely and deeply we respect the decision \nthat Bob Dole has made and announced today, that he will resign his \nseat in the U.S. Senate to seek the Presidency of the United States.\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\n  I think this truly does signal the beginning of the race for the \nPresidency. Obviously, as majority leader of the Senate, Bob Dole has \nhad an enormous responsibility for the schedule of the Senate, for \ndoing all the things that are required of a leader in the Senate to do. \nHe has done them all with great skill and in a way that has reflected \nan enormous amount of credit on the U.S. Senate.\n  I am confident the decision to resign did not come easy to him. We \nhave all had an opportunity to be with him today in meetings, first a \nsmall group in the leadership, then in the Republican conference, and \nthen to hear his public statement that he made in the Hart Senate \nOffice Building. Throughout all of those conversations it became \nobvious to us what a difficult decision it had to be. But I think it \nalso shows the willingness of Bob Dole to do what he has been selected \nto do and that is to be a candidate for President of the United States. \nHis party has, in effect, nominated him as our candidate, and he has \nsaid, ``You have my full commitment. All of my energy, all of my \neffort, without distractions, no more ambushes here in the U.S. Senate \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle, or from wherever--all \nof my energies and my commitment will be directed to achieving success \nand winning the election campaign.'' And I predict that he is going to \nwin this election campaign.\n  We are going to miss him very much as our leader. He has been a true \nfriend to so many of us, and certainly to me, during the time that I \nhave had the honor of working with him here in the Senate, and even \nbefore.\n\n  I never will forget when he came to Mississippi as a new Member of \nthe Senate to defend those who were in charge of disaster benefits \nafter Hurricane Camille had struck our gulf coast in 1969. There were \nsome in the Senate who were prospective candidates for President who \nwere on the other side of the aisle who chaired the committees. They \ncame down to investigate how our State was disbursing disaster benefits \nand suggested, with a lot of national attention, that we were \ndiscriminating in our State against some of our citizens in that \nprocess. And it really was blatant posturing and trying to take \nadvantage of an emotional situation, to curry favor in the national \npolitical arena.\n  Bob Dole, young, new U.S. Senator, could see through that and he \ndefended our elected Governor and the other officials in Mississippi \nwho were working very hard to try to take care of a situation and deal \nwith an enormous disaster. Huge money damages had been lost, a lot of \npersonal suffering; lives had been lost. Bob Dole was willing to come \ndown and stand up for what would have been a politically incorrect \ncause, defending the State of Mississippi. I remember that, and all of \nMississippi remembers that. If they wonder why the numbers are like \nthey are in the Presidential polls right now, you look at our State. He \nis way out in front and he is going to stay way out in front.\n  But he has been a man of courage all of his life. We are familiar \nwith his war record and what he suffered in World War II as a young \nman, and it just makes your heart ache to think about what he has been \nthrough and what he has overcome, to do with his life what he has done \nwith his life and to really give it to the United States in public \nservice--not to privately enrich himself in any way. He said, I am not \na person where Congress is my life. America has been my life and it is \nmy life. And it truly is his life.\n  So it is with a great deal of respect and some heartfelt remorse, \ntoo, that he will be leaving the Senate, that I stand tonight to salute \nhim as a great American, a great Senator, a great statesman. We are all \nvery proud of Bob Dole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The distinguished \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I join these \ncomments about the majority leader. I have known Senator Dole for a \nlong time and I have known him as a man whose is unquestionably a \nleader.\n  There are people who have mannerisms that come from various \nexperiences in their lives. Whenever I think of Bob Dole, I think of a \ngreat many men I have known in my life who were tested in war. He not \nonly was tested but he was severely injured and really came back in a \nmiraculous way, through the support that he got from his own \ntownspeople in Kansas, through, really, the skill of a great surgeon in \nChicago. But he came back and decided that the country that had given \nhim that opportunity to recover from the effects of war was a country \nthat he owed something to, and he has committed his life, really, to \ntrying to make America a better place.\n  I really do not--it is not too often when I sort of puddle-up in \npublic. When I think about Bob Dole, I do, particularly after this \ndecision today. I remember being with Bob Dole when we met with people \nwho were disabled. Everyone knows that Bob was disabled coming out of \nthe war. But he has, because of his own experience in coming back, \ncommitted himself to help those, not only get a chance for recovery, \nbut help those who did not have the same miracle of recovery that he \nhad. And the disabilities laws we have now are laws that, as the \npreceding speaker said, future generations will look to. They will look \nto what we did during our watch here in the Senate and they are going \nto find a great many marks made by Senator Bob Dole, even beyond being \na leader.\n  The work that he did, along with others, in saving the Social \nSecurity System involving a bipartisan solution, although it is not \ntotally permanent, was historic. What Senator Dole did, working on the \nFinance Committee, and what that law did, in fact, preserved the Social \nSecurity system.\n  But Senator Dole goes beyond that, in my mind, because I see him with \nthe Secretary of Transportation, when she came to Alaska, standing on \nthe back of a railroad car, the type of railroad car that former \nPresidents have used, or Presidents or candidates have used, as they \nmade whistle-stop campaigns through the country. I hope Bob Dole does \nthat as a candidate.\n  Clearly, I saw the way that he met with our Alaska Native people, \nwith Alaskans, and the way he enjoyed the outdoors and really has been \nquite supportive of those of us who represent our State.\n  The Bob Dole I know is a man who you never have to ask him twice \nwhere he stands. You can take his word to the bank. And the decision he \nmade today literally brings tears to my eyes, because I know that he \nhas committed himself to service in the Congress and distinguished \nhimself here.\n  He has been willing to set that aside and to tell the country, as he \ndid, that he has two destinations after he leaves here on or before \nJune 11: either to the White House or back to Kansas. I think that took \ngreat courage and real determination and commitment, the kind of \ncommitment that other people may not understand, but we understand what \nit means to us.\n  I have been here when several people ran for the Presidency. They did \nnot resign. They left their seat vacant and missed vote after vote, and \nthere were decisions made here that should not have been reached if \nthey had been here. I was thinking back to President Kennedy and his \ncampaign. He was gone a long time. Lyndon Johnson was gone a long time. \nMany others had been out campaigning, and they had been gone and missed \nvotes.\n  This candidate, as leader, has not missed many votes. But now he has \ndecided he must commit his full time to his quest for the Presidency. \nHe has made a very courageous decision. I salute him. I will say other \nthings later after he does leave. Unfortunately, we sometimes wait too \nlong to say them. But I think that Bob Dole has a love for the Senate \nand the Senate has shown its love for him in responding to his \nleadership. We are going to miss that leadership, and I hope that those \nwho follow him understand the Senate the way Bob Dole does.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, by any standard, this has been the kind \nof day that takes your breath away, one of those days that you will \nalways remember.\n  Everyone on this side of the aisle had an opportunity earlier this \nafternoon\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nto sit down with the majority leader as he explained this momentous \ndecision. I looked around the room, and I do not think there was a dry \neye in the place. Not a one. Everyone sensed that this was a moment of \nhistorical significance, and, indeed, it is. We witnessed one of the \ngreat men of American history make a dramatic and important decision \nthat virtually everyone I know thinks was the right decision, to put \nthis magnificent congressional career behind him and to move on to the \nnext challenge.\n  My oldest daughter happened to have been in town today, and I said, \n``Your timing couldn't have been better. Come with me. I'm going to let \nyou experience something you will remember for the rest of your life.'' \nWe walked over to this crowded room, 902, that we were all sort of \nhuddled around in to listen to what one of the skeptical commentators, \nwho usually finds no good in politicians, uttered tonight on the \nevening news was the finest speech Bob Dole ever made.\n  So, Mr. President, we are here tonight to celebrate the end of a \nremarkable career and for many of us to look forward to the next \nchallenge, which is Bob Dole, unencumbered by past responsibility, \nstepping forward to present to the American people his plans for the \nnext 4 years.\n  I would be less than candid if I did not say this is probably the \nmost exhilarating moment that people on this side of the aisle have \nenjoyed in the last 3 months. It is no secret this has not exactly been \nthe height for the Republican national campaign the last few weeks. So \nit has provided an opportunity to take a second look at what this man \nwould do for America in the next 4 years.\n  So it is with a great deal of excitement, but also sadness, that we \nmark the movement of Bob Dole on to a new plateau.\n  When the history books are written about this institution and they \npick out the few Senators who really made a difference for America, \nthere is not a doubt that the Senator from Kansas will be near the top \nof the list. We wish him Godspeed in the challenges ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on December 5, 1992, President-elect \nWilliam Clinton resigned his position as Governor of Arkansas. On that \ndate, of course, he was assured of another job, after having remained \nas Governor through at least the full year in which he devoted very \nlittle time and attention to that governorship. On this day, May 15, \n1996, Senator Robert Dole announced his resignation not only as \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate, but as senior Senator from the \nState of Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I cannot think of any two facts taken in juxtaposition \nwhich illustrate better the respective characters of the two candidates \nfor President of the United States, any statement of fact that can \nbetter illustrate the different direction in which Robert Dole will \ntake the United States as President.\n  So, for him, while some have characterized his action as principled, \nothers as unprecedented, the word that comes most quickly to my mind is \nprinciples, the same kind of principles which have actuated his entire \nlife--his childhood, his military service, his recovery from a terribly \ndebilitating injury--and his entire political career.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, from a strictly campaign point of view, \nthis gives Senator Dole the opportunity full time to share his vision \nof the future of the United States and his ideas about the widest of \nour public policy questions with the people of the United States who \nmost unfortunately do not know him in the way in which you and I and \nour other colleagues here in this body know him. That, I believe, will \nbe an advantage to his campaign, a clear advantage to the people of the \nUnited States and a terrible loss to all of us who serve here in this \nbody.\n  We will miss his wisdom, his sound counsel, his never failing sense \nof humor more than any of us can possibly state on the floor of this \nbody here this evening. But we give him up to a greater cause, the \ncause of sharing these qualities of character and personality and of \npurpose with the American people. This is the contrast, the contrast in \ncharacter and the contrast in direction for America, that this day and \nthis action have so magnificently illustrated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in paying tribute to our \nleader and in just saying from our hearts how much we respect the \ndecision that he made, this bold and courageous decision, and how much \nwe will miss him.\n  As has been mentioned, there was not a dry eye in our caucus today \nwhen he made this announcement. He and Elizabeth and Robin came in, and \nit was just the Republican Senators, and they said, ``This is like \nfamily. It's like saying good-bye to family.'' But this is a man that \nAmerica is now going to be able to see, who is deeply rooted in this \ncountry, and who knows exactly what he wants to say to the American \npeople.\n  He made the decision by himself. But he could not speak on the Senate \nfloor, talking about amendments to amendments and quorum calls and \ncloture votes, and get across to the American people how very important \nhis goals and his mission and his vision for this country are.\n  He knew that he had to go out into America as an American, not as a \nSenator, and speak from the heart. He made that decision. As usual, he \nalways livens everything with his humor. He said to us today, ``I've \nbeen thinking about this for 2 months. I made the decision about 30 \ndays ago. The reason that it didn't get out, in a town that is known \nfor leaking, is because I didn't tell one U.S. Senator about it.'' Of \ncourse, we all laughed, because that was true.\n\n  He had kept his counsel. He had made this decision, as he so often \ndoes, by himself with his wife Elizabeth. He knew it was right. When we \nfirst started hearing about it today, many of us said, ``Oh, no; that \nmust be a mistake. He's going to step down from leadership, but not \nfrom his seat.'' Then the more we heard about it, we thought, ``Well, \nof course. That is Bob Dole's genius that he would see so far ahead of \nthe rest of us that, yes, indeed, he was going to give up his seat \nbecause he began to see that this election is a crossroads, and he must \nshow the American people who he is, what he stands for, and what \nintegrity and character he has.'' He knew that he could not do it \ntalking about amendments to amendments. He knew it had to come from the \nheartland and from the heart.\n  So every one of us are thrilled for him, thrilled that he has made \nthis decision because we know the mission is the highest of all. That \nis to make the changes in America that will give every child in this \ncountry the same benefits and opportunities that Bob Dole himself has \nhad by having the great good fortune to grow up in this country.\n  He grew up in Russell, KS, in a working family. He has known \nhardship. He has known tragedy. He has stood the test of extreme injury \nand pain, being told that he probably would not walk again, being told \nthat if he walked, it would be with a limp, knowing that he could \novercome this with the grit and determination that the great upbringing \nin the heartland of America would give him.\n  He has never forgotten that opportunity. As I go on the campaign \ntrail with him or as I walk down the hall with him, jaunty as he is, I \nalways see that Bob Dole knows his bearings. He has never had anything \neasy in his life. He has fought hard. He has stood the tests that have \nbeen thrown at him time after time.\n  He wants every American child to have the same opportunity that he \ndid. His mission is to make sure that they do. So we love him. We are \ngoing to miss him. But every one of us are going to be with him on the \ncampaign trail talking about the message that Americans want to hear: \nWhat are you going to do for our country? What he is going to do for \nour country is prepare for the future, to go into the 21st century \nwithout a deficit, saving Medicare, with welfare reform, making sure \nthat we take care of the truly needy but making sure that we look to \nthe future for our children and grandchildren.\n  That is what this man is going to do. He has put that ahead of his \nown career\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nand his own life, because he knows how important this is to the \nAmerican people. God's speed, our friend.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished President pro tempore.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today Senator Bob Dole announced that he \nwill be stepping down as a Member of the U.S. Senate. He has announced \nhis resignation. I have been in the Senate for 40 years. I have been \nhere with many leaders, majority and minority leaders. I can say that \nhe is one of the ablest and finest leaders that this country has ever \nhad serving in the Congress of the United States.\n  He is a man of principle. He stands for what is right. He felt it his \nduty, since he is going to run for President, to give his full \nattention to that campaign. He felt he could not do both, look after \nthe Senate's work and run for President, too.\n  Unlike some people who have attempted to do both, he will give up all \nof the power in the Senate. He, as the majority leader here, has served \nthe longest term, I believe, of any majority leader in history.\n  He has made a fine record. He will give all that up because he wants \nto do his duty and feels he could not run for President and also look \nafter his duties here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, he knows what responsibility means. He felt he could \nnot be responsible to run in the campaign and run the Senate, too. So \nwhat did he do? Since he is going to run for President, he decided to \nresign from the U.S. Senate. He is giving up all of his power, as \nprobably the most influential Member of the U.S. Senate, in his \nposition as majority leader, and as an able Senator giving it all up. \nHow many people would do that? Most people would hang on, say, ``Well, \nI can run for the Senate, I can run for the President, and stay in the \nSenate and still do my job.'' Not Bob Dole. He is not that kind of a \nman. He does not do things halfway. He puts his heart and soul into \nwhatever he does. That is the reason he resigned from the Senate.\n\n  Now, in my opinion, that shows character. I do not know of any \nquality about any person, man or woman, that is better than that of \ncharacter. His behavior in public life and in private life has been \nexemplary. He does not know how to do wrong. We are proud that he is \nsuch a man. We are proud that he has lived the life he has and one with \nsuch outstanding service to this country.\n  He is a man of courage. In World War II he served in the armed \nservices in Italy. He was shot in the arm and other parts of his body. \nThey thought he was going to die but he managed to survive. So many \npeople felt he had no chance to recover but he would not give up. He is \na fighter. He kept on keeping on until he finally restored his health \nand then returned to private life again.\n  Yes, not only did he have physical courage with the enemy but he has \nmoral courage. Sometimes I think moral courage is even greater than \nphysical courage. He could stand up to people when he knew they were \nwrong and tell them so in a courteous way. I just feel that his courage \nwas one of the strong factors in his life.\n  Then, too, he is a man of great capacity. He could not have done what \nhe did here in the Senate as majority leader if he had not been a man \nof great capacity, a man of great ability, who has led this Senate so \nwise and so well for so long. Yes, his capacity has been a great asset \nto this Nation.\n  Bob Dole is a man of conviction. He knew what he stood for and he \nstood for it. He knew right from wrong and he followed the right. A man \nwhose ideals were high, a man we could all be proud of because of his \nexemplary conduct and ideals.\n  Also he is a man of compassion. He could walk with kings, yet he felt \nmost at home with the common people. I have seen many instances in \nwhich he showed great compassion here with employees and with members \nof the public, with the unfortunate, with the disabled, with the \ntroubled. Everybody at times has a problem. He took pleasure in helping \npeople to solve their problems. He is a man of compassion and a man who \nloved people.\n  In all of these things he was courteous. In his position here as \nmajority leader he could have been short with people and he could have \nsaid things and gotten away with it. That would not have been \ncharacteristic of Bob Dole. He was always nice to people. He always \ntried to help people. For that reason, we highly respected him. Because \nof all these good qualities, the Senate has lost an ideal person. This \ncountry has lost a wonderful public leader.\n\n  I predict it will not be long until he will, in his campaign, be \nsuccessful and become President of the United States and render an even \ngreater service. I predict that history will record him as one of the \ngreat persons of this century and of history, known for what he has \ndone in the past but also for what he will do as President of the \nUnited States. I am proud to claim his friendship. I am proud that he \nis an American. I am pleased that he took the step he did today which \nshows strength, courage, and principle. We look forward to his coming \nback to the Government as President of the United States.\n  Bob Dole is blessed with a devoted and lovely wife, Elizabeth. She is \na great person in her own right and serves as president of the American \nRed Cross, former Secretary of Labor, and former Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  She has been an inspiration in his life and will continue to be a \ngreat asset to him in every way possible in the years ahead. God bless \nher.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise also to pay tribute to Leader Dole \nand join my colleagues, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nas well as others who have spoken out.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt for those of us who listen to \nSenator Dole's remarks today that this was truly one of the great \nevents in American history. One had the sense and the feel that great \nthings were taking place.\n  Great, I suppose, partly because we admire and respect Bob Dole so \nmuch, but I think truly great because what he did is so unusual. Here \nis someone who has achieved more success in the Senate than just about \nanyone who has ever served in this body. Here is someone who has been \nelected Republican leader more times than anyone in the history of our \nNation. Here is someone who was willing to risk it all for a higher \ncalling. It is a little like a trapeze artist who goes up to the high \nwire then instructs the folks to cut down the safety net. Not many \npeople do it.\n  Yes, there are some, but most political leaders are happy to be \nsecure in a job, to have the paycheck, to have the staff, to have the \nstrength of the office while they run for another. They are not shy \nabout using where they are at to get where they want to go.\n  What was so unusual about today is Bob Dole cutting the safety net \nand putting it all on the line. For those who remember Rudyard \nKipling's great poem ``If'' you are reminded of the line ``and risk it \non one turn of pitch and toss.'' That is what Bob Dole has been doing. \nHe has put everything he has on the line. He said it best: ``I'm either \ngoing to go to the White House or I'm going to go home.'' It is so \ntypical of the kind of human being that Bob Dole is, one cannot help \nbut be thrilled and exhilarated by the sheer determination and the \ncourage that he shows.\n  This is not a normal politician. This is an extraordinary American \nwho has left the leadership of the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld to champion and seek out the Presidency of the United States. He \nis different. One cannot help but recall Lyndon Baines Johnson running \nboth for the Senate and for Vice President at the same time. The people \nof Texas elected him in both offices. They understood someone's desire \nto have a safety net, to be secure, to be safe, to have a forum before \nthey moved ahead.\n  While we did not condemn those that seem to be safe, to take the \nsafety route, to preserve their spot, strength of power and influence, \nwe cannot help but admire those who are willing to risk it all, whose \ncommitment to the American purpose and the American cause is so great \nthey put that ahead of their own safety, of their own security, and of \ntheir own beloved career. No one should doubt that Bob Dole loves the \nSenate. It shows in the way he conducts himself and the things he \naccomplishes.\n  Also, it would be a mistake for anybody, anywhere, to think that Bob \nDole is not serious about the Presidency. This is someone who has not\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nbeen halfhearted in his commitments. He was not halfhearted when he put \nhis very life on the line in World War II. He was not halfhearted when \nhe won a chest full of Purple Hearts. He was not halfhearted when he \nfaced a lifetime of being handicapped. He was not halfhearted when he \ndetermined in his own mind and in his own heart that he would walk \nagain and that he would move again and that he would overcome that \nhandicap.\n\n  This is not the average person or the normal person who would take \nthe safe way. This is someone of incredible commitment and dedication \nand personal courage. This is someone who threw down the gauntlet in \nthe Presidential campaign today in a stronger, clearer way than I have \never seen before. This is someone who put behind him not only his \nbeloved Senate, but all of his safety net, to say that what he ran for \nand what he sought to do for America was more important than anything \nthat affected Bob Dole.\n  It is very typical of the kind of human being that Bob Dole is, \nbecause I believe Bob Dole is a real thing. He is a Kansan --a Kansan \nwho grew up in a way so that he never complains. He is a Kansan who has \ngrown up in a way so that he does not seek excuses. He is a Kansan who \ngrew up being taught to say what was on his mind, to say what he means \nand mean what he says. That is partly why he is so beloved in the U.S. \nSenate. Unfortunately, it is partly why he is somewhat unusual in \nmodern American politics.\n  Some will say there is quite a contrast in the race that Bob Dole has \njoined. I am one who thinks so. But anyone who has doubts about that \nrace best look further than the current poll numbers, because Bob Dole \nis the real thing. He was the real thing on the battlefield. He was the \nreal thing when he faced a lifetime of being handicapped. He was the \nreal thing when he rose to the heights of politics. Yet, he never let \npolitics be his master.\n  I suppose I will remember him for his judgment, both now and in the \ncampaign ahead. I recall, specifically, an issue that I think many of \nus felt very strongly about, and that is the President's commitment of \ntroops to Bosnia. I opposed that with all my heart, and Bob Dole \nopposed it as well. He spoke out frankly and honestly about the mistake \nof deploying American men and women in a way that we did not stand \nbehind them. When the debate was done, and when public opinion was \nclearly on the side of us who were reluctant to deploy U.S. troops into \nthat theater, and when the President, in spite of all of it, had sent \nAmerican men and women into that zone, we had the chance to vote on the \nfloor on a vote that would have embarrassed the President by \nundercutting the funding he would have for an action he had taken. I \nconsidered it a tough vote. I did not want to embarrass my President, \nbut I did not want them to have to go and serve in an area where we had \nnot made a clear commitment. I believe Bob Dole shared my concern about \nthe deployment. He said so, frankly and honestly. But he also was \nconcerned about America's influence and prestige and the President's \nability to deal with others around the world. He passed up a chance to \nembarrass the President of the United States by voting for that \nresolution, by voting to sustain the President on a policy that he did \nnot like. For Bob Dole, it was more important to support this Nation \nand support its Commander in Chief than it was to gain a political \nadvantage.\n\n  Some could disagree with his vote. I did. But none could disagree \nwith his motivation. For him, what was important was America and the \nviability of the Commander in Chief, even though he was someone Bob \nDole disagreed with. That kind of integrity, that kind of honesty, and \nthat kind of commitment to our Nation are surely qualities that are not \nonly rare, but desperately needed.\n  I do not know what our Maker has in mind for Bob Dole. He has tested \nhim in ways that many of us have never been tested. But I cannot help \nbut believe that Bob Dole's service is not finished yet. In an hour \nwhen our country desperately needs his integrity and character, I am \nglad there is a Bob Dole--the real thing.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I first got to know Bob Dole well 18 years \nago when I went on the Finance Committee and he was the senior \nRepublican on the Finance Committee. The chairman at the time was \nSenator Russell Long, a Democratic Member, of course, from Louisiana.\n  During those early years on the Finance Committee, I was struck by \nseveral characteristics of Bob Dole. I had known him to some degree \nwhen he had been running for Vice-President, but not intimately. During \nthose early years in the Finance Committee, I had the privilege to get \nto know Bob Dole and see him in action. I was struck by several things. \nFirst of all, he is very bright. Not only did he know the intricacies \nof the Tax Code, but when different matters would come up, it was \nobvious he was a quick learner.\n  Second, the characteristic that struck me was his seemingly \ninexhaustible energy. When he became chairman of the committee after \nseveral years, he would manage those bills on the floor--tax bills--\nand, as we all know, in those days, tax bills would sometimes last 2, \n3, 4, 5 days, with all sorts of amendments coming from every direction. \nBob Dole had the capacity to stand here always looking fresh and fit, \neverybody else looking a little bit bedraggled as we would go late into \nthe night, accepting amendments, rejecting those, calling for votes, \ntabling this, and moving on in totally admirable fashion.\n\n  And so, out of that, I came to have a great admiration for Bob Dole \nas I saw him in action on the Finance Committee. Then came his \nleadership here in 1984, succeeding Howard Baker. And, again, Bob Dole \nhad exerted those extraordinary characteristics of leadership--paying \nattention to the needs of all of his members, his flock, as it were, \nand leading us with clear direction and with zest and always with good \nhumor. I suppose there is nobody who made us, as Senators--whether we \nwere in our caucuses, or whether on the floor here--laugh so much, with \nhis quick wit and one-liners, as Bob Dole.\n  And now, of course, he has announced this afternoon that he will be \nleaving the floor of the Senate, where he has served with such \ndistinction for many years. As others have pointed out, he is the \nlongest-serving majority leader in the history of our Nation. To me, it \nis not surprising that he is leaving. Yes, I was surprised, as \neverybody was, by the announcement that came today. But when one \nthought about it, there is no reason for surprise, because it seems to \nme that Bob Dole's life has been marked by a sense of duty. And he saw \na duty here.\n  He has received the nomination of the Republican Party for President. \nBut he looked on and weighed the factors and saw he could not be \nserving the people of Kansas while he was still here trying to do two \nthings at once. Nor could he serve the people of the United States in \nthe fashion and style he felt they were deserving of. And so, in \nresponding to this sense of duty that he give his best to the office he \nwas seeking, while he could not continue to give his best to the people \nof Kansas and the United States, he chose to resign. It has been \npointed out that that is a big decision. But it is a decision that I \nthink we have all come to expect in the style of Bob Dole.\n  So I join others in wishing him well, looking forward to doing \nwhatever I can to help him, as he has helped each of us. He came to my \nState three times to campaign on my behalf in the different elections. \nI think each Senator on this side could say the same thing. So we wish \nhim well. I share the sense of optimism that others have voiced. I know \nthat with his tremendous energy, with his quick learning ability, with \nhis ability of retention of matters that he has studied, and with the \nsense of duty I previously remarked on, he is going to conduct an \nabsolutely marvelous campaign that is going to be a great credit to \nhim, to all who nominated him, and a wonderful reflection on the people \nof the United States of America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I know it is getting late and my colleagues would like to go home and \nhave dinner, but I am sure that we all share\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nin this extraordinary opportunity to say a few words about our leader, \nSenator Bob Dole, and his announcement today of his resignation.\n  I was there, along with Mrs. Dole and Bob Dole's daughter. I think \nall Senators--all 53--there was not a dry eye in the house when Bob \nDole announced his transition from majority leader, relinquishing the \noffice that he loves so dearly. Basically, he laid out for us an all-\nor-nothing campaign. I think it took a great deal of courage. It was a \nbold action, and one that indicated, clearly, to those of us who were \nprivileged to be there, an expression of love for this body that he \nholds so dearly.\n  I think, too, he cleared the air on the issue of some of the \npartisanship that we have in this body. I think it is fair to say no \nlonger can some on the other side of the aisle use the excuse of his \ncandidacy and majority leader as a reason for some of the issues that \nhave not moved before this body. It is my opinion that we have lost a \ngreat leader in the Senate, but the country has gained a great \nopportunity to know Bob Dole as we know him.\n  Mr. President, over the next weeks and months Bob Dole is going to be \nout in America taking his campaign to the American people. I think he \nis going to be laying out very clearly the differences between himself \nand President Clinton. He is going to provide, I think, mainstream \nconservatives and conservatism moral leadership and will be able to \npoint out the differences between the big Government philosophy, which \nis currently emanating from the White House, and that of the best \nGovernment is the closest Government to the people and most responsive.\n  I have had an opportunity to know Bob Dole over the 16 years I have \nbeen in this body. I first recognized him as a true American hero. He \nis one who has always put America first. When he was called to battle \nin World War II--and now, I think, as he leaves the leadership of the \nU.S. Senate--he certainly has shown sacrifice and what it takes \nbasically to be President.\n  Bob Dole has always been there when America has called him, and \nAmerica is calling him today. He is a man of courage, strength of \ncharacter, and patriotism. He is gracious.\n  He came to Alaska to campaign for me. He has been accommodating to me \nduring my 16 years in this body. One of the things that I have always \nmarveled at about Bob Dole is his patience in trying to accommodate \nsome 99 other egos that are relatively high from time to time. Some of \nus have encouraged that he discipline--like, perhaps, that which occurs \nin the 6th grade--those of us who occasionally fall off the turnip \ntruck. But Bob has always maintained an evenhanded approach towards \nleadership, giving each one of us an opportunity to express ourselves \nregardless of how our feelings may be in conflict with his own. Instead \nof, in effect, chastising on occasions when leadership did not receive \nthe support it was entitled to, Bob has always been above that and set, \nI think, an extraordinary example of what true leadership is all about. \nThat is being subjected to the equivocation and the contradictions that \nwe all have on various issues, but being able to hold fast and stand \nabove it as tall as Bob Dole has been and will be as he campaigns for \nthe highest office in our country.\n  So where are we today? This Nation will now have the privilege of \nseeing and knowing the Bob Dole that we have come to know and love and, \nin my own case, have been privileged to work with for the last 16 \nyears. There is no question in my mind, Mr. President, that the \nelectorate will soon be able to define the character of our two \nPresidential candidates and make the choice that is right for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I do not believe I will ever look at \nthe desk directly in front of me, or the podium on it, ever again \nwithout thinking of the Senator from Kansas. Senator Dole is a living \nAmerican hero. He is a Senator of the century. Whenever I have been \naround Senator Dole, somehow I always felt that I was close to the \nheart and the soul of America. I used to introduce him that way. I \nstill introduce him that way. You cannot miss it when you are near him.\n  I want to thank the other side. It was great seeing them standing \nbehind this great American Senator--Senator Daschle, Senator Bradley, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Kerrey, and others. I think it signaled what \nthe entire Nation feels about this man.\n  I loved what Senator Simpson, his great friend from Wyoming, said. He \nsaid: Now America will get a chance to know Senator Dole like his \ncolleagues do. And I think they are going to make him President of the \nUnited States.\n  This has really been a magnificent day--difficult but magnificent. I \nthink on our side we feel a little bit like a family sending off a son \nor daughter to work on a higher mission. I know that is how I feel.\n  I have enjoyed so much this evening listening to the remarks of his \nfriends and colleagues. I join them in saying bon voyage, God bless, \nsafe journey, and much success to the Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/15/senate-section/article/S5103-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXECUTIVE CALENDAR NO. 585 REREFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ARMED \n                                SERVICES\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
