Mr. President, when our colleague from Rhode Island \nannounced his retirement, I could not help but think of what a \ngentleman he is and what an example he has set for this body over the \ncourse of his 35-year career in the Senate. He is the walking \nembodiment of civility, a reminder of the days when politics and public \nservice were indeed kinder and gentler.\n  First elected in 1960, Claiborne Pell is not only Rhode Island's \nsenior public servant, but also one of the Nation's senior statesmen. \nOnly Senators Thurmond and Byrd have served here longer. He is one of \nthe best arguments around today against term limits on Members of \nCongress. Senator Pell's father, Herbert Claiborne Pell, Jr., served as \na Congressman from New York from 1919 to 1921 and was a close friend of \nFranklin Roosevelt and minister to Portugal and Hungary. He had five \nother relatives who served in Congress as well.\n  The younger Pell himself served as a foreign service officer for \nseveral years, then settled in Newport, along with the Vanderbilts and \nAuchinclosses. Most of us know him as the quiet, deliberate, thoughtful \nchairman, and now ranking member, of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He was present at the birth of the United Nations in San\n \n[[Page S 12754]]\n\nFrancisco 50 years ago, and today carries a copy of the U.N. Charter in \nhis coat pocket. This ``eccentricity,'' as one news account called it, \nis a testament to the importance Senator Pell has always placed on an \ninternational organization aimed at promoting world peace and \ncooperation.\n  Senator Pell's greatest legacy probably will lie in the field of \neducation. He is the second-ranking Democrat on the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources and for years chaired the Subcommittee on \nEducation, the Arts, and Humanities. He made a particular mark in \nsetting up a grant program for needy college and university students. \nThese Pell grants, as they are officially called, have become familiar \nto a generation of students. He has also been a leader in promoting \nocean research.\n  A statement Senator Pell made in his retirement announcement \nsummarizes his philosophy and approach to public service. He said,\n\n       I consider . . . the United States Senate a marvelous \n     institution. . . . And I continue to believe that government, \n     and the federal government in particular, can, should, and \n     does make a positive impact on the lives of most Americans.\n\n  There is no doubt that Claiborne Pell has contributed significantly \nand tangibly to that positive impact over the last 3\\1/2\\ decades.\n  In his announcement, Senator Pell also thanked the people of Rhode \nIsland for having tolerated his eccentricities. If those eccentricities \ninclude a quiet, unassuming manner characterized by thoughtful \nreflection, meditation, honesty, and courtliness, then we should all \naspire to be eccentric in the ways that our dear friend from Rhode \nIsland is eccentric. He is eccentric in the best sense of the term. I \ncongratulate Senator Pell, look forward to serving with him for the \nremainder of this Congress, and wish him all the best for the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12753-6", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, like each and every Member of this body, I \nwas surprised--shocked is not too strong a word--when our colleague \nfrom New Jersey announced that he would not be running for a fourth \nterm in the Senate. I could not help but feeling that with the loss of \nSenator Bradley, the Senate would be losing one of its most \nintellectual, thoughtful, and hard-working Members, perhaps one of its \nmost unique ever.\n  Bill Bradley is indisputably capable, an outstanding student of and \noriginal thinker on major economic and foreign policy issues, as well \nas a reflection of mainstream public opinion in this country. He is \ncareful and deliberate in his judgments, and often provides a fresh and \nenlightening perspective on the many complex issues that come before \nthe Senate.\n  Our Nation's tax structure has been one of the focuses of Senator \nBradley's distinguished career in public service. His 1982 fair tax \nproposal led directly to the landmark 1986 tax reform bill. The plan \nwas to cut tax rates sharply and eliminate most preferences and tax \nshelters. He took a broad concept and, in characteristic fashion, \nfilled in the details with exacting care.\n  This was a major piece of legislation whose passage was remarkable, \nespecially since Senator Bradley had relatively little seniority and \nwas, at the time, serving in the minority. But as President Reagan, the \nTreasury Department, the Ways and Means chairman in the House, the \nFinance chairman in the Senate, and other key leaders embraced \ncomprehensive tax reform, Senator Bradley was there every step of the \nway. He quietly encouraged others, avoiding the spotlight while \noffering advice and lobbying Members. He even played basketball with \nsome Members. In spite of his unobtrusive manner and behind-the-scenes \nstyle, he emerged as the indispensable man in getting the bill through \nCongress.\n  Senator Bradley's has been one our most eloquent voices on the issue \nof race relations in this country. He has long called for a national \ndialog on the issue, free of the ideological extremes that tend to make \nthoughtful and frank discussion of race relations rare, if not \nimpossible. His well-thought-out and reasoned pronouncements have often \nhad a cooling effect, and have raised the level of the arguments above \nthe harsh rhetoric often associated with the issue. This is true on \nother issues as well, especially during foreign policy crises.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Bradley during the time we \nhave left together in the Senate, and wish him all the best for \nwhatever his future might hold after he leaves. I am confident that he \nwill, for many years to come, continue to influence the direction of \nour country and will continue to provide valuable leadership on the \nimportant issues that confront us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold pertaining to the \nintroduction of legislation are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12754-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12754-S12756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING CAL RIPKEN, JR., ON BREAKING THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL \n                RECORD FOR MOST CONSECUTIVE GAMES PLAYED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding. He \nknows why I rise on the Senate floor today. It is because, in behalf of \nmyself and Senator Sarbanes, as well as our colleagues from the other \nside of the Potomac, Senators Warner and Robb, I send to the desk a \nresolution congratulating Cal Ripken, Jr., on the occasion of breaking \nthe Major League baseball record for consecutive games played, and I \nnow ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 167) congratulating Cal Ripken, Jr., \n     on the occasion of his breaking the Major League baseball \n     record for the highest total number of consecutive games \n     played.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would also further like to thank the \nRepublican leader, Senator Dole, for allowing the Senate to have no \nmore votes after 5:30 last night so those Senators who were fortunate \nenough to have tickets to the game could get there to be there on time, \nto hear the national anthem sung, and Mr. Ripken's children throw out \nthe ceremonial first ball and to see America as it really ought to be. \nSo I would like to thank the majority leader for the courtesy that he \nextended to me and to the other Senators.\n  Mr. President, it is with pride and enthusiasm that I rise today to \nhonor a baseball hero, a Maryland hero, and an American hero. Last \nnight Cal Ripken, Jr., broke baseball's endurance record. Cal Ripken \nplayed in his 2,131 consecutive ballgame, and in doing so, he broke Lou \nGehrig's record in consecutive games played. Yes, Cal surpassed the \ngreat Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig, by playing 2,131 straight games. Cal has \nstarted every game as a Baltimore Oriole player since May 30, 1982.\n  Now, Cal has achieved many honors already, in his career: Two league \nMost Valuable Player awards, 13 All-Star games, and two Golden Glove \nawards. These are just a few of his many accomplishments. His streak is \nastounding for the character and the commitment it represents. To the \npeople from Maryland like me, the streak means so much more, though, \nthan physical endurance and awards. For us, Cal's effort is a testimony \nto what someone can achieve when they put team interests ahead of self \ninterests.\n  Cal has not done this just for the sake of breaking a record; he \nbroke that record because that is how he lives. He gives 100 percent \nevery day. Ask any of the hundreds of Baltimore Orioles, who played \nwith him over the last 14 years. Ask Cal's coaches who have seen him \nrededicate himself every day. Ask any of the thousands and thousands \nand even millions of Orioles fans for whom he stayed at the ballpark \nlate at night, willing to sign autographs, appear at charity events and \nbe \n\n[[Page S 12755]]\nthere for Baltimore and be there for the Orioles. Ask any of the \nmillions of baseball fans who have watched him handle himself with \ndignity, who have watched him handle himself with gallantry on the \nplaying field and off the playing field. We have watched him also treat \nothers with dignity throughout his career. And, you know, if you ask \nCal why he did it, he will tell you he wants to give his team the best \nchance of winning each and every game, and give the game the good name \nthat it deserves.\n  Mr. President, this celebration is not for Cal alone but also for the \nman who held that record for so many years. Lou Gehrig represented the \nsame qualities that we look for in Cal Ripken. It is words like \nmasculine virtue, honor, integrity, being with your team, standing up \nfor what is right. The Lou Gehrig record had really helped create a \nYankee dynasty, and Lou Gehrig was the major reason for that dynasty. \nLou Gehrig was in a class all by himself. He will always be a champion \nand have a unique place in baseball.\n  It was thought during Gehrig's time that the record would never be \nbroken. However, I believe that if Lou Gehrig were alive today he would \nadmire Cal Ripken and see a man following in his footsteps, putting \npain and self-interest aside, and see a man working harder than anyone \nelse. He would see Cal Ripken trying to be the best player and the best \nperson he could be, and I believe that the ``Pride of the Yankees'' \nwould tip his hat in respect for the ``Pride of the Orioles.''\n  Mr. President, I believe that people in positions of public trust \nshould serve as role models for young people. I believe this includes \nathletes and public officials. So, today, I am proud to say that some \nof Cal's greatest achievements have actually come off the field. He is \na role model for kids. When so many are teaching the philosophy of \n``me, only,'' he represents the philosophy of ``we, together.''\n  Also, he represents the philosophy of giving your time to your \ncommunity. His efforts at raising financial resources to fight \npediatric cancer at Johns Hopkins--on the night that he tied the Gehrig \nrecord, Baltimore raised over $1 million to give to Johns Hopkins for \nresearch on the Lou Gehrig disease. That is what Cal Ripken is. And, \nmost important, Cal is a loving father, husband and son.\n  It is fair to say that the streak does not end when Cal steps off the \nfield. The field is only where it begins.\n  So on behalf of all Marylanders and the Nation's baseball fans, I \nwant to congratulate Cal Ripken for his achievement. Maryland and \nAmerica are proud of him. Today is Cal's day. And in Baltimore and in \nhis hometown of Aberdeen, it is ``Calleluia Day.'' So to commemorate \nhis record, I am submitting this Senate resolution along with my \ncolleagues to honor this remarkable achievement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last night, September 6, 1995, at Oriole \nPark at Camden Yards, not far from my home in Baltimore, Cal Ripken \nbroke baseball's most enduring record of consecutive games played. In \nsurpassing Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 games, Cal Ripken has secured a \nplace in sports history, and in the hearts and minds of all who love \nbaseball.\n  This accomplishment is much more than an event to be chronicled in \nthe record books; it is a tribute to Cal Ripken's dedication to \nexcellence--excellence in athletics as well as excellence in \nsportsmanship. In a time bereft of heroes, we admire persons such as \nCal Ripken who exemplify high standards. Cal plays for the love of the \ngame. He does not play for the fame; he cares little about the glory. \nWhat he does care about is playing baseball to his fullest potential. \nHis affection for the game shines like a beacon in the night. His love \nof the game and his dedication has led him to this record. Neither \nmoney nor fame could have guided him to such a pinnacle in his career.\n  We call baseball our national pastime. But for many of us it is much \nmore than that. It brings us back to an era where the players were \nlarger than life and inspired us to the same greatness. When players \nlike Gehrig rambled out onto the field they were more than men: they \nwere heroes. At a time when people are searching for heroes, Cal Ripken \nstands proudly and quietly at the forefront of those we have to offer \nour children. He is a man of dignity, quiet workmanship, and humility. \nIt is in keeping with these qualities that his children, Rachel and \nRyan, threw out the first pitches to the game that would assure that \ntheir father crossed the threshold from extraordinary player to a \nlegend.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial, lauding Cal \nRipken's streak and his character, from the September 6, 1995, edition \nof the Baltimore Sun, as well as Cal Ripken's statement and excerpts \nfrom remarks presented by his teammate Brady Anderson, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 6, 1995]\n\n                                Our Cal\n\n       Somewhere in this favored city, we should like to think, \n     today a male infant is being born, and named Cal.\n       Somewhere, as the possibilities grow, a court of law is \n     approving a grown-up's change of name to become Mr., Mrs. or \n     Ms. Calripken.\n       Fielding still another dream--from a window at 2131 East or \n     West Baltimore Street, or 2131 Maryland Avenue, a banner \n     flies: black background, large yellow numeral 8.\n       In the distance: north and east of Baltimore, traffic on \n     U.S. 40 is backed up for miles, by the street dancing in \n     Ripkentown, formerly Aberdeen.\n       Politics enters, the governor of California vowing that, \n     once elected president, he will change the postal \n     abbreviation out there from CA to CAL.\n       Hold on--back at that Baltimore maternity ward, it turns \n     out instead to be twins; girls, yet. Okay, their names will \n     be Callie and Vinnie.\n       To be a Baltimorean is to feel, right now, exalted. Some \n     1,525 daily newspapers are still published in this country \n     and every last one, it may well be, will print a news story \n     tomorrow that is datelined Baltimore--a great-news, feel-\n     wonderful story.\n       The news is of a new endurance mark, one that won't be \n     outdone until the 2000s, if then; a mark set by a Baltimore \n     Oriole, by a man who as a major leaguer has played only for \n     our Orioles. Season after season, starting in 1982, our tall \n     shortstop has never missed a game. His bones refused to \n     crack; his joints, on being wrenched, simply unwrenched; his \n     sinews (no matter how hard he flung the ball over to first) \n     never tore. People applaud Cal's upbringing; a further help \n     from family is that while the Birds were on the road, no call \n     came to be present instead for wedding or funeral. The nation \n     that reads, or watches some announcer read, will long equate \n     the name Ripken with stoic, determined toughness.\n       For there to be interest in continuity, a sport has to have \n     gone on awhile; only in the current century did baseball's \n     busy statisticians, checking for uninterrupted participation, \n     proclaim their first durability champ--at 727 consecutive \n     pennant-season games, Steve Brodie, centerfielder for the \n     1890s Baltimore Orioles. The original games-in-a-row search, \n     however, had to do with base hits. There the original \n     titleholder, at 44 games, proved to be Willie Keeler, \n     rightfielder for the 1890s Orioles.\n       Is perseverance a municipal characteristic? Let others \n     say--watching us struggle, even now, to get the world to \n     spell Calvin Edwin Ripken Jr. correctly.\n       With Cal Ripken, just as much off the diamond as on, \n     another quality shines. Put it this way, as the Camden \n     Warehouse banner signals 2131: What a city this would be, \n     what a state, were those of us watching and cheering to go \n     forth, afterward, bent on creating some kind of excellence \n     and decency streak of our own.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        Text of Ripken's Speech\n\n       After last night's record-breaking game, Cal Ripken \n     delivered the following speech:\n       When the game numbers on the warehouse changed during fifth \n     innings over the past several weeks, the fans in this \n     ballpark responded incredibly. I'm not sure that my reactions \n     showed how I really felt. I just didn't know what to do.\n       Tonight, I want to make sure you know how I feel. As I grew \n     up here, I not only had dreams of being a big-league \n     ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. As a boy \n     and a fan, I know how passionate we feel about baseball and \n     the Orioles here. And as a player, I have benefited from this \n     passion.\n       For all of your support over the years. I want to thank \n     you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This \n     is the greatest place to play.\n       This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in \n     ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me \n     their kindness, but more importantly, they demonstrated their \n     love of the game of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball \n     fans everywhere.\n       I also could express my gratitude to a number of \n     individuals who have played a role in my life and my career, \n     but if I try to mention them all, I might unintentionally \n     miss someone and take more time than I should.\n       There are, however, four people I want to thank especially. \n     Let me start by thanking \n\n[[Page S 12756]]\n     my dad. He inspired me with his commitment to the Oriole tradition and \n     made me understand the importance of it. He not only taught \n     me the fundamentals of baseball, he taught me to play it the \n     right way, the Oriole way. From the very beginning, my dad \n     let me know how important it was to be there for your team \n     and to be counted on by your teammates.\n       My mom, what can I say about my mom? She is an unbelievable \n     person. She let my dad lead the way on the field, but she was \n     there in every other way--leading and shaping the lives of \n     our family off the field. She's the glue who held our lives \n     together while we grew up, and she's always been my \n     inspiration.\n       Dad and Mom laid the foundation for my baseball career and \n     my life, and when I got to the big leagues, there was a man--\n     Eddie Murray--who showed me how to play this game, day in and \n     day out. I thank him for his example and for his friendship. \n     I was lucky to have him as my teammate for the years we were \n     together, and I congratulate him on the great achievement of \n     3,000 hits this year.\n       As my major-league career moved along, the most important \n     person came into my life--my wife, Kelly. She has enriched it \n     with her friendship and with her love. I thank you, Kelly, \n     for the advice, support, and joy you have brought to me, and \n     for always being there. You, Rachel and Ryan are my life.\n       These people, and many others, have allowed me, day in and \n     day out, to play the American game of baseball.\n       Tonight I stand here, overwhelmed, as my name is linked \n     with the great and courageous Lou Gehrig. I'm truly humbled \n     to have our names spoken in the same breath.\n       Some may think our strongest connection is because we both \n     played many consecutive games. Yet I believe in my heart that \n     our true link is a common motivation--a love of the game of \n     baseball, a passion for our team, and a desire to compete on \n     the very highest level.\n       I know that if Lou Gehrig is looking down on tonight's \n     activities, he isn't concerned about someone playing one more \n     consecutive game than he did. Instead, he's viewing tonight \n     as just another example of what is good and right about the \n     great American game. Whether your name is Gehrig or Ripken: \n     Dimaggio or Robinson; or that of some youngster who picks up \n     his bat or puts on his glove: You are challenged by the game \n     of baseball to do your very best day and day out. And that's \n     all I've ever tried to do.\n       Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Anderson's Tribute\n\n       Excerpts from the speech Brady Anderson delivered on behalf \n     of Orioles players after last night's game:\n       For 14 years, Cal Ripken has played for the Orioles with \n     skill, determination and dedication. His inspiration has \n     always been a love for the game, his teammates and the \n     devoted fans of Baltimore.\n       The record which has been broken today speaks volumes about \n     a man who never unduly focused on this achievement, but \n     accomplished it through years of energy, incredible inner \n     resources and an unflagging passion for the sport.\n       But fame is a dual-edged sword, and his is no exception. \n     Incredible pressure has been placed on Cal as it became \n     increasingly apparent that this achievement could be \n     realized. In breaking this record, he surpasses the playing \n     streak of Lou Gehrig, an exceptional baseball player.\n       I know Cal is honored to be in the company of such a \n     legend, just as we know that each man's accomplishments and \n     contributions enhance, rather than diminish, the other's; for \n     what finer tribute can one player give to another than his \n     uncompromising excellence?\n       Cal, you have inspired many teammates; you have delighted \n     million of fans; you have given the nation uncountable \n     memories. Your pride in and love for the game are at a level \n     few others will reach. Cal, thank you.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the front page of today's Washington Post \nsays it all: ``History Embraces Ripken.'' As an original cosponsor of \nthe resolution just submitted by my friend and colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, I applaud Cal Ripken, Jr.'s magnificent \naccomplishment.\n  Last night's recordbreaking achievement by Ripken restored America's \nlove for and pride in our national pastime, but it was not just a \nvictory for baseball. What we are celebrating is not just Ripken's \n2,131st consecutive game, or the home run which punctuated it so \nperfectly.\n  Rather, Cal Ripken, Jr.'s achievement is about greatness, about the \nessence of being and being an American. Cal Ripken, Jr. is a modest \nhero, a humble role model, a decent citizen, a caring father, a loving \nhusband. He is committed to his craft, his community, and his country.\n  Yes, history has embraced Cal Ripken, Jr. But, more importantly, he \nhas reminded Americans to celebrate all that is good about themselves \nand their country.\n  Congratulations to Cal, to his family, and to a Nation of friends who \nshare his ideals.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the extraordinary \naccomplishments of Cal Ripken, Jr. As we all know, last night at Oriole \nPark at Camden Yards, Cal Ripken broke a record that was once \nconsidered unbreakable.\n  From 1982 until today, the one constant in the ever-changing world of \nbaseball has been the presence of No. 8 in the Baltimore Orioles line-\nup. In an era where job insecurities increasingly permeate our society, \nCal Ripken's breaking of Lou Gehrig's long-standing record while \nplaying for the same team during the entire streak, seems even more \nremarkable.\n  Without a doubt, this new record has reinvigorated American's \ninterest in baseball. And the fact that the record-holder is such a \nsolid, decent, and humble man adds extra luster to this unprecedented \nachievement.\n  While this record is an extraordinary testament to Cal Ripken's \ndedication to the game of baseball, his actions during the closing days \nof this streak are even more telling. In the early morning of September \n6, 1995, as Cal stood poised on the edge of baseball immortality, he \naccompanied his daughter Rachel to her first day of school. And when \nasked which event held more significance--the breaking of Lou Gehrig's \nrecord or his daughter's first day of school--Cal responded that in his \nhouse, Rachel's first day of school was undoubtedly the most important \noccasion.\n  I congratulate Cal Ripken, his wife Kelly, daughter Rachel, and son \nRyan. Cal Ripken has made Americans remember why baseball is our \nnational pastime--and how much true heroes mean to us.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I urge all of my colleagues to join in the celebration \nby adopting this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 167) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 167\n\n       Whereas on May 30, 1982, Cal Ripken, Jr. became the regular \n     starting shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles baseball club;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. has not missed a single day of work \n     in the intervening 14 years;\n       Whereas on September 6, 1995, Cal Ripken, Jr. played in his \n     2,131st consecutive Major League Baseball game, breaking the \n     long-standing record held by the great Lou Gehrig;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. has been a first-rate role model \n     for the young people of Baltimore, the State of Maryland, and \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. has been named by America's \n     baseball fans to 13 American League All-Star teams;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. was named the American League's \n     Most Valuable Player for the 1983 and 1991 seasons;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. was a member of the 1983 World \n     Series Champion Baltimore Orioles baseball team;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. was named the Most Valuable Player \n     in the 1991 All-Star game;\n       Whereas Cal Ripken, Jr. has twice been awarded baseball's \n     most prestigious award for excellence in fielding, the Gold \n     Glove Award, for the 1991 and 1992 seasons;\n       Whereas in the distinguished career of Cal Ripken, Jr., he \n     has demonstrated an extraordinary work ethic, and dedication \n     to his profession, his family, and his fans; and\n       Whereas the humility, hard work, desire, and commitment of \n     Cal Ripken, Jr. have made him one of the best-loved and the \n     most enduring figures in the history of the game of baseball: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate congratulates Cal \n     Ripken, Jr. for his outstanding achievement in becoming the \n     first player in the history of Major League Baseball to \n     compete in 2,131 consecutive games.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12754-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 12757]]\n\n\n           JAPAN-UNITED STATES SENATE YOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to draw the attention of my \nSenate colleagues to a successful international exchange program \ninvolving the youth of America. This program, the Japan-United States \nSenate Youth Exchange Program has been sponsored over the years by the \nGovernment of Japan and the Center for Global Partnership and has been \nsending young students from the United States to Japan for the past 15 \nyears.\n  The program, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki in \n1981, offers outstanding United States high school students the \nopportunity to spend a summer with a Japanese host family through Youth \nfor Understanding [YFU] International Exchange. As these young people \nassume positions in business, government, education, and other \nendeavors, they play a significant role in strengthening the bonds \nbetween Japan and the United States.\n  In the past, 2 students from each of the 50 States of the United \nStates were selected to participate in this exchange program. Because \nof funding reductions, only 1 student from each State now participates \nin the program. This is regrettable and represents a downward trend in \ninternational exchanges.\n  The imbalance of exchanges between the United States and Japan is \nworrisome: there are 20 Japanese exchangees in the United States for \nevery 1 American exchange student in Japan. And funding from Japan for \nexchanges is much greater than funding from the United States. I hope \nthis imbalance can be corrected.\n  Mr. President, the Japan-United States Senate Youth Exchange Program \nhas been functioning in the best interests of the United States, Japan, \nand the individual student and family participants. I want to take this \noccasion to salute and encourage the efforts of both public and private \ncontributors who have assisted and continue to assist this worthwhile \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12757-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before discussing today's bad news about \nthe Federal debt, how about ``another go'', as the British put it, with \nour pop quiz. Remember? One question, one answer.\n  The question: How many millions of dollars does it take to add up to \na trillion dollars? While you are thinking about it, bear in mind that \nit was the U.S. Congress that ran up the Federal debt that now exceeds \n$4.9 trillion.\n  To be exact, as of the close of business yesterday, September 6, the \ntotal Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $4,969,749,463,346.30, \nof which, on a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America \nowes $18,865.25.\n  Mr. President, back to our pop quiz, how many million in a trillion: \nThere are one million million in a trillion.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12757-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  BIPARTISAN BUDGET SUMMIT NEEDED NOW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is time for a bipartisan summit on the \nbudget.\n  As I said back in June during the debate on the 1996 budget \nresolution, I fear that the Republican congressional leadership and the \nPresident are on a collision course over the budget.\n  An immediate bipartisan budget summit is needed to forge a solution \nto next year's appropriations bills, or we will have a disaster on our \nhands that will force the entire Government to an abrupt halt this \nfall.\n  The start of the 1996 fiscal year is less than a month away, yet we \nare far from completing the 13 annual appropriations bills needed to \nfund the Government. In fact, we are very close to a fiscal disaster.\n  The House, Senate, and the President are still miles apart on these \nbills without much effort being made to find common ground within the \nnext 30 days. And the administration is now preparing contingency plans \nfor agencies to continue essential operations in case we fail to agree \nbefore the first of October.\n  I see little hope for an agreement if we keep to our current course.\n  Of the 11 appropriations bills passed so far in the House, President \nClinton has threatened to veto 6. The Senate has passed seven \nappropriations bills, with huge differences from their House \ncounterparts. Indeed, the Senate and House have reached agreement on \nonly one appropriations bill.\n  The political rhetoric is heating up as the fiscal disagreement \ncontinues.\n  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has declared that: ``The budget \nfight for me is the equivalent of Gettysburg in the Civil War.''\n  President Clinton has also refused to back down, saying: ``I will not \nbe blackmailed into selling the American people's future down the drain \nto avoid a train wreck. Better a train wreck.''\n  This push for a train wreck is stupid on both sides. We don't need to \nshut down the Government to prove we are Democrats or Republicans. We \nall know that an all Republican budget will not become law or an all \nDemocratic budget will not become law.\n  This political posturing is just what Vermonters tell me that they \ndislike about Washington.\n  Shutting down the Government in an attempt to score political points \nwill only bring more scorn of our political system. It is time to put \nour political differences aside and come together in a bipartisan \nbudget summit--before the crisis.\n  Our political system will not be the only loser if political \ngamesmanship causes a Government shutdown--a shutdown will also be a \nloser for U.S. taxpayers. Government shutdowns waste taxpayer money.\n  In 1981, for example, the Government spent $5.5 million to close \noffices and send workers home. In 1990, a President and Congress of \ndifferent parties failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the budget. \nAnd the General Accounting Office calculated that the resulting 3-day \nGovernment shutdown cost taxpayers between $244 and $607 million.\n  Government shutdowns also hurt the citizens in our society who depend \non our Government the most. In 1979, an 11-day Government shutdown led \nto delays in Federal payments for housing subsidies, delays in GI bill \neducation checks, and delays in aid to the disabled.\n  A longer shutdown could hurt senior citizens who rely on their Social \nSecurity income, students who rely on Federal loans, farmers who rely \non Federal support programs, travelers who rely on our air traffic \ncontrol system, and consumers who rely on meat inspections.\n  We need a bipartisan budget summit to avoid such a costly Government \nshutdown. For a summit to succeed, everything must be on the table: \ntaxes, health care reform, entitlement reform, further spending \nreductions, and the time it will take to get to a balanced budget.\n  Such a summit will be a grueling, sometimes acrimonious, encounter. \nBut anyone who has studied the various blueprints can see the outlines \nof an agreement.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that we must consolidate \nunnecessary Government programs, reform welfare, and control Medicare \nand Medicaid spending. We may now disagree on some of the details for \naccomplishing these goals, but that is why we need a bipartisan \nsummit--to hammer out the details of a compromise.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12757-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That has been agreed upon.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, in auspicious timing, the Washington Post has a \nsplendid editorial this morning entitled ``Welfare: Two Kinds of \nCompromise.''\n  It speaks of the compromise that was notably on display when \nCongress, the Nation's Governors, and President Reagan worked out some \nof the better provisions of the Family Support Act in 1988, aimed at \nreforming welfare.\n\n       The parties all agreed on the sensible principles that the \n     Federal Government should help the poor and that the existing \n     welfare program was not doing enough to move people into \n     jobs. The resulting bill was far from perfect and was not \n     adequately financed--that's why welfare reform is still very \n     much a live issue--but it did result in some successes that \n     could be built upon with a new round of reform.\n\n  Mr. President, some time later in our debate, I will offer the Family \nSupport Act of 1995, which builds on the 1988 legislation, which passed \nout of this Chamber 96 to 1. I recall that there was great bipartisan \nharmony in the Rose Garden when President Reagan signed it.\n  In the Committee on Finance, I offered the Family Support Act of \n1995, and it failed to pass, by 12 votes to 8, which is scarcely an \noverwhelming rejection. It was a party-line vote, I am sorry to say. \nSeven years ago it was very different. But we will have an opportunity \nto discuss it.\n  I ask unanimous consent, as we begin this morning, to have this \neditorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 7, 1995]\n\n                    Welfare: Two Kinds of Compromise\n\n       There are different kinds of political compromise. The best \n     kind happens when the contending parties find that \n     substantive agreement can be reached without a compromise of \n     principles. This sort of accord was notably on display when \n     Congress, the nation's governors and President Reagan worked \n     out some of the better provisions of the Family Support Act \n     in 1988, aimed at reforming welfare. The parties all agreed \n     on the sensible principles that the federal government should \n     help the poor and that the existing welfare program was not \n     doing enough to move people into jobs. The resulting bill was \n     far from perfect and was not adequately financed--that's why \n     welfare reform is still very much a live issue--but it did \n     result in some successes that could be built upon with a new \n     round of reform.\n       But there is a less honorable tradition of compromise \n     involving not a quest for consensus but the artful \n     manipulation of labels and slogans. It is this kind of \n     compromise that is most to be feared as Congress approaches \n     the welfare issue. The debate now seems hopelessly entangled \n     in the rivalry between Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and \n     Sen. Phil Gramm for the Republican presidential nomination. \n     That was clear when Mr. Dole gave a speech the other day in \n     Chicago promising to fight ``for revolutionary change vote by \n     vote and bill by bill,'' and Mr. Gramm responded rapid-fire \n     at a Washington news conference. ``I see Sen. Dole moving to \n     the right in speeches every day,'' Mr. Gramm said. ``I don't \n     see it reflected in what he's doing in the United States \n     Senate.''\n       This is a bad context in which to legislate on a problem \n     such as welfare, where the tough issues will not be solved by \n     a resort to doctrine or slogans. Take a particularly hard \n     question: If welfare is turned into a block grant, should \n     states, in exchange for receiving something close to their \n     current levels of federal aid, be required to maintain \n     something like their current level of spending on the poor. \n     Those spending levels, after all, got them their current \n     allotments of aid in the first place. A small group of Senate \n     Republicans who are trying to prevent Mr. Dole from reacting \n     to Mr. Gramm by doing anything he wants, rightly see this as \n     a central issue. But it's easy to include a provision in a \n     bill labeled ``maintenance of effort,'' as Mr. Dole \n     effectively has, and make it essentially meaningless, as Mr. \n     Dole also effectively has, by allowing states to count all \n     sorts of extraneous expenditures as meeting this \n     ``maintenance of effort'' requirement and having the \n     requirement expire in a couple of years. The provision would \n     give Mr. Dole cover with his party's moderates without really \n     giving them much of substance. It's fake compromise. Much \n     more of that sort of thing could become the rule in the \n     coming weeks.\n       Mr. Gramm can make welfare a centerpiece of his campaign \n     against Mr. Dole if he wants to. But the rest of the Senate, \n     not to mention President Clinton, does not need to be \n     complicit in turning a momentous piece of legislation over to \n     the politics of sound bites. Far better no welfare bill than \n     the kind likely to be created in this atmosphere.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I see my distinguished friend, the Senator from North \nDakota, on the floor, and I am happy to yield him 20 minutes if that \nwill be sufficient for his purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from New York for yielding me the \ntime to discuss the Daschle amendment on welfare reform.\n  A friend of mine the other day described a circumstance in his small \nrural hometown. There was a Lutheran minister who did not make very \nmuch money ministering to a very small congregation, being paid a very \nsmall salary. And because a minister in a small town is paid very \nlittle, his wife gave piano lessons in order to make a few dollars to \ntry to make ends meet for him and his wife. These folks were the \nparents of the friend of mine who was referring them to me. He said \nthey lived in a very meager house provided by the church and lived on a \nvery meager income all of their lives. They contributed to their \ncommunity by ministering at the church and by his wife giving piano \nlessons and teaching Sunday school.\n  At the other end of the block, there was a wonderful family, as well. \nThis family started a business, worked very hard, made an enormous \namount of money and were very successful. They were well liked and also \ncontributed much to the community.\n  The two families had taken different routes. One chose ministering in \na small rural church where they were never to earn any significant \namount of money and always lived near subsistence. The other chose to \npursue an occupation that would lead them to accumulate a substantial \namount of assets. Both were good families and both contributed to their \ncommunity.\n  My friend said, ``I wonder if my parents contributed less to their \ncommunity than the folks down the block who made a substantial amount \nof money.'' I think not. I think they made at least as great a \ncontribution. But they ended up with nothing.\n  I use that story to illustrate that, for some in this country these \ndays, being poor is out of fashion. If you are poor, somehow you just \ndid not make it in America and you chose not to spend all of your time \ntrying to maximize your income. So you end up in circumstances, after \nage 70 and after having ministered for 40 years in a rural church, \nwhere you have nothing. And maybe you end up needing some help from \nsomeone. But that is not disgraceful. It was because you chose to \ncontribute in other ways during your lifetime and chose not to spend 50 \nyears trying to maximize your income.\n  The question is, did the minister and his family contribute less to \nour country? No, they did not. They found themselves in circumstances \nof some difficulty--without income, without resources, without assets. \nThere are a lot of good people in our country just like them.\n  The people I just described are atypical. The more likely and typical \nperson in need in this country, with respect to welfare, is a young \nwoman in poverty--an increasingly feminine picture these days--who is \nraising children in a household without two parents present.\n  One morning at about 6 a.m., I went down to a homeless shelter here \nin Washington, DC, and sat there for a couple of hours talking to the \npeople who were there. I have told my colleagues on one previous \noccasion about my visit at the shelter with a 23-year-old young woman, \nwhom I believe, had three children, whose husband had left her, who had \nno skills, no high school education, no job, and no place to live.\n  She and her children, after having spent the night in a temporary \nshelter, as they did every night, were then put on buses in order to be \nat this feeding center at 6 a.m.\n  I sat and visited with this young woman, and I discovered with her, \nas with virtually everyone else on welfare with whom I have ever \nvisited, that what she wanted most in life was a good job. She was not \nasking me, can you give me a bigger welfare check? Can you find a way \nto extend your hand with more money, more benefits, more help? That is \nnot what she was asking. \n\n[[Page S 12759]]\n\n  I was asking her what would she really like if this morning she could \nwave a wand and change her life? Her response was that she desperately \nwanted to have a job that paid her a sufficient income so that she \ncould save money for a first month's down payment to rent an apartment \nwhere she could live with her children. She said to me, I want a place \nto live. I know in order to get a place to live, I need to get a job. \nIn order to get a job, I have to have some skills. I do look for work \nalmost every day and I do get work. And the minute I get work--it is \noccasionally frying a hamburger at some franchise place and always at \nthe minimum wage--I lose my health care benefits for my children. The \nmoment I try to save $10 or $20 for the first month's rent on an \napartment so I could get rid of this homeless condition for me and my \nchildren and find a place to live, the minute I save $10 or $20, I lose \nmy AFDC payment or it is reduced by the same amount.\n  And as I drove back to the office here on Capitol Hill the morning \nafter I visited with her, I thought to myself, I am pretty well \neducated. I have a couple of college degrees. I have done pretty well. \nAnd I wondered how could I think my way through this problem if I were \nin this young woman's situation? What kind of a solution allows her to \nget off this treadmill, the treadmill of poverty, helplessness, \nhopelessness?\n  I honestly, putting myself in her position, could not really think my \nway out of her problem. She cannot get a job because she does not have \nthe skills. She cannot save money for a down payment on rent because \nshe does not have a job. If she gets a job and starts saving money, she \nloses AFDC payments for her kids. It is an endless circle of trouble \nfor someone who is literally trapped in a cycle of poverty from which \nthey cannot recover.\n  Now, I mention that story because in order to talk about welfare \nreform, you have to talk about two truths. One is often used by those \nof us in public office, regrettably, to talk about welfare. That is, \nthe stereotypical notion of who is a welfare recipient. It is some \nbloated, overweight, lazy, slovenly, indolent, good-for-nothing person \nlaying in a Lazy Boy recliner with a quart of beer in one hand and a \nJack Daniels in another hand, with his hand on the television changer \nwatching a 27-inch color television set and unwilling to get up and get \nout and get a job and go to work, munching nachos all day long watching \nOprah, Geraldo, and Montel. That is the notion of the stereotypical \nwelfare recipient.\n  I suppose that happens. There is, I suppose, a small element among \nwelfare recipients who are inherently lazy, unmotivated, unwilling to \nwork, and have become institutionalized in the welfare system. This \nsmall element believes he or she can go on welfare and live on it \nforever, even if they are able bodied. That does happen. It should not \nhappen. It is a minority of the people on welfare. We must eliminate \nthose people for whom welfare has become an institutionalized way of \nlife. We can and will stop these abusers of the system.\n  The welfare bill that we have offered--Senator Daschle, Senator \nMoynihan, myself, and others--is a bill that says to those folks, if \nyou believe that in this country you can live on welfare as a routine \nmatter and you are able bodied, then you are wrong.\n  Welfare is temporary assistance. We are willing to give it, we \nbelieve we must give it. But welfare is temporary and it is \nconditional. Our bill says we will offer a temporary hand if you are \ndown and out. But you have a responsibility to take hold of that hand \nand get out of poverty by getting training to help you get a job. Our \nplan is intended to move people off the welfare rolls and on to \npayrolls. That is what our bill says. That is what we say to those \nfolks.\n  The abuser--the able bodied who are lazy, is a minority in the \nwelfare system. The bulk of the welfare recipients are represented by \nthe woman I discussed earlier--the young woman living in poverty, a 23-\nyear-old unskilled woman with three children to raise, and not the \nmeans with which to do it. She represents the bulk of the welfare \nrecipients.\n  The question is, What do we do about it?\n  Let me give a couple of other facts. It is also a stereotypical \nnotion of welfare that we have a lot of people in this country who are \nsimply producing large numbers of children in order to get more welfare \nbenefits. It probably does happen, but it is not typical.\n  The average size of the welfare family in America is nearly identical \nto the average size of the American family. Let me say that again \nbecause it is important. In public debate we all too often use \nstereotypes, and the stereotype is the notion that there is someone out \nthere having 16 babies because producing babies allows them to get a \nlot of welfare. The average size of the welfare family is nearly \nidentical to the average size of the average family in our country.\n  We spend about 1 percent of the Federal budget on welfare. A \nsubstantial amount of money is spent in many ways in our country, but \nwe spend only about 1 percent of the Federal budget.\n  My interest in this issue has to do with two things. First, I would \nlike to engage with people from as far right on the political spectrum \nas Pat Buchanan and people all the way to the far left and say we all \nagree on one thing: welfare is temporary. Welfare should not become \ninstitutionalized for people who are able bodied and believe they ought \nto live off of the rest of the taxpayers for the rest of their lives. \nThe temporary nature of welfare assistance is embodied in the Daschle \nbill.\n  Second, and more important to me, is an understanding of our \nobligation to America's children. Tens of millions of America's \nchildren are growing up in circumstances of poverty. They were born in \ncircumstances of poverty not because they chose to, not because they \ndecided that is what they wanted for their lives, but because of a \ncircumstance of birth.\n  Two-thirds of the people on welfare in America are kids under 16 \nyears of age. No one, no matter how thoughtless they may be in public \ndebate, would say, I hope, to a 4-, 6-, or 8-year-old child we say: \n``You do not matter. Your hunger does not count. Your clothing needs \nare irrelevant.''\n  I have spent a lot of time working on hunger issues as a Member of \nCongress and have told my colleagues before about a young man who made \nan indelible impression with me. I will never forget it. A man named \nDavid Bright from New York City, who also lived in a homeless shelter, \ndescribed to us on the Hunger Committee when I served in the House, his \nlife in the shelter with rats and with danger and so on. He said that \nno 10-year-old boy like me should have to put his head down on his desk \nat school in the afternoon because it hurts to be hungry. This from a \n10-year-old boy telling us in Congress about stomachs that hurt because \nthey did not have enough to eat.\n  This welfare bill care about our kids in this country. We must \ndecide, whatever else we do about welfare, to take care of America's \nchildren in the right way--to give them hope, opportunity and, yes, \nnutrition, education, and shelter.\n  Now, when I talk about children, there is one inescapable fact that \nthe Senator from New York has talked about at great length that has to \nbe addressed in the context of welfare reform. And that is the epidemic \nof teenage pregnancies in this country.\n  There will be roughly 4 million babies born this year in America--\nroughly. Over 1 million of those babies will be born in circumstances \nwhere two parents will not be present at the birth. 900,000 of children \nborn this year will never in their lifetime learn the identity of their \nfather. Think of the circumstances of that, what it means to a society. \nNearly 1 million babies born this year will never in their lifetime \nlearn the identity of their father.\n  The Democratic alternative we are considering today addresses the \nissue of teenage pregnancy and the epidemic that is occurring in this \ncountry. We address the circumstances where children are growing up in \nhomes where the parents are children themselves, and they have no \ninformation or experience to do adequate parenting.\n  What we do in the Daschle amendment is that we want a national \ncrusade against teenage pregnancy; we say that teenage pregnancy is not \nsomething that is acceptable to this country. It is not something we \nshould promote or encourage; it is something we should discourage. \nPeople should have \n\n[[Page S 12760]]\nchildren only when they are able to care for them.\n  What this amendment says to a child who is going to have a child, a \n16- or 17-year-old child who is going to have a baby--which is \nhappening all too often in this country--is you are not going to be \nable to live in a separate residence if that happens. You are not going \nto be able to leave school and get public assistance. We say there are \ngoing to be conditions for receiving assistance. Every teenage mother \nwho has a baby out of wedlock has to understand this. If you do not \nstay in school, you will lose all benefits--nothing. Benefits are \nterminated. And you are not going to be able to collect money to set up \na separate living arrangement for yourself and your baby.\n  Our proposal establishes some adult-supervised living homes, where \nteenage mothers will have to live in supervised circumstances and stay \nin school as a condition for receiving benefits. We are saying this \nmatters in our country. There is teenage pregnancy epidemic that this \ncountry must deal with. It is also an epidemic that eats up a \nsubstantial amount of our welfare benefits to respond to it. Our \nproposal says we can and should do something about it.\n  As I indicated, the Senator from New York has done an enormous amount \nof work on this issue. I commend him for it. He was the impetus in our \nDemocratic caucus for saying: This is wrong. This is going to hurt our \ncountry. This is going to disintegrate our society unless we address it \nin the right way.\n  This amendment, the Daschle initiative, addresses teenage pregnancy, \nin my judgment, in a very significant way. I am very proud to say this \nis the right way to do it. It is the right way to go about it.\n  We also say something else. We say to a young woman who has a child \nout of wedlock, ``If you are going to get benefits, you have a \nresponsibility to help us identify who the father is. You have that \nresponsibility. If you do not do that, you do not get benefits.'' We \nare going to find out who the father is, and we are going to go after \ndeadbeat dads.\n  Deadbeat dads have a responsibility to help provide for those \nchildren. Not just taxpayers, but the people who fathered those \nchildren have a responsibility to provide some resources to help those \nchildren. They each have a responsibility to be a parent. But in the \nevent they will not do that, we are going to make sure that they own up \nto the responsibility of providing resources for those children.\n  Our bill is tough on absent parents who are delinquent in child \nsupport. Our bill is tough on this issue. When a child is born out of \nwedlock and when a mother says ``I now want benefits,'' we insist that \nmother help us identify the father, and that father help pay for and \ncontribute to the well-being of that child.\n  I would like to mention two other points about this legislation. I \nhave not done this in any necessary order. I guess I could have \nprioritized this welfare discussion a bit more, but I wanted to talk \nabout a couple of component parts of it that are important to me.\n  First, there is an assumption that if we reform the welfare system, \nthere will be enormous savings. Savings of $100 billion over 7 years, \nas I believe was estimated in the budget resolution, are not going to \nhappen. The fact is, if we do what is necessary to reform the welfare \nsystem, to make it really work, we are not going to save money in the \nnext 7 years. But we can build a better country and make people more \nresponsible and give people opportunity and get people off the welfare \nrolls and onto payrolls.\n  The woman in the homeless shelter that I talked about earlier is the \nreason we are not going to save money. In order for her to work and get \na job, she has two requirements. She has to get some training to get a \ngood job. And then, in order to work at the job, she has to have some \nchild care. If she does not get the training, she will not get the job. \nAnd if she does not have child care, she cannot work. Then, when those \ntwo requirements are met, one other element has to be present. If the \njob that person gets does not provide health care, then we have to have \nsome Medicaid transition benefits as well.\n  If we do not do those three things, welfare reform will fail. All \nthree things cost money in the short term. In the long term, they will \nsave money. But there is no way on God's green Earth to believe someone \nwho says, if we reform this welfare system--and we should and we will--\nand do it the right way, that we will save $100 billion in the next 7 \nyears. We can put the country on the right track. We can do the right \nthing. We can end dependency on welfare by able-bodied people, but we \nwill not save $100 billion and it is time for everyone in this Chamber \nto understand that.\n  The second point I would like to make about the financing of welfare \nis the notion embodied in the Republican proposal, that we can solve \nthis problem quickly and easily if only we simply aggregate all of this \nmoney into a block grant and ship it off somewhere and thereby create \nsome nirvana by which the welfare problem is solved.\n  By and large, block grants are blockheaded. They will, in my \njudgment, if used routinely and repeatedly, as some have suggested, on \nvirtually every issue coming before the Congress, result in the most \negregious abuse and waste of the taxpayers' money we will have ever \nseen.\n  Do you want to describe how to promote waste in Government? I will \ntell you how. You have one level of Government raise the money and then \nsend it to somebody else and say, ``You spend it. No strings attached. \nWe will not watch.'' If you want to promote irresponsible, reckless, \nwasteful, wild, abusive spending, I guarantee you this blockheaded \napproach to block grants is the quickest and most effective way to do \nit.\n  So, those who come to us with these simple little placebos, who say \ntake this and you can believe it is medicine, whether it is block \ngrants or $100 billion savings, it is pretty unimpressive to me.\n  What we Democrats have done is put together an alternative. It is an \nalternative that says welfare cannot be permanent. Welfare is going to \nbe temporary. Welfare is not unconditional. Welfare is going to be \nconditional. You need help? We are going to give you some help. But you \nhave a responsibility in accepting that help. It is your responsibility \nto step up and out and off of the welfare system and become a \nproductive member of our society on a payroll somewhere.\n  The second element of our alternative piece of legislation that is \ncritically important is that we say we are going to protect America's \nchildren. Yes, we are going to reform the welfare system, but we are \ngoing to do it the right way, with the right incentives that require \nresponsibility for oneself. That is the foundation of our approach. \nBut, at the same time, we are also going to protect America's children. \nOur plan leaves no questions unanswered about whether America's \nchildren will be protected.\n  That is why I am delighted to be here to support the Daschle \ninitiative. I was part of a large group of people who helped construct \nit. I was not the major architect. I know the Senator from New York and \nothers support it as well.\n  I have taken slightly more time than I intended, but I appreciate the \ngenerosity of the Senator from New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, for beginning today's debate, today's critical \ndebate, in an open, thoughtful, fair-minded manner.\n  Could I comment on just one particular point? The Senator raised the \nquestion of the children born out of wedlock, and he is quite right. In \n1992, 1,224,876 children were born out of wedlock--in some census \ntracts, 80 percent of all children born. Happily, North Dakota has been \nspared--or spared itself. This is something altogether new to our \nexperience.\n  And 30 years ago, you could not have discussed it on the Senate \nfloor. There is a maturity coming to our debates. This was a subject--\nthe ratio, in 1992, reached 30.1 percent. It is probably almost 33 now. \nIt has gone up every year since 1970.\n  In 1970, it was 10.6 percent. So it has tripled, the ratio, and the \nnumber of children have tripled.\n  We could not talk about this. We were not sure it was happening. Was \nit \n\n[[Page S 12761]]\nan aberration, just the weather, something like that? There used to be \ntheories that when there would be blackouts there would be more \nchildren conceived. That turned out not to be so.\n  We have a social crisis of a new order--not a recession, not a \ndrought, not a collapse of farm prices, nor an increase in mortgages, \nthe things that have come with some periodicity and consequence to us, \nand which we have learned to understand pretty much and manage. We have \nnever had this before, and we have never talked about it before; not in \nthe calm, thoughtful way the Senator from North Dakota has done.\n  I want to thank him most sincerely for setting a tone which I think \nand I hope will continue throughout this debate.\n  Mr. President, I look to my friend on the Republican side.\n   Does he wish to speak?\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I do.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may observe, the Senator from Florida is here.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I apologize. I can wait. I am going to be on the floor.\n  The Senator may go right ahead.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized to speak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President and my distinguished \ncolleagues. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  I want to talk some about the structure of the welfare reform \nproposal that is before us and some concerns I have as to whether we \nare building a foundation on reality with steel and concrete, or a \nfoundation of sand based on theory, hope, and avoidance of \nresponsibility.\n  I am going to be talking from basically two sources. First, I will \ntalk from some statistics that are generic and analytical of the \nlegislation before us. I will also be talking from some anecdotes which \nare personal and specific.\n  For the last 21 years, I have had a practice of taking an occasional \njob in a different area of interest within my State. In July, I took a \njob with one of the two welfare-to-work programs in Florida, this one \nin Pensacola. This is a program which is very similar to the objectives \nof both the underlying bill and the amendment that is before us. It is \nmandatory; that is, participation is required. It has the goal of \nplacing a high percentage of those persons who are currently on welfare \ninto employment. It is exploring what are the pragmatic requirements of \naccomplishing that objective, and it is doing so in the community of \nPensacola, which is very representative of the kind of communities \nacross America in which this type of program will be applied.\n  I am going to be using some of the information and observations from \nthat experience also as the basis of my comments on the plan which is \nbefore us today.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support a serious effort to move people \nfrom the dependency of welfare to the independence of and self-\nsufficiency through employment. That is a fundamentally important \nobjective.\n  As we start this, I want us to understand almost the moral dimension \nof what we are doing, and I will place that in the context of eight \nwomen with whom I spent a considerable amount of time in Pensacola who \nare part of this process of making the transition.\n  Just to describe these eight women, they were six white and two \nAfrican American women. They were somewhat older than I had \nanticipated. The youngest was in the early twenties, up to the early \nforties. All of them had two or more children. Three of the eight women \nhad a child with a serious medical disability. I was initially \nsurprised that there would be that high an incidence of medical \ndisability. But on reflection, given the fact that these women \ntypically had no or very limited prenatal care with their children and \nhad limited access to primary care since their children were born, it \nis not surprising that there would be that incidence of medical \ndisability.\n  These are women who are very committed to a better life for their \nchildren through the achievement of independence for themselves. Many \nof these women have limited educational backgrounds and, therefore, the \nkind of job training in which they are now engaged in Pensacola, the \nWelfare to Work program, is difficult for them. But they are making a \nmaximum effort to be successful.\n  In the course of attending one of the programs in which they are \nlearning some of the basic skills that will be necessary, one of the \nwomen broke down and cried. She said: ``This is so difficult for me, \nbut I understand the importance of this opportunity that I am being \ngiven and, if I do not succeed, not only will this likely be my last \nchance but it will fundamentally change the future for my children. I \nwant to succeed.''\n  Our moral responsibility as a society, Mr. President, is we are \ntelling these women that you have 2, maybe 3 years to be successful in \npreparing yourself and securing employment, and securing employment at \na level that will allow you to support your children. We are making a \ncommitment to them that not only are we going to provide them with what \nwould be required to do so, but there will be a job there that they can \nsecure upon the completion of their preparation. And the consequences \nof their failing to get that job is that they and their children will \nhave the level of support that they are currently receiving terminated \nor substantially altered and reduced.\n  So there is a commitment on both sides. And it is from that point \nthat I would like to draw some observations about the underlying bill \nwhich is before us today, because I believe it is based on some \nunrealistic assessments of the world in which this proposal will \nactually operate and creates the potential of some serious unfairness \nand a violation of that moral commitment that we are making to these \nAmericans.\n  First, I believe that the goal of the welfare plan, which is to have \n25 percent of the current welfare beneficiaries employed in year 1 of \nthis plan and 50 percent employed in year 5, is unrealistic.\n  In year 1, the definition of reaching that 25 percent is a month-by-\nmonth evaluation of how many persons who were on welfare had been moved \ninto a work position. And if at the end of the first 12 months of the \nfiscal year, you do not have an average of 25 percent, then your State \nis subject to sanctions. I believe it is going to be virtually if not \nabsolutely impossible to reach that 25 percent goal. There is a \nnecessary startup period in terms of developing the job placement \nprograms, the job training programs, and the support services such as \ntransportation, as well as securing child care for the young dependents \nof these women, which makes reaching the goal of a 25-percent objective \nin year 1 highly unlikely.\n  Equally as difficult will be to reach the 50-percent level in year 5. \nThat is in large part because of whether the jobs are going to actually \nbe available. Pensacola, FL, happens to be an area that has a \nrelatively growing economy, an economy which is creating a substantial \nnumber of jobs.\n But even there the administrators of the program stated that it will \nbe very difficult to reach a 50 percent placement level within a 5-year \nperiod. That would be true because of the competition for those jobs \nfrom all the other people in the community who will be seeking that \nemployment--the issue of will there be jobs that will be not just at \nthe barest minimum wage but at a level high enough or at least offering \na sufficient potential to raise a sufficient amount of money to be able \nto support a family of a single mother and two children, which is the \ntypical family in Pensacola.\n\n  There are 6,600 welfare families in Pensacola, so the goal is to \nplace 3,300 of those in work by the year 2000. That will be a challenge \nfor Pensacola. But, Mr. President, let us put that in the context of \nanother American city, a substantially larger city, and that is \nPhiladelphia. Philadelphia has not 6,600 people on welfare; it has \n500,000 people who are receiving some form of public assistance.\n  In Philadelphia, using the statistics provided by DRI McGraw-Hill on \nU.S. Market Review, in 1994 there were 2,149,000 jobs in Philadelphia. \nIn the last year of their survey, which is 1997, the projection is \nthere will be 2,206,000 jobs in the Philadelphia area, or an increase \nof approximately 47,000 jobs over that period from 1994 to 1997. We do \nnot have the statistics to the year 2000, but assuming that that rate \nof increase \n\n[[Page S 12762]]\ncontinues, we could expect maybe another 20,000 or 30,000 jobs to the \nyear 2000, so well under a 100,000-job growth and yet we are saying \nthat by the year 2000, half of this population of 500,000 people is \nsupposed to be placed in jobs in Philadelphia.\n  How is that going to happen? I think we have a level of unreality in \nterms of the scale of the population that we are saying has to be \ntrained and placed and their children supported and the number of jobs \nwhich are going to be created, particularly in those areas of the \ncountry that are not experiencing the kind of robust economic growth \nthat a community such as Pensacola, FL, has experienced.\n  My first point is that I think we have a statistical unreality in \nterms of what we are saying has to happen and what, in fact, is likely \nto occur. And for that reason, independent groups such as the \nCongressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office that have \nlooked at this plan, have stated that 44 out of the 50 States will not \nbe able to meet the expectations of this legislation--that 44 out of \nthe 50 States are going to fall into the category of those that are \nnonperformers and therefore subject to a 5-percent penalty.\n  I would suggest that these numbers are so unrealistic in terms of the \nkind of commitments that we are prepared to make that the 5 percent \npenalty will be accepted as a fact of life for many States and that any \nserious effort to meet these unrealistic goals is likely to be \nabandoned.\n  It is interesting to me the difference in which we are treating those \nprograms that we are about to ship off to the States and say, ``You run \nthem,'' such as welfare reform and Medicaid, where we are setting these \ntheoretical goals, and then essentially abandoning any effort to do \nthose things that will be necessary to make those goals attainable, and \nhow we are treating the one big program we are responsible for running \nand that at least as of today no one has suggested be sent to the \nStates to run, which is Medicare. There we are saying that Medicare has \nto be treated above politics; that we have to be very, very careful it \nis structured properly because we know we are going to be held \nresponsible for how that one is administered.\n  With welfare and Medicaid, we essentially are saying we can abandon \nall responsibilities for the pragmatic implementation. That is going to \nbe somebody else's responsibility.\n  A second level of unreality is in the funding levels and specifically \nin the area of unfunded mandates to the States. It is interesting, when \nwe came here back in January with a very expansive and aggressive \nagenda of domestic issues, which issue received primacy, which received \nthat special recognition of being Senate bill No. 1. Well, that honor \nwas assigned to the legislation that dealt with reducing unfunded \nmandates, that as our No. 1 domestic objective we were going to cease \nthe process of having the Federal Government meet its responsibilities \nby telling somebody else, generally a State or local government, what \nto do and requiring them to use their resources in order to achieve \nthat national objective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Can the Senator use another 5 minutes? We want to be \nfair to all Senators.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would be happy to do it. I am listening to what he \nhas to say.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The reality is that this bill which we are about to pass \nwill be the grandfather of all unfunded mandates. We are going to be \nimposing significant new responsibilities on the States, without the \nresources to fund those responsibilities, and that as we impose that \ngrandfather of all unfunded mandates, we are going to be creating a \nwhole series of stepchildren as its consequence.\n  Let me just use the example of my State, a family of three typically, \nand in the case of all eight of the women I mentioned earlier, this is \nthe case, a single mother with two children. The State of Florida \nprovides $303 a month in economic support, cash assistance to that \nmother and two children. That $303 is roughly half Federal money and \nhalf State money. Under this proposal, it is going to take 75 percent \nof the Federal money that we have been providing for the support of \nthat family of three in order to pay for the job training and related \nsupport activities and the child care of that mother and her family \nwhile she is preparing to work. There is no proposal to act to fund \nthose additional activities.\n  In fact, the level of funding at the Federal level will be declining \nover the period of this program. So instead of that family having $303, \nit will see that reduced to approximately $185 a month which will be \navailable for economic support because the remainder of the money, \napproximately $135, will be used to pay for these other mandated \nservices. So we are saying that this family, which has been living on \n$303 a month, is now going to have to start living on $180 a month \nwhile the remainder of the money is used to prepare the mother for a \nfuture job and to provide child care for her dependent children.\n  Mr. President, I think that is an unrealistic economic scenario. And \nit becomes even more draconian since we are no longer going to be \nrequiring States, at least after 2 years, and even in a very soft way \nduring the first 2 years, to provide any continuing match. So \npotentially not $85. If the State of Florida were to decide to abandon \nits local match and not provide any State funds, we could have this \nfamily living on $35 a month, just that portion of the Federal money \nthat is left over after you have met your mandates. I think that is \nhighly unrealistic and would defeat not only the goal of moving people \nfrom welfare to work, but would also undermine our basic American \nhumanitarian and compassionate sense of responsibility to all of our \ncitizens.\n  And finally, the reality of this proposal is in the extreme \ndisparities that will exist from State to State under this plan. I \nmention unfunded mandates. In the case of Florida, about 75 percent of \nour Federal funds would be required to meet the unfunded mandates. We \nare better off than Mississippi, where it will take 88 percent of \nMississippi's Federal money to meet their unfunded mandates, which \ncompares to the District of Columbia, that can meet their unfunded \nmandates with only 46 percent of the Federal money.\n  Why is there such a great disparity? Because we start off with a \ntremendous disparity in how much Federal money per child is available \nunder the proposal that has been submitted by the majority leader. A \nstark difference is right within a mile of where we stand. A poor child \nin the District of Columbia will get three times as much money under \nthis proposal of the majority leader as will a poor child across the \nPotomac River in Virginia.\n  I think that is not only indefensible and unfair, but undermines the \nbasic credibility of this proposal as a means of moving people from \nwelfare to work.\n  So, Mr. President, in those areas, I think we have a house that is \nbeing built on a foundation of sand.\n  Mr. President, we need to guard against passing legislation which has \nrhetorical mandates and aspirations, but without the practical \nunderstanding of what it would mean in the lives of people and, \ntherefore, virtually assuring that we will have a failure of \naccomplishing our objectives and will have more decades of exactly the \nkind of welfare issue, exactly the kind of continuing dependence that \nwe are trying to ameliorate through this effort.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the more pragmatic amendment \nwhich has been offered by Senator Daschle and his colleagues as the \nstarting point for serious, meaningful welfare reform.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, if I need that \nmuch, to thank the Senator from Florida, the former Governor of \nFlorida, who knows precisely of what he speaks when Federal formulas \nare involved.\n  You heard the striking differences between the jurisdictions of \nFlorida, Mississippi, the District of Columbia, and Virginia. I hope \nyou also heard the Senator's comment about the city of Philadelphia, \nthe number of jobs in the city, the numbers created in recent years. I \nhave been trying to make a point, as I said yesterday--I do not know \nthat I can persuade anyone, but I can try to make it and I can argue--\nwhich is the point that 30 years ago, we might have considered turning \nthis subject back to the States, giving them \n\n[[Page S 12763]]\nblock grants of some kind, saying, ``You handle it. Cities, you handle \nit. It makes some sense since local governments are closer to the \nproblem. It is not that big a problem.''\n  It is today, in one after another jurisdiction, a problem that has \noverwhelmed the capacity of the city and the State.\n  The Senator mentioned Philadelphia. In 1993, 57 percent of the \nchildren living in the city of Philadelphia were on AFDC, welfare, at \none point in the course of the year. At any given moment, 44 percent--\nthese are numbers never contemplated. Nothing like that happened in the \nGreat Depression. And these children are paupers. They are not from \nunemployed families, where there is a house, an automobile, some \ninsurance.\n  One of the few regulations the Federal Government does have--the rest \nare all intended you have to waiver for--if you have less than $1,000 \nin assets, you are a pauper. The cities cannot handle it. And they will \nnot.\n  Just as when we began the deinstitutionalization of our mental \ninstitutions in the early 1960's--at the last public bill-signing \nceremony President Kennedy had, on October 31, 1963, he signed the \nCommunity Mental Health Construction Act of 1963. I was present. He \ngave me a pen. I had been involved with this in New York, where it \nbegan. Transfer license. We were going to build 2,000 community mental \nhealth centers by the year 1980, and one per 100,000 thereafter.\n  We built about 400. We kind of overlapped and folded the program in \nand forgot about the program. We emptied out the mental institutions. \nAnd we have been hearing about homeless shelters all day.\n  I said yesterday, and I will repeat again, in 10 years' time, with \nthis legislation in place, with these time limits in place, children \nwill be in the streets. Seventy-six percent of the children on welfare \nare on welfare for more than 5 years.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, I hope, will keep that in mind--76 \npercent. About 40 percent--the remainder come and go quickly and are \nnever a problem.\n  But if we do this, we will have in my city of New York half a million \npeople on the streets in New York. We wonder about homeless people. \nThey used to be in mental institutions. Now these children are in \nhouses. They are in households. We will wonder where they came from. We \nsay, ``Why are these children sleeping on grates? Why are they being \npicked up in the morning frozen? Why are they horrible to each other, a \nmenace to all, and more importantly to themselves? Whatever happened?''\n  When the homeless appeared in New York, we right away diagnosed it as \na lack of affordable housing. That is not what it was. It was Federal \npolicy in its most perverse mode. Make a great change and do not follow \nthrough. Make changes you do not fully understand. Those tranquilizers \nwere not as good as we thought.\n  Here are some other cities. In Detroit, 67 percent of children were \non welfare at one point or another in the year of 1993; in Baltimore, \n56 percent.\n  My time has expired. But I will return to this subject.\n  Now I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum for 1 minute to see \nwhether the Senator from Oregon wishes to speak--I do not see him on \nthe floor--after which it is the turn of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Is 15 minutes sufficient for his purposes?\n  Mr. DODD. Why do we not try 15. I may need 20.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty, it is.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I record, Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon \ndoes not wish to speak at this moment. So if the speakers are all on \nour side, it is because we are talking, I suppose, about our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. Before \nbeginning, our colleague from Florida asked me to yield to him for a \nminute to raise a question to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut very \nmuch. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  I want to commend the Senator from New York for the excellent \nstatement, and particularly that he brings us back to reality, just \nwhat are the circumstances of the people that are going to be affected \nby our actions.\n  I would like to inject, briefly, for the Senator's information and \npossibly further comment, some good news. I mentioned that in \nPensacola, there were 6,600 welfare families. I am pleased to say that \nin the first 18 months of the transition program, which is a program \nbased on the 1988 legislation that the Senator from New York sponsored, \nthat almost 600 of those 6,600 have, in fact, been placed in \nemployment, that having occurred because there was a willingness to put \nthe resources required to provide the kind of training and support, \nincluding child care, to those families to allow it to happen.\n  It can happen. This is not just a doom-and-gloom scenario. We are not \nconsigned to have to deal with this problem in its current form \nforever. But it is not going to be easy, it is not going to be quick, \nand it is not going to be inexpensive if we are going to achieve real \nresults.\n  I appreciate the constant reminder of the Senator from New York of \nthose realities.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Florida, and I do particularly \nappreciate his reference to the Family Support Act, which never \npromised a rose garden. We said if you try hard, you will have \nsomething to show for it. Pensacola does.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from New York departs \nthe floor and my colleague from Florida continues, I want to commend my \ncolleague from Florida for an excellent statement.\n  And, let me just say, the distinguished Senator from New York has \ncontributed more to the collective wisdom in this body on the subject \nof welfare reform than anyone. I say that with all due respect to the \nother 99 of us in this Chamber, but the Senator from New York has \ndedicated virtually a lifetime of service focused on this complex \nissue.\n  She is no longer with us, but Barbara Tuchman wrote a wonderful book \ncalled the ``March of Folly.'' It was related to foreign policy \nfailures throughout history. What made her book unique is that she \ntalked about failures where those responsible for conducting foreign \npolicy--from the Trojan Wars to the Vietnam war--knew when they were \nabout to do something that, in fact, it was wrong and that there were \nbetter alternatives. But, they refused to recognize them. She described \nseveral historical events beginning with Troy, including the American \nRevolution, and several others.\n  Were she alive today and were she to write a domestic version of the \n``March of Folly,'' I suspect our current debate on welfare reform \nmight be a chapter in that book. My fear is, and I heard my colleague \nfrom New York express this over and over again, we are missing each \nother in the night as we discuss this subject matter.\n  The Senator from New York has said repeatedly we are not engaged in \nreform here at all. What we are engaged in is a dismantling, total \ndismantling of a system with a faint hope that what we are about to put \nin place is somehow going to serve the public in a better way. What we \nare talking about here is reducing our Federal commitment to welfare by \nroughly $70 billion, passing the cost on to the States and localities \nof this country and asking them to assume the responsibility and burden \nof picking up this chore with little likelihood that we are going to \nachieve the desired goals expressed, with all due respect to the \nmajority leader's bill.\n  I just want to take a moment, before getting into the substance of my \nremarks, and urge my colleagues to \n\n[[Page S 12764]]\nplease listen --listen--to our colleague from New York. There is a lot \nof wisdom in what he says. He knows this issue well. Historically, we \nhave paid attention to our colleagues, regardless of party, regardless \nof ideology, who brought a special knowledge and experience to a \nsubject matter. The Senator from New York is that individual in our \nmidst. We ought to be listening to him on this subject.\n  So I hope in the coming days, we can get away from a bit of the \npolitics of this issue and think about what we are doing and what a \nmess we are likely to create in this country, costing the middle-class \ntaxpayers billions of dollars before we are through, all in the name of \nsome political debate about who is going to deal with the welfare \nrecipient more harshly than the next.\n  That ought not to be what this debate is about. It ought to be about \nhow we reform our current system to make it work better in a realistic, \nthoughtful, prudent manner. Unfortunately, I do not think that this has \nbeen the case. I know my colleague from New York has other business to \nattend to, but I just felt very strongly when I came over here to \naddress this matter. This is one of those rare occasions when the \n``March of Folly'' seems to be upon us once again.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will pay some close attention to the \nproposals that are being offered by the distinguished Democratic leader \nand hope that somehow in the next few days we may come to our senses \nand find some common ground on this issue.\n  I read the other day that the distinguished majority leader announced \nin Chicago that there will be no compromises this fall. How does this \ninstitution function when the leader of our body says there will be no \ncompromise on a subject matter that will have a profound effect on our \ncountry for years to come? We need to seek some common ground and \nthoughtful analysis to deal intelligently and effectively with the \nissue of welfare reform.\n  There is no debate about what we are trying to achieve: How do we \nmove people from dependency to self-sufficiency? We are now looking at \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren of people who have been dependent \non welfare without the ability or the fortune of work. How do we move \npeople to work in an intelligent way? How do we make it possible for \nthem to get there and stay there, so that they have at least the basic \nprotection of health care and some safe place to put their children?\n  This is not a concept that is terribly difficult to grasp, I hope. \nEvery single family in this country ought to be able to relate to this. \nThey do. When you go to work, where is your child? Who is watching your \nchild? Every single person, from the highest paid chief executive \nofficer down to the lowest wage earner in this country, understands \nthat critical issue: if you are going to go to work, you need to have \naccess to safe, affordable, and quality child care. It ought not to be \ndifficult for us to try and come up with some ways to do achieve this.\n  The benefit of all of this is not just fiscal, it also has to do with \nthe fabric of our country. It has to do with helping to provide people \nopportunities to have a sense of self-worth as we build our \nneighborhoods and communities. It is a critical element. And trying to \nfind the ways and the means to accomplish that goal ought to be the \nsubject of our discussions. We should not, as I said earlier, outdo \neach other in our rhetoric to indict people, in most cases, who, \nthrough no fault of their own, are in this situation.\n  I left this chart here, Mr. President, because it ought to be in \neveryone's mind. As our colleague from New York has pointed out, two-\nthirds of the people we are talking about in this bill are children; \nthey are not adults, they are kids. Two-thirds of the recipients are \nAmerica's children. In Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, \nthere are staggering numbers of children who are recipients or \ndependents of families where there is this dependency on public \nassistance of one kind or another.\n  I hope, again, we can have an honest and thoughtful debate about how \nwe can improve this situation, rather than worsening it by creating a \nrace to the bottom. The Washington Post the other day--I do not have it \nhere with me today--had a lengthy article about what will happen as \nStates race to cut benefits. As some States cut benefits, their actions \nwill put great pressure on neighboring States to follow suit, or else \nrisk becoming a magnet for families searching for ways to end their \nslide further down the economic ladder. As the race proceeds, it will \ncause great damage to our national commitment to address these \nproblems.\n  Maybe I am wrong, but I honestly believe when there is a child in \nPennsylvania, or a child in Colorado, or a child in New York that is in \ntrouble, I have an obligation as a Senator to help them. I am a U.S. \nSenator from the State of Connecticut, but my interest and concern \nabout children is not limited to the geography that I represent. It is \nthe country that I represent. And so when there is a child who is \nhurting in a Western State, an Eastern State, or my own State, I \nbelieve that, through the constitutional process which creates this \ninstitution, I ought to bring a concern to this national body to \ngrapple with these problems in a way that makes sense for all of us. I \nshould not just assume that these problems are Colorado's problem, or \nNew York's problem, or Pennsylvania's problem alone. That belief would \nrun contrary to our sense of nationhood.\n  So the goals of work and independence and self-sufficiency and family \nunity are all things that we ought to be striving for.\n  We are going to miss that mark substantially if we do not try and \nfind ways to achieve those goals in a realistic way, and make the kinds \nof investments that will need to be made if we are going to be \nsuccessful.\n  The tendency to blame and punish is certainly tempting. I understand \nthe politics of it. But in the long-term it is not going to help us \nresolve the kind of difficulties that I think we have been asked to \nassume by our election to this body as national representatives--not \njust our own States' representatives but national representatives.\n  There is strong evidence that the rise of poverty is, in large part, \nattributable to declining wages. There has been a tremendous amount of \nevidence that over the past 2\\1/2\\ decades wages have declined, and \nanxiety and fear has grown among our people as a result of that trend. \nI hope we will keep this evidence in mind as we consider this debate on \nwelfare reform.\n  If we take the view that the only purpose of welfare reform is to \npunish people--as I said a moment ago, those who have been getting \nsomething for nothing--then we are going to ignore the fact that \nwelfare is an unwelcome fate for most recipients.\n  More important, we will miss the opportunity, in my view, for any \nkind of real, meaningful reform, because we will ignore what we must do \nto move people from the dependency of welfare to work: First, to \nprovide them with education and training. Again, we all know we are \nentering a sophisticated age. There are fewer and fewer jobs where \nlittle or no education or training is needed. As it is right now, less \nthan 1 percent of the jobs in this country are going to be available to \npeople with less than a high school diploma. In a few years, it will be \na college diploma. You are going to have to have those skills if you \nare going to move people to work. The jobs will not exist for people in \nthis category without the training.\n  Second, you have to ensure that States are partners with the Federal \ngovernment, lest they engage in a race to the bottom that rewards \nStates for spending less on moving their people from welfare rolls to \npayrolls. I do not think anyone believes that is a wise course to \nfollow.\n  Third, and I think most important in this debate, and I have \nreferenced it already--is to ensure that parents have the child care \nthat they need in order to keep a job in the first place. Child care, I \nhappen to believe, is the linchpin of welfare reform.\n  No matter what else we do, if a parent cannot find a safe and \naffordable place for their young children during the working day, that \nparent is not going to be able to hold down a job. I do not care how \nyou look at that issue or analyze it. That is a fact.\n  In my view, the alternative proposal offered by the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, fails to meet this three-part standard. It represents, I \nthink, a retreat from the problem and not reform of it. It does not \neven, in my view, deserve to be called reform. All it would \n\n[[Page S 12765]]\ndo is package up Federal programs for poor families, cut the funding by \n$70 billion, and ship the whole problem to the 50 States. Is somebody \ngoing to tell me that is reform? That is just passing the buck and \nasking the middle-class taxpayer to have their property taxes and sales \ntaxes skyrocket at the local level--as we wash our hands of it. We have \nreformed the problem. Mr. President, we will have done nothing of the \nkind.\n  The acid test of any welfare reform proposal is its impact on \nchildren, in my view, because they are the majority of the recipients. \nIs a reform proposal going to punish the children for the mistakes or \nbad luck of their parents? It bears repeating time and time again that \ntwo-thirds of the AFDC recipients are children. More than 9 million \nchildren received cash assistance in 1993.\n  The Republican welfare reform proposal, as it is called, would single \nthese children out for extraordinarily harsh treatment. I do not care \nwhat your ideology or politics are, I do not know of anybody that wants \nto see that happen. Yet, Mr. President, as a matter of fact, that is \njust what happens under this proposal. In my view, the Republican plan \npackages up punitive policies that aim for the parent, but will hit the \nchild instead.\n  Children should not be penalized because of the happenstance into \nwhich they have been born. I do not think we want to see that be the \ncase.\n  We promise the elderly and veterans a minimum level of support in our \nsociety. Why can we not do the same for children? We need a national \ncommitment to see that children are not abused, that they do not go \nhungry, and that their basic needs are being met.\n  The Republican proposal, however, fails to provide even the most \nbasic minimum standards for our Nation's children. Mr. President, I \nwant to stress that these children, I believe, are our Nation's \nresponsibility. They are our Nation's responsibility. Whether a child \nlives in Mississippi, California, Connecticut, Colorado, or \nPennsylvania, we as a nation must look out for the basic welfare of \neach and every one of these young citizens. The American people, I \nthink, understand the concept of nationhood. They do not want us to \npull the basic safety net out from under these children.\n  The Republican plan, however, threatens to do just that. If a parent \nis cut off of welfare after a 5-year time limit and is still not \nworking, his or her children are the real losers. The Republican \nproposal makes no allowance for these children. If you are a kid in \nthat family, you have had it. I do not believe that makes a lot of \nsense, Mr. President. I think you ought to be thoughtful about what is \napt to happen down the pike here.\n  The proposal being offered by the Democratic leader includes a 5-year \ntime limit, but it provides a voucher in the amount of the child's \nportion to a third party for families who hit the time limit. So the \nchildren's portion is held aside. If the family does not make it out of \nwelfare in 5 years--you still have something for the kid. As it is \nright now in the Republican proposal, you have nothing for that child. \nDoes anybody really believe that is what we should do? Are we going to \nlook at the face of that child in 5 years and say, ``I am sorry, your \nparents did not get off of it, you are a loser and you get nothing.'' I \ndo not know of a single person in this body that would sit and look \nthat child in the face--not the number or the statistic, but that \nchild--and say, ``you get nothing because your parents did not make it \noff welfare in 5 years.'' I do not believe that makes any sense. I \nhonestly do not believe that is what we will do. Nor do I believe that \nis what the States will do. But, this bill calls for that.\n  Changing the welfare rules will not make these children disappear. \nThey may very well end up out on the street--as the Senator from New \nYork said--solely because of the mistakes or bad luck of their parents. \nWe ought to be more creative and more responsible than that.\n  Under the Republican plan, 3.9 million children could lose assistance \nunder the 5-year time limit. More than twice that number would be \njeopardized if States move to the 2-year limit, as some have suggested.\n  I go back to the point of the Senator from Florida and the Senator \nfrom New York. In Detroit, 67 percent of the children are on welfare. \nIn Philadelphia, it is 57 percent. There are some 500,000 families, or \npeople, on welfare in that city alone. Is anybody going to honestly \ntell me that in 5 years, everybody is going to be off? If you are not, \nthe kids in that city are going to be the ones to pay the price because \ntheir parents were not able to find the jobs. That does not make any \nsense, Mr. President. More thought needs to be given to all of this.\n  Despite its tough rhetoric, the Republican welfare reform bill is \nempty, in my view, when it comes to putting welfare recipients to work. \nThe legislation requires States only to dramatically increase their \nparticipation rates. They impose this requirement, yet do not provide \nthe resources to help States reach this goal.\n  Talk about an unfunded mandate. If you do not get it done, if you do \nnot meet that requirement in Philadelphia--Philadelphia, with 500,000 \npeople--in a couple of years, and do not raise your participation \nrates, we penalize Pennsylvania.\n  That is an unfunded mandate--no resources to do it. My Lord, that is \nan incredible burden to place on these States and localities as we wash \nour hands entirely of it.\n  The proposal being offered by the distinguished Democratic leader \nsends, I think, a different message--not perfect, but certainly one we \nought to look at as a way to incorporate these ideas. It should not be \nmistaken for defense of the status quo. It is anything but. It ends \nunconditional receipt of assistance. It replaces the entitlement to \nbenefits with entitlement to employment services. It would cut off \nbenefits to anyone who refuses a job offer, and would require parents \nto sign a parent empowerment contract.\n  As the title suggests, the Work First plan makes work a reality for \npeople on welfare, and not just simply a promise.\n  Our alternative is built on a basic principle that work must be at \nthe center of real welfare reform. We would provide job training and \nchild care assistance to help welfare recipients find and keep jobs. We \nwould back it up with tough requirements and the resources, Mr. \nPresident, to make that a reality.\n  Under the work first bill, existing child care programs are \nconsolidated and dedicated to child care. The bill guarantees child \ncare for those required to work or prepared for work, ensuring that \nkids will not be left home alone.\n  The bill also provides 1 year of transitional assistance with options \nfor an extension for an additional year on a sliding scale basis.\n  In contrast, the Dole-Packwood bill acts as if the 4.3 million kids \non AFDC under the age of 6 and the 3.8 million on AFDC between ages 6 \nand 13 somehow do not exist.\n  Under the Republican proposal, we will have less money in child care \nthan we do today, less money before we put all of the welfare mothers \nto work and send them out the door, less money for these kids that have \nto be placed in some sort of a situation where they are safe.\n  In the Dole bill, the three major child care programs that serve \n640,000 children disappear. That is a fact, Mr. President. They \ndisappear, undermining the Federal-State partnership.\n  There is absolutely no requirement under the welfare reform proposal \nbeing proposed by Senators Dole and Packwood that States continue to \nuse the money that they previously dedicated to child care. You do not \nhave to do that any longer. You are off the hook. So the States do not \neven have to put a nickel into child care. In the earlier bill, they \ndid. They have now taken it out.\n  Existing State requirements are gone on child care. If States wanted \nto provide the same level of services as today, they could not, because \nthe money supply is simply not there. The level of funding is frozen to \n1994 levels, at the same time we expect many more mothers to go to \nwork.\n  According to numbers from the Department of Health and Human services \nagencies, an additional $6 billion for child care is needed over 5 \nyears, over the fiscal year 1994 levels included in the current Dole \ndraft, to make the Dole welfare reform plan work.\n  The only money dedicated to this critical component of welfare reform \nis \n\n[[Page S 12766]]\nthe money authorized by the Labor and Human Resources Committee earlier \nthis year for child care, for the child care and development block \ngrant. Mr. President, that serves a very small number of families.\n  As the author of that legislation, with my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, 5 years ago, I strongly support the program, Mr. \nPresident. But it is no substitute, frankly, for dedicated funds \nprotected from the budgetary whims of this and future Congresses.\n  Furthermore, the program was created, I point out, to help the \nworking poor, and is a mere fraction of what is needed. It is clear \nunder the Republican proposal the working poor are going to lose, and \nlose substantially, and middle-income taxpayers are going to watch \ntheir taxes go up at the local level.\n  The Dole bill even allows States to use the meager amounts that have \nbeen dedicated to child care for other welfare programs, so you can get \nrid of it altogether.\n  The majority leader modified his bill in August. He gave States the \noption to exclude parents with children under the age of 1 from the \nwork requirements. There is no provision, however, for other preschool \nand elementary-age children.\n  The bill does not provide adequate funds for child care, and at the \nsame time, it is going to penalize and sanction parents who cannot work \nbecause they do not have the child care or cannot afford it.\n  Mr. President, that is a no-win situation we are putting these \nparents in. It is just plain wrong. In my view, it will not work. As I \nread it, this welfare bill says it is OK to leave your children home \nalone. You will go to work, but you figure out how to deal with your \nchildren.\n  In case anyone thinks that there are enough Federal dollars in child \ncare under the current system, just look at what has happened. Thirty-\nsix States, Mr. President, and the District of Columbia have waiting \nlists for child care.\n  Listen to the numbers on waiting lists: In Texas, 35,000 children are \non a waiting list for child care. That is today, now. I am not talking \nabout after we pass this bill. Today, 35,000 are waiting. In Illinois, \n20,000 children are on a waiting list. In Alabama, 20,000 children are \nwaiting. In Florida, 20,000. In Georgia, 41,000.\n  Other States have chosen not to keep a list, but the problem is \npresent there, too.\n  Now, we are going to require more people to go to work while \nproviding less child care resources. With thousands of kids already on \nwaiting lists for child care slots, how is that possible?\n  Child care is not only a tremendous concern to those struggling to \nget off welfare. Talk to any middle-income family about child care. \nHave a conversation with a family that weekly, if not monthly, goes \nthrough the anxiety. They are out there working, single mothers trying \nto raise kids, or two-income earners.\n  If you want to get an earful, talk to them about child care and the \nproblems they have. I am not talking about welfare recipients or \nworking poor, but the average family that struggles every week with \nwhere they are going to place their kids. Is it safe? Will they be OK? \nHow much does it cost? Here we are, telling millions of people to go to \nwork with no accommodation, no accommodation for child care.\n  Mr. President, it is lunacy to think this is reform. It is dangerous. \nAs the Senator from New York has said, we will rue the day, we will rue \nthe day if we adopt this legislation without accommodating the kinds of \ninvestments that have to occur if this proposal is truly to work in the \ncoming years.\n  If we turn our back on this issue--and frankly, Mr. President, I say \nso with the highest degree of respect for the individuals who are the \nauthors of the bill--if we do that, we will create significant damage \nin this country. The damage will be similar to those created, as the \nSenator from New York described, to the deinstitutionalization of the \nmentally ill.\n  Welfare reform requires far more thought, Mr. President, far more \nthought. No compromise is a great political speech. But, it is not the \nway to address serious, complex, and profound social policy issues.\n  Mr. President, I hope in the coming days that we will develop a \nwillingness to sit down and work this out thoughtfully. I am hopeful \nthat the Daschle alternative will be adopted because it is.\n  But, if that is not the case, I will offer amendments with specific \noffsets to improve the Dole/Packwood bill. I will say they will come \nfrom corporate welfare, I let my colleagues know.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope common sense will prevail in these coming \ndays and that we will find, as we have historically on issues like \nthis, some common ground. The President has urged it. Others have here \nincluding the senator from New York. I think this no-compromise \napproach is unfortunate. It is not a sound way to legislate, certainly \nnot in an area that is as important as this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from New York [Mr. \nMoynihan] is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwould like to have a dialog with the Senator from Connecticut. But just \nbefore he does, may I say I brought to the floor a pen with which John \nF. Kennedy, on October 31, 1963, signed the Mental Retardation \nFacilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of \n1963.\n  The Senator from Connecticut recognizes those pens. This was the last \npublic bill signing of the Kennedy administration, and we set about \nemptying out our mental institutions. We said we were going to provide \nfor the children, the young people and the older persons who left. We \nwere going to provide community care. But we did not provide the \nwherewithal. We almost, for a while, forgot we had ever done it. It now \nseems to be lost with us entirely. We deal with the problem of the \nhomeless as if it had no antecedent in our decisions.\n  We are on the floor of the U.S. Senate making a vastly more important \ndecision. There were a million, almost a million persons in mental \ninstitutions when this bill was signed. There are about 100,000 today. \nThere are 14 million women and children on welfare--14 million. When \nthey end up on the streets, I hope somebody will remember that it was \nforetold.\n  I wonder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Connecticut. In fact, \nwith respect to the child care comments he made, I think there are some \nlegitimate points he does make. I find myself wondering whether we do \nneed to commit potentially more resources to provide for people who are \ngoing to be required to work so they can have the opportunity to have \nsome child care available to them.\n  I am hesitant, in fact reluctant, to be for an entitlement for child \ncare because I think that could be a slippery slope. I am not too sure \nwe want to provide an entitlement to child care for people who are on \nwelfare and have people who are working mothers, who need child care \njust as badly, have no entitlement. That, I think, creates a double \nstandard that may in fact encourage more people to get on welfare to \nget the child care benefit. So I do have some concerns about that.\n  But I think it is a legitimate issue to bring to the floor, to talk \nabout how we are going to have single mothers with children work and \nnot have the resources available for child care. I think that is an \nissue. I think the leader came to the floor before the recess and \nadmitted that that is an area we hope to do some work on.\n  We talk about bipartisanship. I think that may be an area where we \ncould find some common ground. I think, again, on this side, we are \ngoing to be stopping short of an entitlement in nature, but certainly \nto provide more day care slots and to provide more funding for people \nto have choices as to where to take day care, that is not beyond the \npale--at least from this Senator's perspective, that is not.\n  One of the things that concerned me, however, about his talk was at \nleast the inference, if not the direct assault, that somehow or another \nRepublicans are slashing welfare. I think we have to \n\n[[Page S 12767]]\nmake this very clear. What we are talking about here, on the Democratic \nbill and frankly on the Republican bill, is not slashing welfare.\n  I will give the numbers. Unfortunately, the numbers do not match, \nnecessarily, because the Democrats' calculation of what welfare is and \nthe Republicans' calculation is a little different. Welfare, from my \nperspective, is obviously not just AFDC, but it is AFDC and food stamps \nand child care and a whole lot of other programs. When you add all \nthose programs up, we come up with spending this year of roughly $170 \nbillion that we will spend on welfare programs.\n  On the Democratic side, they add in the earned-income tax credit and \nsome other social service programs, and they come up with a figure \ncloser to $190 billion. So we start at a different base. But let me \ngive what, under the Republican bill, we will spend 7 years from now \nand what we would spend 7 years from now if we did nothing.\n  If we did nothing, we would go from spending $170 billion on welfare \ntoday to, in 7 years, spending $302 billion on welfare. That is if we \ndid nothing. We would increase spending by $132 billion, a roughly 77 \npercent increase in spending on welfare in the next 7 years. That is if \nwe did nothing.\n  Now, what does this dramatic slashing, punishing, cruel, blaming-the-\npoor, Republican proposal do to welfare expenditures over the next 7 \nyears? We are not going to spend in the year 2002 $302 billion, that is \ncorrect. We will spend $289 billion. The increase will be, not 77 \npercent over the next 7 years, but 70 percent over the next 7 years.\n  I know you can say a lot of things about this program, but cruel \nslashing, cutting, when you are cutting 7 percent of the increase out \nof a program that is going to increase 77 percent over 7 years is \nhardly slashing. It is hardly leaving people out on the street.\n  Let us please stick to the facts. This is not a harsh bill. This is \nnot a cruel bill. This is not a bill that blames anybody. This is an \nhonest attempt to try to solve the problem. And, yes, at the same time \ntry to accomplish some savings--hopefully efficiencies, doing things \nbetter, getting more people off the rolls and back into productive \nsociety, which will save money in the process.\n  Just so you understand what the other side is going to do, under \ntheir numbers welfare spending is $190 billion today and will increase \nto $333 billion by the year 2002, an increase of $153 billion, a 75-\npercent increase.\n  So, $189--$190 billion to $333 billion. Again, the Republicans start \nat $170 billion and we go to $302 billion. But they use different \nnumbers. Under the Democratic proposal, their spending would increase \nfrom $190 billion today, not to $333 billion but to $330 billion. So, \ninstead of a 75-percent increase, you get a 74-percent increase.\n  I would not even call that an adjustment. That is not even--that does \nnot even touch the system. The Republican proposal was a modest \nreduction. This does not even meet the standard of reduction, hardly. \nAnd they are trying to put this up as changing welfare as we know it? \nReforming the system? Giving not only the recipient a different program \nbut the taxpayer a break in funding this system?\n  It does not stand up. Either way, their system does not stand up to \nreduce spending significantly and ours certainly cannot be accused of \nslashing and cutting. Ours is a responsible reduction from a very \ndramatic increase.\n  A couple of other points I wanted to make about the talk of the \nSenator from Connecticut. He said, as the Senator from Louisiana \ndiscussed yesterday and the Senator from New York discussed yesterday, \n``How are you going to pay for these programs? You do not have the \nresources. We cannot do it. The Governors won't be able to put these \nwork programs in place and there is no way for us to be able to fund \nthis program with the number of children and single mothers on this \nprogram.''\n  I would remind the Senator from Connecticut that the Republican \nGovernors Association strongly supports the Dole package, strongly \nsupports the block grant approach, strongly supports the idea that if \nyou give them just what they had this year in AFDC funding, and a \nlittle growth factor for the growth States which we have provided for \nin this bill, that they will be able to run this program, put people to \nwork, get people and turn the system from a maintenance system, a \ndependency system to a dynamic system that moves people out of poverty \nand do it for less money. For less money.\n  I will remind you that these Governors, the Republican Governors who \nsupport the Dole package represent 80 percent of the welfare recipients \nin this country. Eighty percent of the welfare recipients in this \ncountry are represented by Republican Governors, and they believe they \ncan do a better job with less money than what the Federal Government is \ndoing today.\n  So ask the people who are going to implement the program how they \nwill do it and they will tell you they can do it. In fact, they want to \ndo it.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Connecticut mentioned and \nfocused a lot of his introductory remarks on how we have to change this \ndependency system, and used the word ``dependency'' as it should be, as \na pejorative term. It is not a good thing. And then later in his talk \nhe talked about how cruel and horrible it was to cut people off after 5 \nyears with nothing. He said, ``We are going to cut them off and there \nwill not be any benefits.''\n  First off, that is not true. Children, moms with children, will \ncontinue to receive food stamps, will continue to receive Medicaid, \nwill continue to receive housing benefits that they do in any other \nsocial service. They will lose their cash assistance. Under the \nDemocrat bill, they lose their cash assistance also. The only \ndifference is they replace the cash assistance with a voucher in almost \nan equal amount--they have a slight reduction--a voucher for them to be \nable to go out and do basically what they did with the cash.\n  So in a sense it is not much of a penalty. But we say if you are \ngoing to end dependency, you cannot continue to keep people on the \nsystem and pay them virtually the same they are making now on the \nsystem. You have to end dependency by ending dependency. You cannot \ncontinue to provide for someone on the system and expect them to leave \nthe system.\n  I do not say that without the understanding that a lot of people \nleave the system. But a lot of people are trapped in the system because \nof the nature of the dependency of it in which the benefits continue.\n  So you cannot stand on the floor and say, ``We have to end \ndependency'' and say, ``We cannot cut them off.'' You cannot be for any \ndependency and not be for some termination of benefits at some point in \ntime when the social contract between the Government and the person the \nGovernment is attempting to help at some point ends, and the person has \nto do it on their own.\n  The other point that I cannot more strongly disagree with is the \nSenator from Connecticut repeatedly said, ``This is a national \nproblem.'' It is a national problem. As a Senator from Connecticut, he \ncares about the children in Philadelphia and he cares about the \nchildren in Colorado. The Presiding Officer is from Colorado. I care \nabout the children from Connecticut and the children from Arizona. I \njust do not believe that the Federal Government is the best person to \nhelp them.\n  Sure, it is a national problem. But I think what we have found in \ndecades of looking at what helps the poor in this country is the \nNational Government does not solve the problem. It is a national \nproblem that calls for a local solution. Sure, the Federal Government \nhas a role to play. We are going to continue. He says we are going to \nwash our hands of it. We are not going to wash our hands of this.\n  I will repeat the numbers to make sure the Senator from Connecticut \nunderstands. We are going to be spending $289 billion under the \nRepublican proposal in the year 2002, a 70-percent increase. The \ncommitment is there. But what we are suggesting in this bill, which is \nphilosophically different and fundamentally different from what the \nSenator from Connecticut and many on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve, is that we solve problems best when it deals with the poor by \nmaking it more personal and individual and local in nature; that \ncommunity organizations and individuals solve problems better in \ndealing with people who have troubles in their lives than a system that \nprocesses checks and papers and maintains people in poverty. \n\n[[Page S 12768]]\n\n  I think everyone here understands that this is a national problem, \nand that that is why we are having this debate. If this was not a \nnational problem, we would not be here debating it. Of course, it is a \nnational problem. But does that mean that the Federal Government has to \nsolve the problem here, has to have instant solutions here for \neverybody to be treated the same in America? Of course not. National \nproblems do not always require national solutions. They at many times \nrequire solutions to be done and ideas to be grown in the local \ncommunities or the individual who can help that person get out of \npoverty.\n  The Senator from Connecticut also talked about how two-thirds of the \npeople on welfare are children. That is a fact. It is very disquieting. \nHe talks about how cruel it is, that the Republican bill will in fact \nhurt children and target children for their harsh treatment. I will \njust remind the Senator that over the past 30 years we have tried a \ngreat experiment as a result of the Great Society programs of the \n1960's. We tried this experiment blindly, with absolutely no idea of \nwhether this program was going to work.\n  A lot of the criticism on the other side is we do not know whether \nturning this back to the States is going to work. We do not know it is \ngoing to work. Well, I would suggest to you back in 1965, 1966, or \n1967, in the years in which these programs were enacted in the early \n1970's, that a lot these programs were passed, and they had absolutely \nno idea whether they were going to work. But they thought that it was \nworth a try. In fact, I would say that a lot of the people who voted \nfor these programs did so with the best of intentions and with the \ngreatest of hopes that this in fact would work. But it has not. I think \nwe did answer that question.\n  Two-thirds of the people on welfare are children. But more of those \nchildren are born out of wedlock today than they were in 1965. In fact, \nif you go back to 1960, the out-of-wedlock birth rate in this country, \nthe illegitimacy rate in this country, was 5 percent. It is now 33 \npercent.\n  I think everyone will admit now, both sides of the aisle, both \nphilosophical perspectives will tell you that it is a harmful thing for \nour country. More of them are born out of wedlock. More of them are \nborn at low birth weights. More are born drug addicted, crack addicted. \nMore of them live in unsafe neighborhoods and die violent deaths. More \nof them have less opportunity. More of them have less educational \nopportunities and a chance for success. That is the system we have \ntoday.\n  I sometimes just become amazed that someone could stand up on the \nfloor and say that what we are doing is cruel when the system today is \nas cruel as we have ever seen in the history of this country. What we \nare suggesting is not cruel or harsh. What we are trying to do is \nchange a system that is surrounded or built on the difficulty of \nmaintaining people in poverty.\n  I cannot stress this point enough: No one who receives welfare \nbenefits as their sole source of income gets rich. You do not get rich \non welfare. You maintain people. That is what the system does. That is \nwhat it is built to do--to maintain people at a level of survival.\n  It is not a system that you go into with the expectation--people who \nhave never been in the business when they think of welfare do not think \nthere is a system that people go into and they are transformed into \nproductive, working citizens. That is what welfare does in this \ncountry. Nobody believes that. Nobody thinks of welfare as the system \nthat changes people's lives for the better. They think of welfare as \nthe safety net where people get caught in it.\n  We have to change that. That is what this bill does. It fundamentally \nchanges the whole perception of what welfare is all about. The whole \nexpectation of someone who now gets onto welfare is not how many are \ngoing to be provided for whatever the length of time in poverty.\n But how will I be helped to get back on my feet to get out of poverty. \nThat we will change the system from one of maintenance and dependency \nto dynamic renewal, that is the challenge. And what many of us believe \nis that that is the challenge best met by people who care most about \nthe people involved in the system. And, yes, the Senator from \nConnecticut cares about the children in Philadelphia. He probably cares \nabout my children. I will never forget the Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm, who suggested that on a talk show a couple of years ago. Ira \nMagaziner was on talking about health care, and Magaziner was saying, \n``I care about your children as much as you do, Senator.'' And Senator \nGramm shot back, ``Then tell me their names.''\n\n  Yes, I care about children in Philadelphia and Hartford and Bismarck \nand Fargo. I care about them. But that does not mean I am the best \nperson to help them. The people in Fargo know better how to solve this \nproblem and how to deal with this person, to sit across the table from \nthem and say: What can I do to help you get back on your feet and \ngoing? Not with the eyeshade down, hand out the check and process the \nnext number.\n  That is the fundamental difference we are debating here today. It is \na difference between holding on to the past and moving to the future.\n  It is a great opportunity, it is a great opportunity we have before \nus to make this system something that we can be proud of, that we can \nlook and see experimentation across the country.\n  In the Republican bill, we allow nonprofit organizations to get \ninvolved and be the welfare agency for that community. I know there are \nmany communities--the Senator from Connecticut mentioned Philadelphia \non many occasions. I have been to north Philadelphia and west \nPhiladelphia, and the only thing left, the only thing left in these \nneighborhoods--there are no jobs left in these neighborhoods, nothing \nof an institutional setting except the church. Why not let the people \nwho care most about these folks, why not let the churches get involved \nin providing welfare services.\n  Oh, I know we get real nervous about church and state, but, folks, I \nwant to solve the problem. I want to help people. And I know many \npastors--many pastors--who would absolutely be the best people to work \nin those communities. Sure, they would have oversight, there would be \nFederal oversight or State oversight, but the people working with the \nfolks in the community would be people who know, people who care about \nthem, people who the folks who end up on welfare trust, know that they \ncare about themselves and their families.\n  This is different. We are not walking away. We are facilitating a \ndifferent approach. It is one that I know will work, I know will work \nbecause it has worked in the past and I think it will work better \nbecause the Federal Government will provide a lot of the needed \nresources that in fact were not there in the past.\n  We stand at a very important moment, as we vote on this substitute \nlater today, whether we are going to continue to try to micromanage and \nhave solutions based out of Washington to run welfare or whether we are \ngoing to turn away from that approach that we know does not work and \nmove to something different, exciting, dynamic, that is going to help \nmillions of people leave welfare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague from \nPennsylvania and found that I agree with much of what he says in terms \nof where the decisions might be made, but I disagree with him in terms \nof his characterization of the divide that exists in this debate. I do \nnot really think it is a question of where should the decision be made.\n  In my own welfare proposal that I made before the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I left it entirely up to the States. Let the States decide \nwhat the makeup of the program should be. Let the States decide what \nthe eligibility should be. Let the States decide what the time periods \nare. Let the States decide what the sanctions are.\n  That was not the divide in the debate. The fundamental difference in \nthe debate was, should there be a continuation of an automatic \nstabilizer, a mechanism that allows the State to be assisted by the \nFederal Government if there is a circumstance in which State resources \nare overwhelmed.\n  Mr. President, if there is a flood in Mississippi, if there is a \ndrought in \n\n[[Page S 12769]]\nNorth Dakota, if there is an earthquake in California, if there is an \neconomic collapse in Pennsylvania, some of us believe just as fervently \nas does the Senator from Pennsylvania that the Federal Government has \nan obligation to make certain the kids in that State do not wind up on \nthe street.\n  I remember being in the State of California, going down the street in \nSan Francisco, in one of the most affluent neighborhoods of that \nbeautiful city, and encountering a young mother with two children \nsitting on the curb with a sign that said, ``I'm homeless. Please help \nme.'' I inquired of the woman, who was dressed as a middle-class person \nand her children were well groomed, ``How did you wind up on the \nstreets of San Francisco?'' And she said to me, ``My husband left \nwithout notice, abandoned the family. I could not make the house \npayment. I was just evicted yesterday.'' And here sat this young woman, \na lovely young woman, with two little kids on the street in San \nFrancisco, CA, begging for money to feed her children.\n  If, God forbid, we are in a circumstance in which California suffers \na whole other series of economic calamities or, closer to home, my home \nState suffers through another devastating drought as we did in 1988 and \n1989, there comes a time when a flat level of funding from the Federal \nGovernment does not do the job, does not protect people who I think \neveryone in this Chamber would want to see protected.\n  The fundamental debate here is are we going to preserve an automatic \nstabilizer that says to individual States if they suffer an economic \ncollapse or some other calamity, that it will not just be a flat \nfunding from the Federal Government and strained State resources that \nare ready to meet the challenge but this country stands together \nunited. That is why we are the United States of America. Over and over, \nwe have seen this country respond to tragedy. Whether it was the \nbombing in Oklahoma, the earthquakes in California, or the drought in \nmy State, we stood together as one nation under God, indivisible, and \nwe came to help out, to make certain that a young mother with two \nlittle kids was not on the street because the husband deserted the \nfamily and the house payment was not made.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, if the American people agree on one \nthing, it is that the current welfare system is broken. Make no mistake \nabout it. Both sides are offering dramatic changes with respect to how \nwe deal with welfare in America.\n  The current system is one that nobody respects. The taxpayers do not \nrespect it. Those who are caught in the welfare system do not respect \nit. The current system does not emphasize work. It contains perverse \nincentives that actually break up low-income families. It allows \nparents to abdicate responsibility for raising their children. It \nallows fathers to escape their child support obligations. And it \nsubjects 9.5 million children and 4 million mothers to a future of \nhardship and failure. That is why on both sides of the aisle there is a \nfundamental commitment to reforming our welfare system and rebuilding \nit from the ground up.\n  Mr. President, in January I began to develop my own alternative \nwelfare reform legislation. I called it the Work And Gainful Employment \nAct. I hoped it would foster a bipartisan dialog on welfare. The WAGE \nAct was the first Senate proposal to completely reform our welfare \nsystem while maintaining an economic safety net for States and \nchildren.\n  It represented a substantial departure from the past. And I am proud \nthat many of the concepts included in the WAGE Act are now in the Work \nFirst proposal offered on our side. Under the WAGE Act States receive \nunprecedented flexibility to experiment. They can develop the methods \nfor moving welfare recipients to work. They have complete flexibility \nto design employment programs, determine eligibility criteria, develop \nsanctions, and determine the support that individuals receive. States \nmay establish time limits of any duration, but those limits only apply \nto participants who refuse to work.\n  The WAGE Act eliminates the unconditional entitlement of AFDC, but \nunlike the blank check block grant approach in the Republican bill, it \ndoes not abdicate Federal responsibility. Instead, my bill replaces \nAFDC with a new transitional aid program. Under that program, welfare \nrecipients must work in order to receive benefits. The WAGE Act also \ncreates a block grant to fund child care work activities and includes \nthe resources to put people to work. The only part of the current \nsystem that is maintained by my plan is the safety net for States and \nchildren. That is where we have a fundamental difference and divide \nbetween the two sides. My plan assures that as poverty and population \nincrease, as recessions occur, and as natural disasters confront our \nStates, the Nation will not abandon Americans in need.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed in the partisan nature of the \nwelfare debate to this point. I very much hoped that we would approach \nwelfare on a bipartisan basis. In fact, Senator Chafee and I authored \none of the few bipartisan welfare-related proposals, the Children's SSI \nEligibility Reform Act, which I incorporated into the WAGE Act that I \noffered earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, I listened to the majority leader on the floor in \nAugust when Senator Kennedy questioned him about the lack of resources \nfor child care in the Republican bill. The majority leader said he was \naware of the problem. He said he was discussing possible solutions \nwithin his caucus. Mr. President, I would say to the majority leader, \nthis problem should come as no surprise.\n  When the Finance Committee debated welfare, I asked the Congressional \nBudget Office whether the Republican proposal had sufficient resources \nto meet its work requirements. It was a very important point, Mr. \nPresident and my colleagues. The Congressional Budget Office looked at \nthe Republican plan and told us in open hearing that 44 of the 50 \nStates of these United States would have no work requirement under the \nRepublican plan, a plan that puts itself forward as work oriented, \ntough on work. If the Congressional Budget Office said in testimony \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee that 44 of the 50 States under the \nRepublican plan will have no work requirement, that is not tough on \nwork. That is not insisting that people go to work. That is no work \nrequirement at all in 44 of the 50 States, because the States would be \nbetter off taking the penalty than actually having the funds necessary \nto require people to go to work.\n  Mr. President, that is a fundamental difference between what the \nRepublicans hold out as a work-oriented bill and the Work First \nproposal advanced by this side, a proposal that has sufficient funding \nto deliver on the promise of moving people from welfare to work. And \nthat ought to be the first test of any bill. No serious effort to \nreform welfare can succeed without child care.\n  Shortly before I offered my WAGE Act, Governors Carper, Carnahan, and \nCaperton wrote me in support of my bill. In their letter the Governors \ndescribe the elements needed for serious welfare reform. The Governors \nsaid in part:\n\n       The litmus test for any real reform is whether or not it \n     adequately answers the following three questions:\n       First, does it prepare welfare recipients for work?\n       Second, does it help welfare recipients find a job?\n       Third, does it enable welfare recipients to maintain a job?\n\n  The Governors went on to say, and I quote:\n\n       Your bill meets this test because it provides assistance to \n     prepare individuals for work, to help individuals find and \n     keep jobs, and to ensure that work pays more than welfare.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Your bill appropriately recognizes the critical link of \n     child care in enabling welfare recipients to work and \n     emphasizes that both parents have a responsibility to their \n     children with the inclusion of measures to increase paternity \n     establishments, child support collections, and interstate \n     cooperation of child support enforcement.\n\n  Mr. President, while the WAGE Act and Work First Act both recognize \nthe critical child-care link, the Dole bill gets a failing grade. Not \nonly does it fail to provide child care, but it kicks children off of \nwelfare roles if their parents are unable to work because child care is \nunavailable. That makes no sense. It is unconscionable to subject \nchildren to a time limit regardless \n\n[[Page S 12770]]\nof whether their parents receive the child care they need to become \nemployed.\n  That is a catch-22 for the kids. But the Dole bill does precisely \nthat. Mr. President, not only does the Dole bill include insufficient \nresources for child care and job training--and that is not my estimate, \nthat is the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office telling us that that \nis a fact--it amounts to a $16.7 billion unfunded mandate to the \nStates.\n  We have heard a lot of talk around here about how bad it is to have \nan unfunded mandate for the States. But that is exactly what the Dole \nbill represents, a huge unfunded mandate to the States. It calls for \nmore welfare recipients to go to work, but it does not provide the \nmoney or the resources to make that happen. It calls for child care to \nbe provided, but insufficient resources are made available.\n  Mr. President, the Republican plan is from the land of make believe. \nYou say it and it is true. We are going to move people to work. But the \nresources are not provided to make that happen, so it is all a hoax. It \nis just words. And, again, that is not my analysis. That is the \nCongressional Budget Office telling us 44 of the 50 States will not \nhave a work requirement under this proposal. There has been plenty of \ntime since the Finance Committee met to get this bill right. But, \nfrankly, no serious effort has been made.\n  Now, I want this debate to be bipartisan. The American people want it \nto be bipartisan. They do not care whether the solution has a \nDemocratic or Republican label. They just want the problem fixed. But \nthey want real reform, not false promises, not just words, not just \nrhetoric. They want the reality of changing this system.\n  Mr. President, when I set out to develop a welfare reform proposal, I \nstarted with four principles. One, emphasize work; two, protect \nchildren; three, provide flexibility to the States; and four, \nstrengthen families.\n  Mr. President, a reformed welfare system should require people to \nwork in order to receive assistance. This is where those of us on both \nsides of the aisle, I think, are in agreement. I believe there is a \nconsensus that if people are going to get something, they ought to \nwork. If a reformed welfare system does that and enables States to \nexperiment, helps keep families together, then the American people will \nhave a system worth respecting.\n  The proposal I developed meets those tests. The Work First proposal, \nthat I am proud to cosponsor with the Democratic leader, does as well. \nBut the Republican bill does not.\n  Mr. President, both my proposal and Senator Daschle's put work first. \nThey take action where the Republican proposal makes promises. Unlike \nthe Dole and Gramm proposals, they provide the resources necessary to \nmake work a reality.\n And Work First protects children; the Republican plan does not.\n\n  Mr. President, while Work First provides States with unprecedented \nflexibility to develop welfare programs, it also requires States to \nmatch Federal contributions so they do not get a free ride. The \nRepublican plan does not.\n  We all agree that State flexibility is important, but there is an \nenormous difference between a flexible program and a blank check. The \nDole block grant program is a blank check. It divorces who spends the \nmoney from who raises the money, and that is a profoundly misguided \nprinciple. We ought not to separate the responsibility of raising money \nfrom the responsibility of spending that money.\n  There are some similarities between the Democratic and Republican \nproposals. Both are significant departures from the status quo. They \nare departures from a system that focuses too much on writing checks \nand too little on promoting work and self-sufficiency. Both junk overly \nprescriptive Federal regulations, and both provide significant \nflexibility for States. But the shortcomings of the Republican proposal \nare a lost opportunity. Without significant changes now, the Republican \nproposal will undoubtedly require substantial future revisions by the \nCongress, and those revisions will come after the Republican plan has \nirreversibly harmed millions of vulnerable children and wreaked havoc \non State economies.\n  Let me highlight a few of the most significant shortcomings in the \nRepublican proposal and how our approach differs.\n  First, the work requirements in the Dole proposal are hollow. The \nRepublican plan provides essentially flat funding for States while \ncalling for an increased effort at putting people to work. Work First, \non the other hand, makes a serious effort to provide the necessary \nresources to put people to work. It uses savings from the welfare \nsystem to put welfare recipients to work and includes the resources \nnecessary to fund work programs.\n  I do not disagree with the goal of the Republican proposal, but it \nsimply does not add up. If we are going to make an honest effort to put \npeople to work, we should remember the words of responsible \ncommentators like the Republican Governor from Wisconsin, Tommy \nThompson, when he testified before the Finance Committee. Governor \nThompson reminded all of us that it takes an upfront investment to have \na work requirement. Senator Moynihan recalls that, no doubt. We need to \nprovide resources for child care and job training if we are going to \nhave a serious work requirement.\n  Second, the Republican plan eliminates the safety net for children \nand the automatic stabilization mechanism for States. Whatever the \nfaults of the current welfare system, and they are many, it does \nautomatically adjust for changing needs.\n  I am going to conclude soon, because I have colleagues waiting to \nspeak. Under the Republican plan, States are left to face crises on \ntheir own. Whether faced with a drought in North Dakota, a flood in \nMississippi, an earthquake in California, or an economic downturn in \nPennsylvania, the Federal Government ought to help stabilize State \neconomies. The Work First plan continues the Federal Government's \nresponsibility; the Dole plan does not.\n  The Republican bill includes a so-called rainy day loan fund. But the \nfunding is simply not sufficient to confront the magnitude of economic \nimpacts that occur during State recessions or disasters. Even New \nJersey's Republican Governor has said the rainy day fund in Senator \nDole's bill won't get the job done.\n  The genius of a national approach to automatically assisting \nindividual States that experience recessions, large population \nincreases, high unemployment, increases in poverty or natural \ndisasters, is that we all support each other in times of need. Part of \nwhat binds us as a nation is our sense of mutual obligation and common \npurpose. Our entire Nation watched as California struggled to overcome \nthe devastation from the L.A. earthquake. The same was true after \nHurricane Andrew and the Oklahoma bombing. And whenever one State is in \nrecession, we provide an influx of national resources through \nunemployment insurance and other Federal programs.\n  The current funding structure automatically adjusts to State need. It \naccomplishes automatically what any nation should guarantee to its \ncitizens--they will not be abandoned in their time of greatest need. \nBut under the Republican proposal, States would have to borrow the \nmoney and pay it back while they still may be in the midst of a \nrecession or other economic emergency. The Dole bill's rainy day fund \nis clearly a second-best approach.\n  Third, Mr. President, the Republican bill makes a hollow commitment \nto ensure that teen mothers will receive the adult supervision they \nneed to improve their lives and the futures of their children.\n  In the Finance Committee, I offered an amendment that would have \nrequired all teen mothers to live with their parents, some other \nresponsible adult, or in an adult supervised setting like a second \nchance home. To my surprise, that amendment failed on a tie 10-10 vote. \nI would have expected overwhelming support for such a provision. But \nevery Republican on the committee except for Senator Nickles opposed \nthe amendment.\n  Now the Republican bill includes the adult supervision requirement \nand another provision I have been advocating for some time--a \nrequirement that minor parents stay in school. But again, the rhetoric \nand reality are two different things. First, the requirements are a \nfacade because the bill provides no resources. Without sufficient \nresources, infants and their young mothers who have no place to go will \n\n\n[[Page S 12771]]\nsimply be denied needed assistance. Second, the Republican plan fails \nto guarantee that adult supervised living environments will be \navailable to young mothers as an alternative to living in an abusive \nhousehold. To be serious, any requirement that teenage parents live \nwith a parent or other responsible adult must provide alternatives when \nno such adult is available. Therefore, I plan to offer an amendment \nthat will provide Federal resources for second chance homes. Second \nchance homes are adult supervised living arrangements that provide the \ntraining, child care, counseling, and other resources that teenage \nparents need to learn how to care for their children. And they work.\n  When the Finance Committee held its hearings on welfare reform, \nSister Mary Rose McGeady from Covenant House gave the most compelling \ntestimony we heard. She told us that Covenant House works. Covenant \nHouse takes in teenage parents and helps them build a future for \nthemselves and their children. She also told us that Covenant House has \nbeen extremely successful in preventing second pregnancies among the \ngirls it serves.\n  We know that 42 percent of welfare recipients gave birth as teens. \nAnd we also know that the younger a girl is when she gives birth, the \nmore likely she will become a long-term welfare recipient. But Covenant \nHouse and other second chance homes increase the chance that these \nmothers will break out of the welfare failure chain.\n  We should not penalize the children of teenage mothers simply because \nof the circumstances into which they were born. Nor should we allow \ntheir mothers the option of getting a benefit check that is a ticket to \ntheir own apartment. Rather, teenage mothers should have to finish \nschool and learn how to take care of themselves and their children. \nThey should learn the kind of responsibility that will not only improve \ntheir lives, but the future prospects of their children. That will only \nhappen it States receive the resources necessary to make second chance \nhomes a reality.\n  The U.S. Catholic Conference, the National Council of Churches, \nCatholic Charities U.S.A., and many others agree with me that second \nchance homes should be included in reform. We are all concerned about \nthe need for strong welfare reform that discourages out-of-wedlock \npregnancies. I hope my Republican colleagues will work with me to make \nsecond chance homes a reality.\n  But while I see enormous potential for Republicans and Democrats to \nwork together on many aspects of welfare reform, there is one \nsignificant problem. The sponsors of welfare reform on the Republican \nside have shown complete unwillingness to move from their block grant \napproach. They argue that block grants are the only way to provide \nState flexibility. But, Mr. President, that's simply not true. Both the \nWAGE Act and Work First provide States with unprecedented flexibility \nwithout dumping welfare completely on the backs of State and local \ntaxpayers.\n  The block grant in the Republican bill is the height of \nirresponsibility. History will prove that fact. We must all recognize \nthat the need for a nationwide safety net has nothing to do with \nwhether Governors or Members of Congress care more about children. \nObviously, we all care deeply about our children.\n  But ending our Nation's safety net for children is extremely \ndangerous. Neither Governors nor Members of Congress can prevent the \nuncertainties that come from the business cycle, recessions, population \nshifts between States and natural disasters. If we abolish a safety net \nfor children, the security of our Nation's children will be left to \nchance, depending solely on where a child lives. It is inconsistent at \nbest for those who preach about morality and family values to support a \nplan that undermines those values.\n  The Work First plan strikes the right balance. It prohibits any \nunconditional entitlement to welfare benefits. Instead, it requires \npeople to work in return for welfare. While it includes a few basic \nrequirements for States, it also provides States with significant \nflexibility. It wipes out the 45 State plan requirements that are \ncurrently in AFDC. Work First replaces the old requirements with only a \nfew categories. It provides States with the flexibility to design \nemployment programs; provide incentives to case managers for successful \njob placements and retention among the welfare population; determine \nprogram eligibility; and establish a number of other policies under the \nState work program.\n  The last time the Senate acted on welfare reform, we passed a \nbipartisan bill with 96 votes. There are many aspects of welfare reform \non which Republicans and Democrats can agree. But I am disappointed in \nthe block-grants-or-bust approach being taken by the Republican \nmajority. There are responsible and innovative ways to address this \nissue without the second-best pure block grant approach.\n  I developed the WAGE bill in order to demonstrate that there is, \nindeed, a better way to reform welfare. The Work First Act closely \nparallels my approach. I sincerely hope that my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues alike will support Work First. Work First scraps \na system that is broken. It uses the best ideas to build an effective \nwelfare system that will move people into work and keep families \ntogether. And it allows States the freedom to try new ideas. I strongly \nbelieve that Work First offers the best possibility for bipartisan \nwelfare reform this year.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, who has been a visionary on this question for longer than \nmost people have been aware that it was a critical problem facing this \ncountry. I can remember so well 30 years ago when my colleague from New \nYork warned this Nation of what was to come, and he has been precisely \ncorrect in what he predicted.\n  There is no other Member of this Chamber, there is no other academic \nin American society, there is no other expert who predicted with such \naccuracy and such vision what would occur in this country. No one has \nmatched the predictive power of the Senator from New York, and I think \nhis views are owed special deference because he is the only one here \nwho has a track record of accurately predicting what would happen in 30 \nyears. It is truly remarkable the vision that he has had with respect \nto this issue, and I have listened to and learned from my colleague \nfrom New York. I hope other colleagues, before this debate is \nconcluded, will listen and learn from this very wise man.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee and my friend from North Dakota for his very generous \nremarks. May I make the point that it was he who asked in the Finance \nCommittee, how are you going to provide for the job training provisions \nin the majority measure, and the CBO simply said, ``You can't.''\n  It was a clear and concise statement of what we are up against and \nwhat we are going to do to ourselves if we do not come to our senses.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I see my friend from Minnesota is here.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, every sports fan in America celebrated \nalong with Baltimore's Cal Ripken last night; when he played in his \n2,131 consecutive game and broke a baseball record most thought could \nnever be toppled.\n  That is an impressive feat; even more impressive when you consider \nthat ``The Streak'' represents more than 13 years of dedication, \nsacrifice, and plenty of hard work.\n  There is another consecutive streak you should know about, one that \nhas not received nearly the attention that Cal Ripken's has, but one \nthat affects a lot more people, and imposes an enormous cost on the \nAmerican taxpayers. Worst of all, this streak has gone on unchecked for \nmore than 30 years.\n  Since the Great Society programs of the 1960's--for three long \ndecades--taxpayers have suffered through a consecutive Federal spending \nstreak that has taken more than 5 trillion of their tax dollars and \nsiphoned them off to fund a welfare system that, frankly, has done more \nharm than good.\n  Mr. President, I hope Cal Ripken's streak goes on forever, but the \nuncontrolled welfare spending streak must \n\n[[Page S 12772]]\ncome to an end, and it is up to us to stop it. I rise today to remind \nmy colleagues of a simple truth, and that is, the people are demanding \nthat this Congress take responsibility for our broken welfare system \nand fix it.\n  Last year, when I was running for the Senate, I listened to \nMinnesotans as we sat down together in their coffee shops and truck \nstops, in their businesses and in their homes.\n  They asked me over and over again: ``What are you going to do about \nwelfare?''\n  I told them we were going to fix it, and many of my colleagues made \nthe same promise.\n  As you know, we just returned from a 3-week recess, and like many \nothers, I had the opportunity to spend that time traveling my State, \nmeeting with people once again and again listening to their concerns.\n  But the question this time was not ``What are you going to do about \nwelfare?'' The question now was ``What are you doing about it?''\n  The people are expecting solutions, not delays, not the attempts we \nare seeing to derail this critically important legislation.\n  For three decades, it has been the taxpayers who have paid the price \nfor a welfare system that does little but encourage dependency and \nillegitimacy.\n  For three decades, the taxpayers have continually turned over their \nhard-earned dollars to individuals instead of bettering their own \nfamilies and helping secure their own futures. The taxpayers have been \nsubsidizing hopelessness and despair.\n  Congress has attempted to repair this mess before. The last major \neffort was in 1988, with the passage of the Family Support Act. On the \nday that conference report was passed in the House, my good friend, \nBill Archer, now chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, went to the \nfloor with a warning.\n  He said:\n\n       My criteria for welfare reform are that after 5 years of \n     implementation we should be able to say to the taxpayers of \n     this country that we have been able to encourage and to \n     remove welfare recipients from the rolls so that it results \n     in a program which has fewer welfare recipients than would \n     occur under the current law. We should be able to say to the \n     working people of this country that the cost of this program \n     will result, after 5 years, in reduced taxes necessary to pay \n     for welfare. This bill fails on both accounts.\n\n  Mr. President, he could not have been more right, and we should have \nlistened.\n  Today, 7 years later, we have 1.3 million more families on the AFDC \nrolls than we had back in 1988. Seven years later, the working people \nof America are paying more taxes than they have ever paid before--4.5 \npercent more than they paid in 1988. We cannot continue to think that \nwe will solve the welfare problem by throwing more precious taxpayer \ndollars at it, hoping that they will do some good. And, at last, I \nthink we have a Congress that understands.\n  Instead of encouraging the status quo, the Republican welfare reform \nlegislation offers welfare families a future. It offers hope. Yes, it \ndoes ask something in return from those who benefit from it. But what \nit gives back is something infinitely more valuable: self-esteem, a \nsense of accomplishment, and a chance to create a better life for \nthemselves and their children.\n  The first step in creating that better life does not require anything \nmore than a commitment. In breaking that long-held baseball record last \nnight, Cal Ripken reminded us all that a person does not necessarily \nneed to be the strongest, or the fastest, or the biggest player on the \nteam to make a lasting contribution. Sometimes those with the most to \ngive are simply the folks who show up every day, ready to work, eager \nto make a contribution.\n  Taxpayers do that. They show up for work every day, put in 40-plus \nhours a week for their hard earned money. They make a contribution.\n  With our legislation, we are encouraging welfare recipients to step \nup to the plate and take their turn at bat, to start lifting \nthemselves, with our help, toward something better. We are not \nexpecting home runs, but we will expect them to show up at the \nballpark, ready to contribute. If we can accomplish that, then we \ncannot help but succeed.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to get serious about moving this \nlegislation forward. I have heard about the terms of bipartisan support \nand a bipartisan effort. I hope that is what we can come down to as we \ngo on with this debate, that we do come to a consensus that this is a \nbipartisan effort. I heard my colleague from North Dakota say we are \nnot going to get everything he wants or everything I want, but \nhopefully we can come together with a plan that does meet the needs, \nobligations, and the responsibilities to our taxpayers. And they expect \nnothing less. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I congratulate the Senator from \nMinnesota not only for the substance of his remarks but for the elegant \nway in which last night's events in Baltimore were used as a metaphor \nfor what it was about. Having in my youth watched Lou Gehrig at the \nYankee Stadium, I had a certain ambivalence about it, but nothing like \nupward and onward.\n  I will just say that regarding the substance of what is hoped for in \nwelfare, there is a consensus, surprisingly, and it commences with the \n1988 legislation, which redefines a widow's pension as a reality of \nthis time. There is no agreement on how you finance--pay for--what \nneeds doing.\n  Yet, the Senator from Minnesota spoke very properly about the \nprospect of consensus and bipartisanship, and I hope we may yet find \nthat. We have done it in the past; why not in the future?\n  None speaks more ably and with more of a record in this regard than \nthe Senator from Illinois. I see that he has risen. I believe he would \nlike to address the Senate in this matter. I ask him how long he would \nlike?\n  Mr. SIMON. Five minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In 5 minutes, the Senator from Illinois can say more \nthan most of us do in 50. I am happy to yield him the time.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator from New York. I wish he were accurate \nin that.\n  We all want welfare reform. I heard the Presiding Officer at a \ncommittee meeting this morning talk about the need for that. I do \nregret that we do not have more of a bipartisan effort, not only on \nthis but on a lot of things. This has happened gradually over a period \nof years on the Hill, and I think it has not been a healthy thing. So \nwhen the Senator from Minnesota makes his comments about the need for \nworking together, I agree. I heard Senator Ted Stevens make similar \ncomments yesterday morning, and Senator Byrd has made some comments \nalong that line.\n  Real candidly, the principal bill that we have, without the \namendment, does not deal with the problem of poverty, does not deal \nwith the problem of jobs. Whether you have a Democratic Senate or a \nRepublican Senate, whether you have a Democratic President or a \nRepublican President, one thing is not going to change, one trend line: \nthe demand for unskilled labor is going down. Most of those on welfare \nare people who do not have skills. And so to have real welfare reform, \nwe really have to be talking about jobs, ultimately. But, in the \nmeantime, we cannot let people fall through the cracks.\n  I heard what our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, said \nabout Senator Moynihan. Senator Moynihan knows more about welfare than \nall of the rest of this body put together--meaning no disrespect to my \ncolleagues here from Arizona and Minnesota, and anywhere else. But the \nreality is that we have, as a Nation, said we are committed to having a \nsafety net for people. This bill, unamended, takes out the safety net. \nThat is the reality. The State maintenance effort that is now required \nwill die. If Arizona wants to do nothing, Arizona can do nothing. And \nif Illinois wants to do nothing, Illinois can do nothing.\n  Let me add one other point. The Dole bill takes a bill that emerged \nfrom the Labor and Human Resources Committee, dealing with job training \nand a number of other things like that, and just drops it wholesale in \nhere--a bill that I think most of us on the committee know needs to be \nrefined. For example, the Job Corps is just decimated. Now, the Job \nCorps needs to be improved. But 79 percent of the people in the Job \nCorps are high school dropouts. This is not a Sunday school class we \nare picking up and saying we want to help you along; these are people \nwho are on the fringes, and the Job Corps \n\n[[Page S 12773]]\nhas been a remarkably successful enterprise.\n  I will have an amendment, Mr. President, that is identical to a bill \nthat Senator Boren and Senator Reid and Senator Wofford and I \nintroduced last year, which will call for an experiment--basically, a \nWPA type of program in four locations, to be picked by the Secretary of \nLabor, in which we will say that you can be on welfare 5 weeks--not 5 \nyears, not 2 years, but 5 weeks--and you have to work 4 days a week at \nthe minimum wage. The fifth day you have to be out trying to find a job \nin the private sector. We will give you $535 a month--not much money, \nbut at least something. I do not recall the average in Arizona, but the \naverage welfare payment per family in Illinois is $367. And then \nprojects would be picked by local citizens, and these people will work \non the projects, as we did in the old WPA.\n  Screen people as they come in. If they cannot read and write, get \nthem into a program. If they have no marketable skill, then get them to \na community college.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SIMON. Could I have 1 minute?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from Illinois can have as much time as he \ndesires because he has so much to say and says it so well.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from New York. I intend now to speak \nfor 2 or 3 hours, but I shall not.\n  One other great advantage of the WPA-type of program that I will \noffer in this amendment is we do not restrict it to one person in a \nhousehold. One of the things that we have done through our welfare \npolicies is discourage families from sticking together.\n  If you can have two people earning an income on a WPA-type of \nproject, then, frankly, they would have a chance of not living in \nluxury, but there would be the economic incentive for families to stick \ntogether rather than families to separate.\n  I certainly am going to support the amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle and Senator Moynihan. I hope we do not do real harm to this \ncountry in the name of welfare reform. Everything that is under a label \n``welfare reform'' is not real good for this country. We have to \nrecognize that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see the able and learned Senator from \nCalifornia has risen. She has asked if she might have 12 minutes. She \nmost certainly can, and I look forward to hearing from her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you very much, \nSenator Moynihan, not only for the time but for your extraordinary \nleadership, your vision.\n  I think it should send a chill through this body, whether we are \nDemocrats or Republicans, men or women, moms, dads, single people, \ngrandmothers, or grandfathers, when you discussed very clearly the \nresults of the Republican plan: if it passes and is signed into law, it \nwill undoubtedly mean children in deep despair, and in deep poverty. \nYour image of children sleeping on grates across this Nation is one \nwhich I take very seriously.\n  There are few in this Congress and few in this country and I could \neven say, in my opinion, there are none, who have been so correct in \ntheir analysis of what is happening to the poor in this Nation. We have \nmade many mistakes, the Senator from Minnesota is correct, as we have \ntried to deal with this very intractable problem. I hope we would not \nreplace some of those mistakes with even deeper mistakes. I, therefore, \napplaud the call for bipartisanship as we deal with this issue.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that we are talking \nhere about the Nation's children. If you look at my home State of \nCalifornia, approximately 70 percent of California AFDC recipients--\nthat is, those who are on welfare--are children. Let me repeat: in my \nhome State of California, 70 percent of those on welfare are children. \nChildren who were born into a circumstance not of their own making at \nall--just their circumstance.\n  What we do here will impact them greatly. In many ways, we are their \nprotectors, Mr. President. We are their protectors. I hope we will not \nabandon them.\n  As I listened to the Senator from New York, my leader on this issue, \nI say that he has issued a warning that if the Dole bill passes \nunamended, in fact we will be doing just that. We will be saying that \nregardless of our statements in all of our campaigns--that children are \nthe most important thing, that children are our future--that without \nour children getting a break, the country will go backwards. In fact we \nwill be walking away from the future. We would be walking away from our \nresponsibility.\n  Many know I have had the great joy of becoming a grandmother for the \nfirst time. As I looked at that little child and saw all the love that \nhe gets on a daily basis, I know how pleased he is. We can never \nguarantee anyone that they will have that much love in their life.\n  But, my goodness, we have to give the basic guarantee to these \ninnocents, to these babies, that they will not be left out in the cold. \nAt least that, Mr. President. At least that.\n  Now, it was President Clinton who brought this issue to our attention \nduring his campaign. ``We must end welfare as we know it,'' he said. I \nthink that President Clinton has a great deal of compassion in his \nheart for children.\n  I know that he agrees with us in the Senate when we say, ``Let us \nreform welfare to benefit the children, not reform it to hurt the \nchildren.'' We will be judged on how we handle this bill. We will be \njudged in the abstract at first, but we will be judged by the results \neventually.\n  People will know if children are going hungrier, if more of the \nhomeless are children. They will know where to point the finger, and it \nwill be right here. If we take the Dole approach without amending it--\nand I hope in a bipartisan fashion we will amend it--we will be hurting \nour children and we will see the results of that and we will know when \nand where it came from.\n  I listened to my learned friend from New York talk about what \nhappened to the homeless after we moved to close down mental \ninstitutions. For all the good reasons--we said, it is better to have \nour mentally ill in smaller institutions, smaller homes throughout the \ncountry. But something happened on the way to the Forum. We ran out of \nmoney and we never built those alternatives.\n  This situation is worse because right off the top we know in the Dole \nbill we are freezing spending. At least when my predecessors tried to \nreform the mental health system, they had a plan. But this Dole bill is \nno plan. It is an abdication, not a plan. This is very, very troubling.\n  Now, one of the things that upsets me perhaps more than any other, is \nthat there is no clear way in the Dole bill that we are going to enable \nworking moms and working dads to rely on child care.\n  Child care is really an incidental in the Dole bill. It is wrapped \ninto a job assistance grant. The funds are frozen. In California, we \nhave thousands of kids today waiting in line to get into child care. We \ndo nothing.\n  I hearken this Senate back to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, \nwho is often praised by Republicans for his leadership. He knew we \nneeded to get women into the workplace. We all know about ``Rosie the \nRiveter.'' Without women going to work and building the machinery of \nwar that we had to build in this Nation--and we had to catch up because \nwe were so behind in order to fight these battles--women were relied \nupon in the workplace. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt knew a woman was \nnot going to abandon her child. She was going to need child care while \nthe husband was off at war and she was off in the factory.\n  According to Doris Kearns Goodwin in the book ``No Ordinary Time,'' \nwhich I commend to everyone, nearly $50 million was spent on child care \nbefore the end of the war.\n And the women blossomed in the workplace because they knew that their \nkids were OK.\n\n  I like the Democratic alternative. I think it makes sense because \nwhat it says is: You must work, but we will make sure that you do not \nabandon your children. The Democratic plan is respectful of the family, \nis understanding of the family. The Democratic plan puts work first and \nchildren first. Work first and children first. The Republican plan \ntakes us out of the game. It says to the States: Here it is. It is your \nproblem. \n\n[[Page S 12774]]\n\n  The people in our States understand in the end it will be their \nproblem, because what is going to happen when there are more helpless \nand more homeless and more desperate people, and people are tripping \nover them in the street and we are out of it?\n  We have to balance the budget, and we will. We will not have the \nmoney for welfare. And it will be the greatest unfunded mandate of all \ntime, because people are not going to allow their communities to \ndeteriorate.\n  So I am very proud to support the Democratic alternative. I think it \nis smart. I think it builds on what success we have had. In California \nwe have had success. In Riverside County, for example, and in Los \nAngeles County, we have put a large percentage of welfare recipients \nonto the work rolls because we have really given them what they need. \nBut the Republican plan, that is going to lead to nothing but trouble--\ntrouble in the States, unfunded mandates laid on our State taxpayers, \nlaid on our local taxpayers.\n  I come from the local end of things. I got elected to the Board of \nSupervisors of Marin County a long time ago. I got calls at home when \nanything was going on in the street. I can assure you, county \nsupervisors and city council people and mayors and Governors are going \nto be very upset when these problems appear in their communities and \nthe Federal Government says, ``It is your problem.''\n  Mr. President, an estimated 70 percent of welfare recipients are \nchildren and here we are walking away from those children. We do not \nhave to do it. Let us be tough on work and kind to children. That is \nwhat the Democratic alternative does. I hope we will have bipartisan \nsupport for that. My cities in California are desperate about this. \nBillions of dollars will be lost to the big counties in California with \nthe Republican plan--billions. Not millions but billions. And the \nproblem will not go away.\n  So I stand with the former chairman, the Democratic ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee. His vision should not be ignored. We should \nlearn from him. We should listen to him. He is the leader in this \nNation on this issue. He predicted what would happen in the \ncommunities, the out-of-wedlock births, and the problems that would \nfollow in society. And when he says he knows we are going to see kids \nsleeping on grates, and misery, and children who are out of control--he \nknows what he is talking about.\n  So I stand with him proudly. I hope we will support the Democratic \nalternative and, if we lose that, that we will come together on \namending the Dole bill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I express particular personal thanks \nto the Senator from California for her generosity in her remarks, and \nto make the case--just comment--that in the aftermath of the Family \nSupport Act, we had considerable successes in places such as Riverside. \nAnd we also had a continued rise in the number of families headed by \nwomen.\n  The CBO has done the best analysis you can do with these things, a \nregression analysis. It states the caseload increase from late 1989 to \n1992, increases in the number of families headed by women explain just \nover half in the rise of the AFDC basic caseload. A quarter was the \nrecession.\n  I ask unanimous consent the analysis be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 1993.\n     Subject: CBO Staff Memorandum on Rising Caseloads in the Aid \n       to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program.\n\n       We are enclosing a copy of ``Forecasting AFDC Caseloads, \n     with an Emphasis on Economic Factors,'' which was prepared by \n     Janice Peskin and John Tapogna in response to a request from \n     the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the Committee on Ways \n     and Means. To understand the upsurge in AFDC caseloads that \n     began during late 1989, the memorandum develops regression \n     models that estimate how various factors affect caseloads.\n       The CBO model for the AFDC-Basic caseload indicates that:\n       The effect on employment of the 1990-1991 recession--and \n     the relatively weak economy before and after the recession--\n     accounts for about a quarter of the recent growth in \n     caseloads; and\n       Increases in the number of families headed by women explain \n     just over half of the rise in the AFDC-Basic caseload.\n       Looking ahead to the 1993-1995 period, increases in the \n     AFDC-Basic caseload are expected to be sizable. The main \n     underlying causes are growth in the number of families headed \n     by women--especially by never-married mothers--which is \n     expected to continue at a rapid rate, and the relatively weak \n     economic recovery that is forecast.\n       We hope you find this report useful.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I do not want to go around looking like an Easter \nprocession here or something, but to my friend from California, that is \nthe pen with which John F. Kennedy, in his last public bill-signing \nceremony, October 31, 1963, signed the Community Mental Health \nConstruction Act of 1963.\n  We were going to build 2,000 community mental health centers by the \nyear 1980 and 1 per 100,000 population afterwards. We built 400 and we \nforgot what we were doing. We emptied out the mental institutions. The \nnext thing you know, the problem of the homeless appears. I was there. \nHe gave me this pen. And we said, ``The homeless? Where did they come \nfrom? It was certainly nothing we did.''\n  It was exactly something we did. When you see those children sleeping \non grates in 10 years time in your city, do not think it will not be \nrecorded, thanks to the Senator from California, that you can see it \ncoming. Somebody might keep the pen with which this bill is going to be \nsigned, if in fact it is signed, for such an occasion.\n  Mr. President, I thank, again, the Senator from California. I see the \nSenator from Michigan is on the floor. Would he like to speak?\n  The Senator from Michigan asks 15 minutes. The Senator from \nPennsylvania has nobody wishing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from New \nYork that the time remaining under the time agreement for his side is \n12 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from Michigan is accordingly granted 12 \nminutes. We will have 45 seconds to wrap up. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to take 10.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No, we understood this would happen and it has \nhappened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York. I also \nthank him, much more importantly, for the extraordinary wisdom, as well \nas passion, with which he addresses this subject. The experience that \nhe has, the institutional and national memory which he carries around \nup there in his head, is unique. I just wish there were more of us like \nhim in that capacity, to learn from experience not just what is \nachievable, but also to pass along the lessons of unintended \nconsequences for so many things that we do.\n  Mr. President, the Nation's welfare system does not serve the Nation \nwell. It is broken in a number of places. It has failed the children \nthat it is intended to protect. It has failed the American taxpayer.\n  I am hopeful the debate in the Senate will result in a constructive \neffort which will finally end the current system and achieve meaningful \nreform. Meaningful reform will assure that children are protected, that \nable-bodied people work, and that child support enforcement laws are \nfully effective in getting fathers to support their children.\n  The history of this country's welfare reform is littered with the \nremains of programs that have begun with high expectations but fall \nshort in reality. Welfare has too often been a cycle of dependence \ninstead of independence. It makes no sense to continue a system which \ncontains incentives for people to be on welfare. We have an obligation \nto break this cycle for all concerned.\n  The imperative of ending welfare dependency has led me to conclude \nthat one component of welfare reform must be time limits on welfare \nbenefits, in order to force able-bodied recipients to seek and secure \nemployment.\n  The Daschle work first bill fundamentally changes the current welfare \nsystem by replacing a system of unconditional, unlimited aid with \nconditional benefits for a limited time. But it does so without \nabandoning the national goal of helping children. Under the work first \nbill, in order to \n\n[[Page S 12775]]\nreceive assistance, all recipients must sign an empowerment contract. \nThis contract will contain an individual plan, designed to move the \nrecipient promptly into the work force. Those who refuse to sign a \ncontract will not get assistance, and tough sanctions will apply to \nthose not complying with the contract that they sign. I have long \nbelieved that work requirements should be clear, strong, and should be \napplied promptly.\n I am pleased that Senator Daschle has accepted a modification at my \nrequest which adds a requirement that recipients be in job training or \nin school or working in a private sector job within 6 months of the \nreceipt of benefits, or, if a private sector job cannot be found, in \ncommunity service employment. The requirement would be phased in to \nallow the States the opportunity to adjust administratively.\n\n  The Dole legislation requires recipients to work within no more than \n2 years of the receipt of benefits. But why wait that long? Why wait 2 \nyears? Unless an able-bodied person is in school or job training, why \nwait longer than 6 months to require that a person either have a \nprivate job or be performing community service?\n  There is no doubt that there is a great need in local communities \nacross the country for community service workers. Last year, the demand \nfor community service workers from the President's AmeriCorps Program \nwas far greater than the ability to fund them. According to AmeriCorps, \nof the 538 project applications requesting approximately 60,000 \nworkers, applications for only about 20,000 workers, about a third, \ncould be funded. Projects ranged from environmental cleanup, to \nassisting in day care centers, to home health care aides. So it is \nclear that there is no shortage of need for community service and for \nworkers to perform community service.\n  Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the cycle of \ndependency and the need to return welfare recipients to work. As long \nas 14 years ago, in 1981, I was the author, along with Senator Dole, of \nan amendment which was enacted into law to put some welfare recipients \nback to work as home health care aides, thereby decreasing the welfare \nrolls and increasing the local tax base.\n  This demonstration project called for the training and placement of \nAFDC recipients as home care aides to Medicaid recipients as a long-\nterm care alternative to institutional care and was subject to rigorous \nevaluation of demonstration and the post-demonstration periods.\n  The independently conducted program evaluation found that in six of \nthe seven demonstration projects, trainees' total monthly earnings \nincreased by 56 percent to over 130 percent during the demonstration \nperiod. Evaluations of the post-demonstration years indicated similarly \npositive and significant income effects.\n  Consistent with the increase in employment, trainees also received \nreduced public benefits. All seven States moved a significant \nproportion of trainees off of AFDC. In four of the States, a \nsignificant proportion of the trainees also were moved off of the Food \nStamp Program or received significantly reduced benefit amounts.\n  Additionally, the program evaluation indicated that it significantly \nincreased the amount of formal in-home care received by Medicaid \nclients and had significant beneficial effects on client health and \nfunctioning. The evaluation also indicates that clients benefited from \nmarginally reduced costs for the services that they received.\n  As the 1986 evaluation of our demonstration project showed, this type \nof demonstration had great potential in allowing local governments to \nrespond to priority needs and assist members of their community in \nobtaining the training necessary to obtain practical, meaningful \nprivate-sector employment and become productive, self-sufficient \nmembers of their community.\n  So experience has shown that we must be much more aggressive in \nrequiring recipients to work. But, as we require recipients to work, we \nmust remember that another important part of the challenge facing us is \nthat two-thirds of the welfare recipients nationwide are children. \nAlmost 10 million American children--nearly 400,000 in my home State of \nMichigan alone--receive benefits. We must not punish the kids in our \nwelfare reform.\n  I am hopeful that the 104th Congress will get people off welfare and \ninto jobs, in the privilege sector, if possible, but in community \nservice, if necessary.\n  I want to again commend and congratulate Senator Moynihan for his \ndecades of work on this issue. I want to congratulate Senators Daschle, \nMikulski, Breaux, and so many others of our colleagues who have worked \non the Daschle work first bill, which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  The work first bill is tough on getting people into jobs. But it \nprovides the necessary incentives and resources to the States not only \nto require people to work, but to help people find jobs and to keep \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I have focused on making sure that able-bodied people \non welfare work. That has been a focus of my efforts for over a decade \nnow in this body, and I have described one of those efforts, with \nSenator Dole, that we actually succeeded in putting into place over a \ndecade ago that had some very positive effects. But there are other \ncritically important elements of positive welfare reform. The number of \nchildren born to unwed teenaged mothers has continued to rise at \ntotally unacceptable rates. We all recognize the need to do something \nabout this and to remove any incentives created by the welfare system \nfor teenagers to have children. I support teen pregnancy prevention \nprograms with flexibility for the States in its implementation.\n  We also know that the problem of teen pregnancy and unwed teenaged \nparents is not going to be completely eliminated or easily eliminated. \nSo I support provisions which require teen parents to continue their \neducation and job training and to live either at home with an adult \nfamily member or in an adult-supervised group home in order to qualify \nfor benefits.\n  We should not erode the Federal safety net for low-income working \nfamilies and for families who have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits. We frequently forget those families. Working families who \nlose their jobs get unemployment and then exhaust their unemployment. \nThese are working people.\n  Tens of thousands of people in my home State of Michigan, over \n329,000 nationally, who are working people who have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits have had to move into welfare as a final resort. \nThat was their final safety net. And responsible reform must assure \nthat in times of economic crisis, funds are available for working \nfamilies who have lost their jobs and exhausted their unemployment \ninsurance. And the only way to do this is with a Federal safety net, \nthat Federal safety net which the Senator from New York has spent so \nmuch time analyzing and discussing before this body.\n  Child care assistance is an important facet of realistic welfare \nreform as it is for low-income working families who are not on welfare. \nChild care assistance is essential to help recipients keep a job and \nstay off welfare. Assistance is particularly needed in transition \nperiods moving from welfare to work. That is why child care assistance \nis such an important feature of the work first plan, not just for \npeople on welfare but for low-income people, whether or not they are on \nwelfare.\n  Another key element of any successful welfare program will be \nassuring that parents take responsibility for their children. So we \nmust toughen and improve interstate enforcement of child support. I \nvery much support provisions to require welfare recipients' cooperation \nin establishing the paternity of a child as a condition of eligibility \nfor benefits, and a range of measures such as driver's license and \npassport restrictions, use of Federal income tax refunds, and an \nenhanced database capability for locating parents who do not meet their \nchild support obligations.\n  The Daschle amendment which is before us addresses these and other \nproblems. It ends the failed welfare system and replaces it with a \nprogram to move people into jobs, to provide child care, to assure that \nparents take responsibility for the children they bring into the world, \nand it does this without penalizing America's children.\n  So I intend to vote for Senator Daschle's work first welfare reform \n\n[[Page S 12776]]\n  program to finally end the current system and achieve meaningful but \nrealistic welfare reform.\n  Again, I want to particularly single out our good friend from New \nYork for the dedication which he has brought to this subject over so \nmany decades, and for the wisdom which he imparts, and for the warnings \nwhich he really gives to all of us that we should do our best to reform \nthe system but be aware of those unintended consequences. It is a \nlesson which each of us should heed.\n  I thank my friend for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise the Senator from New \nYork that he has 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will use each of those seconds to thank my \nincomparably learned and capable friend from Michigan who has so \nwonderfully guided us in legal matters through this Congress and who \nhas spoken so wisely about welfare and who has spoken generously about \nthe Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, if I have 5 remaining seconds, I will retain them for \nsome unspecified purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the majority leader has very generously \nsuggested we might have an additional 15 minutes for our side, and the \nSenator from Vermont is present and I give him as much of that time as \nhe wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork and the distinguished Republican leader for the courtesy that in \nmy years here I have grown accustomed to receiving from both of them.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the welfare bill before us, the \nRepublican version. I know that a lot of very good Senators on both \nsides of the aisle have been wrestling with the problems we face, but I \nworry about just how that wrestling match may come out.\n  Mr. President, the Republican welfare bill is an all-out assault on \nlow-income children and families. The bill is anti-child, anti-family \nand it does nothing to get people off welfare and into a job.\n  The rhetoric being used to sell this bill to the American people is \nfull of false promises. The bill is not reform.\n  It boxes up welfare problems and ships them off to the States. On the \noutside of this box there ought to be, in big bold letters, a sign that \nsays ``Local taxpayers beware.''\n  Sending severely underfunded block grants to the States with no real \nemphasis on work will cost all of us more in the end. The Senate \nRepublican plan cuts spending on welfare now, but you can be sure that \nlocal taxpayers will be picking up the tab later.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 44 of the 50 States \nwill not meet work participation target rates in the Senate Republican \nbill because this plan fails to provide States with the money needed to \nachieve these rates.\n  Here is another unfunded mandate being passed on to the State and \nlocal taxpayers.\n  States must either swallow further cuts in Federal payments to the \nneedy--or come up with more money from their own coffers.\n  This makes no sense--unless the true purpose of this bill is to turn \nour back on the unemployed and further burden the taxpayer. You have to \nbe tax-happy or cold-hearted to like this bill.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the Republican bill would cut over $77 \nmillion in cash assistance, supplemental security income, child care, \nand food stamps over the next 5 years.\n  Under the Republican block grant proposal there will be no \nadjustments for high unemployment or recession. When the block grant \nmoney runs out, Vermonters will pick up the tab.\n  Helping low-income Americans find a way out of poverty is a \nresponsibility of both States and the Federal Government. The \nRepublican plan abandons any national involvement in providing for the \nwelfare of the Nation.\n  States need more flexibility, but that does not mean shedding our \nnational responsibility.\n  I cannot support the Republican plan, but I intend to vote for the \nalternative proposal offered by Senator Daschle. The Democratic \nleader's plan continues a national commitment to keep families together \nand work their way off welfare.\n  Families on welfare cannot get jobs if they do not have adequate \nchild care support. They cannot keep their jobs unless there is a \ntransition period for child care.\n  The Democratic bill not only emphasizes helping people find work--but \nbacks it up with the child care necessary to go to work.\n  The Democratic alternative is a national commitment to help children \nand families work their way out of poverty. The Republican bill is a \nfeel-good, do-nothing charade that takes a walk on the problem of \npoverty.\n  There is a welfare scandal in this country that most Republicans have \nbeen strangely silent about. It is the scandal of corporate welfare.\n  As we pause on the brink of slashing food assistance and child care \nto needy families, I wish we would think a little bit about the \ncorporations that are receiving benefits from Uncle Sam.\n  According to the conservative Cato Institute, the American taxpayer \nspends $85 billion a year on corporate welfare--not including tax \nloopholes that cost many billions of dollars more.\n  The reason for this is simple. Low-income children cannot hire high-\npriced Washington law firms. Those who can hire expensive law firms are \nspared the reform axe this year.\n  The Senate Republican bill takes food, child care, housing assistance \nand assistance for disabled children away from families, but continues \nthe practice of letting taxpayers foot part of the bill for wealthy \ncorporations to lease limousines.\n  We must look at the entire welfare system--including corporate \nwelfare.\n  Nobody on the Senate floor disagrees that we need to reform welfare \naid for low-income families. We do. There are too many programs that do \ntoo little to help people get back to work.\n  We need to ask more of those who receive assistance, but we should \nnot abandon those who play by the rules. We also need to continue \nprograms that reward low-income working families.\n  This bill is just the latest attack by Republican leadership in \nCongress on low-income children and families. But families on welfare \nare not the only targets.\n  Earlier this year, the Republican leadership announced plans to cut \nback the earned income tax credit [EITC]. This is a tax credit that \nrewards low-income Americans who work. It makes a huge difference for \nfamilies struggling to pay the rent and buy food for their kids.\n  Yes, you heard it right. The Republican leadership wants to raise \ntaxes for low-income working families.\n  The Republican budget resolution also cuts Medicaid by $180 billion \nover the next 7 years. Medicaid provides long-term care for low-income \nseniors, the disabled and health care for low-income children and \nfamilies.\n  Following through on the budget resolution, the House just cut \nbillions out of next year's appropriations for education programs, Head \nStart and youth work programs.\n  At the same time, the House is gearing up to pay for 20 additional B-\n2 bombers at $1 billion a pop. A plane that the Pentagon has said it \ndoes not even want. We need to get our priorities straight.\n  The Republican assault on programs that benefit low-income Americans \ncomes at a time when census data shows the gap between the rich and the \npoor is greater than at any time since the end of World War II.\n  If the present trends continue, the America that our children grow up \nin will look more like a Third World country, with deep gulfs between \nthe rich and the poor.\n  Programs that keep poor families together, rather than tearing them \napart and programs that feed children so they can learn, are \ninvestments in our future. \n\n[[Page S 12777]]\n\n  These investments will make America more productive.\n  Members of Congress have benefited from the opportunities which have \nmade America the land of opportunity.\n  We have an obligation to make sure that those same opportunities are \navailable for the next generation.\n  We must work together to make responsible bipartisan changes to \nFederal programs that provide assistance to low-income children and \nfamilies. I fear, however, the public policy is right now being \novershadowed by Presidential politics.\n  I hope that reason will prevail over hysteria as we all take a good \nhard look at how we can make welfare programs work better for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has finally \nembarked on an earnest and vigorous debate on reforming welfare. Except \nfor the balanced budget amendment, this is probably the most important \nlegislation we will tackle in this Congress. There is no doubt that our \ncurrent system is failing welfare recipients and taxpayers alike. I \nbelieve that all Senators recognize the shortcomings that exist in \nwelfare and sincerely want to rectify them. Although there are some \ntough issues yet to be resolved, let us not shirk the responsibility we \nhave to all citizens of this country to work together in passing \nmeaningful welfare reform.\n  We have before us various proposals to revise the Federal programs \nthat provide assistance to the poor in our Nation. After reviewing the \ndifferent recommendations, I have concluded that the Work First \nlegislation authored by Senators Daschle, Breaux, and Mikulski contains \nthe best alternatives to the current problems in our welfare system. \nFirst and foremost, the Work First plan mandates work for welfare \nrecipients and an end to government dependency. The AFDC Program would \nbe abolished and replaced by a time-limited benefit, conditional upon a \nrecipient's signing and complying with a parent empowerment contract. \nWelfare offices would be transformed into employment offices and ensure \nthat welfare parents become productive members of the work force as \nsoon as possible. Persons receiving temporary employment assistance \nwould be required to look for work from day one and would be penalized \nfor turning down any legitimate job offer. States would confirm that an \nincreasing percentage of their welfare populations are entering the \nwork force. Unlike the Republican leadership bill, however, States \nwould have access to the necessary resources to fulfill work \nparticipation rates. Child care assistance would be available to help \nwelfare parents successfully make the transition to employment. The \nCongressional Budget Office has stated that the lack of child care \nwould make it impossible for 44 States to comply with the majority \nleader's bill. I do not wish to place such an unfunded mandate on the \nStates. The Work First plan recognizes that child care is a must for \nStates to meet its tough work participation rates. Moreover, only with \nsufficient child care can single welfare parents retain jobs and avoid \na return to welfare dependency.\n  The Work First bill provides greater incentives than welfare. It \ntransforms the entire welfare bureaucracy, making it work-oriented. \nStates are given the flexibility to administer the Work First \nemployment block grant themselves or contract with private companies to \nmove temporary employment assistance recipients into full-time, \nprivate-sector jobs. Senator Daschle's bill is cost-effective. It would \nachieve a savings of $21 billion over 7 years, all of which would go \ndirectly toward deficit reduction. And while the Work First proposal \nimposes tough time limits for welfare assistance, it contains important \nprotections for children, the innocent victims of our current defective \nsystem.\n  There is an urgent need to improve the welfare system in the United \nStates. I hope that the Senate will take advantage of this historic \nopportunity to enact legislation to overhaul our flawed programs and \nempower welfare recipients to break cycles of dependency and become \nsuccessful and productive citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I think at this point we may have a few moments \nremaining, which I would like to reserve for some unanticipated \npurpose.\n  Seeing no Senators on this side, I see the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have heard several of our colleagues, \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle, talk about the need for \nwelfare reform. And I would say that there is unanimous support in the \nSenate and in the country for welfare reform. But I also would say in \nmy opinion the Democrat alternative leaves a lot to be desired.\n  Let me just make a couple of general comments about welfare before I \ntalk about the specific amendment that we have before us today.\n  We have a lot of Federal programs, and we are spending a lot of money \non welfare. It kind of shocks people. I told people in my State this \npast month that we have 336 Federal welfare programs; 336 different \nFederal welfare programs, and they have not been working. We are \nspending lots and lots of money, and it has not been working.\n  In 1994, we were spending about $241 billion for welfare programs--\n$241 billion--and that figure is increasing dramatically. Most of these \nprograms are entitlements. Most of these programs grow. The Federal \nGovernment defines eligibility, and then we see how much they cost at \nthe end of the year. We do not budget them. We do not say, ``Here is \nhow much money we are going to spend on welfare.'' They are \nentitlements. People are entitled to these benefits. Whether it is food \nstamps, whether it is housing assistance, whether it is energy \nassistance, you name it, we have a lot of programs where people are \nentitled to the benefit, and we see how much it costs at the end of the \nyear.\n  It is not too surprising, therefore, we find a lot of people who \nbecome addicted to these entitlements and then they demand their money; \nthey are entitled, as by definition of the Federal Government. So they \nbecome addicted to Federal programs. They become dependent on the \nFederal Government. We have to break the welfare dependency cycle we \nhave in this country.\n  One of President Clinton's best lines in his 1992 campaign said, ``We \nneed to end welfare as we know it.'' Everyone was applauding. \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents said, ``Yes, we need to, \nbecause we realize the system is not working and it has not worked very \nwell.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a study done by the \nCongressional Research Service that lists the 336 welfare programs and \ntheir costs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no obligation, the study was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   OVERVIEW OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND SPENDING IN EIGHT WELFARE DOMAINS   \n                              NOVEMBER 1994                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             FY 1994 or \n                                                Number of       1995    \n                Welfare domain                   programs  appropriation\n                                                           (in millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCash welfare..................................          7     * $17,171 \nChild welfare and child abuse.................         38         4,306 \nChild care....................................         45        11,771 \nEmployment and training.......................        154        24,838 \nSocial services...............................         33         6,589 \nFood and nutrition............................         10        37,967 \nHousing.......................................         27        17,516 \nHealth........................................         22         5,076 \n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................        336       125,234 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Figure for FY 1996.                                                   \n                                                                        \nNote.

Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt once said:\n\n       The lessons of history, confirmed by evidence immediately \n     before me, show conclusively that continued dependence upon \n     relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration \n     fundamentally destructive to the national fiber. To dole out \n     relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle \n     destroyer of the human spirit.\n\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was exactly right. We have induced a \nspiritual and moral disintegration of fundamental destructive values, \nand it has been destructive to our national fiber; it has been \ndestructive to the family. We have a welfare system that does not work.\n  Since President Lyndon Johnson launched the war on poverty in 1965, \nwelfare spending has cost U.S. taxpayers about $5.4 trillion. \nTragically, as Roosevelt predicted, this culturally destructive system \nhas heightened the plight of the poor in this country, discouraging \nwork and marriage. Today, one child in seven is raised on welfare \nthrough the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program. Nearly a \nthird of the children in the United States are now born to single \nmothers. The number of children on AFDC has tripled between 1965 and \n1992, even though the total number of children in the United States \ndeclined by 5.5 percent.\n  To fix this system, we must drastically change it. Simply tinkering \naround the edges, as suggested by the White House and regrettably by \nthe Democrats' substitute, is not an acceptable solution. Real welfare \nreform must be linked to personal responsibility. It must provide \nincentives for work instead of dependence, incentives for marriage \ninstead of children born out of wedlock, and incentives to get a good \neducation and save money to buy a home instead of dropping out of \nschool and remaining in Government-owned housing.\n  The proposal before the Senate fulfills the commitment--and the \nproposal I am talking about is the Dole proposal--fulfills the \ncommitment to overhaul the welfare system and is the result of \nimportant debate among the Senate Republicans in an effort to \nstrengthen our proposal. I believe this \n\n[[Page S 12780]]\nproposal should enjoy overwhelming support from both Republicans and \nDemocrats, as well as the White House.\n  The Dole substitute has strong work requirements to ensure that able-\nbodied welfare recipients find a job. It recognizes illegitimacy as a \nserious national problem and stresses the responsibility of parenthood. \nIt controls the unlimited spending of welfare programs by capping \nspending and consolidating many overlapping programs.\n  The Dole bill also consolidates 95 Federal programs in 3 block grants \nwith the option for States to request a block grant for food stamps. We \nmay have an amendment to include food stamps in the block-grant \nproposal, and certainly this Senator will support it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scores the Dole proposal as saving \napproximately $70 billion over 7 years, while the Democratic package \nthat we will vote on at 4 o'clock today saves only $21 billion. The \nbill also makes reforms in food stamps, housing programs, child support \nenforcement, and SSI.\n  The Dole bill has a real work requirement. Any able-bodied welfare \nrecipient will be required to find a job, and work means work. Welfare \nrecipients will no longer be able to avoid work by moving from one job \ntraining program to the next. States will also be able to require \nwelfare applicants to look for a job before even receiving a welfare \ncheck.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk, and they have a great title for \ntheir bill. It is called the Work First Act of 1995, and that sounds \ngreat. But you need to look at the details.\n  We now have 155 Federal job training programs. They do not work. Why \ndo we have 155? Because in almost every Congress, every time somebody \nis running for President they say, ``The best welfare program is a \njob,'' so we come up with a new jobs program.\n  We did not eliminate any of the old ones not working, and we stacked \non new. We have 155 Federal job training programs. It is ridiculous. \nUnder our proposal, we put those together. We basically have one. Let \nthe States decide which ones work. Some undoubtedly do work. I hope so. \nWe are spending a lot of money. It certainly does not make any sense to \nhave 155. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  In regard to the substitute before us, many people have said this is \na great bill, this is going to help people move into work. I am \nafraid--I am going to call it the Daschle bill--the Democratic \nsubstitute tinkers with the welfare system instead of rebuilding it. It \nproposes to replace AFDC with a bigger, more expensive package of \nentitlements.\n  Again, I want to underline ``entitlements.'' The Republican package \nsays we want to end welfare as an entitlement; people will not be \nentitled to receive welfare. We will have a block-grant approach. We \nwill say, ``This is how much we will spend.'' It will not be an open-\nended entitlement.\n  Not so under the Democratic package. They replace AFDC with a new \nentitlement package that actually increases spending. Spending will \nincrease more than $16 billion than projected AFDC costs over the next \n7 years, and that is according to the Congressional Budget Office, not \njust Don Nickles or the Republican Policy Committee.\n  The Democratic bill does not impose real time limits on welfare \nbenefits. I have heard everybody say, ``Well, we have to have some \nlimits,'' and I am glad to see they approached time limits in the \nDemocratic bill, but they have exceptions, several pages of exceptions.\n  As a matter of fact, they talk about a time limit and say, ``Oh, yes, \nwe are going to put a limit of cash payments of 5 years under the \nDemocrats' bill,'' but then if you look at page 3 of the bill, as \nmodified, we have exceptions. We have a hardship exception. That goes \nfor a page. We have exceptions for teen parents. We will not count the \nyears they are teens. There are exceptions for child-only cases, and \nother exceptions. In other words, this time limit has loopholes that \ncan just be expanded and expanded.\n  It exempts families that happen to reside in an area that has an \nunemployment rate exceeding 8 percent. Originally, it was 7.5 percent. \nThat means you do not have a 5-year time limit if you happen to live in \nNew York City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, or Newark, NJ. A lot of \ncities, a lot of areas have unemployment rates exceeding 8 percent, so \nthey are exempt from the 5-year limitation.\n  Does that fix welfare as we know it? Does that meet President \nClinton's statement, ``We want to end welfare as we know it''? That \ndoes not end it. It means it will be a lifetime annuity if you live in \na high unemployment area. That makes no sense.\n  We are going to exempt teenagers. If they are 16 years old and have a \nchild born out of wedlock, we will not count the first 3 years and we \nwill start counting after that. So they can be on for 7 or 8 years.\n  Wait a minute. That is not what President Clinton's rhetoric was. As \na matter of fact, President Clinton said on August 11:\n\n       What do we want out of welfare reform? We want work, we \n     want time limits, we want responsible parenting.\n\n  There is no time limit, not if you live in an area that has high \nunemployment. If you are a teenage mother, that time limit is extended \nsubstantially.\n  So I just want to say I have heard many colleagues on the other side \nmaking very laudatory comments on the Daschle bill. But the more I \nlook, the more exceptions I see. It does not look like a welfare reform \nbill. It is kind of tinkering on the edges.\n  Let us talk about the work requirement because, again, President \nClinton said how important work requirements are. The Dole bill says 50 \npercent of the people have to be on work--50 percent of all people. \nUnder the Daschle proposal, it requires 30 percent of the cash welfare \nrecipients to engage in work-related activities by 1997, and 50 percent \nby the year 2000. It sounds like it is the same. But as with the time \nlimits on welfare benefits, these work performance standards are undone \nby the fine print. A substantial number of recipients are excluded when \ncalculating the work participation rates--mothers with young children, \nill people, teen mothers, those caring for a family member who is ill \nor incapacitated. Together, these ``clients,'' as they are now called \nunder the Democratic bill, make up 25 percent of the adult welfare \npopulation, and they are exempt from the accounting of the 50-percent \nrequirement.\n  Think of that. We will have a welfare population where 25 percent is \nnow exempt from the mandate that 50 percent have to be at work. Well, \nif you add that together, that means that when the work requirements \nare fully phased in, 62.5 percent of the adult recipients will not be \nrequired to work or even get job training under the Daschle approach. \nThat means five-eighths of the people will not be required to get a job \nor go into work training because they are exempt. So the time limits \nhave all kinds of exemptions--a big exemption if you live in a high-\nunemployment area, a big exemption if you are a teen mother. The work \nrequirements have big exemptions because we excluded a lot of people--\n25 percent of the adult population--from that. That is why I look at \nPresident Clinton saying, ``What do we want out of welfare? We want \nwork requirements and time limits.'' But the bill is riddled with \nexceptions in work requirements and certainly in time limits. It says \nwe want responsible parenting. So do we. Maybe we can say we want \nresponsible parenting and make that happen.\n  Both bills, I might say, have pretty stringent hits on deadbeat or \ndelinquent dads or parents. So maybe there is some commonality in that \narea.\n  But, Mr. President, my comment is that we need to pass a welfare \nbill. I hope that we will pass a bipartisan bill. I hope our colleagues \non the other side, after we dispose of this amendment, will look at the \nproposal Senator Dole and myself and many other people have sponsored \nand be very serious. I know there are a lot of amendments. We need to \ndispose of them. Maybe we will pass some and reject some. I hope our \ncolleagues that have amendments will bring them to the floor. I hope we \nwill consider and dispose of them and, in the next few days, pass a \nsignificant welfare reform bill, one that eliminates the open-ended \nentitlement, one that has savings for taxpayers and encourages work and \nmoves people away from Federal welfare dependency.\n  I think that is a big challenge. We have not done it in decades. It \nneeds to \n\n[[Page S 12781]]\nbe done. The biggest beneficiary--some people think that Republicans \nare trying to do that so they can save some dollars. Some people think \nthis is management, or we are just going to give the authority to the \nState. I think the biggest beneficiary of our changes will be welfare \nrecipients, because we will be making some changes so they will get off \nthe addiction of welfare and they will be able to break away from the \ndependency cycle that so many generations and individuals now are stuck \non.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is one of the most important pieces \nof legislation this Congress will consider, certainly this year. I am \nhopeful that in the next few days we will be successful in passing it.\n  Mr. President, I know that our side is planning on going into a \nconference. I see my friend from Arkansas on the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may address a question. I understand \nthat all the time remaining between now and 3:30 belongs to the \nopponents of the Daschle proposal; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if I can impose on the generosity of the \nSenator from Oklahoma to yield 5 or 10 minutes to me in opposition to \nhis position.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to. I will inform my colleague that we were \nplanning on actually--we have a caucus going on at this moment that I \nwas hoping to join in. So it is my intention, as I told the Senator \nfrom New York, to have the Senate stand in recess for some period--say \nuntil 3 o'clock. I will be happy to give my colleague 5 minutes.\n  I yield the Senator from Arkansas 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, can I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, is he \nintending to do that and go into recess at that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That was my hope.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator will entertain a unanimous-\nconsent that I speak for 10 minutes after the Senator from Arkansas and \nat that point we go into recess?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, but I will withhold putting the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of observations \nand take a slightly different tack on the issue of welfare than that \nwhich has been debated.\n  First of all, I am deeply troubled by the Dole proposal. I do not see \nhow I can support it. One of the reasons I cannot support it is because \nthere is no comprehensive plan on child care. Any welfare proposal that \ndoes not consider child care is doomed to failure. Women are not going \nto work unless they have someplace that will take care of their \nchildren during work hours. There is no added money in the Dole \nproposal for that purpose.\n  The Dole proposal also has a number of other shortcomings. For \ninstance, the Dole proposal shortchanges States in the Sunbelt, such as \nArkansas, where immigration is on the increase. The bill provides no \nadditional funding to take care of a recession when the number of \napplicants for welfare grow. It seems to me that the proposal is \nfatally flawed in a number of ways. So I am going to strongly support \nthe Daschle proposal, which attempts to address these issues. Every \nMember of the Senate wants to vote for welfare reform. If you sit \naround the coffee shops at home, that is about all they will talk \nabout. However, we have to reform welfare in a commonsensical manner; \nnot the willy-nilly approach taken by the Dole proposal.\n  It seems to me that we speak loudly, longingly and piously about the \nchildren of this country in this debate on welfare. We overtly or \ncovertly attack them in this proposal--the most vulnerable among our \npopulation. Nobody knows for sure what the answer is. However, Mr. \nPresident, I assure you the answer is not to make children any worse \noff than they already are.\n  Let me just make a point about another kind of welfare. This \nmorning's Washington Post had a story on the Federal Page indicating \nthat the Secretary of the Interior yesterday signed a deed for 110 \nacres of land belonging to the American people to a Danish company \ncalled Faxe Kalk. What do you think the U.S. taxpayers got for that 110 \nacres of land yesterday? $275--$2.50 an acre. What do you think the \ncorporation Faxe Kalk got? One billion dollars' worth of a mineral \ncalled travertine.\n It is an aggregate source used to whiten paper.\n\n  Due to the 1872 mining law, still firmly in place, the taxpayers of \nthis country, who lament the taxes they pay, saw $1 billion worth of \ntheir assets go down the tube.\n  In 1990, Mr. President, I stood exactly where I am standing right now \nand pleaded with the people of the Senate to impose a moratorium on \npatenting under the 1872 mining law which requires the Secretary of \nInterior to deed away billions and billions and billions of dollars \nworth of gold, platinum, palladium, travertine, whatever, for $2.50 or \n$5 an acre. I lost that year by two votes.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma will yield 2 \nadditional minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Arkansas an additional 4 \nminutes, and at the conclusion of his remarks I yield the Senator from \nNebraska 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  I stood here and pleaded with this body to put a moratorium to stop \nthis practice, but lost 50-48.\n  Four days later, the Stillwater Mining Co. filed an application with \nthe Secretary for patents on approximately 2,000 acres of public land \nin Montana for $5 an acre--roughly $10,000. If the Secretary winds up \nhaving to deed the land, and he certainly will under existing law, to \nthe Stillwater Mining Co., the next story you read in the Washington \nPost will be that the Secretary of the Interior has deeded 2,000 acres \nof land belonging to the people of this country for $10,000 and \nunderneath that 2,000 acres lies $38 billion worth of platinum and \npalladium.\n  Mr. President, are these my figures? No, they are the figures \npresented by the Stillwater Mining Co. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, \nStillwater said they did not know whether they could make that pay off \nor not. They say there is $38 billion worth of minerals under it, but \nthey did not know whether they could make it pay off.\n  Really? A year ago the Manville Corp., which had jointly formed the \nStillwater Mining Co. with Chevron bought Chevron out and took \nStillwater public at roughly $13 a share. Last week, Manville sold its \nremaining interest in Stillwater to a bunch of investors for $110 \nmillion plus a 5-percent royalty based on a net smelter return. Not bad \nfor a company that 2\\1/2\\ years ago said they did not know whether they \ncould make it profitable or not.\n  A year ago, when Stillwater went public, the stock sold for $13. 1 \nyear later--how I wish I had invested in this one--the stock is worth \n$23 today. It had been up to $28. We cannot find the money for child \ncare in the welfare reform bill, while, at the same time, we deeded \naway $1 billion yesterday, and are getting ready to deed away another \n$38 billion.\n  Just before the recess, I offered an amendment on the Interior \nappropriations bill to renew a moratorium on the issuance of patents \npursuant to the 1872 mining law. However, the Senate defeated the \namendment 51-46. Instead, my friend from Idaho offered an amendment \nthat would require mining companies to pay fair market value for the \nsurface of the land in the future, but that is just for the surface, \nnot the minerals. So instead of paying $275 yesterday, the Faxe Kalk \nCorp. for $1 billion worth would have had to pay $20,000.\n  What a scam. Talk about welfare, welfare for some of our biggest \ncorporations, while we beat up on the children of this country and say \nto the mothers, ``No, we cannot give you child care for your child so \nyou can go to work.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment unfortunately will probably \nbe defeated along party lines.\n  I say unfortunately because there is a significant amount of \nenthusiasm in this body to respond to the people's concern about our \nwelfare system and to try to change it.\n  The Democratic Party, as people have observed and understand, have \nvery often had difficulty coming together around change. That is not \nthe case with welfare reform. \n\n[[Page S 12782]]\n\n  We have spent a great deal of time on this side of the aisle--not \ndefending the status quo--coming up with a proposal that radically \nalters the status quo with an attempt to pass legislation that will \nrespond to taxpayers who say they do not like the current tax.\n  They think we are spending money with no results, and perhaps worse, \nspending money and making the problem more serious than it currently is \nto the recipients who do not like the system, since many do not go onto \nwelfare by choice but are there as a consequence of divorce or \nseparation and find it difficult to get off once they are on.\n  Mr. President, even providers today increasingly are saying they do \nnot like the current system.\n  The Work First proposal is a serious attempt to respond to these \nconcerns, an attempt not to reduce the budget deficit, but to reduce \nthe rates of poverty and increase the self-sufficiency of Americans who \nare struggling to get out of the ranks of poverty. That is the effort \nthat we have before us.\n  It changes our system so that we first will have an emphasis on \nfinding and keeping a job; second, by providing the support necessary \nto find and keep that job; and third, by providing the States with more \nflexibility.\n  Mr. President, I urge citizens to understand that the Daschle \namendment abolishes AFDC. It replaces it with an entitlement that is \nconditional upon an individual who is able bodied being willing to \nwork. Those recipients must sign a parent empowerment contract that \noutlines their plan to move themselves into the work force, similar to \nwhat many States have already done, including my own, the State of \nNebraska.\n  It provides a stimulus to develop the work ethic by moving from an \nincome maintenance program to an employment assistance program.\n  Mr. President, beyond that, this bill recognizes that in order to \nkeep that job, individuals, parents, need to have other things. In \nparticular, it makes certain that every single person that is moving \ninto the ranks of the employed has high-quality, affordable child care. \nOtherwise, they will not be able to get it done.\n  Now, there is a tremendous differential, Mr. President, between the \nrelative cost of child care for somebody who is in the ranks of the \npoor and that of the people who are not poor. Above poverty, American \nfamilies spend about 9 percent of their income for child care. Below \npoverty, it is almost 25 percent of their income.\n  This proposal, moreover, says that many Americans are still \nstruggling to try to be able to afford the cost of health care. This \nextends the 1-year Medicaid to 2 years and provides a sliding scale. So \nagain, there is a requirement of effort for health care.\n  Mr. President, this legislation responds to States saying that they \nwant more flexibility. It allows States to design their own program and \nencourages States to redesign their infrastructure, to streamline the \nprocesses.\n  It provides incentive for States if the States exceed the required \njob participation rate. It does not freeze the funds in an inflexible \nblock grant, but it does say the States are required to maintain some \neffort.\n  Mr. President, this legislation by itself will not solve all the \nproblems. I still believe that we need to raise the minimum wage. I \nstill believe that we need to hold on to the progress that was made \nwith the expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\n  Perhaps one of the most damaging things that is done in the current \nbudget resolution is to reduce the earned-income tax credit. This \nwelfare reform proposal by itself will not solve all the problems.\n  Indeed, ideally for me, would be to pass the Daschle amendment and \nthen include thereafter title 7 and title 8 of the Dole proposal, which \nis essentially the Kassebaum Work Force Development Act that \nconsolidates and provides an awful lot more flexibility to States to \nmake job training programs work.\n It is a very good piece of legislation. It could give the States the \nkind of flexibility and the power that they need to help people acquire \nthe skills necessary to be self-sufficient.\n\n  I have no doubt that, if we were to pass this amendment--and I hope \nmy own skepticism about this current division between Republicans and \nDemocrats will not be warranted, I hope there will be Republicans who \nwill vote for the Daschle proposal--if it is passed, taxpayers will \nlike it because they will be getting their money's worth, for a program \nthat provides incentives for people to work. The recipients will like \nit because it strengthens child support enforcement, it provides a \ncontract that lets them know precisely what they are supposed to do, \nand it offers an alternative approach to the cycle of poverty and the \ncycle of welfare dependency that many are trying to break.\n  The people of the State of Nebraska, in my recent campaign, indicated \nstrongly they want our welfare rules to be written so work is given \ngreater priority than welfare, so it is more attractive than being on \nwelfare. This legislation responds precisely to that concern. They want \nthe opportunity at the State level and at the local level to be able to \ndesign their own programs, and this legislation responds to that \nconcern.\n  It is not being driven solely by the need to reduce the deficit. \nThere is not an ideological bent to it that says it has to be one way \nor the other. It is driven by a desire to be able to stand at the end \nof the day and say this thing is working better; that, from the \ntaxpayers' standpoint, from the beneficiaries' standpoint, and from the \nproviders' standpoint, we have made our welfare system operate in a \nmore efficient, effective and, hopefully, humanitarian fashion as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very important subject, welfare \nreform. I have approached the debate myself by trying to go back to the \nbasics. I think all of us have attempted that. That is by asking why we \nhave a welfare system at all, what should it do, and, just as \nimportant, what should it not do? The answers to those questions, I \nthink, are simple.\n  We now do not have a welfare system just in order to give money to \npoor people. That is not the point of welfare. It is not the point of \nwelfare simply to give money to poor people. Neither do we have a \nwelfare system to punish and humiliate people, especially children, for \nbeing poor. The reason we have a welfare system is to help people in a \ntough spot get back on their feet and back to work; to promote with \ncompassion the values of work, personal responsibility and self-\nsufficiency we all share as Americans.\n  The failure of our present system to meet these goals is a national \ntragedy. It is a top concern of Montanans and of all Americans, and \nrightly so. It seems to me very sad that Congress is approaching \nwelfare reform in a polarized, partisan way. After spending several \nweeks at home listening, talking to people, I know the American people \nexpect better. They expect a serious effort to solve a serious problem. \nAnd they are right. That is why I have reached out to work with \nRepublicans on welfare reform, and it is why I am disappointed to see \nhow little effort the majority has made to work with Democrats and how \nlittle cooperation there is between the administration and the \nCongress.\n  If we continue on this course, the country will not get welfare \nreform. It will get a partisan bill, maybe a veto, and ultimately an \nembarrassing failure. So, while we still have time, today I would like \nto urge us all to try a bit harder to work better together, to do what \nwe know is right, listen to the people, and get the job done.\n  In the past month, I have listened to Montanans I meet along the \nhighway. I am walking across my State. I talk to people on welfare and \npeople who have fought their way off welfare and into jobs, to teachers \nfrom Head Start and professionals from State government, county human \nservice officers, to advocates for poor people, and to middle-class \ntaxpayers who pay for our system.\n  As heated as the welfare reform debate can be, I have learned that \nmost of us have some basic principles in common. We agree that America \nneeds \n\n[[Page S 12783]]\na welfare system, but one which encourages personal responsibility, \nencourages work and self-sufficiency, lets States like Montana create \nsystems that make sense for our own unique problems, is fair to \ntaxpayers, protects children, and helps keep families together.\n  We agree the present system does not achieve these goals. It is \nbroken and it needs dramatic change.\n  The Federal Government has administered our major welfare program, \nAid to Families With Dependent Children, or AFDC, since the 1930's. I \nthink it is fair to say that AFDC has failed to live up to these \nprinciples, and there is no reason to reinforce failure. The best thing \nto do now is not to tinker with the AFDC, or come up with a substitute \nto it; it is to get the Federal Government out of AFDC, turn it into a \nblock grant, let the States design different plans, come up with their \nown ideas and try to learn from one another.\n  Therefore, it is with some reluctance I will vote against the \nalternative proposal by the Democratic leader. It has some good points: \na time limit, work requirements, a child care program, and protection \nfor children. Those are very important. But the proposal has a \nfundamental flaw. Under the proposal, the Federal Government will \ncontinue to administer welfare reform. I believe that will continue to \ncause a problem. It will continue to write requirements for States, and \nI believe it will perpetuate a system that has failed. That is why, on \nbalance, I prefer the welfare reform bill offered by Senator Dole.\n  The Dole proposal makes a clean break with the past. It converts the \nwelfare program into a block grant, eliminating red tape and giving \nStates the flexibility they need to run their own program. And it does \nsome other essential things. It is fair to taxpayers. It does not \nrequire States to adopt the more punitive approaches of the House bill, \nsuch as making States deny benefits to families when they have more \nchildren, or to unwed teenage mothers. And by placing a time limit on \nbenefits and requiring work, it moves away from a program which is \nbased on benefit checks toward one which is based on responsibility and \nself-help.\n  Thus, I hope I will ultimately be able to vote for Senator Dole's \nproposal. But at this point I believe it has some very serious \nproblems. They can be fixed, but we cannot evade them.\n  These problems fall into three main areas:\n  First, failure to provide for child care. First, women and children, \nthe people who receive the big majority of AFDC benefits, can only go \nto work if they have a safe, dependable provider of child care, and \nchild care is expensive. When a mother comes off AFDC, she is likely to \nstart with a pretty low-paying job. So, if we expect welfare recipients \nto work, we must offer some help with child care. But, at present, the \nDole bill offers no real help with child care. It merely gives States \nthe option of exempting families with children before their first \nbirthday from the work participation requirements. We have to do much \nbetter.\n  Second, the safety net for families with children. While we must tell \npeople they have to go back to work in a reasonable time, we have also \nto protect them when times are really tough: when a father suddenly \nleaves a family, when a wage-earner is killed or disabled in an \naccident, when a business closes, and when a young, single mother \nsuddenly loses her job. We cannot and we must not simply cut away the \nwhole social safety net.\n  So, if the Federal Government is going to turn the welfare system \nover to the States, we need a guarantee that the States will continue \nto provide their part of that safety net.\n  We need a guarantee that, under budget pressures as most of them are, \nthey will not simply take the money and eliminate most or all benefits \nfor people who truly need help.\n  The Dole bill does not provide that guarantee. Instead, it merely \nsays that for 2 years, States must reach 75 percent or more of their \npresent level of spending. After that, all bets are off. That is not \ngood enough.\n  Third, the Dole bill contains provisions which should not be in a \nwelfare bill at all. All these should be removed.\n  For example, it turns the Food Stamp Program into an optional block \ngrant that was not in the committee bill. It is in the Dole bill. This \nis unnecessary, because the Food Stamp Program on the whole works. No \ndoubt it can be improved in some ways, but it provides our families and \nchildren with the food they need.\n  And turning food stamps into a block grant is also dangerous, because \nit threatens the nutrition of poor children. States could eliminate \nnutrition services completely, which would threaten kids' health. Or \nthey could turn them into cash grants, which would encourage fraud and \nabuse by recipients.\n  In addition, the Dole bill contains a large and controversial job \ntraining program. This is a very important issue which should be \nconsidered on its own merits, not simply lumped into the welfare bill \nwithout debate.\n\n\n                   america needs a bipartisan reform\n\n  Finally, and once again, my most important criticism applies to the \nwhole approach Congress has taken to welfare reform. That is, I believe \nCongress is treating this as a political issue rather than a real \nissue.\n  That is wrong. The failure of the welfare system is a serious social \nproblem. It is a top concern of the public, and rightly so. It deserves \nto be more than a political hockey puck.\n  But today, we have a Democratic bill and a Republican bill. Slogans \nand press releases. All the things that have made so many Americans fed \nup with politics.\n  If nothing changes, we will get a partisan bill pushed through with a \nvery narrow margin of votes. We will get a veto. It will be sustained. \nAnd at the end of the year, we will have no welfare reform.\n  That does not have to happen. We still have time for serious work on \na serious problem. We can improve this bill, and ultimately get a good, \ntough, fair reform. I hope my colleagues here will join me.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I now ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 10 \nminutes to speak on the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today we begin in earnest to tackle \nthe issue of welfare reform. In the next week we will decide if this \nCongress will pass welfare reform legislation that attacks poverty and \naids recipients to become self-sufficient or if we give in to the \nrhetoric, the hot buttons, the slogans, the wedge issues, ignore past \neconomic appearance, and pass shortsighted and, I daresay, \ncounterproductive legislation.\n  To look first at some of the facts and to suggest a reality check \nabout this debate: There are currently some 14 million people in the \nUnited States receiving aid to families with dependent children \nassistance, known as welfare. But, Mr. President, over 9 million of \nthose people are children. The remaining 5 million of those people are \nadults. So let us be clear what we are talking about at the outset. \nWhen we talk about welfare reform, we are talking about primarily \nchildren. Nine million of the 14 million people receiving welfare are \nkids; only 5 million are adults.\n  Now, of those adults, of those 5 million adults, nearly 4 percent \noverall--these are national numbers--nearly 4 percent have been \ndesignated by the States--by the States--as incapacitated or physically \nunable to work. Other estimates, Mr. President, which include, among \nother conditions, mental illness, substance abuse and the like, put the \nnumber of those who are incapacitated and unable the work at about 18 \npercent. So 18 percent of the 5 million people are unable to work.\n  That means then that somewhere between 4.1 and 4.8 million AFDC \nrecipients are able to work, and, Mr. President, I agree that they \nshould work. I do not think there is anyone in this Chamber, indeed in \nthis country, who would deny that those people who can work should \nwork. On this point I think there can be absolute consensus.\n  The difference, Mr. President, however, between the Democratic \nalternative, the substitute amendment, and \n\n[[Page S 12784]]\nthe underlying bill, between the Democratic and the Republican \napproaches, is that the Democratic approach, I believe, asks two \ncritical questions that apparently did not occur or at least are not \nrepresented in the leadership bill.\n  First question: What about the jobs and attendant training and \neducation for those 4.1 to 4.8 able-bodied adults? And, second, what \nabout the children? Again, 9 million children, what about them? To me, \nI believe that the bottom line of all of this is to ensure that \nchildren are protected. The question we should ask ourselves when \nevaluating any welfare reform proposal is, what about the children?\n  I introduced welfare reform legislation earlier in the year. Every \nprovision in that bill, which was developed in conjunction and in \nconversation with the task force of Illinois residents, every provision \nof that bill sought to improve the condition of children through \neconomic opportunities for their families and to maintain a safety net \nfor them. The whole idea is to keep families and allow families to come \ntogether to provide a nurturing atmosphere for children and at the same \ntime provide those families with an ability to support those children \nwhile providing a safety net for those children. I believe that the \nDemocratic Work First bill, also known as the Daschle substitute, \nbuilds on those principles of support for families, support for \nchildren, and an emphasis on work.\n  The Daschle plan, the Democratic plan, includes all of the components \nnecessary for successful welfare reform. It is tough on work, including \na guarantee of necessary support services like child care and provides \nfunding for job creation, and above all, it protects children. That is \nthe reason that I have joined in cosponsoring the Democratic plan and \nsupport it wholeheartedly.\n  First, the Democratic bill provides that critical safety net for \nchildren. Our bill ensures that no child will go hungry or homeless due \nto the behavior of his or her parents. It affirms the Federal and State \ncommitment to aiding poor children. And in that regard, Mr. President, \nI would point out that in this country right now some 24 percent, \nestimated 24 percent, of the children in America fall below the poverty \nlevel. The highest level of child poverty in the industrialized world \nis in America today. I, therefore, think that we cannot approach the \nissue of welfare reform without addressing the question of child \npoverty, and addressing the question of child poverty has to take place \nin a Federal, State, and local collaborative and cooperative \narrangement.\n  Second, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative, the Work First \nbill, includes critical support services such as child care and health \ncare. We know from past experience that the lack of child care and \nhealth care causes many poor people, many recipients, former \nrecipients, to go back into transition and return back to the welfare \nrolls. An individual who is faced with the prospect of not being able \nto afford health care may then have to leave work and go back on \nwelfare just to have their health needs attended to. Similarly, a \nmother, a single mother particularly, or single parent faced with the \nprospect of leaving their child alone, underaged child alone, in order \nto go to work will often be forced to leave the work force and go on \nwelfare just to provide for child care.\n  So, the Work First bill, the Democratic alternative, includes those \nservices as a necessary component of welfare reform. The Work First \nbill not only guarantees child care for those recipients required to \nwork under it; it also expands and provides for the child care \ndevelopment block grant, the existing program that helps low-income \nworking families to afford child care.\n  As you know, Mr. President, there are a number of people who work but \nwho need the financial assistance so they can put their children into \nchild care so that they will not be forced back onto welfare rolls. \nThis legislation, the Democratic alternative, provides for those \nsupport services.\n  Mr. President, child care for the working poor is critical. It can \noften make the difference between a working parent and a parent \nreceiving welfare. In Illinois alone, in my State, we currently have a \nwaiting list--a waiting list, Mr. President--of some 30,000 children, \n30,000 kids, children, who need to have slots in day care for which \nthere are no slots available. The Democratic leadership recognizes that \nmoving from welfare to work requires an upfront investment, and it has \nto be an investment that goes to the benefit of the children.\n  The Work First bill provides adequate funding so the recipients will \nhave a real opportunity to move from welfare and into the private-\nsector work force. And that is why I would encourage all of my \ncolleagues to take a good look at the leadership bill and encourage \ntheir support of it, because only by providing support for child care \nwill we be able to accomplish real welfare reform.\n  The Democratic plan recognizes no matter how skilled a recipient, if \nthere are no jobs or not enough jobs in the community, there still can \nbe no work. Again, this job creation is another major element that has \nto be part of any real welfare reform. This bill, the Democratic bill, \nthe Daschle bill, provides funding for community-based institutions \nthat invest in business enterprises and therefore helps to create new \nprivate-sector jobs for low-income persons, which then will help us to \nrevitalize poor, underserved communities and help us diminish the \nreliance on and the need for welfare.\n  Mr. President, the Republican leadership bill falls short in the \nareas that I have just mentioned: work, child care, job creation. And \nabove all, it fails children. Two-thirds of those receiving assistance \nare children, and protecting their future should be the goal of reform.\n  One of the fundamental errors and problems with the plan before us \nright now--the Republican plan, the leadership plan--is that the plan \nends the 60-year-old Federal commitment to provide assistance to needy \nchildren. States are given the option of leaving children to go \nhomeless and hungry. It is unconscionable to me, Mr. President, the \nSenate would ignore the plight of children and allow that to happen.\n  During one of the hearings on welfare reform in the Finance \nCommittee, I asked a sponsor, frankly, of the Republican bill, who \nsupported the total dismantlement of the safety net, ``What about the \nchildren? What if this bill results in children being homeless and \nhungry?'' And the response that I got was, ``Well, if that happens, we \nwill just have to come back in a couple years and fix this.''\n  Mr. President, I submit that we cannot be that generous with the \nsuffering of children in this country and that we ought to start off \nfixing this problem now. And that is why I support the Daschle \nalternative.\n                               child care\n\n  Under the Dole bill, work requirements and participation rates are \nincreased but funding for child care is not. Illinois alone will have \nto increase child care by 383 percent to meet the work requirements in \nthe Dole bill. Funding for recipients required to work will siphon off \ndollars from low income families. In a State that already has a waiting \nlist of 30,000, the impact of the Dole bill could be devastating.\n  This is a misguided approach if the aim of reform is long term self-\nsufficiency.\n\n\n                              job creation\n\n  On the jobs issue the Dole bill is silent. There is no recognition \nthat job creation and economic development are critical to communities \nthat are plagued by both high unemployment and high poverty rates.\n  The bill assumes that recipients will be able to find jobs after the \n5-year time limit, which could be less at a State's option, but does \nnot provide funding for job creation or provide adequate funding for \nsupport services that will aid recipients to obtain and keep private \nsector jobs. In many poor communities jobs do not exist and those that \nare available are not easily accessible. This bill buys into the \n``Field of Dreams'' theme of: If you kick them off they will work.\n  In many poor areas in Chicago, unemployment is between 20 and 40 \npercent. 80 percent of black youth between the ages of 16 and 19 are \nunemployed in Chicago and 55 percent of the 20 to 24 year-olds are out \nof work. It will be nearly impossible to move recipients into permanent \nprivate sector jobs if there is no effort to create jobs.\n\n[[Page S 12785]]\n\n  Under the Dole bill States will have to increase the number of \npersons participating in work-job preparation activities by over 161 \npercent by the year 2000. To use my State as an example: Illinois will \nreceive $444 million less in AFDC funds, but will be required to \nincrease by 122 percent the number of recipients participating in work-\njob preparation activities.\n  This will be a tremendous burden on Illinois. Our current caseload \nexceeds 700,000 people and 64 percent of the entire caseload resides in \none county. In the year 2000, Illinois will be forced to use 73 percent \nof its block grant allocation to meet the Dole bill requirements. That \nleaves almost no funding for cash assistance or other programs \nsupporting family stability. In addition, the State and the city of \nChicago will have to create tens of thousands of jobs to absorb former \nwelfare recipients who will have reached the 5-year time limit.\n\n\n                            unfunded mandate\n\n  What this means is States and localities will be forced to pick up \nthe tab, which means the cost will be passed along to all of us through \nhigher State and local taxes.\n  This leads me to my last point--the Dole will is an unfunded mandate.\n  Welfare reform is not easy and it is not cheap. What we have learned \nfrom successful State experiments like those in Michigan and \nWisconsin--is that moving recipients into jobs can be done but it is \nexpensive, labor intensive, and time consuming.\n  Even Tommy Thompson, Governor of Wisconsin, acknowledges the need for \nan initial investment. He has stated that ``every time you change a \nsystem you are going to have an up-front investment, more \ntransportation, more job training, more day care. And those who think \nthat you can just change the system from one based on dependency, where \nyou receive a welfare check once a month, to one in which you require \npeople to go to work, are going to be sadly mistaken when you first \nstart the program. Because there is an up-front investment.''\n  In order to meet the work and child care costs associated with the \nRepublican bill, States will have to spend an additional $16.7 billion. \nThat is a very large unfunded mandate.\n  It is no wonder that the Congressional Budget Office has predicted \nStates won't be able to meet the work and child care requirements in \nthe Dole bill. It is easy to see why CBO assumes that 44 States will be \nunable to meet the bill's requirements, preferring to risk penalties \ninstead.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  We all want reform so that the welfare system works better. But we \nmust keep in mind that the system serves real people--the majority of \nwhom are children. Welfare should not be a wedge issue--it is a people \nissue.\n  The Work First plan provides a real solution to the problems of \npoverty; the Republican plan ignores poverty.\n  We live in one of the richest countries in the world, we have a $7 \ntrillion economy and a $1.2 trillion Federal budget, and yet we lag \nbehind every other industrial nation in child poverty. Yesterday, this \nbody voted to give the Department of Defense $7 billion more than they \nasked for. Clearly, we have the wherewithal to do better by this \nNation's children. What this next week will show is whether or not we \nhave the will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will continue to express myself on this subject \nin the coming hours of this debate. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. I want to raise a question for my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle as to whether the proposed Daschle amendment would \ndeal with a very disturbing situation we found in the State of \nMissouri.\n  Under the current law, and this is one of the reasons people are \ngoing nuts with welfare today, we have had an innovative program in \nSedalia, MO, where the president pro tempore of the Missouri State \nSenate worked with the Division of Family Services, which administers \nAFDC, to try to find employees for a major employer coming to the \nSedalia area, bringing 1,500 to 1,600 jobs.\n  They had the very simple idea that if they would bring qualified AFDC \nrecipients to the employer, then they might help solve the problems of \nthe people who did not have jobs and meet the needs of the employer for \nworkers. They sent over a number of workers. Some of the workers have \naccepted employment, and the system seems to be working very well for \nthem. Some of them chose to find other jobs because they did not like \nthis employer, and that is a good result. Those two classes of people \nfound work.\n  A third class of people was turned down for jobs. They continued to \nreceive AFDC. Another class of workers who refused to show up for jobs \ncould be cut off, but they could only be cut off of the AFDC rolls for \n2 months--jobs for which they were qualified, well above the minimum \nwage, and they were cut off, but they could only be cut off for 2 \nmonths.\n  No. 1, would that restriction continue under the proposed Daschle \namendment?\n  No. 2, and this is probably the most troubling part, two of the AFDC \nrecipients who went to the employer failed the mandatory drug test. \nSince they failed the mandatory drug test, they were not offered jobs. \nThey went back to the Division of Family Services and continued their \nAFDC checks. They could not be cut off, as we understand in Missouri \nthe requirements of AFDC, even though they failed drug tests.\n  As I see it, if this is the effect of existing law or the Daschle \namendment, then there would be an incentive for people who wanted to \nstay on AFDC simply to take drugs to prevent them from passing a drug \ntest.\n  I invite Members who are supporting the Daschle amendment to tell me \nif those two very important requirements would be changed under the \nDaschle amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  I rise in strong support of the welfare reform effort and to express \nseveral concerns about the effort to amend it, which is before the body \nnow. First of all, a very distinguished Member has just noted her, I \nknow, genuine concern that families could be cut off without \nassistance. Let me assure her and other Members who may be listening to \nthis debate that this bill is not about cutting people off who are \ngenuinely in need and genuinely in need of help. As a matter of fact, \nwhat this bill does is continue the program in a significant fashion. \nWhat it does do that is different, in its main point, is give States \nthe discretion to run that program, and it has some big differences in \nthis area.\n  The first and biggest difference is that we take money that is now \nsent to the Federal bureaucracy to administer this program and put that \nmoney into programs to help the needy and help the State level \nadminister the program.\n  What we are doing with this effort is saying that it is no longer \ngoing to be a Federal bureaucracy that dictates to the States and the \ncounties how to run their programs. We are going to give many of the \ndecisions and administration of programs to people on the line, and the \nresources of the program will be diverted away from the bureaucracy \ntoward those people in need and toward those people who actually run \nthe program. It does make a difference. It puts more resources in the \nhands of the people who can make a difference and help those in need.\n  The second thing it does, I think, that is so important and why I \nthink it would be a mistake to turn back to the past is this: In the \npast, we have precluded people from being able to develop effective, \nviable programs on the local level. I will simply give an example in \nColorado. My own county, Weld County, had a program that had the impact \nof reducing welfare rolls by a substantial amount during the first \nmonth of operation. It was an experimental program. \n\n[[Page S 12786]]\n\n  It ended up with a substantial number of people having viable, \nsubstantive jobs that improved their lot in life and set them on the \npath toward getting out of poverty. It was one focused on job placement \nand opportunity, not subsistence and welfare.\n  Those who truly needed the assistance got it, but those who had the \nability to work and the desire to work were delighted to have the \nopportunity to work, and that is what the program did.\n  What happened to that program? It was shut down, and it was shut down \nbecause it did not satisfy the demands of the Federal bureaucrats that \nruled.\n  That is what this bill is all about. This is about giving your local \ncounties and cities and States the ability to design programs that \nreally work. If you believe Washington has all the answers, you will \nnot want to do that. If you believe in centralized planning and \ndecisionmaking in the few hands of people in Washington, DC, that they \ncan make a better decision than the people on the line, why, you want \nto oppose the Dole amendment, you want to oppose the Republican \nproposal. What is at stake in this measure is the ability to give the \nStates and the cities and the communities where these programs are run \nthe ability to change welfare.\n  I do not think there is anyone in this Chamber who would come forward \nand say they are proud of the results of the war on poverty. Men and \nwomen, Democrats and Republicans, liberal and conservatives all look at \nthe numbers and they know that the number of people in poverty has gone \nup under the war on poverty, not down. They know that in spite of \nspending hundreds of billions of dollars, literally trillions of \ndollars since the war on poverty started, that poverty is a bigger \nproblem today than it was when it started. Part of it is because the \nkind of programs we designed have made people dependent on Government \ninstead of being designed to help make them independent and give them \nopportunity. That is what this bill is all about.\n  To go back to central planning, I think, would be a mistake, and that \nis why this bill is a good one, because it gives broader decisionmaking \nto a greater number of people and gives flexibility to the States. It \nredirects the resources so that more of it goes to the recipients and \nthe people who run the program and less to bureaucrats.\n  Third, Mr. President, I want to make a point I think is very \nimportant when people cast their vote on the amendment that is going to \nbe before us. One of the things that sabotaged welfare reform in 1988 \nwas some amendments that were added at the last minute. Those \namendments involved an effort to outlaw referrals to work. I know most \nMembers are going to say, ``What, making it illegal to refer people to \nwork?'' But that is literally what the law did.\n  I think most Members of the House and the Senate would be surprised \nif they knew those measures were in it. I remember the battle very \nwell, because I was in a position of the ranking Republican on the Ways \nand Means Committee that worked on that. There were three provisions \nadded to the bill in the House that restricted referrals to work.\n  One, the most damaging, literally says that a State may not refer \nsomeone to a job in the municipal government or State government unless \nthat job is an entirely new program. In other words, if they simply \njust have a vacancy in a program where they have a real job that \nperforms real services for real pay and you have a welfare recipient \nwho is able to fill that job, they are not allowed to put that welfare \nrecipient to work in that job.\n  What it has done is sabotage much of the efforts to turn this program \naround. You can look in the Green Book that catalogs the welfare \nprograms. If you will look at the rhetoric of the 1988 bill, the line \nwas that we have required either work or education or training, the \nemphasis being on work. But when you look at the results, what we find \nis that only 4 percent of the people on welfare in the JOBS Program are \nin a job or work activity. What you literally have done is create a \nprogram that was sabotaged by that prohibition on work.\n  Now, Mr. President, the major focus of the Dole amendment and the \nRepublican bill that has come out of committee, the No. 1 item that I \nthink has value over and above everything else, is the repeal of the \nprohibition on work; the repeal of that statute that makes it illegal \nto refer welfare recipients to existing job openings. It is a tragic \nmistake that was incorporated into our laws in 1988. It is a tragic \nmistake that has sabotaged our efforts to help those who are poor among \nus turn their lives around. Tragically, the amendment before us does \nnot fully correct that error. In other words, if you vote for the \nDaschle amendment, you will be voting to continue some of the \nprohibitions on work.\n  Right now, the Finance Committee bill, and the Dole amendment, repeal \nthe prohibitions on work. If you wipe those out with this weaker \namendment, you wipe out the major tool that I think can turn the \nwelfare system around.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to make sure I am clear on this. In current law, \nthe Senator is suggesting that if there is a job opening which a \nwelfare recipient could qualify to do, and someone wants to hire the \nwelfare recipient in a work program for that position, they cannot \nrefer that person for the job; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. The statute is very clear. They cannot refer them to it \nunless it is an entirely new job, a new organization, a new department, \nor new bureaucracy.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I own a company, a small business, and I want to \nhire a welfare recipient, they cannot refer that person unless it is a \nnewly created job?\n  Mr. BROWN. They can if it is a private company. But they cannot with \nregard to a city or State job.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. A city or State job. If you have a job available in the \nhighway department holding a sign up--we have all seen that--and you \nwant to refer a welfare recipient to that job, you cannot do that \ntoday; is that right?\n  Mr. BROWN. Under today's law, you could not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Under the Daschle proposal, could you refer that \nperson?\n  Mr. BROWN. My understanding is--and perhaps Members will correct me \nif I am wrong--in that amendment, they do not fully change that \nprohibition. On its face the amendment appears to repeal the \nprohibition, but it in fact continues it in a more subtle form.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. ``Where are the jobs,'' I hear. We are not allowed to \nrefer them to the jobs. Under our bill, we would create the opportunity \nfor those referrals. Under their bill, they prohibit job placements.\n  Mr. BROWN. They keep in place a major impediment to placing men and \nwomen on those jobs.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Would the Senator like a response?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Daschle Work First provision says that you \ncannot fire an individual who is working in order to replace that \nworker with someone currently receiving public assistance. That is \ncorrect. So your reference to a new job means the job is not currently \nheld by a worker, a person already in the private work force.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate that. Let me say I agree with the Senator \nthat somebody should not be fired to be replaced by a welfare \nrecipient. But the statute on the books now--and that is repealed by \nthe committee proposal--is one that makes it illegal to refer someone \nto an existing opening. Now, the purpose of that might be to protect \nsomebody from being fired--I have no problem with that--so that you \ncould replace them with a welfare recipient. I assume the concern is it \nmight cost less. I have no problem with that.\n  I have a problem with the tragedy that has occurred since 1988, and \nthat is prohibiting people from being referred to those jobs which are \nnormally open, saying the only ones you can refer them to are brand new \nagencies or bureaucracies. That is the basic concern I have about the \namendment before us, which I believe is the No. 1 item that was a \nproblem with the 1988 bill.\n  I will mention that I offered an amendment on the floor of the House \nto instruct the conferees to repeal from the bill those prohibitions on \nwork. \n\n[[Page S 12787]]\nThat measure passed by a large majority in the House of Representatives \nat the time. It was a measure that, unfortunately, though, the \nconference committee in 1988 chose to retain in the bill, and it has \nhad continuing devastating affects on the abilities of young men and \nwomen to turn their lives around from poverty.\n  It seems to me that what we ought to be doing with the welfare reform \nbill is looking for ways to help people get out of poverty, instead of \nhaving a program that keeps people in poverty. What we have done to \npeople under the existing program is create a program that makes it \nvery difficult to get out of poverty, to leave it, to turn their way of \nlife around. What we have done in some States is create a level so \npeople have to take a pay cut if they go to get a job. Tragically, \nsometimes the bureaucracy in these areas has chosen not to refer people \nto baseline jobs, beginning jobs.\n  The Denver welfare office, which I have visited several times, is a \nlarge office that employs over 1,000 people working on welfare-related \nprograms at one location. Obviously, Denver is not as big as many of \nthe cities represented here on this floor right now. But the attitude, \ntragically, in many of those areas is that you should not start at some \nof the basic jobs, that you should only refer people to jobs that start \nat $8 or $9 an hour, or $10 an hour.\n  Mr. President, let me mention that I think it is terribly important \nfor people to understand that the way you do well in our economy is you \nstart off on the ladder, and you climb it rung by rung by rung. You do \nnot start off at the top. You do start off and work your way up by \ndoing a good job in each responsibility that you have. One of the \nthings I did while in high school was work 40 hours a week. I worked as \na gardener, a busboy, and a janitor. Those jobs were jobs that helped \nme get better jobs. I think around this country, what men and women \nfind is an opportunity--work means an opportunity for them to improve \ntheir way of life.\n  What we have had is a welfare program in the past that has sought to \nisolate people from an opportunity to get started. What we need more \nthan anything else in the way of welfare reform is a program that \nunderstands its purpose and its function, and its focus ought to be to \nhelp people get out of poverty, not keep them in it. It ought to be one \nthat has a different image of people. It ought to recognize that some \npeople do need help, and we will provide that. But many people want, \nmore than anything else, an opportunity. They want, more than anything \nelse, a way to find a job, to prepare for the skills, and help to begin \nthat process.\n  I am proud that in the welfare reform bill that came out of the \nFinance Committee, there are many ingredients that I think will help \nturn this around. The biggest one, other than repealing the prohibition \non work, is allowing our communities to take a hand in running and \ndesigning these programs. Pueblo County in Colorado designed an \noutstanding program that showed superb results. Unfortunately, it was \nshut down by Federal regulators because it did not fit their idea of \nwhat would work and what would not work. I know San Diego County in \nCalifornia has done a number of experiments that were successful in \nhelping people turn their lives around. Unfortunately, they could not \nbe continued because they did not fit the Federal role model and \nguides.\n  We have seen Jefferson County in Colorado come forward with a very \nprogressive program. I am proud to say that I think many of the bills \ntalked about here will give them the flexibility to move ahead with \nthat. But part of this is understanding that central planning, \ncentralization of decisions, centralization and controlling all welfare \nprograms, does not work. The package that has been put together since \nthe war on poverty began has increased poverty, not reduced it. It has \nreduced opportunity for people. So we have an opportunity, in this next \nweek, to pass what I think will be the single most important bill we \nwill consider in this session of Congress, and that is one of changing \nwelfare, changing it from a program that locks people into poverty to a \nprogram that is designed to help people out of poverty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. I \nthank the Senator from Colorado for his excellent remarks. I thank him \nfor the great work he has done on not only this legislation but really \nin getting us here. He mentioned that he has been the ranking member on \nthe Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, which is a position I was fortunate enough to serve in for 2 \nyears. I know on that committee he worked to set a lot of groundwork \nfor us to work on welfare reform that we did in the House, which became \nH.R. 4, that passed, and added tremendously, even in last year's \ndebate, by introducing his own bill last session\n to reform the welfare system and again move the ball forward on this \nsubject.\n\n  I want to pick up on this issue of worker displacement because I do \nnot think we got the full answer. I am reading from the bill, section \n485 of the bill. Subsection (C) talks about nondisplacement.\n  ``In general, no funds provided under this Act shall be used in a \nmanner that would result in the displacement of any currently employed \nworker''--I accept that as meaning maybe someone who would be fired--\n``or the impairment of existing contracts for services or collective \nbargaining agreements.''\n  Well, what does that mean? It means that if you have any position \nthat is a part of a collective bargaining agreement or contracted \nservice, which just about every city and State position is part of a \ncollective bargaining agreement, you cannot fill that. Any unionized \nemployee whose position is vacant cannot be filled by a welfare \nrecipient. This is a blatant bow to organized labor, saying we will not \ntake that person who holds that sign on the construction project that \nsays ``stop'' and ``slow,'' that is in most cases a contracted service, \nan existing contract for service; that is a position that is filled by \nthe contractor for the State government and cannot be filled by a \nwelfare recipient; someone who works in the State bureaucracy, who is a \nmember of a union. I imagine you could do this if you became a union \nmember and got off welfare, but if you are in a work program, you \ncannot fill that job. You cannot be referred for that job under the \nDaschle-Breaux position.\n  It is a fancier way of saying--I know they were very uncomfortable \nwith coming out and saying we do not want to allow people to be \nreferred, because I got a lot of heat on that, but this is a backdoor \nway of accomplishing the same thing.\n  So I think we should tell it like it is. It is very clear here that \nalmost all city and State jobs, which are almost all unionized jobs \nwith the exception of political appointments, what we are talking about \nhere is not allowing to replace vacancies.\n  I think that is, as the Senator from Colorado very eloquently stated, \none of the biggest impediments to moving people off welfare into jobs \nin which they can later become productive, is this prohibition. It \nremains in the Daschle bill. I think it is a serious flaw in the \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Section 486 of the bill does provide for the \nplacement of people in employment. I wish to correct the statement. I \nhope the misimpression that was given that the Daschle substitute \nprohibits people from being placed in public-sector employment--it does \nnot prohibit welfare recipients from being placed in public-sector \nemployment. What it does provide, as the Senator correctly noted, is \nthat it has to be done according to the rules, and the rules which are \ncollective bargaining agreements and others. It does not prohibit the \nplacement of welfare recipient in the public sector.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, it did not, except there are no \npublic-sector jobs other than the jobs we are talking about in which \nyou could be placed. It sort of is giving with one and taking away with \nthe other. The end result, there will not be public-sector jobs the \nwelfare recipients will be referred to. That is a very serious flaw in \nthis amendment that is being put forward by the Democratic leader.\n  I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Virginia. \n\n[[Page S 12788]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes remaining on the side of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and 2 minutes remaining on the Daschle \nside.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that I be recognized \nfor 12 minutes to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the unanimous-consent agreement, \nat 3:30 there is to be 15 minutes available to the Democratic leader \nfollowed by 15 minutes available to the majority leader.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield the remaining 4 minutes on the \nRepublican side to the Senator from Virginia and he can use the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. ROBB. I ask that I be recognized until such time as the leaders \ncome to reclaim the time under the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Work First plan offered \nby our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this important legislation because I believe it \nboth establishes firm boundaries to combat welfare dependency and \nprovides beneficiaries with genuine economic opportunity.\n  George Bernard Shaw once said, ``The greatest of our evils and the \nworst of our crimes is poverty.''\n  And it is unconscionable, Mr. President, that in America today we \nhave nearly l6 million children living in poverty. In l993, almost 30 \npercent of all children under age 3 lived in poverty and almost 50 \npercent of all African-American children were poor.\n  Between l989 and l993, the number of children receiving food stamps \nincreased more than 50 percent and in l994 25 percent of our Nation's \nhomeless were children under 18.\n  For the world's greatest democracy (where the value and the freedoms \ninherent in each individual citizen are unparalleled anywhere on earth) \nthese statistics portray both a moral dilemma and an economic burden of \nenormous consequence.\n  We have not only an obligation to improve the quality of life of \ngenerations of innocent children shadowed by poverty, but also a \nresponsibility to our taxpayers to both improve our welfare system and \nto reduce the billions of dollars in lost productivity incurred each \nyear as a result of current poverty levels.\n  Mr. President, there are infrequent moments in time where \nconstructive and meaningful solutions can be found to otherwise \nintractable problems. I honestly believe we have before us such a \nmoment, and I hope we do not let this opportunity slip from our grasp.\n  At a minimum, we do not want to let politics, or public opinion \npolls, or fears of 30-second sound bites on the evening news prevent us \nfrom doing what is right.\n  And to do what is right, Mr. President, we have to rethink our \nNation's social policy. We have to restructure our welfare system to \nfoster greater upward mobility, to reconnect the poor to the mainstream \njob market, to reward self-discipline and hard work, to encourage \nfamilies to stay together, and to restore to the poor and the \ndispossessed both the benefits and the obligations of citizenship.\n  I believe the Work First plan meets those objectives.\n  With a 2-year time limit on benefits for adults--and a 5-year \nlifetime limit--this bill transforms welfare into the short-term safety \nnet it was meant to be. It contains the funding necessary to allow an \nindividual to both sustain a family in the short-term and secure and \nkeep a job in the longer term. That is the definition of real welfare \nreform, Mr. President.\n  In reality, single mothers need child care to work, and the Work \nFirst plan guarantees that child care. In reality, families need \nextended Medicaid coverage to bridge the gap created by entry-level \njobs with little or no benefits--and the Work First plan makes Medicaid \navailable for an additional 12 months.\n  By addressing the practical obstacles to independence which so many \npoor families encounter today, the Work First plan provides incentives \nto shatter current barriers and allow individuals to move up the \neconomic ladder.\n  And very importantly, Mr. President, those who cannot find a private \nsector job under the Work First plan are put to work as well, either \nthrough workfare or community service. In fact, within 7 years of \nenactment, nonexempt individuals are required to participate in \ncommunity service jobs just 6 months after joining the welfare rolls.\n  Two years ago, Mr. President, I joined our former colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Boren, in supporting legislation similar to the old \nWorks Progress Act, which placed into public service jobs AFDC \nrecipients who had completed the JOBS Program and still remained \nunemployed. Requiring that those individuals work for their benefits \nappeals to my sense of what the shared contract between a society and \nits people should encompass.\n  Only by providing useful work--and the values and discipline \nassociated with work--can we offer the poor and the disadvantaged a \npermanent way out of poverty. I believe everyone benefits from the \nsense of self-worth that earning wages and contributing to his or her \ncommunity engenders.\n  When we require beneficiaries to work we give them job experience--\njob experience that can open doors and bridge the gap between \ndependency and genuine economic opportunity.\n  The Work First plan is tough medicine, Mr. President, but I believe \nit establishes a pragmatic, compassionate process to lift many of our \npoor citizens out of poverty and into the economic mainstream.\n  And while I believe the Work First plan moves us firmly in the right \ndirection, I have some serious concerns about the alternative plan \noffered by the Majority Leader.\n  First, it guarantees neither adequate child care nor extended health \nbenefits. How can we require poor women to go to work without ensuring \nthat their young children are watched over and protected?\n  Second, CBO estimates that States will need to collectively spend an \nadditional $5 billion by the year 2000--$5 billion above what they are \npaying now--to meet the work requirements in the alternative bill. \nWhere will States get that $5 billion, Mr. President, if federal block \ngrants are frozen for 5 years at current levels? And what is more \nvitally important to successfully improving our welfare system than \neffectively moving people into jobs?\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am concerned that the alternative bill \nfails to require States to continue to contribute their historic share.\n  As a former Governor, I know that reduced State support could mean \nfinancial disaster for many cities and counties. On June l5, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors unanimously adopted a resolution opposing the \nSenate Finance Committee bill and endorsing the Work First plan, \nstating that it would ``provide significantly greater assistance--to \nfacilitate the transition from welfare to work.''\n  The transition from welfare to work--that is our goal. That is the \npurpose, the spirit, the driving force behind the Work First plan.\n  Mr. President, every time a welfare recipient earns a living wage, at \nleast one more child in America moves out of poverty.\n  Every time a welfare recipient earns a living wage, at least one more \nchild in America sees their role model go to work in the morning, earn \na salary, pay their bills, believe a little more in their own ability \nand their self-worth, and live in a world that is infinitely stronger \nbecause they contribute to it.\n  And every time a welfare recipient earns a living wage, at least one \nmore child in America escapes from what could become a cycle of \ndependency and hopelessness that is inherently unAmerican--and for \nwhich we have an obligation today to begin to break.\n  The moment, Mr. President, is before us. We have an opportunity--\nindeed, a responsibility--to help many of our most vulnerable people \nbetter attain the priceless gift of economic freedom. And we will make \nour country stronger in the future.\n  This does not have to be a partisan battle, Mr. President. Rather, it \nshould be a bipartisan effort to identify tough, effective solutions.\n  As Franklin Roosevelt said during his second inaugural address, ``In \nevery land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and \nforces that draw men together. In our personal ambitions we are \nindividuals. But in our seeking for economic and political \n\n[[Page S 12789]]\nprogress as a Nation, we all go up, or else we all go down, as one \npeople * * *.''\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join together in \nsupport of the Work First amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Democrats' \nWork First welfare reform plan, I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this proposal. Welfare reform needs to be done now.\n  Work First does what all of us want to do--it requires people \nreceiving welfare to get to work as quickly as possible. It does this \nwhile also protecting those children at risk and dependent upon the \nwelfare assistance system through no action on their part.\n  This spring, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the need to reform \nour welfare system. I related what I had learned after spending an \nentire morning at one of the busiest welfare offices in Las Vegas, the \nWest Owens District Welfare Office, observing an eligibility \ndetermination interview, and meeting with welfare eligibility workers. \nI later also visited a welfare office in Reno. The need for extensive \nand immediate reform of the current welfare system was brought home to \nme most vividly during these visits. I believe Work First gets us to \nthat needed reform.\n  The Work First alternative is self-explanatory. It puts the focus of \nthe welfare assistance program where it must be--on getting people to \nwork as quickly as possible. All able-bodied recipients go to work \nimmediately. Those who work receive the help they need to get on their \nfeet--they get an additional year of Medicaid health care coverage, and \nthey get child care assistance. And for the working poor, those trying \nto go it on their own, they get a 5-year child care phase-in to help \nensure they can permanently join the work force.\n  Work First does this, while at the same time showing compassion for \nthose in dire straits, and for those children who are at risk. It is \ntoo easy to forget in the heat of debate on this very important issue \nthat there are people, and particularly children throughout this Nation \nwho desperately, and very legitimately need welfare assistance. We want \na welfare assistance system that will be there for those truly in need, \nyet ensures that they get on their own two feet as quickly as possible.\n  My State of Nevada is the fastest growing State in the Nation. Rapid \ngrowth States like Nevada benefit tremendously from the current \nentitlement status of the Federal welfare assistance system. Today, if \na person meets the eligibility criteria, he or she is entitled to \nassistance. The entitlement protects States like Nevada which are \nexperiencing incredible population increases. As needy people move into \nthese rapid growth States, the Federal funding follows the population \nshift.\n  Work First limits the entitlement to welfare assistance. People who \nneed assistance only get it if they are eligible, and only if they meet \ntheir responsibilities. It is a time limited and conditional \neligibility. For the needy, assistance is there, but only if they do \nwhat is necessary to get to work. No longer can welfare assistance \nbecome a lifestyle.\n  Work First provides States with the incentive to create welfare \nsystems that will put people to work as soon as possible. If a State \ndoes not meet its target for putting welfare recipients to work, it is \npenalized. If a State exceeds the target, it is rewarded through a \nfunding bonus.\n  Work First, unlike the Republican proposal, does not use the block \ngrant approach. As a former Governor, I very much understand the \nattraction of block grants for Governors and their States. Quite often \nit can be a better approach.\n  But the notion that somehow block grants are, in and of themselves, \nthe answer to every problem we have with the current welfare program is \ndisingenuous. Particularly when the Republican block grant proposal \nasks States to do more with less.\n  If States are deprived of the funding necessary to do the job the \nFederal Government is sending to them through a block grant, all of the \nflexibility in the world will not enable the States to do the job--let \nalone do it better.\n  Under the Republican proposal, all States are held to their fiscal \nyear 1994 cash assistance level of Federal funding for the next 5 \nyears. How can rapidly growing States like Nevada possibly provide for \ntheir increasing number of people in need based on yesterday's funding \nlevels? And into the next 5 years?\n  And how does the block grant proposal help States face economic \nrecessions? Economic slowdowns impact welfare assistance programs \nimmediately. Working families lose their jobs through no fault of their \nown, and it can be a long time before a job is available again. These \npeople need help. And yet Nevada and the other States are expected to \nprovide for these people on an already inadequate level of Federal \nfunding.\n  Work First also recognizes that the inability to pay for child care \nis a major hurdle for the many single mothers with children who want to \nwork. It is also a problem for low-income working couples who are at \nrisk of losing their jobs because they cannot afford to pay child care \non the wages they receive.\n  Earlier this year, I observed a welfare eligibility determination \ninterview which involved a young woman, who was working, and married \nwith two young children. Both she and her husband had jobs paying above \nthe minimum wage, yet they could not provide a living wage for their \nfamily of four.\n  Her employer kept her work hours to no more than 20 hours per week, \nso she was ineligible for job provided health care benefits. One of her \nchildren had a preexisting medical condition, so medical care was a \nnecessity. The cost of child care for the two children was making it \nimpossible for both her and her husband to continue to work, and still \nhave enough earned income left to live on. Here is a couple trying to \nmake it on their own, and they cannot.\n  Work First recognizes the vital importance of child care assistance \nto help welfare recipients get off welfare and get to work. It also \nrecognizes that the many working poor, like the family I just \ndescribed, also need child care help--for awhile--to enable them to \nstay in the workforce.\n  The Republican welfare reform proposal, however, deals with this \nissue by repealing child care assistance programs which today serve \napproximately 640,000 children. There is no guarantee that any State \nwill provide funds to implement a child care assistance program.\n  If it is truly our goal to get people into the workforce permanently, \nthen we must give these people the help--for a limited time--that will \nenable them to get there. Repealing the very programs that provide this \nassistance is not the answer.\n  This June, I introduced my Child Support Enforcement Act legislation \nmodified from my bill last Congress to help further strengthen our \nability to get dead beat parents to responsibly provide for their \nchildren. I am pleased Work First includes many of the same provisions.\n  No one who shares the responsibility for bringing children into this \nworld should be allowed to shirk that responsibility later by refusing \nto admit paternity or by failing to pay child support.\n  We all lament the increasing number of unwed teenage girls who have \nchildren. This situation is particularly disheartening when these young \nmothers are themselves mere children. But too often in the past, our \npublic policies to try to stem this increase have focused solely on the \nmother and ignored the responsibility of the father. Those fathers, who \nmany times have already walked away before their children are even \nborn, must face the reality of their parental and financial \nresponsibilities.\n  Although Nevada is the fastest growing State in the Nation, its \npopulation is comparatively small with about 1.6 million people. Yet \nits State Child Support Enforcement Program had 66,385 cases in fiscal \nyear 1994, and collected $62.7 million of child support. Unfortunately, \nthe total owed was almost $352 million, leaving an uncollected balance \nof almost $290 million. Already by April this year, Nevada's caseload \nhad grown to over 69,000 cases.\n  These cases represent only those children whose families are \nreceiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or who are using the \nservices of the county district attorney offices to enforce child \nsupport. The many Nevadans using private attorneys are not \n\n[[Page S 12790]]\nincluded. This scenario is repeated in every State across the country.\n  The facts are simple. Nationally, one in four children live in a \nsingle-parent household. But one of the most startling statistics is \nthat only half of these single parents have sought and obtained child \nsupport orders.\n  This means 50 percent of these single mothers either have been unable \nto track down the father, have not pursued support, or are unaware of \ntheir legal child support enforcement rights.\n  Of the parents who have sought out and obtained child support, only \nhalf receive the full amount to which they are entitled. This means 25 \npercent of the single parents who have child support orders actually \nreceive nothing at all.\n  These facts should concern us. It is all too true that many single \nparents must seek public welfare assistance in order to be able to \nsupport their children. When we taxpayers are asked to lend a helping \nhand to these children, we should be assured every effort is being made \nto require absent deadbeat parents meet their financial \nresponsibilities to those same children. Public assistance should not \nbe the escape valve relied upon by those parents who want to walk away \nfrom their children.\n  My child support enforcement legislation and Work First provide the \nmeans to help shut that escape valve. Both provide States the authority \nto withhold or suspend occupational and professional licenses; Work \nFirst also includes drivers' licenses. Both allow the denial of \npassports to noncustodial parents for nonpayment of child support. Both \nprovide for the reporting of child support arrearages to credit \nbureaus. Both require custodial parents cooperate with paternity \nestablishment and enforcement of child support as a condition of \nreceiving cash assistance. The authority to collect child support from \nFederal employees and members of the Armed Services is enhanced by both \nmeasures. Full faith and credit of child support orders is improved, \nand States are required to adopt laws to void fraudulent transfers by a \nperson owing child support.\n  Work First also allows States to prohibit noncustodial parents--the \nparents who owe the child support--from receiving food stamp \nassistance. So much of our efforts to establish and collect child \nsupport fall on the custodial parent--the parent who cares for the \nchildren and tries to make ends meet. This provision provides another \nway to find noncustodial parents and ensure they meet their child \nsupport obligations.\n  We must give our courts and law enforcement agencies the tools they \nneed to crack down on delinquent parents. The goal is not to drive \nthose who want to meet their obligations to their children away, but \nrather to make sure those ignoring their children understand that \nsociety will not tolerate their irresponsible behavior.\n  We must assure taxpayers who lend the helping hand to impoverished \nsingle mothers and their children that every effort is being made to \nget deadbeat parents to pay up. We must ensure the children receive \nadequate and consistent child support, so they are able to have the \nopportunity to become successful, productive, and healthy adults. For \nmany single parent families, if they could receive the child support \npayments they are entitled to, it would make the difference between \nbeing able to maintain their financial independence, and having to seek \nwelfare assistance.\n  I do support the Republican welfare reform requirement that all food \nstamp recipients, both the custodial and the noncustodial parent, \nparticipate in child support enforcement efforts as a condition of food \nstamp eligibility. This requirement to participate in child support \nenforcement efforts needs to be extended to all welfare and public \nassistance programs.\n  During my visits with Nevada eligibility workers, over and over again \nI heard about problems with the Food Stamp Program eligibility \ncriteria. Work First deals with those problems. People eligible for \nfood stamps, without children, are required to work or get training to \nwork as a condition of receiving benefits.\n  Although the Food Stamp Program is criticized, it has provided the \nmost basic safety net--food--for those in need, particularly in times \nof recession. The Republican proposal, however, would give States the \nirrevocable option to put their food stamp funds into a block grant. \nThis option requires States spend 80 percent of these funds on food \nassistance. The other 20 percent is left to the States to use as they \nwish. Again States are held to the higher of either their fiscal year \n1994, or the average of their fiscal year 1992-94 expenditures as their \nfunding level under the block grant approach. How can this option \npossibly provide a dependable minimal safety net for those who are most \nvulnerable to economic downturns? food stamp funds should go for food; \nthat is too basic a human need to play with.\n  Good as Work First is, there are some problem areas of the current \nwelfare system that it does not address. I will be proposing a welfare \nfraud amendment to prohibit welfare recipients who commit welfare fraud \nfrom being unjustly enriched because of that fraud. There are times \nwhen an individual, whose benefits are reduced because of an act of \nfraud, games the system by using his reduced monthly income to generate \nadditional benefits from other assistance programs. When welfare \nrecipients are overpaid benefits, we need to allow the welfare system \nto intercept Federal income tax refunds to recover such benefit \namounts.\n  We need a welfare system that does not allow people to think that \nreceiving welfare assistance is an option they can choose to take when \nit is convenient. We all read in the Washington Post of the young, \nunmarried, working woman who made a conscious decision to have a child, \nvoluntarily left her job, and then applied for and received welfare \nassistance. Her rationale was that she had worked, and now the system \nowed her support while she stayed home to care for the child for its \nfirst 3 years.\n  Millions of single mothers get up every morning, get their children \nready for school or child care, and go off to work, and we should \nexpect no less from those receiving welfare assistance. No one should \never think welfare assistance is going to be there for them because \nthey voluntarily leave their jobs, or decide to have a child and want \nto stay home to care for it.\n  Americans are a compassionate people. They are always there to help \npeople who are genuinely in need. They care deeply about our country's \nchildren. The outpouring from the hearts of Americans across this \ncountry in response to the Oklahoma Federal building bombing verified \nthat compassionate nature a thousand fold.\n  But most Americans are a hard-working lot, too. The vast majority of \nAmericans are out there every day going to work--doing their best to \nprovide for their families on their own. And many of these hard-working \nAmericans are single mothers who are the sole breadwinner for their \nchildren, who pay for their own child care, and who struggle to make it \nby themselves. It should come as no surprise when these hard-working \npeople feel a bit taken advantage of when they see able-bodied people \nrelying on the welfare assistance program.\n   The welfare system must be substantially changed. On that we all \nagree. We all agree too that there will always be people who will need \nthe safety net welfare assistance provides at some time in their lives. \nBut the net should be there only for a limited time, so people get back \non their feet and permanently into the workforce.\n  Work First will change the welfare system. It lets hard-working \nAmericans know that we recognize their frustration with those who abuse \nthe welfare system. It lets Americans in need know that conditional, \ntime-limited assistance is there to help them if they meet their \nresponsibilities to get to work as soon as possible. And it does this \ncompassionately by protecting our most vulnerable citizens. Work First \nmay not have all the answers, but it will get us well down the road to \na more fair welfare assistance system.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ndebating welfare reform. And, I want to take a few minutes to discuss \nmy views on the matter.\n  It is obvious to almost everyone--including those on welfare--that \nthe current welfare system is broken.\n  Too many welfare recipients spend far too long on welfare and do far \ntoo little in exchange for their benefits. Many of those who manage to \nget off the welfare rolls only end up back on \n\n[[Page S 12791]]\nthem after a short period of time. And, for some, generations have made \nwelfare their way of life.\n  This is unacceptable. And, I believe that trying to fix the problem \nthrough patchwork solutions is no longer an option--it will only fall \nshort of what needs to be done. Instead, we need to end the current \nwelfare system--scrap it and start over. And, the new program must have \nas its fundamental premise one basic thing: work.\n  Back in 1987, I proposed a work requirement for all welfare \nrecipients. And, many of those ideas were embodied in the Family \nSupport Act of 1988--the bipartisan legislation crafted by Senator \nMoynihan. It was a good first step. But, it is evident today that the \n1988 law did not go far enough.\n  It is time--it is long past time, really--for us to require welfare \nrecipients to work for their benefits.\n  We must make it unmistakably clear that welfare recipients have an \nobligation to make every effort to end their dependency. Citizenship is \nmore than just a bundle of benefits. It is also a set of \nresponsibilities. And, the primary responsibility is to provide for \nyourself and your family by working.\n  Now, when I say ``work,'' let me be clear about what I mean. I mean \nwork. I do not mean participation in bureaucratic programs. I do not \nmean participation in ``work activities.'' I mean real work. I mean a \njob.\n  And, if a private sector job cannot be found, welfare recipients \nshould still be required to work, giving back to the communities where \nthey live by doing community service work.\n  In short, the new rule of the game must be this: In exchange for a \nwelfare check, you do something for your benefits. You work. The \ngovernment will help with child care and some job training, if needed. \nBut, all adults on welfare should be working. The culture of welfare \nmust be replaced with the culture of work.\n  Let me be specific.\n  First, we should require all welfare recipients to sign a contract in \nwhich they agree to work in exchange for their benefits. Those who \nrefuse to sign should not get benefits.\n  Then, welfare recipients should have to look for a job immediately. \nThey should have up to 6 months to find a job in the private sector. \nSix months, period.\n  Those who refuse to look for work should not get benefits. And, those \nwelfare recipients who are not working at the end of 6 months should \nwork in a public sector job or do community service work--or give up \ntheir welfare benefits.\n  No more free lunches. No more free rides.\n  And, Mr. President, there should be no more permanent claim on public \naid. Working for a welfare check--and everyone should work for their \ncheck--must be temporary. Welfare recipients must eventually work for a \npaycheck.\n  Do not get me wrong. Temporary assistance is the right and humane \nthing to do. We should not abandon welfare entirely. All Americans must \nbe secure in the knowledge that if something unexpected happens to \nthem--the death of a spouse, the loss of a job, the burning down of \ntheir house--that help will be there.\n  But, welfare must no longer be a way of life. We do no favors--\nincluding for the welfare recipients themselves--by keeping people on \nwelfare indefinitely. We must get people off of welfare--and keep them \noff. Welfare dependency must be replaced with self-sufficiency and \npersonal responsibility.\n  So, we should limit adults to 5 years of welfare, returning the \nwelfare system to its original intent--a system of temporary \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, a mandatory work requirement and a 5-year time limit \nsound tough. And, they are. It is time for some tough measures.\n  But, in the process we must be realistic. If welfare is truly to \nbecome a two-way street--if our goal is to move welfare recipients into \nwork and not just out onto the streets--then we cannot ignore the issue \nof child care.\n  For a family living in poverty, the costs of child care can eat up \nalmost 25 percent of their income. Expecting welfare recipients to \nwork--demanding that they work--will not work without child care. The \nwork simply will not pay. Welfare recipients will either go to work and \nleave their children alone --or not go to work at all. No one--no \nmatter how poor--should be asked to choose between their job and their \nchildren. Not only is child care the right thing to do--but, without \nit, welfare reform will fail.\n  In creating a new welfare system, we must recognize this reality by \nmaking sure that child care is available for the children on welfare \nwhen their mothers are working. In addition, we must recognize that \nmany of those who leave welfare only to return later do so because they \ncannot afford child care. We should allow States to provide 2 years of \nchild care assistance for those who have left welfare. And, we should \nmake all low income working families eligible for child care \nassistance--regardless of whether they had ever been on welfare.\n  Mr. President, let there be no doubt. We must be strict with the \nadult recipients of welfare. But, at the same time, we must be \ncompassionate toward the children.\n  Two-thirds of those on welfare are children--and we should not blame \nthem or punish them for being born into poverty. More than one in every \nfive children in America today is born poor. That's one poor child born \nevery 40 seconds. And they were given no choice in the matter. \nAbandoning these children--and they are all of our children--is \ntantamount to abandoning our future.\n  That is why I believe we must guarantee child care. And, that is why \nwe should, while limiting adults to 5 years of welfare, keep the safety \nnet for children.\n  If a parent is kicked off of welfare, the children--the innocent \nchildren-- should continue to receive assistance for food, housing, and \nclothing. But, that assistance should be provided for the children \nthrough a voucher to a third party--not cash to the parents. In other \nwords, adults should not be able to live off of their children's \nbenefits.\n  The point here is that we should provide nothing for adults who do \nnot work, but we should protect the children who are not to blame.\n  Finally, in all of this talk and debate about welfare mothers, let us \nnot forget that there are two adults involved in creating a child. \nThose who bring children into the world should support their children--\nand that includes the deadbeat parents, who are mostly dads.\n  They should be forced to pay child support, and tough child support \nenforcement must be a part of any welfare reform effort. Getting tough \non the deadbeat dads must be as high a priority as getting tough on the \nwelfare mothers. Remember, every dollar not paid in child support is \nanother dollar the Government may have to pay in welfare benefits.\n  Since 1992, when I was appointed to a Senate Democratic task force on \nchild support enforcement, I have argued that fathers who do not work \nand do not pay child support should be required to take a job--just as \nwelfare mothers should be required to work. Absent parents who have \nfailed to pay child support should be given a simple choice. They could \nstart paying what they owe their children. Or, they could take a \ncommunity service job in order to earn the money they owe their \nchildren. Or, they could go to jail. But, what they should no longer be \nable to do is to abandon their children.\n  Mr. President, I am absolutely committed to passing a tough welfare \nreform measure that emphasizes work and personal responsibility--but \nprotects children in the process and maintains a safety net for all \nAmericans who need temporary help.\n  In evaluating the options, I believe that Senator Daschle's \nproposal--the Work First Act--comes closest to meeting my goals. The \nWork First plan strikes an appropriate balance. It requires work and \nimposes a 5-year time limit. It guarantees child care and a temporary \nsafety net for all Americans. It is tough on both welfare mothers and \ndeadbeat dads.\n  I believe that the Daschle proposal is real welfare reform. And, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important, \nsignificant, and long overdue overhaul of our welfare system.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we continue the debate on welfare \nreform I would like to begin by restating some things that I talked \nabout before we recessed in August.\n  I believe it is important for people to understand that there is \nagreement on one issue here--the need to reform the welfare system. We \nmay have differences of opinion about the best way \n\n[[Page S 12792]]\nto accomplish it, but on the central issue, there is agreement.\n  There is not a single member in this Chamber who believes that \nwelfare system is a success. It is failing the taxpayers and it is \nfailing the people who rely on it.\n  I had great hopes that we would be debating welfare reform \nlegislation that enjoyed broad bipartisan support. In fact, I had \nwritten to the two leaders asking that a bipartisan task force be \nappointed to find our common ground.\n  Mr. President, neither party has cornered the market on good ideas \nand sound solutions. Only by having voices from all segments of the \npolitical spectrum, can we arrive at sound legislation developed by \nusing common sense.\n  Unfortunately, the Dole amendment was negotiated behind closed doors \nwithin the Republican caucus. The result is legislation that is strong \non ideology, and short on true reform. Without changes, I fear the \nDole-Packwood proposal may well replace one failed, dependency inducing \nwelfare system with many varieties of the same.\n  Unfortunately, I vividly recall the last prolonged economic downturn \nthat gripped Iowa during the farm depression and accompanying deep \nrecession in agricultural States and communities. The economy began to \nsour in 1981 and did not truly begin to turn about for the State until \nabout 1987. That experience has forever changed the economic landscape \nof Iowa. Good jobs are gone and will never return.\n  Those were very difficult years, but contributions provided by a \npartnership with the Federal Government allowed my State and others in \nthe Midwest to recover. One of the most serious shortcomings of the \nDole amendment is that it severs this important partnership.\n  Mr. President, today, we are debating an alternative that has been \nproposed by the Democratic leadership. Unlike the pending Dole \namendment, the Daschle Work First Act will, in fact, truly reform the \nwelfare system. And in the process, will reduce the deficit by $20 \nbillion.\n  The Work First Act abolishes the current giveaway welfare system and \nreplaces it with a conditional, transitional benefit. Let me repeat \nthis since many seem to misunderstand--a conditional, transitional \nbenefit.\n  This proposal is not tinkering as some suggest. It is true, \ncomprehensive, real reform\n of an obsolete, failed system.\n\n  Welfare as a way of life will no longer exist. There will be no more \nunconditional handouts. Parents will be required to responsibility from \nday one and must do something in return for the welfare check. Failure \nto do so, will have consequences.\n  The Democratic leadership proposal starts with the following goal--to \nget welfare recipients employed and off of welfare. And then develops a \ncomprehensive plan to make it happen.\n  You can't accomplish the goal unless you do certain things. That's \njust common sense. First, you have to take care of the kids. Second, \nyou have to make sure that people have the skills and education \nnecessary to get and keep jobs. Finally, there is no free ride, no more \ngovernment hand outs.\n  We will provide a hand-up. But individuals on welfare must accept \nresponsibility from day one and grab on to that helping hand. If not, \nthen there will be no check.\n  A central element of the Daschle bill is the requirement that all \nfamilies on welfare must negotiate and sign a contract that spells out \nwhat they will do to get off of welfare. Failure to meet the terms of \nthe contract will result in the termination of the cash grant.\n  A binding contract, like that included in the Daschle bill, is \ncurrently in place in Iowa. And it works.\n  Over the past 22 months I have met with a number of individuals about \nthe Iowa Family Investment Program. Time after time I hear welfare \nrecipients say that no one ever asked them about their goals. No one \nsat down and talked with them about what it takes to get off of \nwelfare.\n  Welfare recipients rightfully assumed that no one cared if they \nstayed on welfare indefinitely. That was the message of this obsolete \nsystem which kept welfare moms at home, while most other moms were \nemployed outside the home.\n  There is a new message being delivered in Iowa now. Welfare is a \ntransitional program and people must be working to get off the system.\n  And the welfare picture is changing in Iowa. More families are \nworking and earning income. There are fewer families on welfare. And \nthe State is spending less for cash grants.\n  But we can't get from here to there without recognizing the magnitude \nof the problems facing most of the families on welfare. No skills. No \neducation. No one to take care of the kids.\n  At a hearing on the Iowa welfare reform program, Governor Terry \nBrandstad said, ``There has been much recognition that welfare reform \nrequires up-front investments with long-term results. * * * ''\n  Iowa has begun to make those investments, in partnership with the \nFederal Government. And those investments are beginning to yield fruit \nin the form of reduced expenditures for AFDC grants.\n  The Work First bill also recognizes that child care is the linchpin \nto successful welfare reform. We cannot require welfare recipients to \nwork, if there is no place to put the kids. Placing children in harm's \nway in order to make the parents work in unacceptable. The Daschle bill \nrecognizes this reality.\n  Instead of simply slashing welfare and dumping all of the \nresponsibility and all of the bills on to States and local taxpayers, \nthe Daschle plan represents real reform and real change.\n  Like the Iowa plan, Work First demands responsibility from day one. \nAnd it ends the something-for-nothing system of today with one that \ntruly turns welfare into work.\n  It is built on the concepts of accountability, responsibility, \nopportunity, and common sense. It will liberate families from the \nwelfare trap.\n  And it will strengthen families and help today's welfare recipients \nfinally walk off the dead end of dependence and on the road to self-\nsufficiency.\n  The Daschle Work First bill is a pragmatic, common welfare reform \nproposal and should be adopted. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me commend the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia for his excellent statement and the support he \nhas provided this legislation. His input and his participation has been \ninvaluable on this issue, as it has been on so many others. I am very \ngrateful for that.\n  Let me reiterate my gratitude as well for the assistance and \nleadership provided by the distinguished senior Senator from New York, \nand the Senators from Maryland, Louisiana, and so many other Senators \nwho have had a vital role to play in bringing us to this point. As we \nhave said now for the last couple of days, our intent in offering this \namendment is to hold out the hand of partnership to Republicans in \nbringing forth a proposal that Democrats as well as Republicans could \nsupport to bring about meaningful welfare reform. That is our goal.\n  There are four fundamental aspects of that goal that we view to be \nvery important. First and foremost, we expect, we want, we propose real \nreform.\n  Second, we recognize that real reform is not possible without an \nappreciation of the need to provide more opportunities for work than \nare provided today.\n  Third, we must protect children. We understand that we cannot provide \nopportunities for work, we cannot truly engage in any kind of effort to \nencourage people to leave their homes, we cannot ask a mother to be \nseparated from her children, without also ensuring that her children \nare going to be cared for.\n  Finally, all of us must recognize that South Dakota is different from \nNew York, is different from Michigan. There ought to be, first, \nflexibility, and, second, the realization that the last thing we want--\ngiven that this Senate has put itself on record in opposition to \nadditional unfunded mandates--is to ask States to do things without \nadequately ensuring that the funding is there to get them done right.\n  Those are the four goals: Real reform, work, children, and \nflexibility through an opportunity to sensitize people to the needs and \nthe resources necessary in the States themselves. \n\n[[Page S 12793]]\n\n  We have had a good debate in the last couple of days about many of \nthese goals and how they relate to each other. The reality is different \nthan the rhetoric we have heard on many occasions during this debate.\n  First, there is a fundamental difference between our approach and the \nRepublican approach with regard to work. The Work First plan \nfundamentally redefines welfare as we know it by putting a great deal \nof emphasis on ensuring that the skills can be provided, but ensuring \nas well that we have the resources to do the job.\n  The Republican plan, on the other hand, simply boxes up the problem \nand ships the current system to the States. It tells the States, ``You \ndo it. You find a way to ensure that we can come up with some magical \nsolution to all these goals, but we are not going to allow you the \nresources adequate to get the job done.'' Boxing up the plan and \nsending it out is no solution. Providing the necessary infrastructure, \nproviding the resources, and ensuring a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States truly is.\n  Second, we recognize, as I said in articulating the goals of our \namendment, that we need to ensure that mothers have the capacity to \nwork, that young mothers in particular have the resources--and from \nthat the confidence--that they will need to go out and seek jobs, to go \nout and obtain the skills, to go out and get the counseling, to go out \nand get the education to ensure that at some point in their lives they \ncan be productive citizens with the full expectation that they are \ndoing this in concert with those of us who want to work with them to \nsee that the job gets done right.\n  We recognize that if we are going to reach this goal of putting \npeople to work, if we are going to ask a mother to leave the home, if \nwe are going to ask a young mother in particular to leave her children, \nthen, my heavens, how long does it take for every Member of this \nChamber to realize as well that child care is the linchpin to making \nthat happen? Protecting children is what this is all about; if we do \nnot protect children, if we do not ensure that the children are cared \nfor, there is no way they are going to leave home.\n  So it seems to me this is exactly what we have to produce in this \nChamber prior to the time we finish our work on welfare reform: A \nrealization that protecting children, caring for those kids as mothers \nleave for work, is an essential element of whatever welfare reform we \npass.\n  The Republican plan ignores 9 million children. It has been aptly \ndescribed as the ``Home Alone'' bill, because there simply are not the \nresources, the infrastructure, the mechanism, the will on the part of \nmany on the Republican side of the aisle to address this issue in a \nmeaningful way.\n  We simply cannot be willing to leave child care as the only aspect of \nour need to address the cares of children. We must also recognize, as \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee has said on \nso many occasions, that we must address the problem of teenage \npregnancy. While we do not have all the answers to teenage pregnancy, \nwe must recognize that there is a need there. We must try to address \nthe problem in a meaningful way. There is a responsibility for us to \ncare in whatever way we can, ensuring that teen parents get some \nguidance, ensuring that teen mothers are given an opportunity to work \nthrough the challenges they face as young mothers. We do that in the \nWork First proposal.\n  We do not claim to have all the answers to teen pregnancy. No one \ndoes. No one can possibly tell you, unequivocally, here is how we are \ngoing to stop teenage pregnancies. But we can say that teen mothers \nhave to begin taking responsibility. We can say that we have some \ninitial steps in providing them with an infrastructure and with a \nmechanism by which they can be productive mothers first, workers \nsecond, or students third. This amendment does that. This amendment \naddresses the realization that unless we begin to put the pieces \ntogether in working with teenage pregnancy, recognizing we do not have \nthe answers, we are never going to solve the problem at all.\n  The Republicans have used quite a bit of their time to say that, \nsomehow, this is a plan run out of Washington. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. The truth is that the Work First plan is specifically \ndesigned to give States the flexibility that they need to do whatever \nit takes in their States, to recognize that in South Dakota we have a \ndifferent set of circumstances than we might have in Florida or \nCalifornia.\n  You heard the charge that somehow our plan is weaker on work than the \none proposed on the other side, but the truth is the Work First plan is \nstronger than the current Dole bill as it has been proposed. Our \namendment requires community service after 6 months. The Republican \nplan calls for no work until after 2 years. Our amendment provides for \nresources to help mothers go to work. The Republican plan is $16.5 \nunderfunded. They say our plan may have too many exemptions from the \ntime limit. The truth is that both plans have exemptions. The \nRepublican plan has a 15-percent exemption, arbitrarily set.\n  As I said last night, if we use every one of the criteria specified \nin our amendment, including mothers who have young children, disabled, \nthose people who work in high-unemployment areas, if we have in some \nway used up all of that 15 percent and still find young mothers who \nhave children, are we then to say to them, ``I'm sorry, we have \narbitrarily set the line at 15 percent. You happen to be in the 16th \npercentile. You have to go to work?'' I do not think anyone wants to \nsay that. That is why we believe using selective criteria makes a lot \nmore sense, why giving States the flexibility makes a lot more sense. \nSo, indeed, that is what we have attempted to do, to recognize that \nStates need flexibility, but to recognize, too, that there are certain \ncategories of people who simply may not be required, because of the \nextreme circumstances in which they find themselves, to fit the neat, \ndefined descriptions that we have laid out in this amendment concerning \nthe time limit.\n  So, Mr. President, the Work First proposal is real reform. The Work \nFirst amendment goes beyond rhetoric and meets the reality of reform. \nThe Work First amendment does what we say is important if indeed we are \ngoing to redefine welfare. It provides the opportunity for work. The \nWork First amendment provides for child care and child protection in \nways that are essential to the well-being of the future of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the Work First amendment recognizes that we are not \ngoing to do a thing unless States have the resources, and unless we \nshare those resources in a meaningful way, giving maximum flexibility \nto the States to decide how to use them.\n  Maybe that is why the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed one \nwelfare reform proposal. They have endorsed Work First because they are \nthe ones who are going to be charged with the responsibility of \ncarrying out what we do here. So the mayors understand all of this. \nThey have said, on a bipartisan basis: We want the Work First plan. \nLocal officials have also endorsed one plan. Local officials have \nindicated they, too, understand the consequences of no funding, \nunderstand the importance of child care, understand the importance of \nproviding maximum flexibility, understand the importance of funding and \nreal work. And they, too, support the Work First proposal.\n  Organizations of all kinds have come forward to say this is the kind \nof legislation they want us to pass. The Democratic Governors have said \nagain, as late as this morning: This is what we want; this is what we \nneed. This will do the job.\n  Mr. President, it has been a good debate. I am hopeful that, as so \nmany have expressed on the Senate floor in the last couple of days, we \ntruly can find bipartisan solutions to the challenges we face in \npassing meaningful welfare reform. This is our best good-faith effort \nto accomplish meaningful reform, to reach out to our Republican \ncolleagues and say join us, to reach out across the board to Democratic \nand Republican Governors alike and say join us, to reach out to all of \nthose people currently on AFDC who want to find ways out of the boxes \nthey are in and say join us. We are providing new opportunities, new \nsolutions, and even new hope for people who need it badly.\n  Let us hope as a result of the passage of this amendment this \nafternoon that we can begin our work in earnest to ensure that the \nreality of welfare reform \n\n[[Page S 12794]]\ncan be realized at some point in the not too distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I inquire about how the time is divided \nat this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point, all time has expired. But 15 \nminutes of time has been set aside at 3:45 for the majority leader \nunder a previous unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \non his way, I understand I can take a couple of minutes of his time to \nmake a brief statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, our time for debate on this amendment is \nrunning out. So I will keep these remarks brief and to the point.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Daschle-Breaux substitute. I \ndo not question the good motives behind it. I consider it a thoughtful \nattempt to break out of the welfare status quo--something which all of \nus want to accomplish.\n  But I do not believe it does the job, at least not the way the \nAmerican people want it done.\n  For starters, it retains authority and decisionmaking about welfare \nright here in Washington. And it does so at a time when the States are \nseizing the initiative with far-reaching experiments and demonstration \nprojects. Instead of fostering that process, by returning both \nauthority and resources to State and local taxpayers, the Daschle-\nBreaux amendment would retain the whole mechanism of Federal \nmicromanagement.\n  The substitute amendment talks a good fight on two fronts: with \nregard to work requirements and a time limit for receipt of welfare. \nBut in both cases, there are so many provisos and loopholes and \nconditions and exceptions that we couldn't expect significant progress \nover the status quo.\n  We have had work requirements on paper before, with impressive \nparticipation rates mandated by various times certain. What we need now \nis sufficient flexibility for the States to reach those goals in their \nown ways. The substitute amendment does not give it to them.\n  Nor does it offer hope of turning the tide against illegitimacy. That \nmay be its most important shortcoming. There is already a national \nconsensus that illegitimacy is the key factor that drives the growth of \nwelfare. It is the single most powerful force pushing women and \nchildren into poverty.\n  A welfare bill that does not frontally address that issue--that does \nnot make reducing illegitimacy rates a central goal--is simply not \ncredible as welfare reform.\n  Another touchstone of true welfare reform is whether a bill removes \nor retains the entitlement status of welfare. It seems to me that the \nDaschle-Breaux substitute merely replaces the current AFDC entitlement \nwith a new, or newly designated, entitlement, supposedly time limited.\n  That is not even incremental change, and it cannot get us where the \nNation needs to go in modernizing, streamlining, and reforming our \nprograms of public assistance.\n  I hope that our colleagues who, for one reason or another, plan to \nvote for the substitute amendment will, thereafter, keep an open mind \nand open options about the Republican welfare bill this amendment seeks \nto replace.\n  It is a large package of very comprehensive welfare reform. But I \nthink it can significantly improve our present system and move us \ntoward genuine welfare reform. It points the way toward the radical \nchange that is needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against Daschle-Breaux and let us move \ntoward the adoption of the Dole welfare reform package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dole approach \non the welfare bill. We must restore workfare to our welfare program. \nThe system of welfare that we have in this country was set up in the \nearly 1960's. I remember well the war on poverty, and the intentions \nwere good. But the result has been our inner cities have had \ngenerational welfare. The same thing has happened on our Indian \nreservations. We all want to help people who need help. But we must \nrestore the principle of workfare. That is what the Dole bill does.\n  Also, we must turn over to our States more of this responsibility, \nbecause the States can judge who deserves welfare better. We now have \nall these Washington bureaucrats with the entitlement programs, \nsituated in Washington, DC, making judgments on who should be on \nwelfare in South Dakota or California. Under this new legislation, \nunder this reform, there will be workfare and the States will decide \nwho gets welfare. That will save the taxpayers money. But more \nimportantly, it will reform our welfare program so we will have a real \nwelfare program that helps the people who need it and requires people \nto work who are able to work. It is time for reform in welfare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized under the \nprevious unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to thank all my colleagues for their \nwork, and my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Packwood, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, who spent a lot of work on the floor just in the past few \ndays and who has done a great job helping us a lot in the conferences \nthat we have had in an effort to resolve some of the differences on our \nside.\n  I am prepared to say I think most of the differences have been \nresolved on our side because we have tried to base our bill on three \nprinciples: Creating a real work requirement, returning authority to \nthe States, and restraining welfare spending.\n These principles are key to reaching our goal of dramatic reform that \nprovides work, hope, and opportunity to Americans in need.\n\n  The amendment before us proposed by the Democratic leader fails to \nmeet these principles. The Democrats call it Work First, but in fact, \nit is ``weak first''--weak on work, weak on limiting welfare \ndependency, weak on State innovation, weak on savings, weak on real \nreform.\n\n\n                         real work requirement\n  Let me just say, any bill that comes before us that is going to pass \nthe Congress and, hopefully, any bill signed by the President is going \nto have a real work requirement in it which requires able-bodied \nwelfare recipients to find a job, not stay at home and not stay in a \ntraining program forever, because when it comes to escaping poverty we \nknow the old American work ethic is true. Work works. And States, not \nthe Federal Government, must provide the work requirements. However, we \nmust hold them accountable.\n  Our bill requires--and even there are some on our side who think our \nbill does not go far enough, but our bill requires 50 percent of all \nwelfare recipients to engage in work in fiscal year 2000. And that is a \nfairly high barrier to cross when you consider the young people and \nelderly and disabled unable to work.\n  Our colleagues on the other side put a number of loopholes ahead of \nreal work. The Federal Government would exempt 25 percent of all \nwelfare participants and only 50 percent of the remaining 75 percent of \nthe welfare caseload would be expected to work by fiscal year 2000. The \nbottom line is the Democrats' plan requires only 37 percent of able-\nbodied recipients to work in fiscal year 2000.\n  By comparison, the Republican plan requires 50 percent of all welfare \nrecipients to work in fiscal year 2000. We leave the business of \nexemptions to the people who know best, the closest to the problem. \nThat is the States, the Governors, the State legislators.\n  We believe States should design and run their own work program. And \none thing is certain about welfare reform. No Federal bureaucrat will \never come up with a blanket program which works equally well in all 50 \nStates. Through block grants to States and not waivers, the Federal \nGovernment can provide resources to fight poverty without imposing the \nrules and regulations that ban innovation. \n\n[[Page S 12795]]\n\n  I am reminded of a statement by the distinguished Governor of \nWisconsin, Governor Thompson, when he was speaking with seven or eight \nof our colleagues in my office here, oh, maybe 4 or 5 weeks ago, and \nsome were insisting that we continue to add strings. Whether they are \nconservative strings, they are strings. And the Governor said, I think \nmaybe in a little bit of frustration, that he was also an elected \nofficial; he was elected by the same kind of people we are, and that \nnobody in the State of Wisconsin was going to go without food or \nmedical care.\n  We have to give the Governors credit for some integrity and ability \nand a willingness to do the right thing when it comes to welfare. And I \nthink that is generally the case, whether it is a Democrat or \nRepublican Governor, a Democrat or Republican State legislature; they \nare closer to the people.\n  We have not tried this. There probably will be some horror stories. \nThere always are going to be a few cases where maybe a few things will \ngo awry, but they go awry now.\n  We give the States broad latitude to adopt the programs to meet the \nvaried needs of their low-income citizens. The other bill does not \nallow States to take over welfare programs. It replaces one set of \nFederal rules and regulations with new ones, and States that want to \ninnovate must continue to come to Washington, ask for a waiver, wait, \nwait, wait, and finally get a waiver. We do not think that should be \nnecessary. We believe States ought to be able to innovate; there ought \nto be a lot of flexibility. And I tell you that we have confidence in \nthe Governors, again, in both parties.\n  Local welfare administrators and caseworkers must get recipients off \nwelfare and into the workplace. To encourage results, the Republican \nbill imposes a State penalty for failure to meet participation rates. \nThere would be a 5-percent reduction in the State's annual grant. Under \nthe Democrats' bill, a first-time State failure to meet the \nparticipation rate would simply require the HHS Secretary to make \nrecommendations to the States for improving them.\n  The local welfare administrators and caseworkers need to focus on \ngetting welfare recipients into the mainstream and not focus on \nunnecessary Federal bureaucracy and regulations. Therefore, the \nRepublican bill delivers welfare dollars to the States directly from \nthe Treasury and reduces the Federal welfare bureaucracy.\n  Able-bodied recipients must work to support themselves and their \nfamilies. To accomplish this, we require recipients to work as soon as \nthe State determines that they are work ready or within 2 years, \nwhichever is earlier. Moreover, our bill imposes a real 5-year lifetime \nlimit on receiving welfare benefits.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have a work ready provision with \nmany exemptions. Moreover, their bill fails to impose real lifetime \nlimits on welfare benefits by offering even more loopholes. For \nexample, a welfare recipient who has three children while on welfare \ncan get up to 7 years of benefits before reaching the 5-year limit. \nEven then, that recipient would still remain on the welfare rolls \nentitled to certain benefits and receiving vouchers, without a time \nlimit, in place of cash benefits.\n  The Democrat bill even provides exceptions to these weak time limits, \nturning major cities into welfare magnets. If a welfare recipient lives \nin an area with an unemployment rate exceeding 8 percent, none of the \ntime spent on welfare counts toward the so-called 5-year limit. That \nwould turn cities that have relatively high unemployment rates like New \nYork, Los Angeles, Washington, Philadelphia, Detroit, and many others \ninto time-limit-free zones.\n  But I think the most important thing is that we want to return \nauthority to the States. And we believe there is an opportunity to do \nthat. We want to give the States the flexibility. The Governors want \nthat. Republican Governors want that, and I think many Democratic \nGovernors want that. And that is why the majority of the Nation's \nGovernors on the Republican side want that.\n  I noticed Governor Wilson yesterday disagreed with our bill. He was \nnot at the Governors' meeting. Had he been there, I think he might have \nendorsed it. I have written him a letter to explain the bill so he will \nbetter understand it because he has it all confused with some of the \nothers. But I think 28 or 30 of the Governors, with the exception of \nGovernor Wilson, support our bill, and we believe it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  I hope that after the bill of the distinguished leader on the other \nside, Senator Daschle, is disposed of, we can then start debate and \nfinish action on this bill no later than 5 o'clock Wednesday. We \nbelieve there will be amendments on each side. We have some amendments \nwe cannot work out. The ones we cannot work out we will bring up and \nhave a vote and determine what happens. So it seems to me that we are \non the right track.\n  The Republican leadership plan eliminates the individual entitlement \nand replaces it with a capped block grant of $16.8 billion a year.\n  I would say, finally, the Democrat plan proposes to replace AFDC with \na bigger, more expensive package of entitlements costing the taxpayers \nover $14 billion more than AFDC over the next 7 years, including \nsubsidies to families with incomes as high as $45,000 per year.\n  The Republican bill no longer will continue the burdensome rules and \nrequirements that accompany the old jobs program. The Work Opportunity \nAct repeals the jobs program and lets the States design real work \nprograms.\n  The Democrat plan keeps many provisions of AFDC and the jobs program \nas a Federal entitlement and renames it the ``Work First Employment \nBlock Grant.''\n\n\n                       restrain welfare spending\n\n  No program with an unlimited budget will ever be made to work \neffectively and efficiently. Therefore we must put a cap on welfare \nspending.\n  The Republican bill saves $70 billion over 7 years. The Democrat bill \nsaves only $21.6 billion over the same period of time.\n  Mr. President, because it is weak on work, weak on limiting welfare \ndependency, weak on State innovation, weak on savings, weak on real \nreform, the Democrat bill fails the test to real reform. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  So I think overall, although I know there is a desire of everybody in \nthis body to do something about welfare, we know it has failed. \nNotwithstanding the best efforts of many to make it work, it has not \nworked, and it is time that we take a hard look at dramatic reform. \nThat is precisely what we intend to do. The Work Opportunity Act of \n1995, in my view, is a step in that direction.\n  I will indicate to my colleagues that following the vote on the \nDemocratic substitute, we will ask consent at that time that all \namendments that people might offer, they notify the managers today and \nthen, if we can get the consent, those amendments would have to be \noffered by 2 o'clock tomorrow.\n  I have had a discussion about this with the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle. I have not made the request yet, but I do not believe \nhe disagrees with our intent. Our intent is to move as quickly as we \ncan to complete action, giving everybody all the time they want for \ndebate, offer the amendments they wish to offer, but, hopefully, \nconclude action on next Wednesday afternoon.\n  I would say that initially we had about 70 amendments on this side of \nthe aisle. In my view, that would have probably boiled down to about 10 \nor 12 amendments that may require rollcall votes. I am not certain the \nnumber of amendments on the other side. But it is my hope that we can \nreach some agreement so it would not be necessary to file cloture, that \nwe go ahead and debate the bill, then finish the bill at the earliest \npossible time and go on to something else.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Vote On Amendment No. 2282, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair and the majority leader.\n  I think many of you are aware of why I am here today. I am aware of \nthe dishonor that has befallen me in the last 3 years, and I do not \nwant to visit further that dishonor on the Senate. I respect this \ninstitution and my colleagues too much for that.\n  For 27 years, I have worked alongside Bob Dole, Ted Stevens, and a \nfew others from that era, and most of all with Mark Hatfield, who is \nnot just a colleague but a friend of almost 50 years and who I met when \nI was a teenage Young Republican. He was a bright, young, yet unelected \nlegislator, who turned out to be my teacher, mentor, and friend.\n  There have been many successes in these 27 years, some failures, some \nfrustrations. Let me remember a few, if I could have your indulgence. \nHell's Canyon, that great gash in the Earth that is the boundary \nbetween Idaho and Oregon with the Snake River running through it, the \ndeepest gorge in the United States. In the late 1960's, early 1970's, \nfor about 6 years, we had a battle on trying to stop a dam from being \nbuilt in the gorge and at the same time to create a national recreation \narea. There is humor I see in this, and I smile at some of the \nnewspaper stories I have seen recently about business lobbyists writing \nlegislation.\n  I want you to picture this trip. We are on a raft trip in the river. \nI had been invited by environmentalists, most of whom I did not know. I \nhad not seen the gorge before. They wanted me to see it and become \ninvolved in the saving of it. One night around the campfire, I believe \nit was Brock Evans who, I think, is now with the Audubon Society, then \nwith the Sierra Club--we had a highway map of Oregon and Washington, \nand he takes out a marking pen, and he says, ``I think this is where \nthe boundary is.'' He draws it. Somebody said, ``What about those \nminerals in Idaho.'' So he crosses it out and draws that up here. That \nbecame the boundaries.\n  The humor was--realizing this is drawn with a marking pen--that when \nyou take it to the legislative counsel's office, if he says here--do \nyou know how many miles that is? If he would say, ``Where are these \nboundaries?'' I would have to smile and say, ``You will have to call \nBrock.''\n  There was truck deregulation, an arcane subject that is probably \nsaving consumers more money than anything in deregulation that we have \ndone. Abortion, early on, was a lonely fight. I remember in 1970, 1971, \nwhen I introduced the first national abortion legislation, I could get \nno cosponsor in the Senate. There was only one nibble in the House from \nPete McCloskey, who did not quite come on as a sponsor. There was a \nnibble 2 years before Roe versus Wade. Those were lonely days.\n That is not a fight that is even yet secure.\n\n  Israel, and my trips there, the golden domes, the fight that so many \nof us had made year after year to keep that bastion of our heritage \nsafe and free, and to this date not guaranteed.\n  Tax reform in 1986. We were up against the verge of failure. The \nHouse had passed a middling bill. I was chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. Every day we were voting away $15 or $20 billion in more \nloopholes.\n  I finally just adjourned the committee and said, ``We are done.'' I \nremember Bill Armstrong saying, ``We are done for the day?'' And I \nsaid, ``No, we are done for the session, we will have no more \nsessions.''\n  Bill Diefenderfer, my counsel, and I went to the Irish Times for our \ntwo famous pitchers of beer. Those were the days I drank. I quit \ndrinking years ago. I know why they call it courage--by the time we \nfinished a second pitcher we drafted out on the napkin an outline and \nreally said, OK, they want tax reform, we will give them tax reform.\n  Here is an example where this body can move when it wants to move. \nFrom the time that committee first saw the bill until they passed it in \n12 days, Pat Moynihan was a critical player. The six of us met every \nmorning at 8:30 before the meeting. It passed the Senate within a \nmonth. So when people say this body cannot move, this body can move.\n  Maybe some of the best advice I had came from Bill Roth, successor to \nJohn Williams, years ago, when he used the expression--we were having a \ndebate in those days about the filibuster and cloture and how many \nvotes. In those days I was in favor of lowering the number. I am not \nsure, even though we are in the majority I would favor that now, from \ntwo-thirds to 60 votes. John Williams said we make more mistakes in \nhaste than we lose opportunities in delay.\n  If something should pass, it will pass. It may take 4 or 5 years. \nThat is not a long time in the history of the Republic. Too often in \nhaste we pass things and have to repent.\n  So for whatever advice I have I hope we would not make things too \neasy in this body and slip through--I say that as a member of the \nmajority.\n  Tuition tax credits, a failure. Pat Moynihan and I introduced the \nfirst bill in 1977, and have been introducing it ever since. Its day \nmay come. It may be here.\n  One of the great moments of humor--you have to picture this \nsituation--was in the Carter administration. They were terribly opposed \nto this tuition tax credit bill. Secretary Califano testified against \nit twice in the Ways and Means Committee. Came to a Finance Committee \nhearing and Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Dick Warden \ncame to testify. He had previously been with the United Auto Workers \nand was hired on as a lobbyist, basically for Health and Human \nServices--HEW as it was called then.\n  Thirty seconds into his testimony, Senator Moynihan leans forward and \nsaid, ``Mr. Warden, why are you here? Why are you here?''\n\n[[Page S 12797]]\n\n  Mr. Warden goes, ``Why, I am the Assistant Secretary for Legislative \nAffairs for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and I am \nhere representing the Secretary, the administration.\n  Pat goes, ``No, no, Mr. Warden, I did not do the emphasis right. Why \nare 'you' here? Secretary Califano testified twice in opposition to \nthis bill in the House. In this committee, where there is a more \nfavorable climate, where is the Secretary today?''\n  Mr. Warden goes, ``Why, I think he is in Cleveland speaking.''\n  Pat goes, ``Well, where is the Under Secretary? Why is he not here \ntoday representing the administration? Mr. Warden, why?''\n  ``I am not sure.''\n  And Pat's voice rising, saying, ``Where is the Assistant Secretary \nfor Education? Mr. Warden, I was in the Kennedy administration when \nthat position was created and I can say that man has utterly nothing to \ndo at all. He could be here testifying today. Mr. Warden, I will tell \nyou where they are. They are up on the eighth floor of their building, \ncowering under their desks, afraid to come and testify on the most \nimportant piece of education legislation introduced in this century, \nand Mr. Warden that is why you are here. Now, please go on.''\n  Poor old Mr. Warden barely went on.\n  I had more humor in education from Pat than probably anybody here.\n  Friendships beyond count. The camaraderie is unbelievable. I look at \nJohn Chafee sitting back here, my squash partner. His secretary, about \nevery 3 months, kicks out our squash matches. Over 15 years, 202 to \n199. His secretary not only kicks out the matches, but the games and \nthe scores within the match. John every now and then presents it to me, \nback we go, back and forth, back and forth, and evenly matched as you \ncan be.\n  Some here--Senator Byrd would, Senator Exon would--some in my age \ngroup will remember General MacArthur's final speech at West Point: \nDuty, honor, country.\n  It is my duty to resign. It is the honorable thing to do for this \ncountry, for this Senate.\n  So I now announce that I will resign from the Senate, and I leave \nthis institution not with malice but with love, good luck, Godspeed.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the political nightmare that has faced \nmy colleague now for almost 3 years is coming to an end.\n  I think in an ordeal of this type we tend to focus on the negative or \nthe causes for leading to resignation. As he has briefly reflected on \nthe many accomplishments that he made during his service not only here \nin the Senate but services he rendered to the State of Oregon as a \npolitical leader, as a legislator, I like to accentuate the positive.\n  I must say in my many years of teaching political science I never had \na more brilliant student than Senator Packwood. Came to the university \nas a freshman and he immediately established himself as one who is \nknowledgeable about politics and is willing to engage in politics and \nto invite other people to be involved in politics.\n  I had been in the State legislature for about 6 years and had known \nhis father who was one of the chief lobbyists in the legislature \nrepresenting the utilities industry. If Fred Packwood told you \nsomething, you knew it was true and you knew it was prudent. He \nestablished himself as one of the outstanding lobbyists in that \nlegislature. I knew his mother.\n  Therefore, I speak even though there may be only but 10 years \nseparating our ages, as sort of a long friend, perhaps partially a \nmentor, and most of all, someone whose friendship I cherish.\n  Mr. President, when young Bob Packwood became engaged in political \naction leading to his political career as an elective officer, he \nlaunched a whole new style of campaigning in my State, best described \nas a slogan ``People for Packwood.''\n And he did not have to pay a high price to some kind of a public \nrelations firm to come up with that kind of a focus that epitomized his \nwhole style of campaigning. He thought it out. He demonstrated, again, \na brilliant mind in his political activities.\n\n  We were going through one of those wrestling matches in the \nRepublican Party that we are still going through and perhaps we will \nalways go through, and that is the wrestling between the so-called \nliberal wing and the conservative wing. At that particular time the so-\ncalled party machinery was pretty much in the hands of conservatives in \nour State, and the moderates felt that they were not being well \nrepresented within the party structure. So Senator Packwood, at that \ntime, organized what was called the Dorchester Conference. And in the \nDorchester Conference he invited many Republicans who represented the \nmiddle, the center, and said we have to epitomize the pluralism of our \nparty, both in our heritage and in our practice in current time. And he \nlaunched that forum which is still going on in my State after all these \nyears, almost 30 years.\n  So I say to my colleague that you have your footprints, you have your \nimprint of legislation in the political life of our State, and your \nrecord can never be changed on that basis of your contribution.\n  I would like to come, then, to that very dramatic moment when Senator \nPackwood decided that he would venture forth as a Republican candidate \nagainst the impregnable, the undefeated Senator Wayne Morse, for the \nU.S. Senate. He was a sacrificial lamb. He was one who was going to \nfill out the ballot because we wanted to have a Republican candidate in \nevery position on that ballot.\n  I remember that campaign very well because I had known Senator Morse \nas a Republican. I had campaigned for Senator Morse as a Republican. I \nknew Senator Morse's great abilities, and I still respect the \ncontribution that former Senator Morse made to this country, \nparticularly in areas of peace and war.\n  But I remember, too, that when Senator Packwood suggested a debate \nwith Senator Morse--and we all know, for those of us who remember him, \nhe could make you believe black was white and white was black. In terms \nof his eloquence and his tenacity as a debater, he was without peer in \nthe U.S. Senate, from those comments made not just by Republican \nMembers, but by Democratic Members alike. And so Senator Packwood not \nonly suggested but challenged him to a debate.\n  That is not terribly dramatic, in a sense. But Senator Packwood said, \n``And we will only have 2 minutes to answer a question.'' Any of us who \nwere friends and knew Senator Morse, he could not tell you what the \nweather was outside in 2 minutes, because he would attack the subject \nfrom its historic context, he would attack the subject from its social \ncontext, from its political, from its economic--he would give you the \nwhole ball of wax, so to speak, and an hour and a half later you got \nthe answer.\n  And that was a very dramatic debate because it was televised. But the \ntelevision people did not just put the television camera on the face. \nThey realized that what was happening here was a defeat in the making, \nbecause on the sides of the podium, Senator Morse's hands began to \nshake with uncertainty, realizing he was being cut off before he ever \ngot to the second sentence of an answer. And it was probably one of the \nmost historic if not the most historic political debate in my State's \nhistory.\n  At that point the pundits were all saying: Aha, this young man coming \nalong challenging this veteran and sage of Oregon politics, having been \nboth a Republican and a Democrat and being elected to the U.S. Senate \nas a Republican and as a Democrat both. And that launched Senator \nPackwood's career here in the Senate.\n  He has many credits in his record. It does not mean that Senator \nPackwood and I have agreed on every issue. He is pro-choice. I am pro-\nlife. That has divided us in terms of an issue, but not in terms of a \nfriendship. He has respected my position. I have respected his \nposition. And that was, again, one of the characteristics of Senator \nPackwood throughout his political life in my State and in the U.S. \nSenate. He was not a prisoner to dogma. He looked at the issue, he \nwould make his assessment, and he would take his position.\n  I want to say with all due respect to all of my colleagues that I \nserve with today and those I have served with \n\n[[Page S 12798]]\nover almost the 30 years that I have been here, I have known no \ncolleague that is his peer in taking a complex issue such as a tax \npackage, dissecting it, analyzing it, and explaining it so that the \naverage citizen out there watching the proceedings could understand. He \nhas demonstrated that time and time again. I not only give him that \naccolade; he has certainly been a role model for me to be more brief \nthan I have a tendency to be, having grown up in a profession that had \na 50-minute lecture.\n  So I just want to say to my dear colleague, I wanted to take just a \nfew moments to focus on a record that cannot be expunged, and that in \nthe total man, and the total person, and the total picture I hope we \nwill be not only considerate of that record and recognize that record, \nbut also recognize that he is a fellow human being. Even though the \nmedia and the public often treats us as objects, we are human beings \nwith emotions and with feelings. And I want to say, as a fellow human \nbeing, I rise to give these few remarks with a sad heart, for I hurt \nwith Senator Packwood in this particular moment. I count it a privilege \nto not only have him as a friend for this length of time, but I look \nforward to many more years of friendship.\n  In closing, I want to say this lady sitting next to Senator Packwood, \nElaine Franklin, has been his right arm through battles and victories \nand disappointments. And when I was looking at a rather dismal \nsituation in my last election, she took her leave time and her \naccumulated vacation and came out to the State of Oregon and engaged \nfull time in my campaign for reelection. Even though that was a close \nelection, I have to pay tribute to Elaine Franklin for her role in \nhelping to make it a victory. I think that is part, again, of the \nperson picking key people, able people, as the Senator did in Elaine \nFranklin.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a minute or two. I think \nSenator McCain wanted to say a word.\n  I think the Bob Packwood we heard today is the Bob Packwood that many \nof us have known over the years. I remember in 1968, Bob Packwood \ncalling me. We were both running for the Senate for the first time. He \ncalled me, I think, late at night or early in the morning. We talked \nabout each winning, about coming to the U.S. Senate. I came from the \nHouse. He came from State political office. We ended up on the same \ncommittee, the Finance Committee--a very important committee. It had a \nnumber of outstanding chairmen--Senator Long was there for a long time, \nand I was there for a short time; then Senator Bentsen, Senator \nMoynihan, and Senator Packwood.\n  I want to underscore what the senior Senator from Oregon just stated. \nI do not know of anybody who is a quicker study and can explain in \ndetail so that I can understand it, and others can understand it--\nwhether it is Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, capital gains, whatever it \nis--anything in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I believe my \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle will acknowledge that Bob \nPackwood has no peer.\n  I can think of many, many times when he was able to bring us \ntogether. I am not talking about bringing together Republicans, but \nDemocrats and Republicans, because of his explanations and illustration \nof forceful arguments. And he knew the issue. We have served together, \nnot always agreeing on every issue, but serving together over the years \nand have been good friends over the years.\n  I know some may be pleased today, and some may not be pleased. But I \nbelieve that Senator Packwood when he said duty, honor, and country \nmeans precisely that. He has great respect for the Senate and has \nalways had great respect for the Senate.\n  As soon as there was this report from the Ethics Committee yesterday \nthere were all kinds of questions and speculation about what will \nhappen now?\n  I believe Senator Packwood has made the right decision. I believe \nthat a protracted debate in the Senate may not have changed anything. I \nmust say I think it is very severe punishment. I remember one case here \nwhere a Senator, charged with certain things, came to the Senate floor \n6 months after it was reported by the Ethics Committee, but not after a \ntrial and not after conviction on three counts.\n  Having said that, I think Senator Packwood has made the correct \ndecision. It is not easy. It has not been easy. It is always easy when \nyou are criticizing, but it is not as easy when you are taking it. We \nall know that. We have been on both sides.\n  But I must say that I have watched Senator Packwood the last 24 hours \nand wondered myself how he was able to carry on. But then, again, I \nknow Bob Packwood. This is not the end of Bob Packwood's career. He \nwill continue to make a difference in the lives of many, many \nAmericans. He only cited a few things. We can cite pages and pages of \nlegislation that bears his name or bears his name along with colleagues \non the other side, bipartisan, nonpartisan, in some cases partisan. He \nis a hard worker--nobody ever suggested otherwise--loyal to his party, \nloyal to his constituents, and loyal to his leaders.\n  So I would just say that obviously he deserves some time to get \neverything in order. It takes a little while around here to do things. \nI am not certain. He did not state an effective date. But I guess my \ncolleagues would say some reasonable time would be allowed--even by the \nsharpest critics.\n  I look at the legislative record of Senator Packwood and add it all \nup. And I think about the many times he stood on this floor in this \nplace, right here, offering amendments or debating amendments that \naffected somebody somewhere, some child or children or homeless, or \nwhatever it might be, whatever the issue might be.\n  I would just say he has been an outstanding legislator, an \noutstanding U.S. Senator, and someone whose legacy will be around for a \nlong, long time, and a friend of mine.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about our \ncolleague, and my friend, Bob Packwood. I will not comment about the \ncircumstances that have compelled Senator Packwood to resign his \noffice. I will not speak about the merits of the case against Senator \nPackwood. I can neither reproach the Ethics Committee nor endorse their \ndecision. I was spared the burden of adjudicating this matter and it \nwould not be fair for me to criticize the result of their 3-year \ninvestigation. I know the members of the committee, and I know them to \nbe decent and principled Senators who would not take their \nresponsibilities in this matter lightly.\n  But Bob Packwood is my friend. I am proud to call him my friend. And \nI cannot bring myself to say that his departure from the Senate is \nwelcome. I surely know less about the case against the Senator than do \nthe members of the Ethics Committee, and I know that they would not \nreach their decision absent their confidence that the decision was \njust. But I cannot accept it with anything other than profound regret.\n  Nor can I comfort myself with an appreciation that the Senate has in \nthis moment comprehended something about relationships between men and \nwomen that, heretofore, male Senators are supposed to have failed to \ncomprehend. I did not feel that was the case prior to the Ethics \nCommittee's ruling, and I do not think we deserve to be congratulated \nfor suddenly evolving into more sensitive beings.\n  I cannot claim that I have treated every human being I have \nencountered in my life fairly or generously. But I am confident that \nwhether I have treated a person well or ill it had nothing to do with \ntheir gender, and I resent assumptions that all men in this institution \nrequire an object lesson made of Bob Packwood so that we might learn to \ntreat one half of humanity with dignity.\n  Thus, I cannot quietly or publicly, genuinely or falsely say that Bob \nPackwood's departure was the necessary price for us to become better \npeople. We could all become better people, but I seriously doubt the \nSenate's loss of Bob Packwood will advance us toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, let me also ask my colleagues to spare a little \nconsideration for the whole of Bob Packwood's life and career in this \ninstitution before we lapse into self-congratulation. \n\n[[Page S 12799]]\nAnd let us also recall Biblical injunctions concerning forgiveness and \nunderstanding. No matter what our views of this matter are, we can all \nrecognize that this is a sad--a profoundly sad moment--for Bob Packwood \nand for the Senate. Let us not congratulate nor celebrate a thing \ntoday. This a moment for grieving.\n  Bob Packwood is a man of great industry, intellect, and what used to \nbe called civic-mindedness. He is a patriot, a devoted servant of his \ncountry. The Almanac of American Politics accurately described him as \none of the most ``legislatively accomplished of senators with a \ndistinctive and consistent set of principles he has backed for a \nquarter century.''\n  Every Member of this body knows the extent of his accomplishments. \nThey are vast even when compared to the records of other senior Members \nof the Senate. On so many of the issues before the Finance Committee \nwhich he so ably chaired, Bob Packwood was considered the committee's \nleading expert. He has been for many years one of the Senate's most \neffective advocates for less regulation, freer trade, a simpler and \nless burdensome tax code.\n  I know that it pains him greatly to leave the Senate now that we are \nseriously addressing two problems to which he has devoted his \nconsiderable energy and ability for years--welfare reform and saving \nMedicare. Both of these urgent and complex tasks will be far more \ndifficult to resolve absent Bob Packwood's leadership.\n  But his broad intellect and keen sense of service would not allow Bob \nPackwood to limit his work to only those issues before the Finance \nCommittee. They led him to participate centrally in the debates over \nall the major issues of our time. From the environment to foreign \npolicy, Bob Packwood was a statesman--a distinguished statesman.\n  Bob is right. There is life after the Senate. And as he builds a \nsatisfying, challenging, and interesting new life--which I am confident \nhe will do--Bob can look back at his 27 years of Senate service with \nenormous pride and satisfaction. He has contributed more than most to \nthe welfare of his countrymen. He will have his regrets, as will we \nall. But he cannot but feel that his country is a better place for his \nservice to it.\n  I commend him greatly for that service; I grieve for him today; I \nregret this moment's arrival; I wish him good fortune, and say again, \nwithout reservation: I am proud to call Bob Packwood my friend.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, Bob Packwood will soon be absent from us. \nHe is also my friend. He will always be my friend. He was chairman of \nthe Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and helped to recruit me \nfor this Senate post early in the year 1978. He has been loyal, \nsteadfast, and true. And I trust that I was able to return that to him \nin earnest friendship.\n  I have prepared some notes. Many of you know me well, and when I \nreally have something to say, I write it down in my own way, no staff, \nno winging it, which has sometimes put me in a lot of trouble. But I \njust want to share a few things that come from down deep inside, and \nthey are brief. They may match some of the things said by my dear \nfriend Mark Hatfield and dear friend John McCain.\n  This remarkable career of Bob Packwood's public service will now end. \nThe political story of his life will close on its final chapter. But \nother aspects of his life will go on. And we must not, we cannot, and \nwe should not forget the extraordinary accomplishments and successes of \nthis superior legislator simply because of the maelstrom of negatives \nthat have poured forth from some who have chosen to act as judge, jury, \nand executioner, at so many levels of our society.\n  He was the man who always fought so hard for women and their rights. \nNo one can challenge that statement. He was the man who worked doggedly \nfor civil rights and fairness and empowerment for the lesser people of \nsociety. He was the man, often the only man, who carried the banner for \nwomen's reproductive rights when others were unwilling to unfurl it. He \nwas the man who fought for job equity and the crashing in of the glass \nceiling for women in this country. Every single thoughtful, activist \nwomen's group was once on his side ``through thick or thin,'' at least \nuntil recent times. Then many of them consciously and callously \nabandoned him, not willing to consider even a shred of evidence \nportraying ``his side'' of the story.\n  Now, please make no mistake here. I am not defending what Bob \nPackwood did or did not do. I do not know the circumstances of all of \nthat, only what I have read and heard. And having practiced law in real \nlife for 18 years, it is my experience to pay guarded attention to what \nI read or hear. Justice, freedom, and due process depend on various \nrules of procedure and process. There are few of such rules in the \nSenate or in the court of public opinion.\n  The Ethics Committee of the Senate was established partly to avoid \nthe travesty of a trial by the media. That mission has now been \nseriously thwarted and twisted.\n  None of this recent crisis needed to have come to pass. I was serving \nas assistant leader of our party during a late night session in the \nmonth of November 1993. In the Chamber, we were debating and having a \ngreat public discussion of the issue of exercising the Senate's power \nof subpoena of one's most intimate, personal recollections, one's own \ndiary.\n  Late that night Bob Packwood appeared before Senator Bob Dole and \nmyself in Bob's office with his written resignation in his hand, signed \nby him and to be effective at 2 a.m. the following early morning, just \nhours away, 3 hours away. That apparently was not enough, for that very \nnext morning the Ethics Committee delivered certain files, records, and \npleadings to the Justice Department for ``further proceedings'' as to \npossible criminal matters, while the committee had made no previous \npublic reference as to any such criminal conduct.\n  Bob Packwood at that moment of time said that he then had no choice \nbut to remain in the Senate in order to fight the charges from the \nfirmest of battlegrounds.\n  I remain terribly disturbed about the entire process. These are not \npersonal reflections upon members or any particular member of the \nEthics Committee, I assure you. Oh, yes, yes, I know, we should brush \nall this past brooding aside because the feeding frenzy is now on and \nthe waters are now blood flecked and teeming with scissor-teethed \npiranha.\n  Where I personally get in a lot of trouble in life is because of a \nsimple philosophy ingrained in me by a tough grandfather who practiced \nlaw and a dear and marvelous father who practiced law, who taught me \nthe power and worth of that craft, and two stalwart sons who come now \nafter me and are practicing the very special profession of law. The \nbest original advice was, ``If anyone goes to jail, be sure it's your \nclient.''\n  I liked that advice. I cherished that advice. But I learned a more \nimportant thing then, and it will always be so, that there are always \ntwo sides, always, always. We have only heard one. There is such a \nthing as due process and fairness. That has not yet been completed.\n  There are some stirring words in our Nation's founding documents and \nin all laws that take their breath of life from those documents and \nwhat comes from them requires--no, certainly, it demands--that we must \nbe able to confront our accusers; that we be able to review and examine \nall papers and documents and witnesses that the ``prosecution'' may \ndeem relevant in the case. We know that the process of selecting \nevidence that is ``relevant'' or ``not relevant'' does not rest with \nthe parties but with an unbiased finder of fact. We cherish the law \nthat any accuser must at some point, in some proceedings somewhere \nwithin the system of justice within this country, be required to raise \ntheir right hand and swear to God or make other affirmation that what \nthey are telling is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth, and that person then, after affirming such an oath, is to be \nsubjected to cross-examination based upon the rules of evidence and due \nprocess.\n  It is my understanding that 6 of the 19 accusers of Senator Packwood \nhave not yet been identified in the media and do not wish even at this \ntime to be publicly identified. Apparently, they are to remain \n``unidentified'' even to the extent of retaining that status as \n\n[[Page S 12800]]\nthe committee releases the record of the proceedings to date.\n  Senator Packwood indicates that a number of witnesses have come \nforward on his behalf because they have read about it or suddenly \nlearned of the complaints against him on television or in the press. \nAdditional witnesses are not going to be able to come forth as long as \ncomplainants remain unidentified. Perhaps there is yet some forum for \nSenator Bob Packwood to state ``his side.'' That will be his choice, \nnot mine.\n  So Bob Packwood is leaving our midst. We know not what the future \nwill hold for him, but he is a fighter. He has fought for women and \ntheir rights. He has fought for the lesser in our society and for their \nrights. He is a true civil libertarian and his public life should not \nbe judged in parts but in sum total. He has conquered an affliction \nthat surely contributed to his downfall, alcoholism. These last recent \nyears have obviously been nightmarish for him and obviously also for \nhis accusers.\n  That is so true. But the Good Book speaks of judgment and justice and \ntruth and forbearance and tolerance and forgiveness, and we might draw \non some of those timeless strengths and attributes in judging this man.\n  Very few of us in public service have had a life unexamined, but now \nthat will be so to ever more degree. But how far back in life do we \nthen go? As I have said several times before, the Al Simpson who was on \nFederal probation at the age of 18 is not the same Al Simpson standing \nhere. The Al Simpson who was thrown in the clink at age 20 for clubbing \na guy around on the streets of Laramie is not the same Al Simpson \nstanding here, although sometimes the feelings are still burning down \nthere.\n  [Laughter.]\n  How far back do we go? Anyone here want to go back in their life to \n1969 to see what you were up to? Check with me. Come in. Let us have a \nvisit about that.\n  So if we in the Senate really are to receive the same treatment, for \nthis is what the public is always demanding of us, that we should \nexpect the same treatment--no more and no less--than our fellow men and \nwomen, then, pray tell me why the statute of limitations in any \njurisdiction in America is no longer than 6 years for offenses far more \nserious in nature than the ones charged against our brother from \nOregon.\n  That may be very difficult for some to understand, but it is the \ntruth. The statute of limitations is limited to 6 years in the most \nlenient of jurisdictions and is an average of 3 years in most other \njurisdictions, and yet they have plumbed the scraps of life of Bob \nPackwood back to the year 1969. Where does it all end?\n  That would be a good question to ask ourselves, and many surely will \nnot do it in any public forum. But when we return to the comfort and \nsolace of our own homes this night, visiting with loved ones and \nfriends and reflect upon the sadness and tragedy of Senator Bob \nPackwood and of the victims--and I mean that--remember what can be \nasked and inquired of the accusers can also be the nature of an inquiry \nto the accused, which is this: How would you feel if this were \nhappening to you?\n  That is not a diversion. That is not a clever phrase. That is not \ncorny. It is not naive. It is not uncaring. It is not unresponsive. It \nis not the mumbling of a bald, emaciated 64-year-old Senator from \nWyoming who ``just does not get it.'' I have heard all of that guff \nbefore. It is just something we should not forget in life as we are \npushed forward in the undertow of the immeasurable tide of the \ninformation age of a free society. The print and electronic media is \nnow playing all of the varied roles heretofore to be performed only by \nadministrative and court tribunals.\n  There was a reason for the Ethics Committee. It was to avoid a \n``public hanging.'' It was to avoid ``frontier justice.'' It was to \navoid ``vigilante justice,'' if you will. That is one of the reasons \nwhy it was created. Something has surely gone awry. It will be up to \nthose of us remaining in the Senate to set the course anew.\n  And to my friend Bob Packwood, God bless you, Godspeed. You are loved \nby many. Thank you.\n  [Applause in the galleries.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will suspend. The Sergeant at Arms \nis noted to restore order if there are outbreaks in the galleries.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am not going to review the bidding of \nwhy we are here this afternoon, but I do want to express my sentiments \ntoward Bob Packwood, for whom I have the greatest respect and \naffection.\n  As Senator Packwood mentioned, we have played 400 squash matches over \nthe past 12 years. Four hundred times we met at the squash club to \nplay, and in the game of squash--many may not know how it works, but \nyou are very dependent upon your opponent for calling whether a shot \nwas fair or not. In those 400 matches, never once--never once--did I \nhave the slightest inclination or reason to say that what the call that \nBob Packwood made was other than perfect.\n  Never once did I have any sense of questioning it, because I had \ntotal reliance on him, and I still have that total reliance and \naffection and respect for him.\n  Bob Packwood has one of the finest minds that I have seen since I \nhave been in the Senate. We have served together in the Finance \nCommittee for 18 years, and it is Bob Packwood who is responsible for \nthe Republican Party having as many Senators as we do here.\n  When I first came to the Senate, there were 37 Republicans, and Bob \nPackwood was in the leadership at that time and conceived the idea of \nhaving retreats on the Eastern Shore where Republicans would get \ntogether and come up with plans for the future. It is Bob Packwood who \ncame up with the idea of what is now the Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, with the Republican Senatorial Trust that he formed. When I \nran for office, I received a small amount of money from the Republicans \nin the Senate, a very modest amount. But Bob Packwood really conceived \nthe machinery that we have now, and the result of the tremendous \nfunding that Republican candidates at present are receiving.\n  Many have talked about his legislative achievements, but to my mind, \nthe greatest single achievement in Bob Packwood in legislative affairs \nwas the 1986 tax bill. That bill was absolutely stalled, was going \nnowhere. It had come from the House, not much of a bill. It came over \nhere. We argued with it. Everybody came up with suggestions on how to \nreduce expenditures or how to have greater tax breaks. We all competed \nwith each other, took care of everybody in sight as the deficit rose \nand rose in our calculations.\n  Then Bob Packwood said, ``That's it.'' It was he who came up with the \nfinal program that we had. It was the 1986 tax bill. It was a Packwood \ntax bill that I and many others unanimously voted in the committee. I \nwill never forget that evening. Pat Moynihan was there. Senator Dole \nwas there. When we finished that vote, a unanimous vote, everybody \nstood and applauded the chairman of the committee for the tremendous \nfeat that he had accomplished.\n  So we will miss him. We will miss a fine brain in this Senate. We \nwill miss him pacing across down in the well as matters were debated \nand coming up and getting at his desk. Back and forth. I will miss that \ndistinctive walk he had, bent forward slightly as he charges over here. \nI will miss that so much because we were very close friends and will \nremain close friends, and I will greatly miss him, as we all will.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have not prepared any remarks for this \noccasion, and I would be the first to assert that I am not especially \nprepared.\n  Accordingly, to be brief, perhaps the more intense for that reason, \nto say that in 18 years that we have shared this committee, as the \nSenator from Rhode Island just said, they have been years of perfect \ntrust between us and, on my part, profound admiration.\n  And just a moment's good cheer. The Senator from Rhode Island will \nremember in those intense days leading up to the 1986 legislation, we \nwould meet each morning in Senator Packwood's office about 7:30 for \ncoffee and plan the day's strategy. If you would like to \n\n[[Page S 12801]]\nknow something about the Tax Code as it then was, it fell to me each \nmorning to read the service, as it were. I would find the previous day \nan advertisement in the Wall Street Journal that said: ``Buy oxen, \nantelope''--I do not know-- ``cattle, llamas * * * guaranteed losses.''\n  And they would guarantee you losses and you could not but make money \non the Tax Code. It was a scandal and the country knew it. It is all \ngone now--thanks to you, and thanks for so much else. There is just one \nline, perhaps of help in the years ahead, of Dr. Johnson, who said, \n``How small, of all the ills that human hearts endure, that part which \nlaws or kings can cause or cure.''\n  This last spring Liz and I--your dear Liz--went to Ephesus, where \nJohn took Mary after the crucifixion. We saw Mary's house and the site \nwhere John is buried in a basilica. We saw where the Apostle Paul \npreached, and I can think of only his lines from I Corinthians: 13. \n``Now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three; but the greatest \nof these is charity.''\n  The Greek--he was writing in Greek--was ``agape,'' and in English we \ntranslate it ``love.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I did not know Senator Packwood well, \nbut I have watched him. I heard him on CNN last evening. I have heard \nhim on other shows. I have listened to him, as the leader and the \nSenator from Wyoming have pointed out, explain complicated issues in a \nvital and easily understood way. I have listened as the heads of \nvarious women's organizations have indicated their respect for him and \nfor his long record of help.\n  I recognize that service in this institution is not easy, that people \nare held to a standard, and after all, we are just mere reflections of \neveryone around us. We are complete with moles and warts and our own \nproblems. So this is not a happy day for me. I do not believe it is a \nhappy day for the U.S. Senate.\n  I do believe it is a day of some courage and bravery on the part of \nSenator Packwood, because even those of us who did not know him well \nknow of his love for this body--you could see it, it is palpable, it is \nthere--and his respect for this body as an institution. I really think \nthat kind of performance goes beyond any party label, and it goes \nbeyond any trial and tribulation.\n  My father used to always say to me, ``Dianne, do not let a man be \nknown for the last thing he does. Let him be known for the best thing \nhe does.''\n  I think that is a legacy that hopefully is being written here this \nafternoon. This is a sad day in a chapter of history of the U.S. \nSenate, but it says one thing: We do have our failings, and we do make \nour mistakes. But it is a sign of a wise man, and even a giant man, who \nstands and does what has to be done and goes on to fight another day.\n  I thank you, Senator Packwood, for a long and distinguished service \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a very sad day for many reasons. \nI think we are losing an outstanding Senator at a time when the Senate \nand the country needs his expertise very badly. I join my many \ncolleagues and express my sentiment about the friendship which I have \nenjoyed with Senator Packwood. I think that the Senate, the country, \nSenator Packwood, and the people who have registered complaints about \nhim would have been better served had there been public hearings. This \nis a view that I have always held and expressed with my vote in favor \nof those public hearings.\n  I understand the business of the Senate. But I believe that we could \nhave found the time here with many of the quorum calls, or perhaps on \nweekends, or perhaps evenings, to have heard this matter. I believe \nthat America was entitled to full disclosure. I believe the people who \ncame forward with complaints were entitled to be heard, and I think \nSenator Packwood was entitled to have a defense.\n  I think that I, as a ``juror,'' a Senator, who had to pass on the \nissues, would have been prepared and better off had that been done. I \nhave always been opposed to plea bargains of any sort. I understand the \nkind of pain that would have been involved had we gone through those \nhearings. But I think it would have served the institution well and all \nof the parties well. I have had one other very painful experience with \nSenator Packwood when I got six stitches under my left eye a decade \nago. But I consider this day much more painful.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, because of other matters, I have not been \nable to be on the floor during the statements that have been made. I \nwant to comment about my friend from Oregon and his decision. I think \nit takes courage to face the facts, and Senator Packwood has. But like \nSenator Dole, as I have walked through the building and through the \nHall, I have been thinking of the good times we have had together. When \nwe came here, particularly to the Senate, we had already met each \nother. As a matter of fact, I met Bob Packwood at a picnic President \nEisenhower had at his farm at Gettysburg, and one of the photographs \nthat I cherish is a photograph of Senator Packwood, John Tower, and \nmyself standing there outside of the Eisenhower home.\n  We have had a long history of our friendship and acquaintance. I am \nsaddened that this day has come. But I want to really reflect on the \ngood days, as I said, the days of sharing with each other our family \nlifestyle when we first came to Washington. Neither of us had a great \ndeal of money. We did a lot of entertaining in our homes with one \nanother.\n  It is a time of change now, of great change. But change does not \nerase the memories of good friendships, and it is not a time to abandon \nthose memories, as far as I am concerned.\n  I also remember the time when Senator Packwood flew up to Alaska in a \nLear jet with me back in the days when Lear jets were not that safe, as \nI later found out in 1978. It was a long, hard trip to fly to Alaska in \na chartered plane, because we had stayed here on the floor of the \nSenate too long and had an obligation to make a speech in Alaska and we \ndid go up in a chartered plane.\n  These memories come back in flashes, I think, to those of us as we \nsit and listen to developments that are hard to understand, hard to \ncomprehend, and difficult to deal with.\n  But, Bob, I want you to know that I do cherish those memories. You \nhave been a good Senator. I will not repeat the words that have been \nsaid on the floor about the things we have worked on here together.\n  I know there is a group of Alaska Native people in my office waiting \nfor me now that, had it not been for the help of Senator Packwood, \nSenator Moynihan and others, they would have suffered severe losses \nthat would not have been recognized under the tax laws, where other \npeople had recognition of their net operating losses. Native people, \nbecause of the strange hiatus in the Federal law, had not received the \nrecognition they should have had about the ability to recover those \nlosses through the sale of them to other people.\n  It was the work of Senator Packwood, Senator Moynihan, and I remember \nCongressman Rostenkowski and others that recognized that inequity. It \ndid lead to a tax loss. We admit that. But that loss would have been \nthere in any event but for the Federal law that they helped us change.\n  So times pass, and I find my heart heavy with the decision made by \nSenator Packwood, but again in the position I hold now as chairman of \nthe Rules Committee, I say that I spent the day trying to figure out \nwhat we would do to handle a case of this magnitude and of this \ncomplexity had he not made the decision.\n  So I think in the final analysis, the record should show that Senator \nPackwood has saved the taxpayers of this country a great deal of money \nand saved the Senate a great deal of delay in a period of great change, \nwhere we need to spend our time and devote our efforts to trying to \nfind solutions for the problems that really confront this country, very \ndeep problems, problems, I think, that the leadership Senator Packwood \nhas given in the field of welfare, Medicare, and tax reform will \n\n[[Page S 12802]]\ncontinue. The dynamics of his suggestions will be carried out. The \ninertia of the Packwood move through the Finance Committee will \ncontinue, and strangely enough it will continue for years to come \nwithout his being there. Thank you.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12796-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS UNTIL 6 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Campbell, \n     and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 2465.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAWS \n                   AND PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO EXPENDITURE OF \n                   STATE FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any funds received by a State under the provisions of \n     law specified in subsection (b) shall be expended only in \n     accordance with the laws and procedures applicable to \n     expenditures of the State's own revenues, including \n     appropriation by the State legislature, consistent with the \n     terms and conditions required under such provisions of law.\n       (b) Provisions of Law.--The provisions of law specified in \n     this subsection are the following:\n       (1) Part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (relating \n     to block grants for temporary assistance to needy families).\n       (2) Section 25 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (relating to \n     the optional State food assistance block grant).\n       (3) Subtitles B and C of title VII of this Act (relating to \n     workforce development).\n       (4) The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n     (relating to block grants for child care).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I asked the bulk of the amendment be read, \nas it just was, for a very simple purpose. It is a straightforward \namendment. It is very basic. It simply calls for the amount that is \nblock granted under this bill to be spent in a manner in accordance \nwith the laws and procedures for expenditures of the States' own \nrevenues. That may not sound like a revolutionary or even controversial \nsuggestion, but it is terribly important.\n  The core and essence of this welfare reform is centered around the \nsuggestion that States and communities can do a better job in deciding \nhow their funds are expended on welfare programs assisting the poor \nthan can a centrally planned government, than can a government \nthousands of miles away from the action. It is the heart, at least in \npart, of what this welfare reform is all about--the suggestion that \nmoney can be spent better by local levels than it can be by the Federal \nlevel.\n  Why would I raise this issue? The facts are that in six of our States \nit makes a difference. In 44 of our States the money is expended, as is \nprovided under the State's own laws, generally in the same manner that \nthe State's own expenditures are allocated. But in six of our States a \npractice has been followed where the Governor alone decides where block \ngrant money is spent.\n  If we believe that the States are better able to decide how that \nmoney is spent, then I think we have to be concerned about the \nsituation in the absence of this amendment. Literally, unless this \namendment is adopted, we will see six of our States where the Governor \nis allowed to both appropriate the money, in effect decide where it is \nto be spent, and administer that money; that is, distribute the money \nand, as we will explore later on, even have a strong voice in \nconducting the audit of how that money is spent.\n  Literally, what we are doing, then, in those six States is giving \ninto the hands of one person the ability to appropriate, the ability to \nadminister, and some significant control over the audit of what they \nhave appropriated and administered. This is contrary to the very \nfoundation of this country. It is contrary to the very theme of our \nConstitution. It is contrary to those philosophers who thought of our \nsystem and brought it to fruition.\n  Mr. President, any in this Chamber who have read the very significant \nbook of Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \ncannot help but note not only his musings about the history of our \nsystem, but the intricacies of the Roman system. One of the lessons is \nthe understanding that there needs to be a division of power.\n  I want to quote from some of our historical documents because I think \nMembers will find it interesting. In our own Federalist Papers, Madison \nsaid it best. It is in No. 47, where he says clearly:\n\n       There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive \n     powers are united in the same person or body or magistrates.\n\n  Unless we adopt this amendment, you are going to have that power, \nboth legislative and executive powers, combined in one person in six of \nour States.\n  In No. 47 of the Federalist Papers, Madison says this:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and \n     judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  That tyranny he talked about he goes on to talk about in further \ndepth when he says:\n\n       From these facts by which Montesquieu was guided, it may \n     clearly be inferred that in saying, ``There can be no liberty \n     where the legislative and executive powers are united in the \n     same person, or body of magistrates.''\n\n  Mr. President, that is the core of the concern of this amendment. \nThis amendment will simply provide, in those six States where they do \nnot now have it, that they will follow the normal legislative process. \nIf we do not adopt this, what we will in effect be doing is saying that \nthe elected representatives of the people and the legislative branch \nwill be ignored and their priorities bypassed when it comes to welfare \nreform under these block grants. We in this body have long recognized \nthe difference between block grants and others where we have allocated \nthe money ourselves. In categorical programs it has been normal to send \nthe money back to the States, but it has been sent back to the States \nwith guidelines from the Federal Government, including elected \nlegislators, making the decisions on its allocation.\n  The prime difference between block grants and the categorical grants \nis the level of government which designs the program. Under our block \ngrants, the States design the programs. For categorical grants, most of \nthe programs are designed and established at the Federal level. The \nState is to administer the grant in accordance with Federal directives.\n  Mr. President, it makes sense that when we move to block grants, that \nwe allow the State legislative process to be part of this.\n  This amendment is offered, not only by myself but by Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Simpson, Senator Murkowski, Senator Kohl, Senator \nCampbell, and Senator Feingold.\n  I believe the provisions of this measure are broad and they are \nbipartisan. I think they unite the interests of this Congress, an \ninterest that we ought to have special recognition of. Would Senators \nliterally want to abdicate the legislative responsibility to a chief \nexecutive? Chief executives are responsible, are important members of \nour governmental functions, but they should not have combined with them \nthe legislative powers.\n  In addition to this, I want to draw the Members' special attention to \nanother factor in this bill. Under section \n\n[[Page S 12803]]\n408 of the Dole amendment, it requires States to conduct an annual \naudit of expenditures under the Federal temporary assistance--AFDC, \nthat is--block grant. The auditor is required to be independent of the \nadministering State agency and approved by the U.S. Treasury Secretary \nand the chief executive officer of the State.\n  Literally, what we are doing, then, is we are allocating money to the \nStates which, in some cases in effect, will be legislated or \nappropriated by a chief executive, administered by that chief \nexecutive, and audited by someone that chief executive approves of. Or, \nput a different way, no one of which the chief executive does not \napprove can audit those funds.\n  This is untenable. I understand why some Governors may like this \npower, but I suspect, on reflection, many Governors will not like that \npower because what it gives them a special burden. Some may say this is \nin line with what we have done in the past. But let me assure this body \nthat it is not fully in line. Under the General Revenue Sharing Act of \n1972, Public Law 92-512, section 123(a) addressed this. In subsection 4 \nit said this:\n\n       It will provide for the expenditure of amounts received \n     under subtitle A only in accordance with the laws and \n     procedures applicable to the expenditures of its own \n     revenues.\n\n  In other words, the State government would have the ability to \nappropriate those moneys under the same procedures that they follow now \nfor their own revenues. That is what we are asking in this amendment. \nIt is consistent with the provision that Congress enacted in 1972 for \ngeneral revenue sharing.\n  In 1977 the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations \nreported:\n\n       The commission recommends that the State legislatures take \n     a much more active role in State decisionmaking relating to \n     the receipt and expenditures of Federal grants to the States.\n  Specifically, the Commission recommends that the legislatures take \naction to provide for: inclusion of anticipated in Federal grants in \nappropriation or authorization bills; prohibition of receipt of \nexpenditures of Federal grants above the amount appropriated without \nthe approval of the legislature. The recommendation goes on.\n\n  But whether it is in the 1972 General Revenue Sharing Act or the 1977 \nreport of the Advisory Commission, or the 1980 report of the U.S. \nComptroller General that dealt with the same subject, the theme is \nconsistent. It was also a theme of provisions in the 1981 Omnibus \nReconciliation Act, in the 1982 Job Training Act, and in the 1984 U.S. \nComptroller General's report to Congress. There the subject was \naddressed, with this specific language-- the public's opportunity to \ninfluence State decisions for programs supported with block grant funds \nhas been enhanced through the combined effects of multiple public \nparticipation opportunities offered by the States, the increased \nactivity of State elected officials, and the increased activity of \ninterest groups at the State level. This increase is related to the \nexpanded public input opportunities established both in response to the \nFederal requirements as well as to the greater discretion available to \nthe States.\n  Mr. President, it is clear from following the background that this \nCongress and independent advisory groups have recognized the value over \nand over again of having elected State officials set the priorities.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. And it is basic. \nWhat it suggests is that we as a Congress ought to make sure that the \nappropriating function is performed by the State legislatures or at \nleast with regard to the general standard of appropriation that is \nfollowed by the States themselves.\n  It is endorsed by the National Conference of State Legislators. It is \nendorsed by the National Speakers Conference. It is endorsed by the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letters from and resolutions of these three bodies.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures is greatly appreciative of the leadership you \n     have provided on a variety of federalism and \n     intergovernmental relations issues. Most recently, you were \n     able to include language in H.R. 4 that reaffirmed the state \n     legislature's role in expending federal block grant funds. \n     With the Senate about to undertake debate on the Republican \n     leadership's welfare reform package, S. 1120, we wish to call \n     upon you again to ensure that state legislative policymaking \n     and fiscal authority is in no way compromised regarding any \n     and all block grants included in S. 1120.\n       As reported from the Senate Finance Committee, H.R. 4 \n     specifically stated that family assistance block grant funds \n     received by the state would be expended in accordance with \n     the laws and procedures applicable to expenditure of the \n     state's own revenues. NCSL strongly encourages you to pursue \n     insertion of similar language in S. 1120, making it \n     applicable to all of the various block grants and \n     consolidations being considered, and stands ready to assist \n     you. Your language clearly reaffirms the roles that state \n     lawmakers play in appropriating funds. We are concerned that \n     giving governors direct control over funds, even if it is \n     optional with food stamps, could well violate state laws and \n     practices. Your H.R. 4 language guarantees that there will be \n     an open, deliberative process in expending any block grant \n     monies. It does not change the governor's role regarding the \n     state's policymaking process and it certainly ensures that \n     the state legislature will be involved.\n       Thank you again for the leadership on and commitment you \n     bring to these issues. NCSL is prepared to work closely with \n     you as floor deliberations on S. 1120 proceed. Please have \n     your staff contact Sheri Steisel (624-8693) or Michael Bird \n     (624-8686) for further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                James J. Lack,\n\n                                           State Senator, New York\n     and President, NCSL.\n                                                                    ____\n\n        Resolution Supporting State Authority in Welfare Reform\n\n       Whereas, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States reserves all powers not prohibited to the \n     states nor delegated to the United States to the states or to \n     the people respectively, and;\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States neither \n     prohibits power over welfare to the states, nor delegates \n     power over welfare to the United States, and;\n       Whereas, through the years the United States has assumed \n     powers over welfare that are inconsistent with the \n     distribution of powers between the United States, the states, \n     or the people respectively under the United States \n     Constitution, and;\n       Whereas, restoration of the Constitutional distribution of \n     powers between the United States, the states or the people \n     respectively should proceed at an expeditious pace to restore \n     the consistency of governing relationships with the nation's \n     fundamental law, and;\n       Whereas, the welfare programs of the United States have \n     been largely unsuccessful, enormously expensive and even \n     counter-productive to the welfare of recipients, and;\n       Whereas, the states are laboratories of democracy in which \n     different policy approaches are tried, and the most \n     successful policies are copied by states whose policy \n     approaches are less successful, and;\n       Whereas, restoration of state authority with respect to \n     welfare is consistent with the fundamental democratic \n     principle that government should be as close as possible to \n     the people, and;\n       Whereas, the United States Senate Finance Committee has \n     reported H.R. 4 which contains language that would allow \n     states to expend federal welfare funds ``in any manner that \n     is reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose'' of the \n     bill, and;\n       Whereas, as reported by the United States Senate Finance \n     Committee, H.R. 4 contains language requiring that federal \n     funding for welfare be ``expended only in accordance with the \n     laws and procedures applicable to expenditures of the State's \n     own revenues, including appropriation by the State \n     legislature,'' and;\n       Whereas, the above reference clauses in H.R. 4 represent an \n     important step toward restoration of state authority with \n     respect to welfare;\n       Now therefore be it resolved, That the Board of Directors \n     of the American Legislative Exchange Council urges the United \n     States Senate to include the above reference clauses in any \n     welfare reform bill which it adopts.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Resolving To Preserve State Legislative Authority and Oversight of \n                       Federal Block Grant Funds\n\n       Whereas, the National Speakers Conference represents the \n     bipartisan and collective sentiment of the nation's Speakers \n     of the House; and\n       Whereas, the National Speakers Conference seeks to \n     strengthen and preserve state legislatures' traditional \n     appropriations authority and oversight of all state \n     expenditures; and\n       Whereas, the National Speakers Conference recognizes that \n     this authority is enshrined in our national and state \n     constitutions and is fundamental to the system of checks and \n     balances that defines the separation of power among the three \n     branches of our government; and\n\n[[Page S 12804]]\n\n       Whereas, the National Speakers Conference believes that the \n     appropriation and administration of block grants require the \n     full participation of both the legislative and executive \n     branches to develop and implement effective policy; and\n       Whereas, the National Speakers Conference believes the most \n     effective means of ensuring the full participation of the \n     legislative and executive branches of government is through \n     the budget appropriation and approval process;\n       Now, therefore be it resolved by the National Speakers \n     Conference, that the various Speakers of the House attending \n     the National Speakers Conference in a bipartisan vote urge \n     the United States Congress to support the premise that all \n     federal block grants received by the various states be \n     expended only in accordance with the laws and procedures \n     applicable to expenditures of the state's own revenues, \n     including appropriation by the state legislatures; and\n       Be it further resolved, that the Conference endorses the \n     bipartisan amendment proposed by Senators Hank Brown of \n     Colorado, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Herb Kohl of \n     Wisconsin, Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Alan Simpson of \n     Wyoming to the welfare reform bill; and\n       Be it further resolved, that the National Speakers \n     Conference request the United States and the United States \n     House of Representatives in any block grant legislation that \n     is enacted to ensure that the legislative appropriating \n     authority is protected; and\n       Be it further resolved, that copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Congressional delegations of the various \n     states by the Speakers of the House of those respective \n     states.\n       Approved this first day of September Nineteen Hundred and \n     Ninety-Five in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Let me simply close with this thought. As we give to the States an \nenormous grant of new authority and new responsibility, an ability \nliterally to appropriate the funds and allocate the funds that have \nbeen taken by the Federal Government, I think it is incumbent upon us \nto make sure that is done wisely, and it is done well. To suggest that \nwe are going to concentrate in the hands of one person, the Governor, \nthe ability to both appropriate and administer and have a control over \nthe audit is unacceptable.\n  This amendment gives the States the ability to preside over this \nmoney just as they do with their own money that they raise.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the Senator from Colorado \nfor offering this amendment which appears to this Senator, and I \nbelieve to most Senators on either side of the aisle, as appropriate, \nand necessary because there are principles involved.\n  I am sure the Senator from Colorado agrees that constitutional \ngovernment is a division of powers, and always contemplates that \nresources will be revenues. These are revenues to State governments \nthat will be allocated in accordance with agreements in the legislative \nbranch and the executive branch.\n  That is the intent of the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. It is precisely that intent and more consistently \nconstitutional, I believe.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It seems to me, precisely that. By constitutional \nproviso the Congress guarantees to the States a republican form of \ngovernment. I am not sure whether this would fall under that admonition \nor injunction.\n  Mr. BROWN. Many of us were hopeful that admonition for a republican \nform of government meant just that. But unfortunately, apparently it \nwas not.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I insist that republican be with a small ``r,'' and at \nthe time when Thomas Jefferson assumed to run the democratic Republican \nParty. But we will not get into that detail.\n  I would simply indicate that it would be my disposition, absent any \ncontrary information, to accept the amendment. If the Senator wishes a \nvote, of course that is his right. But I will defer to the Senator from \nColorado in this regard.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would be happy to have it accepted. I am \nadvised there are Members who have concerns about this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. So they would wish to speak and perhaps to be heard. \nVery well. I do believe we are at a point where we may be reaching an \nagreement on tomorrow's schedule, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada is on the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair inform the Senator from \nNevada what the parliamentary status now is on the Senate floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is on a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. There is no time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I \nmake appear elsewhere in the Record so as not to interfere with the \ndebate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if we might be able to get the yeas \nand nays on the Brown amendment. We will set that vote for tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if we could ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBrown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will have an agreement to have that vote tomorrow \nmorning at 9:30 unless it can be accepted. I understand there is no \nobjection on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Not to my knowledge.\n  Mr. DOLE. There may be an objection.\n  We are still looking for additional amendments to be taken up this \nevening. We have agreed to amendments on either side. I know the \ndistinguished manager on the other side does not wish to offer his \namendment this evening. We can lay it down. I think that would take an \nhour, or 45 minutes, tomorrow.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If it is agreeable, an hour and 30 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator from Nevada be generous enough to let \nus proceed with these technical matters for just a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nevada yield for that \npurpose?\n  Mr. REID. I do.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2466 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in the \nsecond degree and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment of \nthe Senator from Colorado is temporarily set aside, and the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2466 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in accordance with the agreement, such \nas it will be reached between leaders, I yield the floor with the \nunderstanding that we will take this matter up tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just for clarification of the schedule this evening, it \nis the leader's intention to take up the Moynihan amendment tomorrow \nand have other amendments offered if we can have them laid down tonight \nbut no additional amendments would be voted upon tonight?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct. I know Members are going to want to be \nleaving fairly early tomorrow afternoon. It is not going to be possible \nunless they are willing to come to the floor tonight and debate the \namendments and have the votes tomorrow morning. We are searching on our \nside if we can ask the leader to search on his side.\n\n[[Page S 12805]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, let me urge my \ncolleagues. We have been polling our Members and have been told that we \nhave about 130 amendments. If we have that many amendments, there is no \nreason why tonight we cannot have a good debate on some of these \namendments. I would like to see a couple of them offered and debated \ntonight. The ranking member is here and prepared to work with any of \nour Members on this side. So I hope we can do that. If we have that \nmany amendments, there is no reason why at 6 o'clock tonight we do not \nhave more of an opportunity to discuss some of these important matters.\n  So I really urge all of our Democratic colleagues to cooperate in \ngood faith and to come to the floor. This is a good time to be offering \nthe amendments, and we will accommodate Senators as they come to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator from Nevada will yield further, I make the \nsame request. This is normally the late evening, Thursday evening, and \nwe have not announced any votes this evening but we are prepared to do \nthat if we can have the cooperation of Members, if they just come to \nthe floor, debate the amendment, with the exception of the amendment of \nthe Senator from New York, and then we can agree to vote on those \ntomorrow morning.\n  Following the votes, we would take up the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. Moynihan], with 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided for \ndebate. So we will put out a hotline on this side, and this is the time \nto offer amendments. We had 70-some on our list. You have, say, 150. If \nthere are 200 amendments out there, there ought to be somebody willing \nto come to the floor at 6:20 on a Thursday evening--it is not even dark \noutside--and offer some amendments. We are prepared to do business. I \nknow the Presiding Officer is very pleased to be here, and we will do \nour best. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12802-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SENATOR BRYAN'S WORK ON THE ETHICS COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. REID. The first criminal jury trial that I had involved a \nburglary case. As I recall, the jury trial took about 3 or 4 days. The \nreason I remember the case so clearly is that I was the attorney \nrepresenting the defendant, the person charged with the crime. The \nprosecutor of that case was Richard Bryan, then a young deputy district \nattorney in Clark County, NV. It was a good case. We had two young \nlawyers who had a real good battle in the courtroom.\n  Senator Richard Bryan was an outstanding lawyer. He was the first \npublic defender in the history of the State of Nevada. He and I took \nthe Nevada bar together in 1963. We were the only two freshmen elected \nto the Nevada State Legislature in 1969.\n  Not only did he have a successful and distinguished career as a \nprivate attorney, but he also served in the Nevada State Legislature as \nan assemblyman and as a Nevada State senator. He served as attorney \ngeneral of the State of Nevada. He was elected twice to be Governor of \nthe State of Nevada and has been elected twice to be a U.S. Senator \nfrom the State of Nevada.\n  The reason I mention this is I think, in the events that have taken \nplace today, those six members of the Ethics Committee who have toiled \nmonths and months have been kind of forgotten about. This was a job not \nsought by Senator Richard Bryan, who was chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee. In fact, he took the job at his peril. He was running for \nreelection when then majority leader George Mitchell asked him to do \nhis duty as a U.S. Senator and accept this task, this ordeal, to be \nchairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.\n  I have never talked to Senator Bryan about the facts of the case that \nhas been before this body today. But I know Richard Bryan. I know him \nwell. He and I have been friends for 30-odd years or more. And I know \nhow this case has weighed on him. I see it in his face. I see it in his \ndemeanor. As I have indicated, I have never discussed the case with \nhim. But I know Senator Bryan well, I repeat. I know that his \nobligation was to be fair to the victims, to be fair to the accused and \nto this institution and, of course, the oath that he took as a Senator.\n  The time that he spent on this case could have been spent working on \nother issues, could have been spent with his family and his friends, \nbut he spent not minutes, not hours, not days, not weeks but months on \nthis case.\n  When the elections took place last fall, Senator Bryan became the \nranking member of the Ethics Committee, and Senator Mitch McConnell \nbecame chairman of the Ethics Committee.\n  Mr. President, I think that we, as Members of the Senate, should all \nacknowledge the work done by the Ethics Committee. I am speaking of my \nfriend, Senator Bryan. I am doing that because I know him so well. I \nknow the time that he spent. I know his background. I know what a good \nperson he is and how fair he tries to be with everybody in everything \nthat he does.\n  Now, I can speak with more authority and certainty about Senator \nBryan than I can the other five members of the Ethics Committee, but \nthese other five individuals coming from their varied backgrounds and \nexperiences led to this Ethics Committee that had a sense of duty. It \nwas bipartisan in nature, and being bipartisan in nature reached a \nconclusion in this most difficult case. Senators Mikulski and Dorgan on \nthe Democratic side and Chairman McConnell, Senators Craig and Smith \nare also to be given appreciation by this Senator and I hope the rest \nof this body for the time that they spent on this very thankless job.\n  Mr. President, I, of course, have talked in detail about Senator \nBryan and the person that he is. If I knew the other five members as \nwell as I knew Senator Bryan, I am sure that I could say the same \nthings about them and the difficulty they had in arriving at the \ndecision they did. I am sure that if I had spent the time with them as \nI have with Senator Bryan, I could tell by their demeanor, I could tell \nby the looks on their faces the consternation and the difficulty they \nhad in doing the work that they did on this case.\n  Mr. President, there is no way to compliment and applaud these \ngentlemen and the lady who serve on this committee in an adequate \nfashion, but I, I hope on behalf of the entire Senate and the people of \nthis country, express to them my appreciation and our appreciation for \ndoing what they did in this case, that is, working the long, hard, \ntireless hours they did and arriving at a decision that only they could \narrive at.\n  Mr. President, in 1882, a member of the very small Nevada Supreme \nCourt--there were three members of the supreme court in 1882--in a case \ncited at 106 U.S. 154, Justice Bradley said in that case these words \nthat I think apply to what has taken place here today: ``The event is \nalways a great teacher.''\n  Mr. President, the event that has taken place today has been a great \nteacher for us all and will be in the future.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12805-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12805-S12830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss three amendments \nthat I intend to propose later in regard to this bill we are engaged \ntoday, this week, and probably into the next week with one of the most \nfundamental reforms of the welfare system in over a generation. It \nreally is a debate of great historic importance to not only the people \nwho are on welfare, but to all Americans.\n  The millions of Americans who are trapped in the cycle of welfare \ndependency need a way out. As we work on this bill, I believe that we \nhave to make absolutely sure that as we do this, we do, in fact, give \nthem a way out and not just put them into another revolving door.\n  The purpose of the first amendment that I will offer will be to make \nsure \n\n[[Page S 12806]]\nthat the States tackle the underlying problem of the welfare system. \nQuite frankly, Mr. President, too often welfare ends up being quicksand \nfor people instead of a ladder of real opportunity.\n  The underlying bill that we are working on will certainly help change \nthat and helps change it by creating a work requirement that will help \nboost welfare clients into the economic mainstream of work and \nopportunity.\n  We need to help people get off welfare. One very important way we can \ndo this is by helping them avoid getting on welfare in the first place, \nand that is one thing that sometimes we miss in this whole debate about \nwelfare. We do need to worry about how to get people off welfare. But \nif we can take action as a society that keeps them from ever going on \nwelfare, that is a great accomplishment as well. It will not only do \nsociety a lot of good, but it will be very important to the individual \nwho we are talking about.\n  So this brings me to the specific proposal contained in my first \namendment.\n  This amendment would give States credit for making real reductions in \ntheir welfare caseload, not illusory reductions based on just ordinary \nturnover.\n  What am I talking about? Since 1988, 14 million Americans have gone \noff welfare--14 million. Yet, during that same period, there has been a \n30 percent net increase in the welfare caseload. What this tells us is \nthere are a lot of people going on, a lot of people going off, but we \nare getting more people coming on than are going off.\n  So we have to make absolutely sure that we keep our eye on the ball \nand, really, the ball that we are trying to keep our eye on is the \nobjective of keeping people out of the culture of welfare dependency.\n  Under the bill, States will have to meet a work requirement, and that \nis good. But I think this policy will have an unintended side effect, a \nside effect that I believe my amendment will help cure.\n  If there is a work requirement, States certainly will have an \nincentive to try to meet that requirement. If States face the threat of \nlosing Federal funding for failing to meet the work requirement, I am \nafraid that they could easily fall into the trap of judging their \nwelfare policies solely--solely, Mr. President--by the criterion of \nwhether or not they help meet just that work requirement.\n  I believe that what we have to remember is that the work requirement \nis not an end in and of itself. Our goal must be to break the cycle of \nwelfare dependency, and we have found that helping people stay off \nAFDC, never going on, through tools used by the Government--job \ntraining, job search assistance, rent subsidies, transportation \nassistance, and other similar measures--is a cheaper way of doing this \nthan simply waiting for the person to fall off the economic cliff and \nbecome a full-fledged welfare client. It just makes common sense. If we \nas a society can intervene early, it is going to be cost-effective and \nit is going to work and it is going to make the difference in people's \nlives.\n  Under the bill as written, States are really given no incentive to \nmake these efforts to help people. If anything under the bill, there \nreally is a disincentive to do this. If a State takes an active, \naggressive, successful effort to help people stay off welfare, then the \nreally tough welfare cases will make up an increasingly larger \nproportion of the remaining welfare caseload, and that will make the \nwork requirement much tougher for a State to meet.\n  Under this bill as written, there is incentive really to wait to help \npeople, to wait, to wait until they are actually on welfare. Then the \nStates can get credit for getting people off welfare. That really does \nnot seem to me to be the right way to do it or the right incentive.\n  If States divert people from the welfare system by helping them stay \noff welfare in the first place, then the people who stay on welfare \nwill tend to be more hardcore, more hard-to-reach welfare clients, and \nthat will make it more difficult for States to meet the work \nrequirement.\n  That, Mr. President, really is exactly the opposite of what we should \nbe trying to do. My amendment would eliminate this truly perverse \nincentive. My amendment would lower the work requirement that States \nhave to reach by the very same amount that the States have reduced \ntheir welfare caseload.\n  Helping citizens stay off welfare is just as important as making \nwelfare clients work, just as important as moving people off welfare. \nIndeed, the reason we want to make welfare clients work in the first \nplace is, of course, to help them get off welfare. But--and this is a \nvery important provision in my amendment--we cannot allow this new \nincentive that I propose for caseload reduction to become an incentive \nfor the States to ignore poverty.\n  Under my amendment, States will be given no credit for caseload \nreductions achieved by the changing of eligibility standards. Ignoring \nthe problem of poverty, Mr. President, will certainly not make it go \naway. Arbitrarily kicking people off of relief is not a solution to \nwelfare dependency, and States should not--I repeat, not--get credit \nfor changing their eligibility to meet this objective.\n  Welfare reform block grants are designed to give States the \nflexibility they need to meet their responsibilities. They have to have \nmore flexibility. But they must not become an opportunity for the \nStates to ignore their responsibilities. States do need to be rewarded \nfor solving the problem. Giving States credit for real reductions in \ncaseload will provide this reward.\n  I believe this amendment will, in fact, yield another benefit. It \nwill enable States to target their resources on the more difficult \nwelfare cases: the at-risk people who need very intensive training and \ncounseling if they are ever going to get off welfare.\n  It will not do us any good as a society to pat ourselves on the back \nbecause people are leaving AFDC, if at the very same time an even \ngreater number of people are getting on the welfare rolls, and if the \nones getting on are an even tougher group than the ones who got off.\n  The American people demand a much more fundamental and far-reaching \nsolution. They demand real reductions in the number of people who need \nwelfare.\n  Reducing the number of people on welfare is certainly going to be a \nvery tall order. Since 1988, only half a dozen States or so have really \nmanaged to reduce their caseload. One of them, Wisconsin, has managed a \nvery significant reduction. It is going to be tough, but it is \nabsolutely necessary.\n  This issue simply must be faced, and it will be faced with all the \ncreativity at the disposal of the 50 States, 50 laboratories of \ndemocracy.\n  How are States going to do it? There are probably as many ways of \ndoing it as there are States. I think that is one of the positive \nthings about the underlying bill.\n  There is no single best answer. That is the key reason why we need to \ngive the States the flexibility to experiment. In Wisconsin, for \nexample, the Work First Program, with its tough work requirement, has \nreduced applications to the welfare system. That is a promising \napproach. We have to do other things, such as reduce the number of out-\nof-wedlock births and get rid of the disincentives to marriage.\n  The bottom line is this, Mr. President: We have to solve the problem \nand not ignore it. States should be encouraged to take action. But they \nshould be encouraged to take action early to keep people off of \nwelfare, to help them before they drop into the welfare pit. I believe \nthis is the compassionate thing to do. I believe it is the cost-\neffective thing to do.\n  My staff and I, Mr. President, have spent a considerable amount of \ntime talking to the people who run Ohio's welfare operation, both at \nthe county levels and at the State level. One of the problems that they \nhave continued to talk to me about is just what I have talked about, \nand that is, that what we really need to do is keep people off of \nwelfare. We do not want to be in the situation that I used to find \nyears and years ago when I was practicing law and when I was county \nprosecuting attorney, where we would have situations where people were \nhaving problems, where people needed help--either job training, or \neducation, or just a little help to tide them over--and they could not \nget that help. What the welfare department would have to tell them is, \nwait until you get the eviction notice, wait until they start putting \nyour clothes and everything else out on the street, then we can help \nyou, then you \n\n[[Page S 12807]]\ncan get on welfare. And once you get on welfare, all these things will \nhappen and you will get all these benefits. Our director, in the State \nof Ohio, of welfare, Arnold Tompkins, makes an analogy to a light. He \nsays you go up with the switch or down, and you are either on welfare \nor you are not. If you are on it, you get all these benefits. If you \nare not, you do not get the benefits. We have a difficult time giving \npeople some help to stay off of welfare.\n  I think what we must make sure we are doing when we pass this bill--\nwhich is a very, very good bill, and one of the reasons it is a good \nbill, it has a realistic work requirement in it. One of the things we \nhave to make sure we are doing is allowing the States the flexibility \nand giving them some incentive to try to take the actions early on \nwhich will prevent someone actually from ever going on welfare. We must \nmake sure that we, as we write this bill, give the States credit for \nhaving done that.\n  Let me turn to the second amendment that I intend to propose. It has \nto do with a rainy day fund. This amendment is a very simple one. It is \na recognition of economic realities. When a State faces a recession, a \nnumber of things happen. One of them is that the welfare caseload goes \nup. The other thing that always happens is the revenues going into the \nState go down.\n  It is as simple as that. When States are in the middle of a serious \nrecession, they are reluctant to borrow from a loan fund because they \nare, frankly, afraid they will be unable to pay the money back. I do \nnot blame them. I believe that we need an unemployment contingency \ngrant fund to make sure that when a recession hits, the Federal \nGovernment will remain a partner in the process of taking care of the \nwelfare population. You will notice I say ``partner.''\n  It should be just as clear, Mr. President, that this rainy day fund \nmust not become a back door to the re-Federalization of welfare. The \nthreshold for disbursements from this fund, I believe, has to be tough. \nAnd the threshold in my amendment is, in fact, tough. It has been \ndescribed as follows: A State, under my amendment, will not qualify if \nit has a ``cold.'' It will only qualify if it has ``pneumonia.''\n  It is my hope that this amendment will not be controversial. I \nbelieve it is a necessary precaution for the inevitable downturns in \nthe economic cycle. Under this amendment, the State has to meet two \nconditions to qualify for aid from this fund. First, it has to maintain \nits welfare effort at the fiscal year 1994 level. And unemployment has \nto be two percentage points higher than in the previous year. States \nwill then have to match these Federal funds at the same rate as the \nmatching formula for Medicaid. And they will have to maintain their own \neffort. This is a tough requirement, but I believe it is fair, and I \nbelieve that it will be of immense help to the States.\n  Mr. President, we need this rainy day fund, and we need to make sure \nthat it is not abused.\n  Let me turn to the third amendment I intend to offer. It has to do \nwith a subject that has troubled me in this country for many, many \nyears, and that is the issue of child support and child support \nenforcement. When I discuss this issue, I again have to go back, in my \nown mind, at least, to my experience as a county prosecuting attorney. \nOne of my jobs, of course, was to try to enforce the child support \nenforcement laws. Mr. President, the third amendment really is an \nattempt to make it easier for States to crack down on deadbeat parents. \nWe are all aware that one of the key cost causes of our social \nbreakdown is the failure for parents to be responsible for their own \nchildren. The family ought to be the school for citizenship--preparing \nthe children for responsible and productive lives. When the parents do \nnot do that, it is very difficult for society to step in and fill the \ngap.\n  We need to reconnect parenthood and responsibility. We need to help \nStates locate these deadbeats, establish support orders for the \nchildren, and enforce the orders.\n  My amendment attempts to address this problem in two ways. First, it \nprovides for a more timely sharing of information with the States. \nToday, the Federal Parent Locator Service, in the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, gives the States banking and asset \ninformation about potential deadbeats on an annual basis, only once a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, talk to the people who have to track down these \ndeadbeats, and they will tell you and other Members of the Senate how \ndifficult that process is. As I mentioned, I used to do this when I was \na county prosecutor. If you have to wait a whole year to get \ninformation about a deadbeat, there is a pretty good chance that that \ndeadbeat is going to flee your jurisdiction. The information that you \nget may be up to a year old--or even more--and will simply not be \ninformation that will do any good.\n  My amendment is simple. It would change that reporting requirement \nfrom an annual basis to a quarterly basis.\n  Mr. President, these child support enforcers are involved in a very \ndifficult but a very important job. I believe that we should cut--by 75 \npercent--the amount of time they have to wait for this very important \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the debate on these and the other \namendments offered by my colleagues. I believe that we have a great \nopportunity in this year's welfare reform bill--an opportunity to \nchange the direction of welfare and to really change the direction of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I would like to compliment my \nfriend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for an excellent \nstatement. His experience as a Congressman, his experience as \nLieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio, as well as a Senator, gives \nhim a perspective that may be better than most because he has been \ninvolved in administering these programs. I think he has had some very \nconstructive, positive ideas that are really invaluable. I hope our \ncolleagues will pay attention. I compliment my friend for his remarks.\n  I would also like to say at this time that we requested a list of \namendments, and the numbers were floating around, whether there was 50 \namendments, 60 amendments, or 70 amendments.\n  We are very willing to take up those amendments, see if we can \nincorporate those amendments into the substitute bill that will be \noffered tomorrow, or have people offer their amendments. They can \ndebate them. We will set aside the amendment and vote on the amendment \ntomorrow.\n  If colleagues have amendments that they would like to be considered \nand disposed of, and frankly I think we are going to be more favorably \ndisposed tonight than we will be later on Friday and certainly on \nMonday and Tuesday. I encourage colleagues if they have amendments to \nplease bring those to the floor and we will try to assist in any way we \ncan as far as disposing of them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand there is a pending \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2469 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding to States to accommodate any \n               growth in the number of people in poverty)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2469 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nthat would provide additional funding to States to accommodate growth \nwhich may occur in their welfare caseloads.\n  Legislation which provides the basis for this amendment is included \nin the welfare reform bill already passed by the House of \nRepresentatives entitled H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act.\n  Title 1 of that bill includes a supplemental grant to adjust for \npopulation increases. In the House version, the grant is $100 million \nannually for each of fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and the year 2000.\n  In the Dole bill, the supplemental grant is $877 million over 5 \nyears. The House supplemental grant is distributed to States based on \neach State's proportion of the total growth. However, the Dole bill \nhandles this formula in a very complicated manner which only benefits \n19 out of the 50 States.\n  Frankly, by providing zero funding for growth, it does in the State \nof California. I have got to make that very clear.\n  The amendment I am proposing today takes the same approach, as the \nlegislation that passed the House of Representatives, with respect to \ngrowth, and would apply it to the Dole bill. California, which is \nprojected to experience a significant growth in its poor population \nover the next 5 years, under the present draft of the Dole bill, would \nreceive zero--zero.\n  There is no additional cost associated with this amendment. In fact, \nthere is some reason to believe that this method of accommodating \ngrowth equitably and objectively among all States might result in some \ncost savings when compared to the underlying bill. In any event, the \nauthorization of appropriations, for the supplemental grant for each of \nthe fiscal years, remains the same as in the Dole bill, and \ndistribution of the additional funds is capped by those amounts which \ntotal $877 million over 5 years.\n  I would add another point. All States will be held harmless under \nthis legislation. That is to say, no State's grant will be reduced if \nthe State experiences a decline in its poor population. But each and \nevery State which experiences an increase in its poor population will \nreceive a corresponding increase in its Federal grant to help them \ncarry out the mandates of this legislation.\n  Let me briefly contrast this with the approach in the underlying \nbill. As I said, only 19 States, meet the definition for use of this \nmoney under the language of the Dole bill, and that is irrespective of \ntheir actual growth of in poor youngsters. And, it excludes many States \nthat will experience growth in their caseloads.\n  Under the Dole bill, 19 States receive automatic additional funding, \n2.5 percent of the fiscal year 1996 grant in each of the years 1997 to \nthe year 2000 if, first, their State's welfare spending is less than \nthe national average level of State spending and, second, population \ngrowth is greater than the average national population growth.\n  In addition, for reasons which are unclear, certain States are deemed \nas qualifying if their level of State welfare spending is less than 35 \npercent of the national average level of State welfare spending per \npoor person in fiscal year 1996. As I understand it, only two States \nqualify. Mississippi and Arkansas are the only two States that would \nqualify under that portion of the drafting.\n  This formula penalizes States which have traditionally had higher \nlevels of State welfare spending. So, in other words, if you have been \na high benefit State, you are actually penalized by the bill. And, it \nrewards States, irrespective of their projected, or actual, population \ngrowth or decline.\n  I must say I am astonished that many States which are projected to \nhave significant increases in their poor populations do not meet the \ndefinition required by the Dole bill. It leads me to conclude that this \nsupplemental grant is not necessarily to accommodate growth at all.\n  Federal taxpayers are being asked to spend almost $1 billion over 5 \nyears in the name of growth. But, in fact, the result is that States \nwhich, until now, have spent less than the average in assisting the \npoor will now be subsidized. So, until now, they have not spent much, \nand, now, they are going to be subsidized by the taxpayers of all 50 \nStates. What kind of a bill is that?\n  Let me take a moment to review for you what some of the benefit \nlevels have been from some of the States who will be beneficiaries of \nthis so-called growth fund. In Mississippi the maximum monthly AFDC \nbenefit for one-parent families with two children has been $120. That \nis $120 in combined Federal-State AFDC grants. In Alabama, the combined \nmaximum has been $164. In Texas, the maximum benefit has been $188. In \nTennessee, $185. Louisiana, $190. Arkansas, $204. Kentucky, $228.\n  Let us look at one or two States with similar benefit levels. In \nIndiana, the monthly benefit is $288. In Missouri, it is $292. But even \nthough these levels are similar to other States, they will receive \nnothing, zero, zip--nothing--to accommodate any increase in their poor \npopulations. Why? Who would draw this kind of growth formula?\n  Let us look now at some high growth States. Let us see what they \nget--Washington, for example. While the \n\n[[Page S 12809]]\nBureau of the Census projects a general population growth of almost 10 \npercent, the Dole bill provides zero funding for growth. Idaho is \nprojected to experience a general increase in its population of almost \n11 percent, Mr. President. Is it a growth State under the Dole bill? \nThe answer is no. Finally, let us take a look at California, the most \npopulous State in the Nation and one which is projected to grow by 6.25 \npercent over the next 5 years. It, too, receives no additional funds to \nmeet the anticipated growth in caseload.\n  Clearly, the growth fund in the underlying bill is, as I have said, \nnot a true growth fund. It is a fund for some other reason, but I do \nnot think anyone in this body should call it a growth fund. I believe \nthis is a fundamental flaw in the Dole bill, as compared to the House \nversion of the welfare reform bill.\n  None of us in this body knows what the future holds for our States--\nwhether it is economic recession in a rust belt State, regional \ndownturn in a sunbelt State, natural disaster in any part of our \ncountry, or even Federal base closures. What we do know is there will \nbe unanticipated regional economic conditions and corresponding \nfluctuations in the incidence of poverty. Any State is susceptible to \nthese circumstances. This amendment, the amendment I am proposing, \nsimply uses the same approach as in the House bill, applies it to the \n$877 million, and says that you receive additional funding for growth \nproportionate to your numbers published by the Bureau of the Census. If \nyour poor population goes up, you will get the corresponding \nproportional share of that fund.\n  This, to me, is the fair way of doing it. No gimmicks, you use the \ncensus figures. If you are a growth State, you get extra funding to \ncarry out the mandate. Frankly, most of the States, the overwhelming \nnumber of States, are projected to benefit, and also States with no \ngrowth, or actual declines in population, are held harmless. And, \nfinally again, it costs no more money.\n  You will have proposals before you that use a little sleight of hand. \nSome will reduce the base funding level currently in the Dole bill and \nthen add to it. This amendment does not alter the initial grant in the \nDole bill. This takes the initial grant level, applies the poverty data \nsupplied by the Bureau of the Census, and simply says, as the House in \nits wisdom did, that that data is used objectively to determine any \nadditional funds which are provided to each and every State. So, Mr. \nPresident, your State would benefit from that. My State would benefit \nfrom that for sure. That is what this amendment does.\n  Let me conclude on this amendment by saying that this is not a matter \nof ``winners'' and ``losers.'' It is a matter of accuracy and fairness \ninvolving the distribution of Federal funds. I think it is very \ndifficult for anyone to argue against that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator from California will yield, I appreciate \nher amendment, and I want to thank her for coming to the floor and \noffering her amendment. I see other colleagues, as well as the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I again urge other Senators, if they have amendments, I \nthink we will be lot more receptive and also it will expedite the \nconsideration of those amendments for tomorrow or on Monday.\n  I do not know that this--as a matter of fact, I doubt that allocation \namendments are the ones that will be readily agreed upon because some \nStates win and some States lose. Allocation formulas are always \ncontested in almost any type of bill like this, whether it is a highway \nbill or a welfare bill or other allocations. The allocation formula the \nSenator is proposing under her amendment would be identical to the one \nnow currently in the House bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is the same basis. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The amendment is directed toward States that have \nincreases in welfare population.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct any and all States.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Welfare population being defined as welfare children, or \njust total welfare population of the States.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is defined as increase in poor populations \nmeasured by current census data.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The information that the Senator handed out, the \ndistribution formula that she is recommending and the impact on the \nStates is on actually the second page of the handout but recorded as \npage 4.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I did not bring those with me because we are making \ncharts, and we were called, and we came down before the charts were \nready, I am afraid.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have a couple of charts. I want to make sure. I will \nconfer with my colleague and friend.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There are four charts. If I can take a look at them \nwhen we finish, I would be happy to.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct. I know the formula is going to be \ndifficult to change. If it looks like a growth formula, if it is named \nlike a growth formula, it ought to talk and walk like a growth formula. \nThat is all I am saying.\n  More States are benefited by this. I think 27 States fare better than \nin the underlying bill are clearly benefited by this, and States which \ndo not experience an increase are held harmless.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my colleague will yield further, she has 27 States \nthat would presumably do better under the great portion of the bill, \nnot the entire bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator's amendment is allocating the money set \naside for growth States, and under her proposed distribution it would \nincrease benefits under that portion of the fund to 27 States as \ncompared to 10 States. In other words, under the Dole proposal.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As compared to 19 States. The Dole proposal, as we \nunderstand it, benefits only 19 States. My amendment benefits all \nStates. I would be happy to debate it. If I am wrong, I would be happy \nto admit it. This is our belief. Our formula would benefit 27 States, \nbeyond those in the Dole bill, and would hold everybody else harmless. \nSo nobody would go below what their 1996 level is.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me further try to clarify so I will know and maybe \njust help us tomorrow when we are considering these amendments.\n  Under the proposal of the Senator from California, it benefits 27 \nStates. You do not change the amount of money. So you spread it out \nover a few more States. Senator Dole's proposal would have additional \nfor the growth States that have large increases in poverty. It would \nbenefit 19 States. So presumably they would do a little bit better. So \nyou are dividing up the same amount of money as compared to your growth \nproposal. We will have charts to make an analysis or comparison under \nboth proposals.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. They are not necessarily all of the growth States \nthat are benefited.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Senator Dole's \nproposal, I believe, is directed toward States that have significant \nincreases in growth in poverty. And my guess is--I have not studied \nthese charts--but he talks about the growth funds for States that have \nsignificant increases in poverty. Yours maybe is a little broader \ndistribution.\n  I will tell my colleagues that there is a dispute on both sides of \nthe aisle. This is probably not a partisan amendment as such because \npeople wrestle with distribution formulas, and trying to come up with \nmost equitable formula is not always the easiest thing to do, \nparticularly if they have a lot of inequities in past distribution \nformulas which we have had with different programs.\n  But I, again, want to thank the Senator from California for offering \nher amendment and sending it to the desk.\n  Does the Senator also have another amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct, for tonight.\n  Let me just say what I understand the Dole does in this area. Then if \nI am wrong, I would be happy to know that.\n  These funds apply, if two things are met: one, the State's welfare \nspending is less than the national average of State spending; and, \nsecond, population growth is greater than the national population \ngrowth. That does not necessarily relate to welfare population growth. \nThat is one problem that I have with it.\n\n[[Page S 12810]]\n\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2470 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n(Purpose: To impose a child support obligation on paternal grandparents \n               in cases in which both parents are minors)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I now send the second amendment to the desk \nand I ask for its consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \ntemporarily set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2470 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 654, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS AGAINST PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS \n                   IN CASES OF MINOR PARENTS.\n\n       Section 466(a) (42 U.S.C. 666(a)), as amended by sections \n     915, 917(a), 923, 965, and 976, is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(17) Procedures under which any child support order \n     enforced under this part with respect to a child of minor \n     parents, if the mother of such child is receiving assistance \n     under the State grant under part A, shall be enforceable, \n     jointly and severally, against the paternal grandparents of \n     such child.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as I have listened to the debate, \nthere has been a lot of talk about teenage pregnancy, youngsters \nimpregnating youngsters, walking away from their responsibility, and \nreally young children becoming pregnant, becoming teen mothers often by \nteen fathers. I have heard many Senators say we must stop this. I \nbelieve we have a way to send a major message to a constituency, and it \nis contained in this amendment.\n  What this amendment would do is say that every State must have in \neffect laws and procedures under which a child support order can be \nenforced, where both parents are minors, and, the mother is a minor \nreceiving Federal assistance for the child, against the paternal \ngrandparents of the child.\n  So if you are the mother and father of a boy child, and your boy \nchild goes out and impregnates a minor girl who ends up on welfare as a \nresult, you will be liable for a child support order against you as the \nparents of that young boy.\n  What I find increasingly is that child support is a growing crisis. \nThis has also been debated--and, frankly, the lack of child support is \none of the major causes of children living in poverty in my State; that \nis, the absence of child support--a parent, usually the father, not \nalways, but usually it is the father that just walks off and does not \nsupport his child.\n  Well, if this is going to be a tough welfare bill, let us address it. \nLet us say, ``Parents, you are responsible for the behavior of your \nadolescent son. If your adolescent son is going to go out and get a \nyoung girl pregnant, you are going to have to pay for the uprearing and \nthe child support of that offspring.''\n  I think the time has come for this kind of amendment. It is strong. \nIt is an amendment that attributes family responsibility. It is an \namendment that says parents of minors have responsibilities and one of \nthose responsibilities is to see to it that their sons do not enter \ninto this kind of conduct and then walk away from their responsibility.\n  So, I would now ask that that amendment be set aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be set aside.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, while my colleague from California is \nhere, I have not had a chance to totally review her second amendment. I \nam very interested in this amendment. It is a tough amendment. If I \nunderstand it correctly, if my colleague from California will correct \nme if I misunderstood her statement, but the Senator's amendment would \nbasically, if you have a minor with a child, a single parent--the \npaternal grandparents would be liable for what expense?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For the child support. A court order would be \nobtained and the parents of the male child would be responsible for the \nchild support of that offspring.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me talk out loud or think out loud. So if you have a \nteenage mother, if you have in this case an unmarried single mother, \nand if there is a court order placed against the father for child \nsupport, if that is not collectible from the father, then the parents \nof the father in this case would be liable for the child support?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct where the father is also a minor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The primary responsibility would still be the father.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. But if the father is delinquent, if the father is not \navailable or unable to pay, for whatever reason, unemployed, you name \nit, then the parents of the absentee father in this case would be \nliable?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct for minor fathers. And I would \ncertainly welcome the Senator from Oklahoma looking at this. If there \nis any way he thinks it could be made better, I would be delighted.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague from California for offering \nthe amendment tonight. I appreciate that. I am interested in the \namendment. It looks good from what I have seen. I will study it further \nand see if we can support it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Oklahoma. \nSenator Feinstein's second amendment, I think, is a positive amendment \nand one that maybe we can work on and get it accepted on both sides. I \nthink it is a good amendment.\n  I am not as enthusiastic about the first amendment. In defense of \nSenator Hutchison, who really did an outstanding job on this side of \nthe aisle in working on the issue of formulas and trying to bring some \ncompromise into a very difficult issue, nobody is happy with \nallocations of formulas, as the Senator from Oklahoma said. There are \nStates that win; there are States that lose. What we tried to do is \nhold at least everybody harmless. We did under the formula that is in \nthe Dole bill and then provided some reasonable amount of money for \ngrowth. I guess what is really the bugaboo here is how we determine \nwhat growth is and what is fair.\n  I suggest to you that if the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], \nwere here, what she would say is what is fair should not be based on \nwhat is--a system that you receive money from the State based on how \nmuch money you put up, not on how many poor people you have but how \nmuch money you are willing to give to the poor people in your State. So \nif you are a State like California, which is a high-benefit State and \nputs up a lot of money, you get more Federal dollars. It is a match. \nThe more you put up, the more money you get. And so as a result, States \nlike California and, I would say, Pennsylvania where I am from, which \nis above average--not as high as California but above-average State as \nfar as welfare dollars--get more money from the Federal Government \nbecause we are willing to put up more State dollars to match the \nFederal funds.\n  Now, that is an equitable system the way it exists today, but we are \nchanging the system. Effective as a result of this bill's passage there \nis no more Federal match. There is no more every dollar we put up or \nevery--I think it is roughly 50-50--every dollar we put up, you put up \na dollar and we go on together.\n  What we do now is send a block grant to the States. Every State gets \na block grant. What is that? It is an amount of money irrespective of \nanything else. Irrespective of how much you are contributing, we are \ngoing to give you an amount of money that you will be able to spend on \nAFDC to help mothers with children. It is not dependent anymore on how \nmuch money you put up. It is just a block grant.\n  Now, if we were going to design a block grant program from the start, \nif we did not have the existing AFDC program in place, how would we \ndistribute that money? Well, let me tell you how it is distributed \nunder the bill. It is distributed based on how much money you got last \nyear.\n  Think about this. Now we are giving a block grant to take care of a \npopulation of children and in most cases mothers and we are basing it \non last year's amount of money that the State got, which, of course, \nfrom last year, \n\n[[Page S 12811]]\nwas based on how much the State was willing to pony up to get Federal \ndollars and match it. It has no relation again to how many more persons \nbut to how much the State was willing to spend.\n  So what happens, there are many States that are high-benefit States \nthat are getting a lot more money per child than low-benefit States are \ngetting per child. If we were going to design a program today from \nstart--let us say we did not have an AFDC program, we had no poverty \nassistance program at the Federal level; we were going to start a \nprogram today--how would we design a model for helping children?\n  I suggest that what we would do is exactly what the Senator from \nCalifornia suggested. We should figure out how many poor people there \nare in the State, people eligible for welfare, for AFDC, and allocate \nso many dollars per person on welfare. We would take the number of \npeople on welfare in the country, we would say here is how many dollars \nper person each State will get for that person on welfare and divide it \nup among the States. That would be a fair allocation formula. No child \nin California is worth more than a child in Mississippi or Vermont or \nOklahoma.\n  But that is not what we did. We did not start out and say everybody \nis going to get the same irrespective. What we did was say children in \nCalifornia actually get more money because the State in the prior \nlegislation, the current AFDC law contributed more so children in \nCalifornia get $200 per month per child and a person in Mississippi may \nget $50.\n  Now, what the Senator from California says is that, well, we are \nsubsidizing these bad States like Mississippi that did not contribute a \nlot of money to help the people in their State.\n  I hear a lot from the other side of the aisle about we should not be \npunishing children--except, of course, if they happen to live in a \nState that is not a high-benefit State in this example because that is \nexactly what we do with the Feinstein amendment. We punish children who \nlive in low-benefit States that continue to get low benefits under the \ncurrent program.\n  What Senator Hutchison did was say, look, let us look at, since we \nnow no longer require in this bill any kind of matching State funds--\nthere is no maintenance-of-effort provision in this bill. California \ncan completely pull the plug on every dollar of welfare spending that \nthey are now required to spend to get the Federal match. They do not \nhave to contribute a cent anymore and they get all the money. And they \nget two or three times as much per child as Mississippi. But now, \nagain, California does not have to spend the money to get that money.\n  Now, how is it fair to say that California should get, because they \nare increasing in population, even more money per child than \nMississippi which maybe is not growing as fast? If you look at it from \nthe perspective of not what has been but what a fair allocation formula \nshould be now based on a completely new model, you would suggest that \nStates having low-benefit levels that are growing should be the \nrecipients of the increasing growth funds to have their children come \nup to parity with States like California and Pennsylvania and New York \nand others.\n  That is what the Senator from Texas is suggesting. I would also \nsuggest the Senator from California is doing her duty. She represents a \nmega-State, a State that has been very generous with welfare dollars, \nand under her allocation formula of the pot, I think California--I \nthink it is about $1.5 billion, money that would be allocated over the \nnext 7 years for these programs. They get roughly half the money in \nCalifornia under this program. It is a big chunk. California is a big \nState. It has one-eighth of the population of the country but they get \nabout half the increase under this formula allocation.\n  If I was from California, I would design a program that got me half \nthe money, too. I understand that. But it is not fair when you consider \nthe new rules that we have put in place. No longer do we require match. \nThat is the key here. California does not have to put up a penny to get \nthis money anymore.\n  What we are saying is because we do not make them put up a penny \nanymore and because they are getting much more per child than I think \nany other State, with the possible exception of New York, we are not \ngoing to give them even more money because they happen to be growing. \nWe are going to take care of the States that do not get a lot of money \nand that are growing also.\n  So that is the basis for this discussion. And so while it may, to the \nvirgin ear on this subject, be a very appealing argument from the \nSenator from California that this is only fair, I mean we are growing \nand therefore we deserve more money, I would suggest that if we are \nlooking at it for the sake of the child and not looking at where that \nchild lives but looking at what the Federal Government's obligation is \nto a child under a new system where State matching dollars are \nirrelevant, then I would suggest that growth fund should be targeted to \nthose States where the Federal contribution per child is the lowest. \nAnd that is what this amendment does.\n  I speak against my own interest in this case because Pennsylvania is \nnot as high a benefit State as California but it is an above-average \nbenefit State that is not going to receive any growth dollars according \nto the estimates. We are not going to receive a penny, and we would \nreceive a small amount of increase under the Feinstein bill.\n  So it would be in my interest for Pennsylvania to vote for, I think \nit is $6 million. It is not a whole lot of money for Pennsylvania, but \nit is a little bit of money under the Feinstein amendment. That might \nbe my benefit, but I do not think it is fair under the new allocation. \nI think it is fair to focus on the child, not where that child lives, \nin what State.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut said earlier in the day, this is a \nFederal problem and we should have a Federal solution. I did not agree \nwith the second part. It is a Federal problem. We do not need Federal \nsolutions, we need local solutions. But the dollars that come from \nWashington should be equitable across the country. That is what this \ngrowth formula attempts to do, to bring other States with lower \nbenefits up to meet the average.\n  I know it is going to be a difficult vote. I happen to be from one of \nthose States that does not benefit under the current growth funds but \nwould under the Feinstein growth fund. You would be very tempted, and I \nknow many Members will be, to jump on for your parochial interests.\n  No. 1, I think it would be very damaging for the long-term interests \nof this bill. I think it is absolutely unfair when you look at the \nchild, not where the child lives and how much the Federal Government is \npaying per child. I think that should be the fundamental test of \nwhether this formula is fair.\n  I know this is going to be a very heated issue. It is one that is \ngoing to be talked about tomorrow, and I know the Senator from Texas \nwill be far more eloquent than I have been in defending her formula. I \njust want to commend the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, one \nmore time, for the tremendous work she did in putting together an \nallocation formula which no one thought could be done. We did not think \nwe would be able to work this one out. This was the issue that was \nbogging us down.\n  When it comes to money, everybody gets real tightfisted around here. \nWe were able to work out something which I think is defensible, not \nonly from a political standpoint of folks being able to explain back \nhome, but I think it is very defensible from a fairness perspective of \nwhat this bill actually accomplishes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2471 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n    (Purpose: To require States to establish a voucher program for \n providing assistance to minor children in families that are eligible \n                   for but do not receive assistance)\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Mr. President, I attempted earlier today to speak \nto this issue in general, and now, I would like to speak to the issue \nof welfare reform and the legislation before us generally as well as \nfile several amendments.\n  At the outset, I would like to say that, quite frankly, I am very \npleased with the way this process is working. In spite of all the \nslogans and the political speeches and the hot buttons and the wedge \nissues, the fact is that because of this debate, we are undertaking a \nconversation among ourselves as legislators and, again, indeed with the \ncountry around the issue of welfare generally, welfare reform and the \nappropriate response to the challenge our current system poses to this \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you that this is an issue that, as the \nFrench would say--there is an old expression--``plus ca change, plus \nc'est la meme chose,'' the more things change, the more they remain the \nsame.\n  Quite frankly, I brought to the attention of the Finance Committee, \non which I serve as a member, an article that had appeared in the \nChicago History magazine in their spring issue. The article was \nentitled ``Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Half-Orphans.'' The \ncaption of the article said:\n\n       In 19th century Chicago, the debate over the care of needy \n     children raised issues of Government versus private control \n     and institutional versus family care.\n\n  The article goes on at great length and, indeed, I have some pictures \nhere from the article that showed the condition of poor children in \nturn of the century Chicago sleeping in the gutters and the, turned \nover by their parents to orphanages, unable to be cared for because of \nthe poverty of their parents. The homeless half-orphans title refers to \nwomen who during the turn of the century struggled to raise children \nalone and because of their economic circumstances could not afford to \ndo so and were often called upon, compelled even, to turn their \nchildren over to halfway houses and orphanages and others in order to \nprovide just for the basic sustenance of those children.\n  I raise this not to inflame this debate because I, again, very much \nappreciate the way and the tenor this debate has taken, certainly this \nevening, but really to begin talking about my amendment which calls on \nthe States to establish a safety net for children, and to put that \namendment in context.\n  Essentially, the amendment itself says that when all is said and \ndone, if you will, at the end of the day, after the States, under the \nprimary legislation, have made all their rules, that in the final \nanalysis, no child--no child--in America will be left to fend for \nthemselves, will be left without subsistence, will be left homeless, \nwill be left hungry.\n  Bottom line, this amendment calls on us to make an affirmation of our \ncommitment to provide for the children and to make certain that welfare \nreform does not become a subterfuge or outlet for punishing kids for \nthe sins of their parents or the misfortune, indeed, of their parents \nto be born into poverty.\n  I think it is important for us to talk a little bit about welfare in \nthe context of poverty as an issue, because really that is what it is. \nWelfare is not a stand-alone problem, it is not something you just say \nexists over here in a vacuum by itself. Welfare is not, and never has \nbeen, anything other than a response to poverty. It is a system, a set \nof rules that calls on a Federal-State relationship and cooperation, \nand we can debate, as no doubt we will and will continue to, what that \nrelationship must be. But it, essentially, is a relationship between \nGovernment that calls on our national community to care for the welfare \nof poor children so that we do not have to go back to the friendless \nfoundlings and the homeless half-orphans that plagued so many of our \ncommunities at the turn of the century in America.\n  So welfare reform then should, at a minimum--at a minimum--ask the \nquestion, and answer in the affirmative the question: What about the \nchildren? We must always have an answer that says that no State, no \nlocality, no community, no part of our national community will allow \nfor children to go homeless and to go hungry.\n  So this amendment requires the States to establish a child voucher \nprogram to provide services to minor children who reside in families \nthat meet the State's income and resource criteria for the temporary \nassistance to needy family block grant, which is the name of the block \ngrant in the underlying bill, but who are not receiving assistance. The \namount of the voucher will be based on a pretime limit, per capita \nrate, and would be a total amount for each child.\n  The State would be called on, therefore, even if the parent did not \nqualify for failure to live up to the rules or for cutbacks or whatever \nreason, to assure that the children would be entitled to essential \nservices through a voucher system.\n  The voucher would be paid to a third party that would provide the \nservice. So a child living in a family which no longer qualified for \nassistance would still be assured of essential services. This amendment \nwould assure that children, are not punished for their parents' \nbehavior.\n  Let us talk a little bit about welfare for a moment. I think it is \nimportant to go back to the big picture issue--welfare as a response to \npoverty.\n  Right now, in this country, Mr. President, 22 percent of the children \nlive in poverty. This is higher than in any other industrialized \nnation. One in every 5 children in America lives in poverty. That means \nthat 15 million children live in poverty--40 million Americans total \noverall, but 15 million children live in poverty. That, Mr. President, \nis greater--frankly, it is 40 percent more than it was even in 1970.\n  To talk about what we mean in terms of poverty, for families of \nthree, the poverty rate is $12,320 a year. A family of four is \nconsidered to be poor if they have an income of $14,800 a year. Mr. \nPresident, 53 percent of female-headed households in this Nation are \npoor, and 23 percent of American families overall are headed by women. \nSo this becomes a problem of particular urgency for poor children, and \nparticularly for poor women.\n  Our child poverty rate here in the United States is two times that of \nAustralia and Canada. Our child poverty \n\n[[Page S 12813]]\nrate is four times that of France, Sweden, Germany, and the \nNetherlands. And so we can see that child poverty is a particular \nproblem here in the United States. It is a problem that has been \naddressed somewhat by the existence of what is known as welfare, the \nAFDC program. Again, AFDC is simply a response to poverty.\n  I have a chart, Mr. President, of child poverty rates among the \nindustrialized countries. This is the most recent data available. As \nyou can see, here is Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland. It goes \nfrom 2.5 percent up to the United States, which is 21.5 percent. We \nhave a higher rate than Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, Italy, \nGermany, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Belgium, \nSwitzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland.\n  Child poverty is a particular problem here in the United States. The \ngap between rich and poor children is greater in our country than in \nany other industrialized country. Affluent households with children in \nthe United States--the top 10 percent in terms of wealth--are amongst \nthe wealthiest children in the 18 industrialized countries that have \nbeen surveyed. Of the poorest, the bottom 10 percent of children in the \nUnited States in terms of wealth, we are the third poorest among the 18 \nindustrialized countries surveyed.\n  So the disparity in the children of the wealthiest in the world and \nthe children among the poorest is greater in this country than in any \nother industrialized nation.\n  I have another chart here. This depicts poor households with \nchildren. Here is the United States with $10,923. Affluent households \naverage almost $65,536 annually. The length of the bars represent the \ngap between rich and poor children. As we can see, here in the United \nStates, this gap is greater than anywhere else in the industrialized \nworld.\n  So, as we approach the issue of welfare reform, we are approaching an \nissue of dealing with our response to a problem that is unique in the \nindustrialized world and a problem that has been getting worse, not \nbetter.\n  The issue of welfare inflames passions in the United States. Without \ngetting into the passions, I want to talk a little bit about the facts \nin terms of the AFDC program or what is known as the welfare program. \nAs the Chair is no doubt aware, AFDC has been a response to poverty \nthat has been with us for a while. The system has come under great \nchallenge, and that is really why we are here right now, to debate the \ndirection that we are going to take in terms of reforming this program. \nWhat we generally refer to as welfare is Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren, which was established under the Social Security Act of 1935. \nStates obviously play a major role in operating this program. States \ndefine eligibility, the benefit levels, and actually administer the \nprogram. So, again, while we will talk further and in greater detail \nabout the level of State involvement, the fact is that the States \nalready make a huge determination about who will participate in the \nAFDC program.\n  Mr. President, presently there are some 14 million people receiving \nAFDC in the country. That is a lot of people. The fact of the matter is \nthat that is about 5.3 percent of our total population. But I think a \nmore stunning and compelling fact is not just that 14 million Americans \nreceive some sort of assistance under the Aid to Families with \nDependent Children, but that 9 million of those 14 million people are \nchildren; 9 million of those people are children. So we hear the \ndiscussion about folks not pulling the wagon and in the wagon having to \nbe pulled and about whose fault all of these problems are and the like. \nI think it is important that we remain mindful of the fact that fully \ntwo-thirds--9 million out of 14 million--who will be the subject of \nwhat we do here, are children. Only 5 million of those people receiving \nAFDC are adults.\n  Of those 5 million adults, Mr. President, states reported that some \n3.6 percent of their caseloads were disabled or incapacitated. That \nencompasses the people who are not able to work. So, really, of the \nfolks we are talking about in terms of welfare reform, some 4.1 million \nout of the 14 million are able bodied and able to work. Certainly, we \nstart this debate with the notion that anybody who can work should \nwork, and anybody who can take care of themselves should be able to do \nso. The question becomes, however, what about the children? What do we \ndo about the children?\n  I daresay, Mr. President, that right now the way this legislation \nbefore us is constructed, the children will lose out. There is no \nguarantee or commitment by our national community that the children \nwill be protected by the decisions that get made at the State level. On \nthe one hand, I think we can all agree that State flexibility is \nsomething that is a positive change, and States ought to be able to \nmake decisions about how they handle their local population.\n  At the same time, legislation that does not provide a safety net for \nthe children essentially penalizes those children and makes any child \nliving here in the United States really at the mercy of their location \nor geography. So a child who lives in New York may well find himself in \nthe presence of a benevolent State legislature and Governor and find \nhimself cared for and not having to sleep in the streets, as in the \noriginal picture I showed you. A child in New York may benefit, and in \nanother State a child may not. So the children, once again, become \nvictims to fortune and victims to the accident of geography and the \naccident of their birth and of their address. It seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, that that is not a result that we as a national community \nshould allow to happen.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \narticle ``Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Orphans'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Chicago History magazine, Spring, 1995]\n\n            Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Half-Orphans\n\n                           (By Joan Gittens)\n\n       Editor's note: The debate over the care of dependent \n     children is not new. In the following excerpt, Joan Gittens \n     explores nineteenth-century attitudes towards child care in \n     Illinois and Chicago.\n       There is perhaps no greater catastrophe for children than \n     when their families, for whatever reason, no longer functions \n     for them. Not only must they contend with emotional upheaval; \n     they are left without caretakers and must look to the broader \n     society for sustenance and protection. If they are fortunate, \n     relatives or friends will step in and fill the gap--if not \n     emotionally, at least on a practical level. The children \n     unlucky enough to have no surrogate parents must look to the \n     society at large to take an interest in their well-being. \n     That this is at best a tenuous situation for a child is \n     demonstrated by the prevalence of the pathetic and mistreated \n     orphan in folk and popular culture.\n       Yet folklore could scarcely exaggerate life's hazards for \n     children dependent on public bounty in Illinois. Despite the \n     citizenry's occasional intense regard--usually when a \n     particularly brutal story hit the newspapers--dependent \n     children have been generally isolated, remote from public \n     consciousness, and without natural allies. ``Their very \n     innocence and inoffensiveness leads to their disregard,'' \n     wrote one observer bitterly. ``They make no loud outcry and \n     menace no one. Since there are so few voices raised in their \n     behalf, it is not surprising that the persons charged with \n     their care should be ignorant of any problems they present, \n     and blind to their real interests.''\n       Besides being easy to ignore, dependent children have \n     historically been costly to the state, requiring years of \n     expense before they could become self-sufficient. How much \n     the issue of their poverty has shaped their prospects the \n     State Board of Charities noted late in the nineteenth \n     century, citing the telling fact that as early as 1795 the \n     territory of Illinois had created an orphans' court to deal \n     with the estates of children who had lost their parents. The \n     children most desperately in need, children without means or \n     property, had no court to watch over their interests. They \n     had instead the overseer of the poor, who could apprentice \n     children from destitute families even over their parents' \n     objections.\n       Another territorial law underscored the inferior protection \n     accorded to dependent children. The law provided that \n     apprentices and masters could take grievances to a justice of \n     the peace to rule on, thus enforcing on the one hand the \n     master's right to obedience and hard work and on the other \n     the apprentice's right to decent treatment and competent \n     education. The law specifically excluded from protection \n     children apprenticed by the local poor law officials.\n       The conscious separation of ``the state's children'' from \n     those with parents continued in the Poor Law of 1819, the \n     social welfare law passed the year after Illinois attained \n     statehood. But revisions of apprenticeship and poor laws in \n     the next fifteen years reflected a growing sense that the \n     state owed a more even-handed treatment to the vulnerable \n     children who looked to them for support. The Apprenticeship \n     Law of 1926 and the \n\n[[Page S 12814]]\n     Poor Law of 1833 made it the concern of the state that dependent \n     children's apprenticeships be monitored to some extent by the \n     probate judge, who was charged to keep the bonds of indenture \n     in his office and to investigate indentured children's \n     situations from time to time. The laws also articulated some \n     of the expectations that the children might have: the right \n     to decent treatment, adequate education, a new Bible, and two \n     suits of clothes (suitable to their station in life) at the \n     end of the apprenticeship. Masters still had great discretion \n     to decide what was fit and proper treatment, but there was at \n     least some sense that children dependent on the state had a \n     right to proper care.\n       The Apprenticeship Law of 1826, in addition to voicing some \n     concerns about the protection of dependent children, gave a \n     further indication of an increasing sense of state \n     responsibility by expanding the definition of children \n     requiring state attention. This law gave wide latitude to the \n     overseer of the poor in indenturing children whom he deemed \n     to be inadequately cared for, like the children of beggars, \n     habitual drunkards, and widows of ``bad character.'' This was \n     the first recognition that the state might need to intercede\n      even in families who had not turned to the overseers of the \n     poor for help. And it was the first articulation that the \n     state had an interest in doing more than warding off \n     imminent starvation, that it also had an interest in the \n     proper rearing of children and an obligation on some level \n     to step in if such proper rearing was not going forward.\n       This concern about proper child rearing was a nineteenth-\n     century phenomenon all across Western culture, but in the \n     United States it was especially tied to the republican \n     experiment that must have been very much on citizens' minds \n     in 1826, that fiftieth-anniversary year of the Declaration of \n     Independence. The adequate raising of children was a \n     humanitarian concern, but it was also a practical matter for \n     the survival of the noble but risky political enterprise that \n     was the focus of so much anxiety and so much international \n     attention. In the 1840s, the Illinois Supreme Court gave this \n     rationale for the state's presumption to interfere in family \n     life:\n       The power of chancery to interfere with and control, not \n     only the estates but the persons and custody of all minors \n     within the limits of its jurisdiction, is of very ancient \n     origin, and can not now be questioned. This is a power which \n     must necessarily exist somewhere in every well regulated \n     society, and more especially in a republican government, \n     where each man should be reared and educated under such \n     influences that he may be qualified to exercise the rights of \n     a freeman and take part in the government of the country. It \n     is a duty, then, which the country owes as well to itself, as \n     to the infant, to see that he is not abused, defrauded or \n     neglected, and the infant has a right to this protection.\n       To some extent the laws dealing with the adult poor \n     reflected increased humanitarian concern as well--Illinois \n     outlawed the practice of auctioning off the destitute to the \n     lowest bidder in 1827, for example--but it is striking that \n     in its increased concern about neglected children, the state \n     paid little or no heed to the rights of poor parents. Earlier \n     poor laws had given the overseer of the poor the right to \n     indenture children without parental consent if the family had \n     become a charge upon the state, even if their poverty was \n     only a temporary catastrophe. The 1826 law expanded the \n     overseer's discretionary powers to decide on the fitness of \n     parents, and while on the one hand that showed an increased \n     concern for the well-being of children, it also reflected a \n     callousness toward the civil rights of poor parents that had \n     always pervaded American poor laws.\n       This cavalier approach toward destitute families remained \n     characteristic of those engaged in child welfare right \n     through the nineteenth century, a striking anomaly in a \n     society where the sanctity of family ties was a paramount \n     value. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century \n     that some child welfare theorists would begin to argue for \n     the rights of poor parents and to insist\n      that the best care society could offer for children was to \n     support them in their homes rather than removing them.\n\n\n        urbanization and the growth of the child welfare problem\n       The growing awareness of children in need was a key \n     characteristic of nineteenth-century social welfare \n     endeavors. In Illinois, as in other areas of the country, \n     this concern had its roots in a mix of philosophical, social, \n     and practical considerations. The years before the Civil War \n     saw an outpouring of reform efforts on all levels, and \n     because of their vulnerability and dependence on adults, \n     children were prime subjects of this heightened humanitarian \n     sense. They appealed further because during the course of the \n     nineteenth century the concept of childhood as a special \n     stage of development grew apace, drawing the attention of \n     everyone from popular novelists to learned theologians.\n       Nineteenth-century culture celebrated childhood's intuitive \n     goodness and innocence, in contrast to the gloomy assessment \n     of earlier centuries, which had seen children at best as \n     profoundly ignorant and at worst as little bundles of \n     depravity. Another reason for the attention to children's \n     needs was the abiding concern that they be trained to be \n     independent, responsible citizens, not merely for their own \n     sake but for the health of the republic. Finally, attention \n     turned to dependent children because their numbers swelled so \n     markedly with the rapid growth of urban centers during the \n     nineteenth century.\n       Chicago, a frontier outpost at its incorporation in 1833, \n     grew in the next sixty-seven years to be the second largest \n     city in the United States, an industrial center that \n     attracted immigrants from all over the world. According to \n     the national census, the population of Chicago was 4,470 \n     people in 1840; 298,977 in 1870; and 1,698,575 in 1900. The \n     rapid growth of the city brought great wealth to some, but it \n     brought in its wake much suffering as well. Immigrants who \n     came to the city seeking a better life sometimes found \n     Chicago to be a place of opportunity, but many found \n     themselves enmeshed in a web of poverty, depression, and \n     squalor, and the devastating effects of urban life were \n     particularly visible in children. In 1851 the city charter \n     noted a group that greatly concerned officials: ``children \n     who are destitute of proper parental care, wandering about \n     the streets, committing mischief, and growing up in \n     mendicancy, ignorance, idleness, and vice.'' These children, \n     popularly called ``street arabs,'' were viewed as potential \n     trouble makers and therefore received official attention \n     early.\n       In addition to these children there were others affected by \n     the disruption of city life. The legislature had made minimal \n     legal provisions for illegitimate children, for example, in \n     the early years of statehood; the presumption was that the \n     mother would keep her baby and the town would support her and \n     her child at subsistence level\n      (and with the most grudging of attitudes) if the father \n     could not be held to account and she could not manage for \n     herself. But in the vast, anonymous city, a desperate \n     mother could simply abandon her baby on the streets \n     without busy neighbors discovering the desertion, as they \n     would inevitably have done in a small town or rural \n     setting. The increase of this phenomenon of deserted \n     children, little ``foundlings'' as they were called, was a \n     gruesome measure of the hazards that the city could hold \n     in store for young women and their unwanted children.\n       Orphans as a group grew in number as well. All the dangers \n     of disease were compounded by crowded city life, by filthy \n     tenements and equally filthy and dangerous work places. \n     Children could lose one or both parents to a host of diseases \n     such as cholera, small pox, and tuberculosis. The United \n     States suffered through three cholera epidemics, in 1832 and \n     again in the 1840s and 1850s, and the fact that the disease \n     was waterborne insured that the poor, crowded into tenements \n     and using the foulest of water, were among the hardest hit by \n     the recurring plagues.\n       ``Half-orphans'' (the standard term for children who had \n     lost one parent) also claimed the reluctant attention of the \n     state. If the mother died, the children might come to the \n     attention of the larger society because they stood in need of \n     care and nurturing. It was possible that they would turn into \n     some of the little ``street arabs'' about whom Chicago city \n     officials expressed such concern. But a father's death, on a \n     practical level, was even more catastrophic. Most poor \n     families patched together their meager income from money \n     brought in by fathers, mothers, and children; working men, \n     although they were paid very little, were routinely paid more \n     than women and children, and they made the largest \n     contribution to the family income. Widowed mothers, ill-\n     equipped to provide for their families, might find themselves \n     turning to the city or county for help to support their \n     children. Children were also left ``half-orphaned'' in fact, \n     although not in law, by their father's desertion of the \n     family. Sometimes this desertion was absolute; but Hull-House \n     resident Julia Lathrop wryly noted ``the masculine expedient \n     of temporary disappearance in the face of nonemployment or \n     domestic complexity, or both,'' contending that ``the \n     intermittent husband is a constant factor in the economic \n     problem of many a household.''\n       Natural catastrophes like the Great Fire of 1871 were \n     another cause of dependency in children, and family problems \n     and the stresses of urban life were compounded as well by the \n     labor unrest that characterized the last twenty-five years of \n     the century. In addition, the country experienced a financial \n     panic approximately every twenty years: in 1819, 1837, 1857, \n     1873 and 1893. In Chicago, the Panic of 1893 was delayed for \n     a time by the Columbian Exposition, but with the close of the \n     exhibition, jobs disappeared and all the severity of that \n     worst of nineteenth-century depressions was visited on the \n     city. The year 1894 was in many ways a terrible time for the \n     poor of Chicago. Compounding the depression was the violence \n     and bitterness of the Pullman Strike, and the ultimate defeat \n     of organized labor in the prolonged struggle. A small-pox \n     epidemic struck the city; and the winter was one of the worst \n     on record. The dependency rate soared. Families who had never \n     been able to save enough to have\n      a cushion against disaster were utterly destroyed by such \n     compounded misfortune and had to turn to the city and \n     country for help.\n\n\n                The State Response to Dependent Children\n\n       Although the vicissitudes of urban life and economic \n     instability throughout the century greatly expanded both the \n     number and types of children in need of help, public \n     officials resisted innovation in dealing with the needs of \n     dependent children, lumping them with the rest of the \n     dependent population rather than addressing their particular \n     needs as did the private organizations that began to \n\n[[Page S 12815]]\n     flourish in Chicago in the 1850s. In downstate Illinois, dependent \n     children were still primarily indentured through the middle \n     years of the century. An 1854 revision of the apprenticeship \n     law manifested some special attention to children's needs, \n     strengthening their right to basic education and protection \n     by Poor Law officials who were to monitor their treatment and \n     to ``defend them from all cruelty, neglect, and breach of \n     contract on the part of their master.'' An 1874 law further \n     defined the child's rights to proper care, specifically \n     forbidding ``underserved or immoderate correction, \n     unwholesome food, insufficient allowance of food, raiment or \n     lodging, want of sufficient care or physic in sickness, want \n     of instruction in their trade.'' Such bad behavior on the \n     part of the master gave the state sufficient cause to end \n     indentures. These revisions of the original apprenticeship \n     law reflected the state's ambivalence about parental rights. \n     The 1854 revision deleted the clause authorizing the removal \n     of children from parents whom the overseer of the poor deemed \n     unfit. But the 1874 law restored intervention to some degree, \n     allowing the overseers of the poor to apprentice without \n     parental consent any child ``who habitually begs for alms.''\n       Although the basic concept of apprenticeship for dependent \n     children was shortly to reappear in social welfare parlance \n     as the innovative notion of ``free foster homes,'' the whole \n     system of formal, legal apprenticeship as a means of caring \n     for dependent children was beginning to die out in \n     nineteenth-century America. In northern Illinois counties, \n     particularly Cook County, poor law officials instead placed \n     children in the poorhouse, and this trend became state-wide \n     by the end of the century. Most often children were in the \n     poorhouse with their mothers, but a few orphans and \n     illegitimate children ended up there as well.\n       The presence of children in the almshouse was an enduring \n     affront to reformers. In 1853 a Cook County grand jury found \n     the almshouse to be grossly inadequate, noting with \n     disapproval that ``the section devoted to women and children \n     is so crowded as to be very offensive.'' The physical \n     conditions of this particular poorhouse did improve somewhat \n     over time, but those who concerned themselves with child \n     welfare universally accepted the maxim that the poorhouse was \n     no fit place for children. Forty years and much reform \n     agitation later, the situation was not significantly better. \n     Julia Lathrop, who toured the Cook County poorhouse many \n     times as a member of the State Board of Charities, wrote this \n     description of the children there in 1894:\n       There are usually from fifty to seventy-five children, of \n     whom a large proportion are young children with their \n     mothers, a very few of whom are for adoption. The remainder, \n     perhaps a third, are the residuum of all the orphan asylums \n     and hospitals, children whom no one cares to adopt because \n     they are unattractive or scarred or sickly. These children \n     are sent to the public schools across the street from the \n     poor-farm. Of course they wear hideous clothes, and of course \n     the outside children sometimes jeer at them.\n       These children, as part of the poorhouse population, were \n     among the most stigmatized and outcast members of nineteenth-\n     century society. Nobody went to the poorhouse if they could \n     help it. These institutions were deliberately set up to be as \n     unattractive as possible, a meager social mechanism intended \n     merely to sustain life in the dependent population. The poor, \n     who could pay with no other currency, were expected to pay \n     with their dignity for their board and room. Lathrop spoke of \n     ``the absolute lack of privacy, the monotony and dul[l]ness, \n     the discipline, the enforced cleanliness.'' Nor was enforced \n     cleanliness always the problem. The poorhouse superintendent \n     in Coles County reported in 1880, apparently without \n     embarrassment, that he could not remember one bath having \n     been taken in his sixteen years in charge. The institution's \n     surroundings reflected his laissez faire approach to hygiene.\n       It was still possible for poor families to receive some \n     measure of ``outdoor relief'' in most counties of the state \n     in the mid to late nineteenth century, but such support was \n     very limited. Nineteenth-century economic theory, reinforcing \n     the already parsimonious attitude of Americans, posited that \n     handouts merely increased dependency and led to the \n     ``pauperizing'' of families, destroying their initiative and \n     drive to do better. Poorhouses were set up to replace most \n     outdoor relief, created with the notion that they must not be \n     too attractive or they would be crowded with shiftless types \n     simply trying to live on the bounty of the town. In reality, \n     authorities need not have feared such a thing. Anyone who \n     could possibly manage it stayed out of the poorhouse. Those \n     who entered were the unfortunate souls who had no one to \n     protect them or find them a tolerable situation in the \n     outside world. Children shared the poorhouse with the \n     chronically sick, the elderly poor, the insane, and the \n     mentally and physically disabled, as well as the ``paupers'' \n     who simply could not make an economic go of it on the \n     outside. In Cook County, and elsewhere on a less grand scale, \n     the essential misery of the poorhouse was compounded by \n     corruption. The staff jobs were filled by patronage, and \n     those in charge of the various wards were thus unlikely to be \n     much exercised about the humane care of inmates.\n       One of the most critical voices raised against the abuses \n     of the poorhouse and the presence of children there was that \n     of the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities, \n     established by the legislature in 1869 to monitor and \n     coordinate the various social welfare efforts throughout the \n     state. The board's power was originally very restricted. \n     ``The duties required of the commission are quite onerous,'' \n     the First Biennial Report stated ruefully. ``The powers \n     granted are very limited. The board has unlimited power of \n     inspection, suggestion and recommendation, but no\n      administrative power whatsoever.'' Still, the State Board \n     could and did register vigorous disapproval, and it made \n     enough impact so that a bill to dissolve the new \n     monitoring agency was introduced into the legislature \n     almost immediately. The bill failed, but hostile \n     legislators were able to limit inspection dramatically at \n     one point by cutting off all travel funds for the \n     commissioners.\n       Despite such constraints, the State Board fulfilled an \n     important function as the first official agency in the state \n     to collect and tabulate information about the actual living \n     conditions of dependent members of society, including \n     children. For example, the board reported that in 1880 \n     Illinois almshouses housed 386 children; forty were assessed \n     as feebleminded, twenty-four diseased, fourteen defective, \n     and eighty-three had been born in the almshouse. Of that \n     eighty-three, seventy-nine were illegitimate, a fact pointed \n     to by almshouse critics to illustrate their concern about the \n     inadequate separation of the sexes in the institutions. Some \n     poorhouses had schools or arranged that children should \n     attend the public schools in the vicinity; but in many county \n     almshouses, the children did not go to school at all. Still, \n     there was no doubt in anyone's mind that these children were \n     getting an education, a thorough grounding in the seamier \n     side of life.\n       In 1879 there was a movement in Cook County to get children \n     out of the almshouse and into private child care \n     institutions. This effort revealed the prevailing attitudes \n     of reformers toward the parents of children who were \n     dependent because of poverty. Much negotiation was necessary \n     to settle which orphanages were to take the children, since \n     religious groups insisted that the children's religious \n     affiliations be respected. Yet in all the negotiations, no \n     one considered that the poorhouse mothers might have an \n     opinion about the removal of their children. The private \n     institutions involved required the termination of parental \n     rights before they would take the children. When the mothers \n     in the Cook County poorhouse learned that their children's \n     well-being was to be bought at the expense of their \n     parenthood, they protested vigorously but without success. \n     Some reformers, in fact, expressed the view that the mothers' \n     unwillingness to give up their children demonstrated their \n     lack of affection for their families. But in the end, the \n     mothers succeeded in making an eloquent statement about these \n     high-handed methods. When the officials from the child care \n     institutions arrived to pick up the children, they found that \n     most of them were gone. To prevent their removal to the \n     orphanages, the mothers had managed to find places outside \n     the poorhouse for all but seventeen out of seventy-five \n     children. The Cook County poorhouse had a rule that no \n     parents who refused to give consent to the adoption of their \n     children could enter the poorhouse, but in 1880, the county \n     agent objected to the rule as inhumane and cruel. He refused \n     to enforce the policy, and his stance meant that children \n     began to enter the Cook County poorhouse again, with and \n     without parents, less than a year after the ``rescue \n     operation'' of 1879.\n       The concern that children were growing up in such a \n     wretched setting did not disappear, despite the limited \n     success of the Cook County effort, but it took another forty \n     years for the Illinois legislature to close almshouses to \n     children. In 1895 a law provided that orphan children could \n     be removed from the poorhouse and placed in private homes, \n     but only when a private charity or individual would assume \n     the expenses connected with such placement. By 1900 a dozen \n     states, beginning with Michigan in 1869, had ended the \n     practice of putting children in the poorhouse, but Illinois \n     proved more resistant to thoroughgoing reform. Finally, in \n     1919 the legislature passed a law limiting the time in the \n     poorhouse to thirty days for girls under eighteen and boys \n     under seventeen, after which other arrangements would have to \n     be made for them. This effectively ended the use of the \n     poorhouse as a child welfare institution. By that time the \n     number of children in Illinois poorhouses had shrunk \n     considerably: to 171 children in 1918 compared to 470 at the \n     peak, 1886.\n\n\n             child care institutions under public auspices\n\n       Although the county poorhouses provided most of the public \n     care of destitute children in nineteenth-century Illinois, no \n     one made much of an argument to counter the accusations \n     leveled against them of pinch-penny meanness and spiritual \n     demoralization. In reality, they existed as the most frankly \n     minimal of offerings for children in need, with a policy set \n     far more by a consciousness of county expenditures than of \n     children's welfare. Noted social welfare thinker Homer Folks \n     remarked in 1900 that ``the states of Illinois and Missouri, \n     notwithstanding their large cities have been singularly \n     backward in making public provisions for destitute and \n     neglected children.'' In fact, Illinois had only two child \n     welfare institutions under public auspices during the \n     nineteenth century, both far more specialized than the catch-\n     all poorhouses provided by most counties. These \n\n[[Page S 12816]]\n     institutions were the Soldiers' Orphans' Home and, until 1870, the \n     Chicago Reform School.\n       The Illinois Soldiers' Orphans' Home founded in 1865 in \n     Normal, Illinois, was a state-funded institution for the care \n     of children whose fathers had been killed or disabled in the \n     Civil War. An institution with a limited purpose, the \n     Soldiers' Orphans' Home was meant to close once its original \n     population had been cared for. But in the 1870s the \n     eligibility for care was broadened to include children of all \n     Civil War veterans, an act that established the institution \n     on a more permanent basis. Frequently the children were half-\n     orphans whose mothers simply could not feed them any more. In \n     1872, for example, 532 out of 642 children had living \n     mothers. In 1879, the superintendent gave this description of \n     the newly arrived children for that year: ``The class now \n     entering are, for the most part, young and in particularly \n     destitute circumstances--those whom their mothers have \n     struggled long and\n      hard to keep, but who now find themselves, at the \n     commencement of winter, without the means for support, and \n     know they must either send them away to be cared for \n     elsewhere, or permit them to remain at home to suffer. The \n     state must now take these burdens of care and \n     responsibility where the weary mothers lay them down.''\n       The separation of children from mothers unable to provide \n     for them financially was a tragic constant in nineteenth-\n     century children's institutions. At least at the Soldier's \n     Orphans' Home there was some connection maintained between \n     children and their families; mothers were not required to \n     terminate their parental rights when they placed their \n     children there, and it was not uncommon for the children in \n     the institution to spend time, sometimes whole summers, with \n     their mothers. The population of the home fluctuated with the \n     season and with the economic climate of the times.\n       This enlightened aspect of the place, however, was not \n     typical of the administration. The Soldier's Orphans' Home \n     was often plagued by scandals and investigations, and the \n     treatment of the children was very harsh. The fact that it \n     was a publicly funded institution meant that it was \n     scrutinized fairly intensively by the State Board of \n     Charities, and the board found little to praise in the \n     orphanage. The quality of administrators varied widely, since \n     they were appointed by the governor. The first \n     superintendent, Mrs. Ohr, was a Civil War colonel's widow \n     with small children but no business capacity and a rapacious \n     appetite for elegance, furnished at the expense of the state. \n     In 1869, early in her tenure, both the Springfield Register \n     and the Chicago Times voiced accusations about serious \n     mistreatment of the children. Although Mrs. Ohr and her staff \n     were exonerated, one steward was dismissed on the grounds \n     that he had made sexual advances to a number of little girls \n     in the institution. Mrs. Ohr weathered this upset, kept on \n     because she was ``a mother to these orphans,'' in the words \n     of the investigating committee. But eventually she went too \n     far; a combination of totally ignoring the trustees' \n     instructions, keeping the children from school in order to \n     perform chores around the institutions, and thoroughly \n     profligate spending finally ended her career at the Soldiers' \n     Ophans' Home some twenty years after she had launched it.\n       The two superintendents who followed Mrs. Ohr were more \n     business-like in their approach, but they had no training in \n     the care of children, orphans or not; they were strictly \n     political appointments. The most difficult regime for the \n     children up to the turn of the century was that of a \n     Republican politician named J. L. Magner, who was nicknamed \n     ``the cattle driver'' by some of the Bloomington/Normal \n     locals because of his harsh treatment of the children. There \n     was consistent criticism that the children were made to work \n     too hard, at tasks that were sometimes beyond them, and they \n     were often kept home from school to work. One particularly \n     distressing instance of work beyond the children's capacity \n     was the scalding death of a three-year-old child, burned \n     while being bathed by some of the older children of the \n     institution.\n       Nor were the superintendents and their policies the only \n     difficulty. The building, planned by a board of trustees with \n     a poetical turn, was gracefully adorned with turrets and \n     ``crowned with a tasteful observatory.'' But Frederick Wines \n     secretary of the State Board of Charities, assessed the \n     building as a thoroughgoing failure on a practical level. \n     There were no closets, no playgrounds, only two bathrooms for \n     over three hundred children, no infirmary, and no private \n     quarters for the superintendent's family. Perhaps worst of \n     all, there was no deep wellspring to supply water. The well \n     went dry after the first year, and water had to be brought in \n     by railroad. The Soldiers' Orphans' Home, beset by scandals \n     and mismanagement, conjured up the worst fears of Illinois \n     citizens about public institutions run badly because of \n     patronage appointments.\n       The Chicago Reform School, also a public institution, won \n     approval from most critics for efficient management and \n     humane treatment of its inmates. But the school's involvement \n     with pre-delinquent boys ended with the noted O'Connell \n     decision of 1870, and the institution closed shortly after \n     this. With the exception of the inadequate provision of the \n     poorhouse, the responsibility for dependent children in \n     Chicago, from 1871 to the end of the century, was under \n     private auspices.\n\n\n         the Growth of Private Institutions in the 19th Century\n\n       The state's minimal response to dependent children was an \n     obdurate problem in the nineteenth century. An equally \n     disorganizing feature of child welfare in Illinois resulting \n     from state reluctance was the proliferation of private \n     agencies to care for children. These institutions mushroomed \n     in the state (particularly in Chicago) in the last half of \n     the nineteenth century, offering a wide variety of services \n     to children, based in part on their religious and cultural \n     identification and in part on the variety of needs that the \n     complex crises of urban life created. These agencies, \n     originally meant to fill the gap left by the inadequacy of \n     state responses quickly because entrenched in the public life \n     of the city. Their presence contributed to the fragmentation \n     that would plague child welfare efforts in Illinois through \n     the twentieth century, resulting in a lack of coordination \n     that left many dependent children unserved. By the end of the \n     nineteenth century, critics in Illinois and around the \n     country began to see the dominance of private agencies as a \n     negative and talk in terms of a stronger state organization; \n     but in the mid-nineteenth century, the private child welfare \n     institutions were autonomous, both organizationally and \n     financially, not always by their own choosing.\n       The Chicago Orphan Asylum, founded in 1848 to respond to \n     the crisis of the cholera epidemic of that year, was the \n     first orphanage in Cook County. It was followed in 1849 by \n     the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, which aimed to serve \n     Catholic\n      children and keep them out of the Protestant Chicago Orphan \n     Asylum. This carving out of religious turf, begun so early \n     in the history of child care institutions was to be a \n     major factor in the development of orphanages in Chicago. \n     In addition to a competition among religions for the care \n     of children, a strong sense of ethnicity motivated \n     founders of these institutions. Chicago had institutions \n     representing all nationalities; there were German \n     orphanages, Irish orphanages, Swedish, Polish, Lithuanian, \n     and Jewish orphanages, as well as institutions founded by \n     ``native Americans'' of English stock.\n       Besides motives of religion and ethnicity, institutions \n     developed to respond to a variety of needs among children. \n     Many of them took in the children of the poor but insisted \n     that parents relinquish their rights to the children before \n     they were accepted. A few, like the Chicago Nursery and Half-\n     Orphan Asylum, were founded to offer support to working \n     mothers who could not keep their children at home, yet wanted \n     to preserve their families. The children lived at the \n     institution, but mothers were expected to visit them \n     regularly and contribute something toward their children's \n     support. The Chicago Home for the Friendless originally took \n     in homeless and battered women as well as children but soon \n     revised its mission to focus on only on children. The Chicago \n     Foundling Hospital specialized in caring for the abandoned \n     infants found with such appalling regularity on the streets \n     and brought by the police to the institution for what care \n     and comfort it could offer. The mortality rate in foundling \n     hospitals was always shockingly high; the babies had \n     frequently suffered from exposure, and feeding them \n     adequately and safely, in the days before infant formula and \n     pasteurized milk, posed a major problem. The desertion of \n     infants was a disturbing and highly visible form of child \n     mistreatment, provoking an 1887 law that made such \n     abandonment a crime resulting in automatically terminated \n     parental rights. But not all children left at the foundling \n     hospital were abandoned on the streets. Dr. William Shipman, \n     founder of the hospital, witnessed a poignant scene in which \n     a mother and her little boy said a heartbroken farewell to \n     their baby before placing it in the champagne basket used as \n     a receptacle outside the foundling hospital. In typical \n     nineteenth century fashion. Shipman sympathized with a mother \n     pushed to such lengths, yet his assistance took the form of \n     only taking the baby, not of investigating ways that the \n     family might stay together.\n       One development among private institutions that especially \n     reflected the growing awareness of children and their needs \n     was the Illinois Humane Society, which began its child saving \n     work in 1877. By the time the population of Cook County had \n     begun its phenomenal growth, going from 43,383 people in 1850 \n     to 607,524 in 1880. Both the stresses of city life and its \n     anonymity provoked child abuse, according to Oscar Dudley, \n     director of the Illinois Humane Society, who observed that \n     ``what is everybody's business is nobody's business''; and \n     thus children could be terribly treated\n      by parents and guardians even though there were laws in \n     effect to protect them. The Humane Society originally \n     began as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to \n     Animals, but in 1877, Director Dudley transferred the \n     society's attention to cruelty against children by \n     arresting an abusive guardian. There was, he wrote, ``no \n     reason that a child should not be entitled to as much \n     protection under the law as a dumb animal.'' The Illinois \n     Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals changed \n     its name to the Illinois Humane Society in 1881, \n     recognizing that over two-thirds of its investigations \n     involved cruelty against children rather than animals. \n     Dudley asserted that from 1881, when the Humane Society \n     began to keep records, until the time that he was writing \n     (1893), over ten thousand children had been rescued. \n\n[[Page S 12817]]\n\n       The rescue operations were broadened from cases of abuse to \n     the protection of children exploited by their employers, \n     particularly when children were forced to beg or were \n     entertainers or victims of the infamous padrone system. \n     Dudley reported great success in finding asylums and homes \n     for these children, a situation receiving tacit approval from \n     the state, which did not at this point assume responsibility \n     for neglected or abused children or supervise private child \n     placement activities.\n\n\n               State Involvement in the Late 19th Century\n\n       The only real state or city involvement with private \n     institutions originally was that the mayor, acting as \n     guardian for dependent children, had the power to place them \n     in child care institutions. The city of Chicago (where most \n     of the children's institutions flourished), the surrounding \n     countries, and the state of Illinois all proved very \n     reluctant to contribute financially to private institutions. \n     The city did give very occasional assistance, in times of \n     real crisis like the cholera epidemics or the Great Fire of \n     1871, but it was limited in quantity and very episodic. The \n     most the city would do for the Chicago Nursery and Half-\n     Orphan Asylum, for example, was to provide that the city \n     could buy or lease the land upon which the asylum would be \n     built. For the Englewood Infant Nursery, the assistance was \n     even more meager: in 1893 the city provided ten tons of hard \n     coal and burial space for dead babies. For the children who \n     managed to survive, the funding had to come from other \n     sources.\n       The state did make one major concession in funding when it \n     agreed to provide subsidies for the industrial schools that \n     developed in the last years of the century. The schools were \n     modeled after English institutions made famous by the \n     renowned English reformer Mary Carpenter, who in the 1870s \n     and 1880s enjoyed considerable influence in the United \n     States. The primary point of the schools, reflecting the use \n     of the word ``industrial,'' was to train children to earn \n     their own living in later life, although in fact the training \n     tended to be geared much more toward a traditional \n     agricultural economy than toward anything having to do with \n     industry. Boys learned farming, some shoe and broommaking, \n     woodcarving and academic subjects. Girls were primarily given \n     a common school education and taught domestic skills.\n       The willingness to fund the industrial schools was \n     traceable to their mission: they were founded to deal with \n     older, predelinquent street children who threatened the \n     public order by begging, consorting with objectional \n     characters, or living in houses of ill-fame. The law \n     establishing industrial schools added that children in the \n     poorhouse were proper subjects for the schools, which meant \n     that in practice there was a mix of younger veterans of the \n     street. The State Board of Charities, which inspected the \n     schools, objected to this mix, but the industrial schools \n     survived this criticism, as well as a series of court \n     challenges ranging from civil liberties concerns to \n     objections that the schools were sectarian institutions and \n     therefore not appropriate recipients of state funds.\n       The development of the subsidy system, the state funding of \n     private institutions on an amount-per-child basis, was a \n     phenomenon noted by Homer Folks in The Care of the Destitute, \n     Neglected and Dependent Children, his end-of-the-century \n     assessment of child care trends in the United States. Neither \n     Folks nor other observers of current philanthropic trends, \n     groups like the national Conference of Charities and the \n     Illinois State Board of Charities, really approved of such an \n     arrangement. They urged Illinois to move in the direction of \n     states like Kansas and Iowa, which had converted veterans' \n     orphans' homes similar to the Illinois Soldiers' Orphans' \n     Home to state institutions that served all dependent \n     children, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or parental \n     status. These states and others around the country were \n     moving toward a point where the state\n      assumed primary responsibility for dependent children, not \n     by warehousing them in local poorhouses but by placing \n     them in state-run, central institutions from which they \n     were placed out into foster and adoptive homes. This \n     system of central state control was known as the \n     ``Michigan Plan,'' after the first state to enact the \n     policy. Illinois's neighbors Wisconsin and Minnesota, as \n     well as Michigan, had state institutions for dependent \n     children, winning the approval of child welfare theorists \n     who applauded such centralization. It was, they argued, \n     more efficient and economical, providing children with far \n     better, more consistent care than Illinois's system, where \n     a child might be placed with a superb private agency but \n     might also be made to endure the grim inadequacies of the \n     poorhouse.\n       ``The real contest, if such it may be called,'' wrote Folks \n     in 1900, ``will be between the state and the contract or \n     subsidy systems. To put it plainly, the question now being \n     decided is this--is our public administration sufficiently \n     honest and efficient to be entrusted with the management of a \n     system for the care of destitute children, or must we turn \n     that branch of public service over to private charitable \n     corporations, leaving to public officials the functions of \n     paying the bills; and of exercising such supervision over the \n     workings of the plan as may be possible? ``Illinois was seen \n     as nonprogressive in its increasing use of the subsidy \n     system, allowing private agencies to dominate the field while \n     the state remained relatively uninvolved in the care and \n     protection of dependent children.\n       This minimal level of state involvement offended against \n     another philanthropic tenet, the idea that the state should \n     have a monitoring function over all agencies, public and \n     private, as well as keeping in touch with children who had \n     been placed in families. The State Board of Charities did \n     visit the industrial schools, which got public funds, but it \n     was not until the Juvenile Court Act was passed in 1899 that \n     the State Board was given responsibility for inspection of \n     private as well as public agencies for children.\n       Another significant change from an earlier view, at least \n     among the more ``advanced'' thinkers, was a rejection of \n     institutions as the best substitute for a child's family. In \n     the nineteenth century, institutions and asylums of all kinds \n     had sprung up, not only in Illinois but all across the United \n     States. Asylums were not intended to be a dumping ground for \n     society's unfortunates, as the county poorhouses were, but \n     were rather supposed to be a specialized environment in which \n     the needs of a particular dependent population could be met \n     most effectively. But it was not long before a set of critics \n     arose who stressed the negative effects of institutions and \n     urged that institutional life should be resorted to only \n     under special circumstances or on a very temporary basis. For \n     special cases, like the handicapped, perhaps institutions \n     could provide resources and training that they would not \n     receive elsewhere, these critics agreed; but for children \n     whose greatest problem was that for one reason or another \n     their families were not functioning, the negative effects of \n     institutions far outweighed the positive aspects.\n       According to the anti-institutional analysis, the \n     regimentation in institutions was destructive of\n      initiative and individuality. The qualities that brought \n     rewards in an institutional setting--mindless obedience, \n     dependence, obsequiousness--were the very traits that all \n     agreed were destructive to the forming of a healthy, \n     independence adult citizen. Furthermore, institutions by \n     their nature seemed to foster abuse and bad treatment. \n     Exposes and investigations of various institutions \n     featured accusations of physical cruelty and psychological \n     debasement.\n       Institutions were expensive, physically and psychologically \n     barren, and downright unnatural for children, according to \n     Charles Loring Brace, a minister who worked for the \n     Children's Aid Society of New York. Brace began a program \n     that took the street children of New York City and sought to \n     improve their lives not by placing them in the highly \n     controlled environment of an institution but by resettling \n     them in homes in mid-western and western states such as \n     Illinois. He was convinced that the best solution for \n     children in need of placement was to provide homes in the \n     simplest and most direct way, relying as much as possible on \n     the basic goodness that he believed informed the souls of \n     most Americans, especially those who still lived away from \n     the corrupting city in the virtue-producing agricultural \n     heartland of the nation. The methods of the Children's Aid \n     Society reflected the simplicity of Brace's moral equation. \n     Brace and his associates would arrive in a western town with \n     a trainload of children, and using the medium of the local \n     churches, would call upon citizens to give these needy young \n     people a home. The entire plan of ``free foster homes'' was \n     really only an updated version of apprenticeship, in which \n     the child agreed to work in exchange for care and training, \n     except that this child-placing organization, aided by such \n     technological developments as the railroads, reached much \n     farther afield than the overseers of the poor had done in \n     earlier times. Free foster homes differed further in that \n     they were no legal bonds struck at all between the child and \n     his foster family. Brace firmly believed that a child who \n     brought a willing pair of hands to a family would be valued \n     accordingly and could safely count on good treatment in his \n     new home.\n       This notion proved, not surprisingly, to be overly \n     sanguine, as the Children's Aid Society came to discover when \n     the accusations began to grow in the later years of the \n     century that New York was not really solving children's \n     problems by the use of its ``Children West'' program but was \n     merely dumping one of its troublesome populations onto other \n     states. At various times the Children's Aid Society conducted \n     surveys and studies of its ``alumni,'' claiming a very high \n     success rate for the program, but critics questioned the \n     quality of these studies, and oppositions to Brace's program \n     continued. The 1899 Illinois Juvenile Court Act forbade any \n     agencies to bring\n      children unaccompanied by their parents or guardians, \n     without the approval of the State Board of Charities. This \n     was partly a protection against the importing of child \n     labor in Illinois, but it was a response as well to \n     organizations like the Children's Aid Society. The law \n     included the provision that any child who became a public \n     charge within five years of arrival in Illinois should be \n     removed to his or her home state.\n       The notion of placing children in families and the belief \n     that normal family life was a far healthier situation than \n     institutions was firmly entrenched in child welfare thinking \n     by the end of the century. But the earlier, more naive, \n     notion that foster families could be trusted to care for \n     dependent children without supervision had been replaced in \n     philanthropic thinking by a belief that it was important for \n     an outside agency regularly to check on the child and act in \n     his behalf. Coupled with this was the beginning of \n\n[[Page S 12818]]\n     a move away from ``free'' foster homes to the belief that boarding \n     homes, foster homes in which a family got payment for keeping \n     the foster child, were most productive of humane treatment. \n     Child welfare theorists and practitioners worried that if a \n     family's greatest inducement to take a foster child was the \n     child's potential economic contribution, there might be a \n     strong incentive for them to over-burden him with work, at \n     the expense of his academic education, which reformers were \n     coming more and more to see as the true and proper occupation \n     of childhood.\n       One final change in philanthropic theory that saw little \n     reflection in practice but was to bring about a revolution in \n     twentieth-century social welfare was the growing conviction \n     that the best thing that could be done for children was to \n     keep them with their families whenever possible. Students of \n     society came increasingly to regard poverty as a result of \n     faulty economic and social structure rather than of personal \n     failings of feckless or lazy individuals, and they \n     disapproved of the kind of casual invasion of poor families' \n     lives that could demand the sacrifice of parental rights in \n     return for assistance. This belief in the preservation of the \n     family became a basic underpinning of the social welfare \n     faith as it was articulated in the next fifty years, and the \n     state of Illinois, with its experiment in mothers' pension \n     programs, was to be in the forefront of progressive practice \n     in this area.\n       In the last decade of the nineteenth century, through, the \n     innovations that would make Illinois notable a few years \n     later were nowhere in sight. Surrounded by vigorous \n     neighbors, Illinois was considered conservative in its \n     reluctance to deal with its child welfare functions and in \n     its willingness to relinquish the charge to private agencies. \n     In fact, the state's attitude toward dependent children had \n     changed very little in the course of the nineteenth century. \n     The first laws and provisions for dependent children had \n     reflected a lack of\n      ardor bordering on indifference, and at the end of the \n     century, the state's engagement in child welfare, despite \n     the crisis engendered by rapid growth and economic stress, \n     was tepid at best. The combination of fiscal conservatism \n     and ethnic and religious tensions meant that state action \n     was regarded with suspicion in many quarters and kept \n     efforts fragmented and inadequate to the need. There was \n     also a fear that the patronage and corruption for which \n     Illinois was already famous might make state \n     administration of programs for dependent children less \n     effective than privately run efforts. Ironically, it was \n     in part this very disorganization and inaction that would \n     lead to the founding of the Juvenile Court and bring \n     Illinois, however briefly, within the pale of reformers' \n     approval.\n\n\n                          For Further Reading\n\n       The Historical Society Library has numerous pamphlets, \n     annual reports, and other materials from institutions such as \n     the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum, the Chicago Home \n     for the Friendless, and the Chicago Foundlings' Hospital. For \n     a broad historical perspective on the United States's care \n     for needy children, see Joseph Hawes's The Children's Rights \n     Movement: A History of Advocacy and Protection (Boston: \n     Twayne Publishers, 1991) and James Leiby's A History of \n     Social Welfare and Social Welfare and Social Work in the \n     United States (New York: Columbia University Press, 1978). To \n     learn more about child welfare reform between the Progressive \n     era and the New Deal, see Mina Carson's Settlement Folk: \n     Social Thought and the American Settlement Movement, 1885-\n     1930 (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1990) and \n     Robyn Muncy's Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, \n     1890-1935 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991). Marilyn \n     Irvin Holt's The Orphan Trains: Placing Out in America \n     (Lincoln: The University of Nebraska Press, 1992) discusses \n     one nineteenth-century solution to the plight of urban \n     orphans.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. So, Mr. President, in order to make certain that \nwe do not have this accident of geography become the difference between \nchildren sleeping in the streets or children provided for and given \nsustenance--food and shelter--I have proposed this amendment, which \nsays that the safety net will, in any event, be there for the children. \nAnd that child poverty, which is a national issue for us as Americans, \nwill not then become balkanized in terms of the response that is given \nby the Government, that our national community recognizes that child \npoverty is a national issue, and child welfare, in the final analysis, \nhas to have at least a national safety net. And that is what this first \namendment provides.\n  Mr. President, with regard to this amendment I understand that these \namendments will be taken up tomorrow. Let me say also that there are \ntables that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nshowing the number of children who will be denied or who are in \njeopardy of being denied assistance by virtue of the operation of the \nunderlying legislation.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF THE

Mr. President, in my State of Illinois, quite \nfrankly, it suggests some 34 percent of the children may be denied AFDC \nor may be denied subsistence if the family violates the time limitation \nrule, which would translate, Mr. President, in some 203,000 children \nbeing at risk of homelessness, being at risk of hunger.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that we can take the kind of chances \nto allow our children to once again end up as homeless half-orphans and \nfriendless foundlings. We have to assure our national commitment is to \nchild welfare, and that the safety of our children is a paramount \nconcern and one that will not be abrogated without regard to what we do \nwith regard to this legislation overall. It is for that purpose that I \nfile and submit this first amendment.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent agreement \nrequest.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I announce that there will be no further rollcall votes until \nmorning. There will be votes tomorrow morning, votes starting at 9:30. \nWe may have as many as three or four amendments we will be voting on, \nfor Senators' information, so we ask them to be prompt. Again, no more \nvotes tonight.\n  We will stay here for some additional time if Senators have \nadditional amendments they wish to have considered. We will be happy to \nconsider those. We have taken up a lot and we are setting those aside \nand so I think we are making some good progress on the bill.\n  Again, no further rollcall votes tonight, and we will have rollcall \nvotes stacked tomorrow morning beginning at 9:30. I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois for allowing me to interrupt.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to submit all of my \namendments at this time. I want to make certain that I have enough time \nto discuss and file my amendment this evening.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2472 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit a State from imposing a time limit for assistance \nif the State has failed to provide work activity-related services to an \n   adult individual in a family receiving assistance under the State \n                                program)\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Essentially it says that States shall not just \nknock somebody, a family, off for failing to meet the work requirement \nunless they have helped them to try and find a job.\n  It is kind of basic. I will read it:\n\n       The limitation described . . . shall not apply to a family \n     receiving assistance under this part if the State fails to \n     provide the work experience, assistance in finding \n     employment, and other work preparation activities.\n\n  Mr. President, the underlying legislation, has a cutoff for \nassistance and rules regarding work. For individuals who do not go to \nwork, they will not receive any support.\n  That is fine, Mr. President. I think we can all agree again, anybody \nwho can work should work and anybody who has children ought to be \nresponsible in the first instance to take care of them.\n  However, Mr. President, it is also a reality that there are parts of \nthis country in which frankly there are not the employment \nopportunities available that people can even take jobs.\n  The absence of jobs in some areas I think is a major problem and \nfrankly defies some of the suggestions made here that the problem with \npeople receiving public assistance is that they just do not want to \nwork. The fact of the matter is that the problem in very many instances \nis that there are no jobs for people to work at. Even if they wanted to \nwork there are no jobs.\n  In fact, in my own State, we have areas of my State in which \nunemployment ranges from 20 to 40 percent. The statistics indicate that \n80 percent, frankly, of African-American males between the ages of 16- \nand 19-years-old in the city of Chicago are currently unemployed.\n  Mr. President, 55 percent of the 20- to 24-year-olds are out of work. \nIt is not possible to move recipients into permanent private-sector \njobs if there is no effort to provide or create those jobs and if the \njobs are not there and if individuals have not been given some \nassistance in terms of transitioning.\n  Under the bill that we have before the Senate, the number of people \nparticipating in the work/job preparation activities is estimated to \nincrease by over 161 percent by the year 2000. Again, that means that \nStates like Illinois will receive some $444 million less in AFDC funds, \nbut on the other hand be required to increase by 122 percent the number \nof people participating in work and job preparation activity.\n  Those numbers just do not fit. Eight into three will not go. The \nnumbers do not add up therefore, I think it really is a real concern \nthat States not be allowed to just kick people off without having done \nwhat the bill says they should do in providing people with transition \nto work.\n  The text of the legislation says that the State has to outline how \nthey intend to ``provide a parent or caretaker in such families with \nwork experience, assistance in finding employment and other work \npreparation activities and support services that the State find \nappropriate.''\n  Now, that is fine language. I have no problem with that. But the \nquestion becomes what if the State does not do this? What then happens \nto the families? What then happens to the children?\n  Again, this amendment simply, I think, seeks to clarify that in the \nevent the State has not done that, has not provided work experience \nassistance in finding employment or the work for the work preparation \nactivities, that the individual then will not be penalized for \ncircumstances frankly that then are legitimately and, in a way that can \nbe documented, beyond their control.\n  So that is the second amendment that I submit for consideration of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Senator offering her amendments \ntonight. Would the Senator please give us a copy of the amendments? I \nhave a copy of your first amendment and comments or questions I might \nask. If the Senator would like to go ahead, if we could have copies of \nboth the second and third amendments, that would help.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Absolutely. I thought I had provided the Senator \nwith a copy, but I will give it to him right now.\n  This is the third amendment and this is the second.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2473 To Amendment No. 2280\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the job opportunities to certain low-income \n                          individuals program)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the previous \namendment will be laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2473 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 122, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 111. MODIFICATIONS TO THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR CERTAIN \n                   LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 505 of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. \n     1315 note) is amended--\n       (1) in the heading, by striking ``DEMONSTRATION'';\n       (2) by striking ``demonstration'' each place it appears;\n       (3) in subsection (a), by striking ``in each of fiscal \n     years'' and all that follows through ``10'' and inserting \n     ``shall enter into agreements with'';\n       (4) in subsection (b)(3), by striking ``aid to families \n     with dependent children under part A of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act'' and inserting ``assistance under the \n     State program funded part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act in the State in which the individual resides'';\n       (5) in subsection (c)--\n\n[[Page S 12820]]\n\n       (A) in paragraph (1)(C), by striking ``aid to families with \n     dependent children under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act'' and inserting ``assistance under the State \n     program funded part A of title IV of the Social Security \n     Act''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``aid to families with \n     dependent children under title IV of such Act'' and inserting \n     ``assistance under the State program funded part A of title \n     IV of the Social Security Act'';\n       (6) in subsection (d), by striking ``job opportunities and \n     basic skills training program (as provided for under title IV \n     of the Social Security Act'' and inserting ``the State \n     program funded under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act''; and\n       (7) by striking subsections (e) through (g) and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     conducting projects under this section, there is authorized \n     to be appropriated an amount not to exceed $25,000,000 for \n     any fiscal year.''.\n       Redesignate the succeeding sections accordingly.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am actually delighted that the \nSenator from New York is on the floor at this moment, because this next \namendment essentially makes permanent a part of the Family Support Act \nthat establishes what is called the Job Opportunities for Low-income \nIndividuals Program.\n  The JOLI Program--that is what it is called, JOLI, Job Opportunities \nfor Low-income Individuals--is to create job opportunities for AFDC \nrecipients and other low-income individuals. Grants can be made to \nprivate, nonprofit corporations to make investments in local business \nenterprises that will result in the creation of new jobs. This \namendment authorizes appropriations for a program that is already in \nplace as a demonstration program. This would make it permanent.\n  The rationale for the amendment is that the underlying bill does not \nprovide any support at all for job creation. Even though S. 1120 \nrequires some kind of work activity within 24 months, and eligibility \nfor assistance ends after some 60 months, whether the individual has \nfound a job or not. So, there is no question but that we will need to \nsee a great creation of thousands of private-sector jobs in order to \nabsorb the influx of new workers.\n  So the JOLI Program actually helps. It is working. It helps \nindividuals to become self-sufficient through the development of \nmicroenterprises for economic development and other kinds of job \ntraining. The really good news about JOLI is that this is not \nreinventing the wheel. It is already in place. It was authorized under \nsection 505 of the Family Support Act of 1988.\n  Under a recent evaluation of JOLI, the first 20 JOLI intermediaries--\nthat is, community-based organizations that are the grantees--have \nassisted some 334 individuals to start or stabilize their own \nbusinesses, and it has assisted an additional 535 people to secure \nemployment in jobs paying an average wage of about $8 an hour, which is \nreally quite remarkable. Of the 869 low-income individuals benefiting \nfrom the demonstration program, most of them had become economically \nself-sufficient within a year of their involvement or interaction with \nthe program.\n  So the JOLI Program addresses the scarcity of jobs in many urban as \nwell as rural communities and recognizes the need to ensure that \nwelfare recipients and other low-income people have access to \nemployment opportunities in the private sector. It utilizes the \ncapacity of community-based organizations and the private sector to \ndevelop jobs so individuals who right now are mired in poverty will \nhave some options and have some hope, and will have the ability to take \ncare of themselves and their families.\n  Again, we are talking about the 5 million people who are adults who \nare presently receiving public assistance and who will, therefore, \nhopefully, be given a hand up as opposed to a handout--will be given \nthe ability to work, will be given the ability to care for themselves \nand their children. I think job creation is an integral part of any \nhonest welfare reform that we undertake to have in this session of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2474 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit a State from reserving grant funds for use in \n    subsequent fiscal years if the State has reduced the amount of \n    assistance provided to families under the State program in the \n                         preceding fiscal year)\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I have a last amendment I send to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2474 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, strike lines 13 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Authority to reserve certain amounts for \n     assistance.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A State may reserve amounts paid to the \n     State under this part for any fiscal year for the purpose of \n     providing, without fiscal year limitation, assistance under \n     the State program operated under this part.\n       ``(B) Exception.--In any fiscal year, a State may not \n     exercise the authority described in subparagraph (A) if the \n     State has reduced the amount of cash assistance provided per \n     family member to families under the State program during the \n     preceding fiscal year.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this last amendment--again, this is \none of these efforts to keep the worst from happening. Again, we all \nhope it does not happen, that the States are not less than responsible \nin their execution of the underlying bill. This amendment is designed \nto serve as a buttress against what has been characterized as the race \nto the bottom.\n  Essentially, if a State decides to cut its cash assistance benefits, \nto cut the amount that it spends to address the issue of poverty within \nthat State, then that State will be prohibited from carrying forward \nunused block grant funds.\n  This is called--I call this the race-to-the-bottom amendment. The \nnotion is, if we send the States this money in a block grant, there is \nnothing to prohibit that State from saying we do not want to have \nassistance for poor children. We are not going to address the issue of \njob creation. We are not going to train people to go back to work. We \nare not going to provide the children with any assistance. We are just \ngoing to further squeeze the amount of resources devoted to the whole \nissue of poverty in our State and we are going to take the money we get \nfrom the Federal Government and use that to go from year to year to \nyear to year and not maintain our own effort.\n  If one State does it, then the next State would be incentivized, if \nyou will, to do as much, which will then start--hopefully not, but \nmight well start, if you will--a race to the bottom and a cycle of the \nStates trying to underbid one another in terms of the amount of \nassistance that they provide for poor people who live in that State.\n  I think that would be a real tragedy. As a result, this amendment \nsimply says that a State may not carry over funds from one year to the \nnext if they have reduced the amount of benefits that are available for \npoor children and for poor families in that State.\n  Again, this stops the States from penalizing poor people in ways that \nwould be inconsistent with the legislation. So it is, in that regard, \nsimply a preventive, protective, prophylactic amendment, if you will.\n  The other reason for this legislation, just to be real candid in \nterms of the dollars, frankly, is that this legisla- tion--because of \nthe level of appropriations, it has been estimated that the States \nwill, overall, have to cut. They will not have enough money, frankly, \nto do what is required of them in the legislation. CBO has already \nadvised that most States will not have the money to provide for the \nkind of job training, the kinds of transition services--or certainly \nchild care in this legislation. So, that being the case, there should \nnot be any money left over. But in the event there is, I think we \nshould put a buttress and a stop that says we are not going to allow \nStates to engage in this race to the bottom, engage in this effort to \nsee who can be the most punitive with regard to poor people in that \nState.\n  So that is the last amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want, in closing--and I have wanted to give my \ncolleague a chance, so I kind of rushed through a little bit to try to \nspeed up so he would \n\n[[Page S 12821]]\nhave the opportunity to present his amendment--to talk about this issue \nin another context.\n  I had occasion, back in my State, to meet with and work with a task \nforce members came from all sectors--from the business sector, from the \ncommunity activist sector, people who were advocates, actual welfare \nmothers served on the panel--to talk about the issues having to do with \nour response to poverty. I started my conversation this evening saying \nwelfare is not and has never been anything other than a response to \npoverty; a response that engenders strong feelings, certainly, but that \nis what it is. We must not lose sight of the underlying issue as we \napproach the question of how well the response works.\n  The point is that I believe we have, when all is said and done--we \ncan talk about differences in philosophy about block grants and whether \nor not there is too much Federal bureaucracy. Although, frankly, the \nnumbers, by the way, do not support the notion that a whole lot of \nmoney that is presently dedicated to the AFDC Program goes into \nadministration on the Federal level.\n  In fact, most of the administrative expenses take place at the State \nlevel. I think it is important that we make that point.\n  I think it is also important--and I am digressing here--to point out \nthat because most of the administration takes place at the State and \nlocal level, it is likely that by operation of this new law, should it \npass, the States will in fact be stuck with what has been called a huge \nunfunded mandate in that they will be called on to administer and to do \nthings that they do not presently have the resources to do. And they \nare going to have to find the resources to do that from places other \nthan the Federal Government. We will not be there to help out with \nState efforts to create jobs. We will not be there to help out with \nchild care. We will not be there to help out with the administration of \nwhatever the State response is. That is a fundamental problem I think \nwith the underlying bill.\n  But the point that I really want to make is one that the Senator from \nNew York I think has eloquently spoken to, and it does go to the \nfundamental issue of debate in all of this. That is the question of \ncommon ground. That is the issue of whether or not we have a commitment \nas a national community to address the issue of poverty, to address the \nissue of child welfare, or whether or not we are prepared to balkanize \nas a country into 50 different welfare systems, into 50 different \nresponses to poverty, into 50 different approaches to child welfare, \nand whether or not the welfare and the well-being, the possibility of \npotential for hunger, the possibility of the potential for homelessness \nof a child in this country will depend on an accident of geography. It \nis bad enough that a child who is born into poverty suffers the \naccident of having been born poor. As a friend of mine once said, ``It \nis your own fault for being born to poor parents.'' I could not \ndisagree with that point.\n  But the fact of matter is, we have to make sure that the accident of \nbeing born to poor parents is not exacerbated by where that took place.\n  The question is whether or not, as Americans, we will have the \nforesight to recognize that through this as the very central issue of \nthe nature of our Federal Government, the nature of Federalism and the \nnature of our Nation and the kind of country that we will have. Will we \nhave a country in which everyone recognizes that the welfare of a child \nin Oklahoma, in Nevada, or Iowa is as important to the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from New York \nas the welfare of a child in his or her own State, or will we have a \nsituation in which by virtue of the balkanization provided by this \nunderlying bill, the only children about whose welfare you or I can \nhave a say about are the children in the State from which we are \nelected?\n  I do not think, Mr. President, that is a direction that the American \npeople want to see us fall off to.\n  As we talk about the devolution in Government, the devolution that we \nought to consider to welfare work better, making it work efficiently, \ngiving people opportunity, giving people an opportunity to go to work, \ngiving children the kind of care and the kind of safety net that they \nneed to have so that they will have opportunities, so they possibly \nwill not have to be born to poor children, and their children, whether \nor not they will have to be born to poor parents, that their children \nwill have a chance to do better.\n  That is, it seems to me, consistent with the American dream and is \nconsistent with the whole concept of what this Nation is about.\n  I therefore hope that a direction that this bill takes in the final \nanalysis, when all is said and done, and the amendments are put on it, \nthat we reaffirm and not reject and walk away from our national \ncommitment to address the issue of poverty and to provide for the \nwelfare of all of our children.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I compliment my colleague, one, for her interest in her State, her \nconstituents, and also for the fact that she has I think four or five \namendments, and she was waiting to offer those tonight and discuss \nthose. I have not had a chance to review all of them. I have looked at \na couple of them.\n  I know my colleague from Pennsylvania has an amendment he wishes to \noffer. We may have other amendments. So I will be very brief. I will \nreview these amendments a little more in detail over the night and talk \nabout them possibly tomorrow.\n  But the first amendment that the Senator has is a big one. It is an \nimportant one. Our colleague should be able to understand it. So I ask \nthis question: I am reading under ``eligibility.'' This is talking \nabout the underlying bill. But also I might mention under the Daschle \nbill, there was a time limit for welfare payments from the Federal \nGovernment, 5 years. Under the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, \nit says after the 5 years should expire and a welfare recipient still \nhas a dependent child, the State would be mandated to provide a voucher \nprogram to provide assistance to the minor child.\n  Is that correct?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator also mentions that she did not want to have \nunfunded mandates in one of the other amendments but this would be--\ncorrect me, if I am wrong, you do not fund this program. You just \nmandate that the States after 5 years would have to provide a voucher \nprogram to provide assistance even though we do not give them any \nmoney?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. We will not give them the money. In fact, if \nanything, the welfare of those children in those families, if anything, \nshould have first dibs on the block grants that we at the Federal \nGovernment level are providing the money that goes to the States that \nis calculated to, and the whole idea is to provide for the welfare of \nminor dependent children.\n  So if that minor dependent child has a parent who does not comply \nwith the work requirement or misses some other test that is set up, \nthat child will still be provided for first.\n  So, if anything, I call this the child voucher, but really, if \nanything, it should be called the Child First amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I wanted to make sure, though, that we understood. \nBecause this has a benefit, it would not have been provided under the \nDaschle substitute.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes, it would have. This particular safety net for \nchildren was provided for in the Daschle substitute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to review it. I appreciate my colleague.\n  I just looked at the other amendment. She has one amendment that says \nyou want to have a pilot program and you wanted to authorize $25 \nmillion for the job opportunities for certain low-income individuals. \nIs that correct?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is a program we have ongoing now.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much are we appropriating for that program at this \npoint?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. We are right now at about 5.6. So $5.6 million.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for my colleagues' information, according to \n\n[[Page S 12822]]\n  CRS, we have 154--I have heard now 155--various employment and training \nprograms. This is one program that you would like to maybe take out of \nthe block grants and increase its funding by fivefold. Is that correct?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. This is a demonstration. This is not just about \ntraining. There is a demonstration program that is already in existence \nfor micro-enterprises development, for a variety of approaches to \neconomic development and job creation for low-income individuals. This \nalready exists. Yet the increase is $5.4 million in fiscal year 1995.\n  Yes, there is a fivefold increase in the funding for this job \ntraining and job creation program for low-income individuals. It is \nthat increase.\n  But I would point out to my colleague that there is no question--\nagain, in the eyes of what we are with doing here--that there is a \nsuggestion that you cannot do welfare reform and put people to work on \nthe cheap. You are going to have to make investment in those counties, \nin those States such as Wisconsin where there is a successful welfare \nreform experiment under way. There is no question that to transition \npeople from welfare to work requires that we give them something to \nwork at, give them skills, training, and micro-enterprise loans to \nstart businesses or whatever. But there is some assistance required to \nleverage human capability to provide that they get back into the \nprivate sector and to get back to work.\n  There are two counties in Wisconsin in which there have been work to \nwelfare, a work transition pilot program. There is no question but that \nthe investment is made on the front end to give individuals the ability \nto transfer off of welfare and to transfer from dependency to \nindependency.\n  The JOLI Program has done that. It has done it successfully. It was \ninitiated as a part of the Family Support Act. It works. It is not like \ntrying something brand new. It has worked.\n  It seems to me that in light of the fact that job creation is not \naddressed at all in the underlying legislation--and it is not. There is \nno ability for creating jobs in the bill without this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Let me finish my point. In light of that fact that \nthere is no effort to leverage private activities to create jobs, this \namendment says let us take something that works and let us expand it so \nthat since the States have to have, since individuals who live in these \nvarious States will have to comport and comply with work requirements, \nlet us give the States some assistance in providing job creation and \nprivate sector entrepreneurial activity.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will just make a brief statement, not \nnecessarily continue the colloquy.\n  I appreciate the commitment of my friend and colleague from Illinois. \nJust a couple of comments pertaining to this amendment.\n  This second amendment we have been discussing is rather small. It \nsays we would have a $25 million pilot program to continue a program we \nalready have and quadruple its costs or multiply it by five.\n  That is directly contrary to what we are trying to do in this bill. \nAs I mentioned before, according to CRS we have 154--I put this in the \nRecord earlier today--Federal job training programs, some of which--and \nI know my colleague from New York is the author and sponsor of some--\nsome of which have probably done some good. A whole lot of them \nprobably have not. And so to think that we have 155 and my colleague \nfrom Illinois has picked out one----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for just a comment?\n  This is not a job training program. This has nothing to do with job \ntraining. The JOLI Program is job creation. It gives poor people the \nopportunity to access money, equity capital in order to start their own \nbusinesses and start their own jobs. It is not job training.\n  That is why it was distinct from the job training debate. That is a \nwhole other debate. If you take a look at what the Family Support Act \nlanguage that created the JOLI program you will see that it is not a \njob training program. This amendment says let us give poor people the \nopportunity to create their own jobs.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. If I may just respond to my colleague, since we \nare in a colloquy, some of the initiatives under JOLI have come from \nother parts of the world. There has been a famous experiment that \nstarted actually in India, I say to the Senator from New York, in which \npoor people were given tiny loans called microloans to start their own \nbusinesses.\n  So it is not job training, and it is to be distinguished from the job \ntraining debate.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I again appreciate my colleague's \ninitiative, her commitment to her cause. I will just state that this \nSenator is going to vote against it, and this will probably be one we \nwill have a rollcall vote on tomorrow. It does increase the \nauthorization of this program by fivefold. One may not call it a jobs \nprogram. I would have to look and see if it was included on the list \naccording to CRS as a Federal employment and/or job training program. \nMaybe it is a lending program. I am not sure it belongs--if it is a \nlending program and financing program, maybe it should or should not be \nin this bill. I do not know that I want to multiply programs by that \nkind of multiplier at this point.\n  The overall scope of this bill says we are going to be saving--if we \npass this bill, we are going to be saving $70 billion. Now, we are \ntalking about big money. I will go back to the amendment that our \ncolleague from Illinois raised before, but I wish to be really brief \nbecause I know our colleague from Pennsylvania has an amendment.\n  But the initial amendment is a very big amendment. And I will have to \ncompare it--and I appreciate her statement that it was in the Daschle \nsubstitute, but as I understand it, it is a bill that would basically \nwaive the 5-year requirement or time limit.\n  President Clinton said that he wanted to have a time limit, and we \nare talking about Federal payments--have a time limit on how long an \nindividual or family can receive money from the Federal Government. If \nwe are to end welfare as we know it, we are going to have to have some \nlimitations. As I read the first amendment, as long as there is a \ndependent minor child, you would continue to have assistance.\n  Now, the assistance from the Federal Government would be terminated \nafter 5 years, cash assistance. Under the Senator's amendment, the \nState would provide vouchers for supplemental assistance. That is an \nunfunded mandate. Maybe the States could take it from other savings in \nthe program. I will try to study that a little more. But the essence of \nit is the family can be on welfare forever if they continue to have \nchildren. And that is not the thrust of what we are trying to do in the \nbill which is to have real incentive to get off welfare, to break the \nwelfare dependency cycle and to make some improvements.\n  I do appreciate my colleague's introduction of the amendments and her \nstatements and also her dedication to some of the things she is trying \nto do. But at least as far as this Senator is concerned, I do not think \nwe will be, at least I will not be able to accept the first amendment \nas well. I will look at the other couple of amendments that our \ncolleague introduced and will consider those. So again I would like to \ninform my colleagues tomorrow morning at 9:30 my guess is we will have \nseveral rollcall votes. And again I thank my colleague from Illinois \nfor introducing her amendments.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, except \nI would just say one thing. I do not mind the Senator taking issue with \nthe amendment one way or another, but I think it is real important not \nto misrepresent what the amendment is about. It is not about keeping \nfamilies on welfare forever. It is a child-first amendment. It has to \ndo with children. If the State decides to have a shorter time limit \nthan the bill or the family is cut off because the parent will not go \nto work, then we have to I think maintain some kind of a safety net for \nthat child. \n\n[[Page S 12823]]\n\n  I do not believe the President of the United States or any other \nMember of this body wants to set up a set of rules that would leave us \nwith 6-year-old children sleeping in streets homeless and hungry. I do \nnot believe anybody wants to do that. But we do not have any guarantee \nin the underlying legislation, and that is what this amendment seeks to \nfix.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I rise to offer an amendment. Before \nI do that, I just want to make a couple of comments about what the \nSenator from Illinois stated and characterized the Republican \nleadership bill, which I am very hopeful will be adopted by the Senate. \nShe says that the bill balkanizes welfare reform into 50 separate \nprograms and that this is bad, that everyone should be treated the \nsame.\n  I happen to believe that that is the problem with this system, that \neverybody is treated the same and not particularly well, and the \nbalkanization into 50 separate programs is a bad idea. But \nbalkanization into a million individual efforts to help poor people in \nour society is a good idea. And that is what this bill does.\n  Sure, it gives a lot of flexibility to the States, but there are many \nprovisions in this bill which tell the States and direct the States and \nencourage the States to go farther; to go down to the local level and \nto the community level and make this a program that is a program that \ntalks about communities and neighborhoods helping neighborhoods and \nfriends helping friends. And that is the dynamism that is in this bill \nthat has never been tried from a Federal perspective before.\n  So, yes, it is balkanization but not to 50 but to 50 times 50 times \n50 and more. And that is the excitement about this bill. That is why we \nare so committed to seeing this happen.\n  The Senator from Illinois also said that there is nothing in this \nbill about job creation, and I have heard this over and over and over \nagain. And I feel like a broken record getting up and responding to it. \nBut I will say several things.\n  The Senator from Illinois said there is nothing about job creation. \nWhat she is referring to, I assume the Senator is referring to is that \nthere is no Federal dollars to place people in employment. There is no \nspecific pot of Federal dollars to say we will pay for employment slots \nand for supervision and for paying their stipend while they are \nworking.\n  What I would say is that the Governors of the States, the Republican \nGovernors of the States, I believe 29 out of 30 of the Governors have \nsaid that this bill is an acceptable bill to them; that they do not \nneed a big pot of money if they can run their own program; that they \ncan do it cheaper and better, put more people to work, get more people \noff the rolls if they have the flexibility to run their own program \nwithout all the tripwires and redtape that is involved in the Federal \nsystem.\n  That is Governors, as I said before, Republican Governors, who \nrepresent 80 percent of the welfare recipients in this country. \nRepublican Governors are from States that represent 80 percent of \nwelfare recipients and they say this is a good deal; they can live with \nthis; they want this. And they can create the jobs to put the people to \nwork as required by this legislation.\n  I would also say that we eliminate, in the Dole bill we eliminate the \nprovision in current law, which was maintained in the Daschle bill,\n we eliminate the provision that says if you are a city or State or any \nother kind of municipality, you can no longer fill a vacancy with a \nwelfare recipient. That is current law. You cannot fill a vacancy with \na welfare recipient in a courthouse or school or any other municipality \nor government entity.\n\n  What we say is, if there is a vacancy there and you want to give \nsomeone on welfare a chance, you can fill that vacancy with someone. I \nused the example earlier today, when we talked about this, of folks on \na road crew standing there with that sign: ``Slow,'' ``Stop.'' You \ncannot fill that vacancy, if it occurs, with a welfare recipient.\n  You can today under the Dole provision. That is creating jobs. You \nwant to talk about creating job slots, that creates a lot of job slots \nin communities across this country that are illegal today. So we do \nexpand the opportunities for people on welfare to get jobs under this \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, one other comment. The Senator from Illinois said that \nchildren should not suffer because of being born accidentally into \npoverty. Unfortunately, in this country and every other country in the \nworld, poverty exists. The difference between other countries and this \ncountry is that when you are born into poverty, you are not frozen into \npoverty by the Government which does not allow you to rise in society.\n  There are many cultures and civilizations in this world that doom you \nto the life in which you were born, but we do not have a caste system \nin this country. We do not have levels of classes in this country. The \ngreatness of this country is that the grandson of a coal miner who \nlived in a company town outside of Johnstown, PA, can be a U.S. \nSenator, as I am.\n  That is the greatness of this country, that we still offer \nopportunity, and that is what is lacking in the current system. We \ndisincentivize people from getting off the welfare roll by providing, \nas Franklin Roosevelt said, the subtle narcotic to the masses of \nwelfare. We are going to get rid of the subtle narcotic and turn that \ninto Powerade, into a system to give them the energy and the \nopportunity to move forward and rise.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2477 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n    (Purpose: To eliminate certain welfare benefits with respect to \n fugitive felons and probation and parole violators, and to facilitate \n  sharing of information with law enforcement officers, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment will be set aside.

Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk I \nhope is going to be a noncontroversial amendment. I believe it is one \nthat should get broad support, hopefully unanimous support, of this \nbody. It is an amendment that is very similar in nature to one that was \nadopted in the House of Representatives on their bill offered by \nRepresentative Blute of Massachusetts having to do with fugitive felons \nwho receive welfare.\n  Yes, that is right. There are people who are fleeing the law, felons \nin which warrants are out for their arrest, who are hiding from the law \non the welfare rolls. You say, ``How does that happen?'' Someone has \nbeen convicted of a felony and has escaped or violated parole or has \nbeen issued a warrant for their arrest on a felony charge and is \neluding the law. While eluding the law, they sign up for welfare to \nsupport their eluding the law.\n  You say, ``Well, how can this happen?'' It is very easy to happen, \nbecause in most States in this country, if you are on the welfare rolls \nand the police department wants to find out if you are on the welfare \nrolls and they have a felony warrant for your arrest, the welfare \ndepartment cannot tell the police department that you are receiving \nbenefits. Why? Because your rights to privacy are protected. If you are \non the welfare rolls, you have a right of privacy.\n  You may be a murderer. In fact, one of the reasons I offered this \namendment is just last year in Pittsburgh--I have a July 29, 1994, \narticle about a man who was on the welfare rolls. When they found this \nguy in Philadelphia, they found him and searched him, obviously, and \nthey found a welfare card with his photo on it, his correct name. He \ndid not even bother to lie about what his name was. He was protected by \nprivacy. You say this must be an odd occurrence. This was a murderer, \nfleeing the law for years and collecting Government benefits.\n  In Cleveland, they did a sting operation, and they rounded up a lot \nof felons at this sting operation and searched them, and they found out \nthat a third of the people they caught in the sting operation that had \nexisting warrants were on welfare.\n  I visited the police department in Philadelphia and talked to their \nfugitive task force. They have a fugitive task force in the police \ndepartment in Philadelphia. They have some 50,000 outstanding fugitive \nwarrants in the city of Philadelphia. Historically, what the police \nofficers have said is anywhere from 65 to 75 percent of the felons they \ncatch are on welfare of some sort, whether it is food stamps or AFDC, \nSSI, you name it, they are collecting money while eluding the law. Not \nhaving to sign up for legitimate work where they might be caught, they \ncan stay home and run around with their buddies at night and collect \nwelfare. So you support them while the Federal Government and the State \nand local counties try to track them down. This is absurd.\n  So what we are suggesting is that the welfare offices, when contacted \nby the police department, must give the police department, if they have \na warrant--I am not talking about people just wanting to search who is \non the welfare rolls, but if you have a warrant \n\n[[Page S 12825]]\nfor someone's arrest, a felony warrant, that you can contact the \nwelfare office and say, ``Has such and such signed up for welfare?'' \nYou can give the name and address. And you will find, at least the \npolice told me, when it comes to receiving welfare benefits, they give \nthe correct address to receive those benefits. They do not lie about \nwhat address those benefits go to. So you get the name, the address--we \nhave the name--the address, the Social Security number and a photo \nbecause a lot of these folks just have police sketches. You might have \nwhat their name is, but you may not have a good photo or it may not be \na recent photo.\n  So what we do is give police a tremendous advantage, at least \naccording to the police departments I have talked to and the research I \nhave done, in tracking down fugitive felons.\n  As I said before, I do not think this is a controversial measure. I \nthink this is something that can and should be supported by everyone.\n  There is an additional provision in the bill that deals with another \nproblem on AFDC, and that is the term ``when a child is temporarily \nabsent from the home.'' What happens there? This is a separate issue \nthan the fugitive issue, but it is included in the amendment.\n  We have situations where you have a mother and children or a child \nwho, unfortunately, may be sent to prison or sent to detention, or \nwhatever the case may be, but be out of the home for a period of years. \nUnder the laws in most States, because the Federal law does not define \n``temporarily absent,'' what happens is that mom continues to receive \nwelfare benefits for that child, even though the child has not lived in \nthe home for years or months because they are in jail.\n  We think that is sort of a silly idea. If the child is being \notherwise detained because of incarceration as a runaway, whatever the \ncase may be, we should not continue to pay the mother the benefits for \nthe child who is no longer living there. That, you would think, is \npretty much common sense, but under the Federal law today, that is not \ncommon sense. So we define what ``temporarily absent'' is.\n  Again, I am hopeful this amendment will be agreed to and adopted, but \nI am going to ask at this point for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from \nPennsylvania. I think this is an excellent amendment. It is kind of \nbothersome to think that there might be thousands of fleeing felons \nreceiving welfare, and maybe because there is a lack of coordination \nbetween law enforcement and welfare agencies and offices, they are able \nto get away with it. I do not doubt my colleague's homework. It is \nprobably quite accurate. To think that that is happening, it needs to \nbe stopped. His amendment would go a long way toward stopping it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor, and I hope my \ncolleagues support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2469, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to modify a prior amendment and also introduce \ntwo additional amendments. I will try to be brief. I call up amendment \nNo. 2469 and send a modification to the desk.

Mr. President, the Dole bill requires that income and \nresources of an immigrant sponsor be deemed as available to the \nimmigrant when determining eligibility for all federally funded, means-\ntested programs. This is the case, whether or not the immigrant is a \nUnited States citizen. In other words, it creates two classes of \ncitizens. A naturalized citizen, under the Dole bill, could not be \neligible for any form of assistance. I believe this is unprecedented \nand, as I said, creates two classes of American citizens, which will \nsurely be challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds.\n  So I rise today to offer an amendment to this bill to provide equal \ntreatment for naturalized and native-born U.S. citizens. This amendment \nis cosponsored by Senators Kohl and Simon. It is supported by the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Association of Counties, the National League \nof Cities, the United States Catholic Conference, and the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, as well as several other organizations.\n  The amendment simply removes any reference to citizens in all places \nin the underlying bill that require deeming, and leaves in place the \ndeeming requirements for benefits to legal aliens.\n  I think the question before the Senate is this: Does the Constitution \nof the United States of America provide for two distinct classes of \nUnited States citizens--those who are naturalized and those who are \nnative-born? I know of only one benefit which is denied by the \nConstitution to citizens of our country who were not born in this \ncountry, and that one thing is the Presidency of the United States. \nArticle II, section 1 of the Constitution expressly states that ``no \nperson, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United \nStates at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, shall be \neligible to the office of President.'' That is where the line is drawn \nfor me.\n  I do not believe that, absent a constitutional amendment, the \nConstitution gives this body the authority to deny outright any \nbenefits, save that one, to naturalized citizens. Article I of the \nConstitution does contain one other distinction with regard to \nnaturalized citizens and their qualifications to be Members of \nCongress. It says, ``No person shall be a representative who shall not \nhave attained the age of 25 years and been 7 years a citizen of the \nUnited States.'' That is whether they are native-born or naturalized. \nIt also says, ``No person shall be a Senator who shall not have \nattained the age of 30 years, and been 9 years a citizen of the United \nStates.''\n  I do not believe our forefathers necessarily foresaw the specifics of \nthe debate which is before us today. But I do believe they considered \nwhat distinctions should be made between naturalized and native-born \ncitizens. And the result of that consideration is reflected in the \nConstitution.\n  The Department of Justice has expressed serious concerns about the \nconstitutionality on the proscription of benefits as applied to \nnaturalized citizens in this bill. In a letter to Senator Kennedy, \ndated July 18, a copy of which was also provided to me, Assistant \nAttorney General, Andrew Fois states:\n\n       The deeming provision, as applied to citizens, would \n     contravene the basic equal protection tenet that ``the rights \n     of citizenship of the native born and of the naturalized \n     person are of the same dignity and are coextensive.''\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       To the same effect, the provision might be viewed as a \n     classification based on national origin; among citizens \n     otherwise eligible for government assistance, the class \n     excluded by operation of the deeming provision is limited to \n     those born outside the United States. A classification based \n     on national origin, of course, is subject to strict scrutiny \n     under equal protection review, and it is unlikely that the \n     deeming provision could be justified under this standard.\n\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the letter from the Justice Department be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter follows your question to \n     Attorney General Janet Reno regarding the constitutionality \n     of the deeming provisions in pending immigration legislation \n     at the Senate Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on June \n     27.\n       You have asked for our views regarding the ``deeming'' \n     provisions of section 204 of S. 269, Senator Simpson's \n     proposed immigration legislation. Our comment here is limited \n     to the question raised by application of section 204 to \n     naturalized citizens.\n       We have serious concerns about section 204's \n     constitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens. So \n     applied, the deeming provision would operate to deny, or \n     reduce eligibility for, a variety of benefits including \n     student financial assistance and welfare benefits to certain \n     United States citizens because they were born outside the \n     country. This appears to be an unprecedented result. Current \n     federal deeming provisions under various benefits programs \n     operate only as against aliens (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 615 \n     (AFDC); 7 U.S.C. 2014(i) (Food Stamps)) and we are not aware \n     of any comparable restrictions on citizen eligibility for \n     federal assistance. As a matter of policy, we think it would \n     be a mistake to begin now to relegate naturalized citizens--\n     who have demonstrated their commitment to our country by \n     undergoing the naturalization process--to a kind of second-\n     class status.\n       The provision might be defended legally on the grounds that \n     it is an exercise of Congress' plenary authority to regulate \n     immigration and naturalization, or, more specifically, to set \n     the terms under which persons may enter the United States and \n     become citizens. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976); \n     Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1982). We are not \n     convinced that this defense would prove persuasive. Though \n     Congress undoubtedly has power to impose conditions precedent \n     on entry and naturalization, the provision at issue here \n     would function as a condition subsequent, applying to \n     entrants even after they become citizens. It is not at all \n     clear that Congress' immigration and naturalization power \n     extends this far.\n       While the rights of citizenship of the native born derive \n     from Sec. 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of the \n     naturalized citizen derive from satisfying, free of fraud, \n     the requirements set by Congress, the latter, apart from the \n     exception noted [constitutional eligibility for President], \n     becomes a member of the society, possessing all the rights of \n     a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the \n     constitution, on the footing of a native. The constitution \n     does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those \n     rights. The simple power of the national Legislature, is to \n     prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, and the exercise \n     of this power exhausts it, so far as respects the individual.\n       Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 166 (1964) (internal \n     quotations omitted) (statutory restriction on length foreign \n     residence applied to naturalized but not native born citizens \n     violates Fifth Amendment equal protection component).\n       Alternatively, it might be argued in defense of the \n     provision that it classifies not by reference to citizenship \n     at all, but rather on the basis of sponsorship; only those \n     naturalized citizens with sponsors will be affected. Again, \n     we have doubts about whether this characterization of the \n     provision would be accepted. State courts have rejected an \n     analogous position with respect to state deeming provisions, \n     finding that the provisions constitute impermissible \n     discrimination based on alienage despite the fact that they \n     reach only sponsored aliens. See Barannikov v. Town of \n     Greenwich, 643 A.2d 251, 263-64 (Conn. 1994); El Souri v. \n     Dep't of Social Services, 414 N.W.2d 679, 682-83 (Mich. \n     1987). Because the deeming provision in question here, as \n     applied to citizens, is directed at and reaches only \n     naturalized citizens, the same reasoning would compel the \n     conclusion that it constitutes discrimination against \n     naturalized citizens. Cf. Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 \n     (1977) (``The important points are that [the law] is directed \n     at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact \n     that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it \n     does not discriminate against the class.'') (invalidating \n     state law denying some, but not all, resident aliens \n     financial assistance for higher education).\n       So understood, the deeming provision, as applied to \n     citizens, would contravene the basic equal protection tenet \n     that ``the rights of citizenship of the native born and of \n     the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are \n     coextensive.'' Schneider, 377 U.S. at \n\n[[Page S 12827]]\n     165. To the same effect, the provisions might be viewed as a \n     classification based on national origin; among citizens \n     otherwise eligible for government assistance, the class \n     excluded by operation of the deeming provision is limited to \n     those born outside the United States. A classification based \n     on national origin, of course, is subject to strict scrutiny \n     under equal protection review, see Korematsu v. United \n     States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), and it is unlikely that the \n     deeming provision could be justified under this standard. See \n     Barannikova, 643 A.2d at 265 (invalidating state deeming \n     provision under strict scrutiny); El Souri, 414 N.W.2d at 683 \n     (same).\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, to a great extent, we are a Nation of \nimmigrants. There are very few of us in this body who could claim not \nto have been a product, in some way, of immigrants.\n  My mother was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. She left that country \nhiding in a hay cart during the revolution. They crossed Siberia on \ntheir long journey to California. My grandmother was widowed shortly \nafter arriving in this country, left with four small children. My uncle \nwas a carpenter. My mother did not enjoy good health as a child and was \nhospitalized for many years. There was no widow's pension then, no \nAFDC. And I am not one that believes that immigrants should come to the \nUnited States to get on the dole. But we do have a naturalization \nprocess which, after the designated waiting period, and after meeting \ncertain requirements, immigrants take an oath, they become citizens of \nthe United States, with all of the privileges and benefits accorded to \nnative-born citizens, save the one spelled out in the Constitution that \nI have read today.\n  This bill essentially says that even if naturalized--even if a \nnaturalized citizen for 20 years, your sponsor's income will be deemed \nas yours, and you will not be eligible for Federal benefits.\n  Even if that sponsor is dying from cancer, and no matter what happens \nto the naturalized citizen, that naturalized citizen is exempted from \ncoverage under this bill.\n  I believe that violates the equal protection clause of our \nConstitution and jeopardizes the fairness of the legislation. So the \namendment that I am submitting is essentially equal treatment for \nnaturalized and native-born citizens.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be brief. I think I understand the amendment. The \nSenator is saying that immigrants to the country should be able to \nreceive welfare benefits just as any other citizen can, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Only if they have become United States citizens. In \nother words, the deeming provision does not apply if you are \nnaturalized.\n  In this bill, the deeming provision extends even to naturalized \ncitizens. Therefore, they would not be eligible.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If an immigrant comes into the country and goes through \nthe processes to be a naturalized U.S. citizen, they are required now \nto have a sponsor, a sponsor that states that they will make sure that \nthey will not be a ward of the Government for some period of time.\n  Does the Senator know what that period would be?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I did know and I cannot remember what it was.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will review that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is not just a legal immigrant, but a naturalized \ncitizen too.\n  We are not talking here about removing that requirement for legal \nimmigrants in this amendment. This is just for naturalized citizens.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to have the Senator's amendment. I have not \nseen it before. I will be happy to review it and we will take it up \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma very much.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2479 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for State and county demonstration programs)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous amendment shall be laid aside. \nThe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California, [Mrs. Feinstein], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2479 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, strike lines 18 through 22, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 418. STATE AND COUNTY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       ``(a) No Limitation of State Demonstration Projects.--\n     Nothing in this part shall be construed as limiting a State's \n     ability to conduct demonstration projects for the purpose of \n     identifying innovative or effective program designs in 1 or \n     more political subdivisions of the State.\n       ``(b) County Welfare Demonstration Project.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services and the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly enter \n     into negotiations with all counties or a group of counties \n     having a population greater than 500,000 desiring to conduct \n     a demonstration project described in paragraph (2) for the \n     purpose of establishing appropriate rules to govern \n     establishment and operation of such project.\n       ``(2) Demonstration project described.--The demonstration \n     project described in this paragraph shall provide that--\n       ``(A) a county participating in the demonstration project \n     shall have the authority and duty to administer the operation \n     of the program described under this part as if the county \n     were considered a State for the purpose of this part;\n       ``(B) the State in which the county participating in the \n     demonstration project is located shall pass through directly \n     to the county the portion of the grant received by the State \n     under section 403 which the State determines is attributable \n     to the residents of such county; and\n       ``(C) the duration of the project shall be for 5 years.\n       ``(3) Commencement of project.--After the conclusion of the \n     negotiations described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture \n     may authorize a county to conduct the demonstration project \n     described in paragraph (2) in accordance with the rules \n     established during the negotiations.\n       ``(4) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     termination of a demonstration project operated under this \n     subsection, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture shall submit to the Congress a \n     report that includes--\n       ``(A) a description of the demonstration project;\n       ``(B) the rules negotiated with respect to the project; and\n       ``(C) the innovations (if any) that the county was able to \n     initiate under the project.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, throughout the welfare debate it has \noften been stated that people closest to the problem know how to best \ndeal with it.\n  In fact, many States assign administration of Federal welfare \nprograms to counties. As a former mayor, and a former county \nsupervisor, that certainly is the case in California.\n  Many of the innovations and successes currently under discussion have \nbeen initiated at the local level. In my earlier remarks on welfare \nreform, I mentioned several of them--initiatives made by counties to \nput people to work, to devise programs to really run their programs \nwith efficiency, and appropriate for their local communities.\n  This amendment affirms that there will be no limitation on the \nability of a State to conduct innovative and effective demonstration \nprojects in one or more of its political subdivisions.\n  It empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to jointly \nnegotiate with any county or group of counties having a population \ngreater than 500,000 to conduct a demonstration project where the \ncounty would have the authority and duty to administer the operation of \nthe welfare program covered by this bill.\n  In essence, what it is saying, for large counties, or a group of \nsmall counties, like in Wisconsin for example, the Secretary would have \nthe authority to be able to negotiate so that the grant would go \ndirectly from Washington to the counties.\n  What does this mean? It means you take the State out of it. Why do I \nwant to take the State out of it? Because I know what States do. They \ncharge a cost, they set up a bureaucracy, and therefore a portion of \nthe money will end up in the State. The State can often not send that \nmoney to the counties, or find a reason not to send it, and even use it \nfor other purposes.\n  So in this amendment, the State in which the demonstration county is \nlocated would pass directly to the county the portion of the grant \ndetermined by \n\n[[Page S 12828]]\nthe State as attributable to the residents of that county.\n  The duration of the demonstration project is 5 years, after which \ntime the Secretary is directed to report to the Congress on the \ndescription, rules, and innovations initiated under the project. \nEssentially, the block grants of the large counties could go directly \nto the counties, thereby I believe, based on my experience, it would \nsave money and be more efficiently used.\n  This was in the bill, my understanding is, as it was originally \ndrafted, and it was removed. We would by this amendment place it back. \nIt is similar to an amendment which was in the prior Daschle bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment \ntemporarily be set aside so I can offer two amendments which I expect \nwill be ultimately accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The first relates to a study of the impact of changes \non the child care food program on program participation and family day \ncare providers.\n  I have worked with the majority and minority on the Agriculture \nCommittee on the language of the amendment, and I expect it will be \naccepted by the floor managers.\n  Mr. President, This amendment is very simple and it addresses an \nissue of great concern raised by my constituents in Wisconsin.\n  A few months ago, the House of Representatives repealed the \nentitlement status for the Child and Adult Care Food Program and placed \nits funding in a block grant of other child nutrition programs. The \n10,000 family day care home sponsors in the United States worried the \nprogram would be swallowed up by the larger, more well-known programs \nsuch as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and \nChildren.\n  The Family Day Home sponsors, who administer aspects of the CACFP \nknew the House proposal effectively meant the end of this very \nimportant program. Mr. President, the CACFP is a relatively small \nprogram that affects a very large number of children in this country. \nIn addition to providing reimbursements to providers for meals served \nto low-income children in child care centers, it provides a blended \nreimbursement for meals served in all participating family day care \nhomes--those with six children or fewer. Most children in the United \nStates that currently receive day care are cared for in small family \nday care homes. Even more significantly, according to Congress's Select \nPanel for the Promotion of Child Health, pre-school age children \nreceive about three-quarters of their nutritional intake from their day \ncare providers. Those two facts emphasize the importance of ensuring \nchildren receive nutritious meals while they under the supervision of a \nfamily day care home provider.\n  Early this year, the operator of Wisconsin's smallest non-profit \nsponsor in my State, Linda Leindecker of Horizon's Unlimited in Green \nBay, met with me to discuss her specific concerns about the proposals \nto modify the program she helps deliver. The CACFP, she pointed out, \nhas greater benefits than might meet the eye. While the clear goal of \nthe program is to enhance the nutritional status of children receiving \ncare by family day care homes, it has many less obvious benefits. Linda \npointed out that the program provides a strong incentive for small \nfamily day care homes to become licensed by the State. A recent survey \nof over 1,200 day care homes in Wisconsin found that over 70 percent of \nthose surveyed became licensed because of CACFP benefits. That means \nchildren are more likely to be in day care homes that provide a safe \nand more healthy environment with more nutritious meals than \nunregulated day care homes. These so-called ``underground'' homes are \nnot only operating without health or safety standards, but they are \nalso better able to evade compliance with income tax laws as well.\n  Not only must family day care homes participating in the CACFP comply \nwith State regulations, they are also subject to random inspections of \nall their homes by the CACFP sponsors. CACFP care providers must also \nundergo extensive nutrition education and training programs conducted \nby sponsors to ensure that the children in participating homes are \neating nutritious meals as required by the program. In total, Wisconsin \nfamily day care providers are serving nearly 12.5 million healthy \nbreakfasts, lunches, suppers and snacks annually.\n  Mr. President, the message I have heard loud and clear from Linda and \nother Family Day Care Home sponsors in Wisconsin is that while the \nprimary benefit of the family day care home portion of the CACFP is the \nenhanced nutritional status of children in small day care homes, the \nsecond most important benefit is the role of this program in creating \nmore licensed and regulated family day care homes. That benefits \nparents, taxpayers, and children alike.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate Agriculture Committee did \nnot take the drastic approach endorsed by the House. In particular, I \nam pleased that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] and the Senator \nfrom Vermont [Mr. Leahy] recognized how important CACFP is to this \nNation's children by maintaining the identity and entitlement status of \nthe program in S. 904 as approved by the Agriculture Committee\n  However, the legislation before us, which incorporates the \nAgriculture Committee's bill S. 904, does make some fundamental changes \nto the reimbursement structure for family day care homes. The bill \nestablishes an area-wide means test for full reimbursement, tier I, of \nmeals served in family day care and provides a much smaller \nreimbursement for meals served in homes that do not fall within a \nqualifying geographic area, tier II. The Democratic alternative to the \nmajority leader's bill also provides for geographic based means testing \nfor CACFP but provides a slightly higher second tier reimbursement.\n  Wisconsin's day care home sponsors are alarmed by the small tier II \nhome reimbursement and worry that this lower level of reimbursement \nwill eliminate the incentive for family day care homes to become \nlicensed and approved by the State. As some homes drop out of the \nprogram and operate underground, even fewer will enter the program at \nall, making regulated day care less accessible and less affordable to \nparents of young children. Sponsors are also worried that the \nnutritional quality of meals served in tier II homes will decline as \nwell. Fifteen cents, they point out, doesn't buy much of a healthy mid-\nday snack.\n  I share those concerns, Mr. President. I am concerned that the \nmarginal benefit of day care home participation may no longer justify \nthe cost of being regulated or licensed by the State. If that is the \ncase, I am concerned that not only the quality of day care will \ndecline, but that the quantity of affordable day care will fall as \nwell. While we are debating a bill that proposes to send more low-\nincome parents to work, it is important that there be an adequate \nsupply of safe and affordable day care for their children.\n  Mr. President, my amendment tries to address those concerns by \nrequiring USDA to study the impact of the changes to CACFP made in this \nbill on program participation, family day care home licensing and the \nnutritional quality of meals served in family day care homes. Since the \nimpact of these changes will likely be felt within the first year or \ntwo following enactment, my amendment calls for a one-time study of \nthis matter, rather than an annual review.\n  I think it is critical that Congress have access to the information \nthey need to conduct proper oversight of Federal programs. While the \nchanges made to the CACFP in S. 1120 are intended to maintain program \nintegrity while achieving fiscal responsibility, it is important that \nCongress find out whether the legislation actually achieves those \ngoals.\n  That is the intent of my amendment. It is simple and straightforward \nbut it is important.\n  The second amendment, Mr. President, relates to authority to allow a \nhousing project in Madison, Wisconsin to conduct a demonstration \nproject that waives the current take-one, take-all section 8 \nrequirement that requires a project which accepts a single section 8 \nresident to take any other section 8 applicant. \n\n[[Page S 12829]]\n\n  The unfortunate result of this policy, Mr. President, is that \nsometimes it is meant that a project will not accept any section 8 \nresidents at all. This demonstration program would not entail any \nFederal cost.\n  I understand that neither the administration nor the authorizing \ncommittee has any objection to this amendment and that they support \nmoving in this direction in order to provide greater flexibility for \nthese types of housing programs.\n  I offer this amendment along with my senior colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl. The amendment would provide an opportunity for Madison, \nWI, to demonstrate an innovative and emerging strategy in the operation \nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development assisted housing \nprogram by eliminating the take-one, take-all requirement.\n  That provision requires the manager or owner of multifamily rental \nhousing to make all units available to residents who qualify for \nsection 8 certificates or vouchers under the National Housing Act as \nlong as at least one unit is made available to those residents under \nthe terms of the long-term, 20-year section 8 renter contracts.\n  The availability of low-income housing is being seriously threatened \nacross this Nation. This is especially true when private property \nowners are considered who are increasingly choosing to opt out of the \nHUD section 8 program for a variety of reasons, as their long-term \ncontracts expire.\n  The situation in this case in Madison is typical of these problems \nthat are being experienced nationwide. HUD itself recognizes this and \nhas actually proposed, Mr. President, that we eliminate the take-one, \ntake-all language.\n  They project an elimination of the requirement will provide an \nincentive to attract new multifamily low-income housing developer \nowners and also retain existing ones.\n  Local government officials, private institutions, residents and \napartment owners in Madison in this case, Mr. President, have agreed to \na plan for the Summer Society Circle Apartments that will reduce the \nconcentration of low-income families and densely populated in \ncircumscribed areas.\n  They believe it will reduce crime and drug and gang activity and \nstabilize development in neighborhoods by encouraging a mix of low- and \nmoderate-income families. We believe the amendment provides an \nopportunity to demonstrate that public-private collaborative planning \ncan result in increased, Mr. President, increased availability of \nquality housing for low- and moderate-income families.\n  Accordingly, we urge the support of the body. There is no additional \ncost associated with this demonstration project, which simply allows \nthis community to have greater flexibility in operating in housing \nprojects which meet the needs of the communities.\n  As I understand the parliamentary situation, it is the desire of the \nmanagers to have as many of these amendments offered tonight as \npossible, and they will be disposed of in due course.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2480\n\n(Purpose: To study the impact of amendments to the child and adult care \n  food program on program participation and family day care licensing)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 712, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 972. DENIAL OF MEANS-TESTED FEDERAL BENEFITS TO \n                   NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WHO ARE DELINQUENT IN \n                   PAYING CHILD SUPPORT.\n       (A) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a non-custodial parent who is more than 2 months \n     delinquent in paying child support shall not be eligible to \n     receive any means-tested Federal benefits.\n       (b) Exception.--(1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to an unemployed non-custodial parent who is more then \n     2 months delinquent in paying child support if such parent--\n       (A) enters into a schedule of repayment for past due child \n     support with the entity that issued the underlying child \n     support order; and\n       (B) meets all of the terms of repayment specified in the \n     schedule of repayment as enforced by the appropriate \n     disbursing entity.\n       (2) 2-year exclusion.--(A) A non-custodial parent who \n     becomes delinquent in child support a second time or any \n     subsequent time shall not be eligible to receive any means-\n     tested Federal benefits for a 2-year period beginning on the \n     date that such parent failed to meet such terms.\n       (B) At the end of that two-year period, paragraph (A) shall \n     once again apply to that individual.\n       (c) Means-tested Federal Benefits.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``means-tested Federal benefits'' means \n     benefits under any program of assistance, funded in whole or \n     in part, by the Federal Government, for which eligibility for \n     benefits is based on need.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe this amendment is quite \nstraightforward. It basically says that, if a noncustodial parent is \ndelinquent on child support payments and gets into arrears extending \nbeyond 2 months, that individual, that deadbeat dad or deadbeat mom, as \nthe case may be, will not be entitled to means-tested Federal benefits.\n  I think it is very important that we do this. I do not think we \nshould be in the business of giving benefits to people who are \nneglecting their children. Many families go on welfare because \nnoncustodial parents are not paying their child support.\n  What we do in this amendment is we give people a second chance. We \nsay if they agree to sign a schedule and commit themselves to the \nrepayment of the arrears and continue the payments on time, then they \ncan get these benefits. But if they fail again, they will have to wait \n2 years before they get a chance at those benefits again.\n  I hope we will have broad support for this amendment.\n  Only about 18 percent of all cases result in child support \ncollections across this Nation.\n  And we have to remember we have 9.5 million children counting on AFDC \nfor support. We could really take people out of poverty quickly if the \ndeadbeat parent, be it a mom or a dad--usually it is a dad but \nsometimes it is a mom--came through with their child support payments.\n  This amendment is just another way for us to stand up and be counted \nand say: Look, you are not going to be entitled to get job training, \nvocational training, food stamps, SSI, housing assistance, and the \nother means-tested Federal benefits if you are behind on those child \nsupport payments. But we are ready to help you. If you will sign a \nschedule of payments and you live up to that schedule, we will make an \nexception.\n  It is interesting to note that America's children are owed more than \n$34 billion in unpaid child support. Talk about lowering the cost of \nwelfare, collecting unpaid support would be one of the quickest ways to \ndo it. Welfare caseloads could be reduced by one-third if families \ncould rely on even $300 a month, or less, of child support. Mr. \nPresident, $300 a month would add up to more than $3,000 a year.\n  So my amendment would crack down on the deadbeat dads or the deadbeat \nmoms, and basically say you have to pay support or you are not going to \nget the Federal assistance you would otherwise be entitled to.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not think I need to continue this dialog with \nmy colleagues. I think at this point I can rest on what I have said. I \nthink the Boxer amendment sends a tough message that we will have \nlittle tolerance for people who fail to meet their child support \ncommitments. And we should be tough on these people because they \njeopardize the health and well-being of their children by failing to \npay support, and they are making the taxpayers pay money that they, in \nfact, owe to these children. So I rest my case on this amendment. I \nlook forward to its being voted upon.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma and my friend from New York, is it \nnecessary to ask for the yeas and nays at this time, because I \ncertainly would like to have a vote on the amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to my \ncolleague from California. Certainly she has a right to request the \nyeas and nays. I will support that effort.\n  I have a couple of comments. I had not seen the amendment. I may well \nsupport the thrust of it. Others may as well. We are going to have a \ncouple of rollcall votes in the morning and then have some debate over \nSenator Moynihan's proposal, have the rollcall vote on his, and we may \nhave several other rollcall votes. It will certainly be the Senator's \nopportunity, if she wishes to ask for the yeas and nays tomorrow. And \nthat will also give her the opportunity to modify the amendment if it \nwould make it more agreeable and more acceptable. That would be my \nrecommendation. But, certainly, if she wishes to ask for the yeas and \nnays tonight she has that opportunity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his honest answer. I appreciate it. \nI will withhold because I do believe this is an excellent amendment and \nif there are small technical problems I will be happy to work with my \nfriends to straighten them out.\n  So I will withhold, but I look forward to voting on this as soon as I \ncan and I will be back in the morning to debate that, discuss it, at \nwhat time my colleague thinks is appropriate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague from California doing that.\n  Mr. President, I know of no other Senators having amendments, and my \ncolleague from New York as well. I suggest the absence of a quorum. It \nwill be my intention that the Senate stand in recess until tomorrow \nmorning shortly. But I will withhold for that for the moment. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12805-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12830-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12830-S12831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        HONORING LOWELL C. KRUSE AS RECIPIENT OF THE HOPE AWARD\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate a \nMissourian who has dedicated his life to helping others. He has spent \nhis entire career in the medical field, not as a doctor, but as someone \njust as dedicated and just as committed to service. Mr. Kruse is soon \nto accept the Hope Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Multiple \nSclerosis Society. He has served as a hospital administrator, vice \npresident, and president; but throughout, Mr. Kruse has never forgotten \nthose who are less fortunate.\n  Mr. Kruse was born on February 9, 1944, in the small midwestern town \nof Lake City, IA. He earned a bachelor's degree in business \nadministration and psychology from Augustana College in Sioux City, SD, \nand went on to earn his master's degree in hospital administration from \nthe University of Minnesota. Mr. Kruse started his career first as an \nassistant administrator at the St. Barnabas Hospital in Minneapolis, \nMN, then became an associate administrator at the Metropolitan Medical \nCenter in Minneapolis where he remained for 7 years serving as the vice \npresident of community operations.\n  In 1977, Mr. Kruse assumed the responsibilities as president and CEO \nof the Park Ridge Hospital and Nursing Home in Rochester, NY, and later \npresident and CEO of Upstate Health System, Inc. in Rochester. In 1984, \nMr. Kruse returned to his roots in the Midwest, serving as the \npresident and CEO \n\n[[Page S 12831]]\nof Heartland Health System in St. Joseph, MO, for the past 10 years.\n  While Mr. Kruse has continued to strive for success, he has never \nturned his back on others in his community. In New York, he was a \nmember of the Greater Rochester Area Citizens League Board, the United \nWay, and the board of directors of the Rochester Area Career \nEducational Council. In Missouri, he has served as chairman of the St. \nJoseph Development Corp., as well as chairman of the St. Joseph Chamber \nof Commerce, and is currently a fellow at the American College of \nHealth Care Executives. These are just a few of the many contributions \nMr. Kruse has made to fulfill his commitment and dedication to the \ncommunities in which he has lived.\n  Mr. Kruse has been the recipient of numerous awards for his devotion \nto community service. In 1970, he was listed as one the outstanding \nyoung men in America. In 1976, Mr. Kruse was awarded a Distinguished \nService Award and honored as one of 10 outstanding young Minnesotans. \nIn 1992, Mr. Kruse received the Midland Empire Arthritis Center's \nWilliam E. Hillyard Jr. Humanitarian Award.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Kruse has dedicated his life to helping \nand inspiring those around him.

A bill to reform the refinancing of Federal elections, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                the campaign finance reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenator Feingold and Senator Thompson, to introduce the Senate Campaign \nFinance Reform Act of 1995. This bill, if enacted, would dramatically \nchange American political campaigns.\n  This legislation is intended to help restore the public's faith in \nthe Congress and the electoral system; to reaffirm that elections are \nwon and lost in a competition of ideas and character, not fundraising. \nToward that end, we hope to level the playing field between challengers \nand incumbents.\n  Again, I want to note, this bill is about placing ideas over dollars. \nWhile my Democrat cosponsors may disagree, I believe that Republicans \nwon majorities in Congress last year because the American people \nunderstood and supported our ideas for changing the American \nGovernment, not because we excelled at the money chase. We want to make \nsure that decisions about who governs America--decisions that are so \nprofound in their consequences for current and future generations of \nAmericans--will be made by voters who have a fair understanding of \nthose consequences.\n  Campaigns, of course, cost money. This bill recognizes that fact. It \ndoes not end campaign spending, but limits it in a manner that forces \ncandidates to rely more on their message than their money.\n  Mr. President, poll after poll reveals the public's loss of faith in \nthe Congress. One of the reasons this has occurred is that the public \nbelieves--rightly or wrongly--that special interests control the \npolitical and electoral system. In order to limit the ability of \nspecial interests to control the process, and to change the perception \nthat money controls politics, we must enact campaign finance reform.\n  A recent USA Today-CNN Gallup poll revealed that 83 percent of \nAmericans want campaign finance reform enacted. According to the same \npoll, the only two issues that the public feels are more important than \ncampaign finance reform are balancing the Federal budget and reforming \nwelfare. To the surprise of many, the poll showed that changing \nMedicare and cutting taxes has less support than did campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I would like to outline what the bill does:\n  Spending Limits and Benefits: Senate campaign spending limits would \nbe based on each State's voting-age population, ranging from a high of \nover $8 million in a large State like California to a low of $1.5 \nmillion in a smaller State like Wyoming. Candidates that voluntarily \ncomply with spending limits would receive:\n  Free Broadcast Time--Candidates would be entitled to 30 minutes of \nfree broadcast time.\n  Broadcast Discounts--Broadcasters would be required to sell \nadvertising to a complying candidate at 50 percent of the lowest unit \nrate.\n  Reduced Postage Rates--Candidates would be able to send up to two \npieces of mail to each voting-age resident at the lowest 3d-class \nnonprofit bulk rate.\n  New Variable Contribution Limit--If a candidate's opponent does not \nagree to the spending limits or exceeds the limits, the complying \ncandidate's individual contribution limit is raised from $1,000 to \n$2,000 and the complying candidate's spending ceiling is raised by 20 \npercent.\n  On the issue of Personal Funds: Complying candidates cannot spend \nmore than $250,000 from their personal funds. Candidates who spend more \nthan that amount are considered in violation of this act and therefore \nqualify for none of this Act's benefits.\n  Also candidates are required to raise 60 percent of campaign funds \nfrom individuals residing in the candidate's home State.\n  There is a ban on political action committee contributions. In case a \nPAC ban is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, backup limits \non PAC contributions are also included. In such an instance, PAC \ncontribution limits would be lowered from $5,000 to the individual \ncontribution limit. Additionally, candidates could receive no more than \n20 percent of their contributions from PAC's.\n  All franked mass mailings banned in year of campaign.\n\n[[Page S 12832]]\n\n  There is a requirement increased disclosure and accountability for \nthose who engage in political advertising.\n  Bundling is limited.\n  It requires Full Disclosure of all Soft Money contributions.\n  There is a ban on personal use of campaign funds, which codifies a \nrecent FEC ruling that prohibits candidates from using campaign funds \nfor personal purposes such as mortgage payments or vacation trips\n  This bill will affect both parties equally. It does what other bills \nin the past did not, not benefit just one party. And that is also why \nit has bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, is this a perfect bill? No, it is not. I do not know \nif it is even possible to write a perfect campaign reform bill. But it \nis a good bill, that addresses the partisan and nonpartisan concerns \nthat have undermined previous reform attempts. As the Washington Post \nsaid, ``it would represent a large step forward.'' Also, as many have \nnoted, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  We must take this step. The American people expect us to do at least \nthat much.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few additional comments. I note the \npresence of my friend and colleague from Wisconsin, who is my partner \nin this effort, Senator Feingold.\n  Sometimes, residing here in the Nation's capital, as we have to do a \ngreat percentage of our time, we have a tendency to not be aware of the \nhopes and aspirations and frustrations of the American people. Last \nweek there was a CNN poll that showed what the American people want \nCongress to do and what they expect Congress to do. Mr. President, 88 \npercent of the American people want Congress to balance the budget; 31 \npercent believe that they will do it. The next highest on that list is \n88 percent want Congress to reform welfare; 47 percent expect them to \ndo it. Next in line is 83 percent of the American people want Congress \nto reform campaign financing, while only 30 percent of the American \npeople believe that Congress will do it.\n  The article goes on to say Congress meanwhile has fallen to a 30-\npercent approval, its lowest level since Republicans won control in \nJanuary. Analysts say it is largely due to the slowdown in legislation \nas items have moved to the Senate coupled with an increase in partisan \nbickering over Medicare and GOP squabbles over welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should rest easy when the approval \nof the American people of Congress is as low as 30 percent.\n  Recently there was a poll done by respected pollsters in this city. I \nwould like to quote three very important items from that poll.\n  When asked: We need campaign finance reform to make politicians \naccountable to average voters rather than special interests, voters \nstated this was very convincing, 59 percent; somewhat convincing 31 \npercent; not very convincing, 5 percent; not at all convincing, 4 \npercent; and do not know, 2 percent.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that. When asked: We need campaign \nfinance reform to make politicians accountable to average voters rather \nthan special interests, a total of 59 percent found that argument very \nconvincing, and 31 percent; somewhat convincing, a total of 90 percent \nof those interviewed.\n  When asked: We do not need campaign finance reform, the election in \nNovember helped clean up a lot of problems in Washington, respondents \nsaid their argument was very convincing, 13 percent; somewhat \nconvincing, 19 percent; not very convincing, 22 percent; and not at all \nconvincing, 39 percent.\n  Reducing the amount special interest groups can contribute to a \ncandidate would be very effective, 54 percent; somewhat effective, 34 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, when the respondents were asked: Those who make large \ncampaign contributions get special favors from politicians, respondents \nsaid this is one of the things that worries you most, 34 percent; \nworries you a great deal, 34 percent. Sixty-eight percent of the \nAmerican people believe that those who make large contributions get \nspecial favors from politicians bothers them most or bothers them a \ngreat deal.\n  What I am saying is that we need to reform this business. We must \nunderstand that money will always play a role in political campaigns. \nIn an ideal world that would not be the case. We do not live in an \nideal world. But there should be accountability.\n  I am pleased that Senator Feingold and Senator Thompson and others \nare joining in this effort, the first bipartisan effort in over 10 \nyears. This is not a popular issue, Mr. President. It is not one that \nthe Congress would like to address. There are those who are cynical \nabout the real prospects of fundamental campaign finance reform since \nit has been a high item on the agenda for a long time.\n  Frankly, I do not know if we will reform campaign financing. But I do \nknow this: If we do not do something in this area, the very high \ndisapproval that the American people have for our activities here in \nCongress will be reflected at the polls in November of 1996 since the \nAmerican people have no other recourse. It is not clear to me what that \nreaction will be, whether it is a search for an independent party or \ncandidate.\n  About 2 weeks ago was there was a poll taken by the Wall Street \nJournal and NBC that showed that 6 out of 10 Americans now would \nsupport an independent party for a candidate, or whether they would go \nback to the Democratic Party or they would believe that those on this \nside of the aisle are making a good effort. But I do know this: If we \ncontinue to experience such high disapproval ratings, the American \npeople lose confidence in our ability to carry out their mandates and \nthe repercussions cannot be good for our system of government.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will look at this issue carefully. I \nhope we will continue to try to work on a bipartisan basis. And I hope \nthat all of those who are interested in this issue will understand that \nthe Senator from Wisconsin and I do not believe that we have come up \nwith a perfect document, there are parts of this bill that I have \nreservations about, parts of this bill that the Senator from Wisconsin \nhas reservations about. We cannot let perfect be the enemy of the good. \nAnd always, if there is one lesson here, it\n is that this issue must be addressed on a bipartisan basis and from a \nbipartisan standpoint.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield such time as he may use \nto the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I especially want to thank the Senator from Arizona. I \nam pleased to be a part of this effort, to be one of two authors in the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, and am pleased to hear that Senator Thompson has \njoined us.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Arizona already this year on a \nnumber of issues and on a bipartisan basis about our concern about the \nrevolving door. Members of Congress and staff sometimes move rather \nquickly over to lobbying ventures. We are trying to do something about \nthat.\n  We worked hard together to try to do something about the great public \nfrustration about pork items being placed on appropriations bills, and \nare trying to respond in another piece of legislation that is attached \nto the line-item veto, a bill that could do something about putting \nextraneous material on emergency spending bills.\n  I, of course, feel particular good about our recent effort and \nsuccess on the gift ban which this body enacted just prior to the \nrecess that we just had.\n  I have to tell you, back home the response to the gift ban was a lot \nmore intense than I expected. People are looking for any sign of hope \nthat things can change here in Washington. Even though the gift ban \nitself is not something that changes the world or solves all of our \nproblems by any means, there was a feeling I got that people took some \nheart from that.\n  Our effort today in introducing this campaign finance reform bill is \nall about building on that initial success and doing it in an area that \nis even far more important; as the Senator from Arizona has said, the \nchanging of the way we finance our campaigns. I am very optimistic that \na number of Members from both sides of the aisle will join us in this \neffort soon. That is the indication I am getting from our \nconversations. \n\n[[Page S 12833]]\n\n  The Senator from Arizona said this is, will be, and will continue to \nbe a bipartisan effort. Senator McCain is speaking to Democrats and I \nam speaking to Republicans about this. We are not dividing up the \nSenate because this has to be a product of the Senate.\n  What we are really asking here is for both political parties to, in \neffect, sort of mutually disarm this money race in politics and to have \na consensus that the Senate and the Congress in this country will all \nbe better off if we stop this horrible trend for outrageous spending in \ncampaigns.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona that this is not the perfect \nbill or the ideal bill, if there is one. I believe in complete public \nfinancing of campaigns. I think it would be better if we did not have \nany campaign contributions, if it was illegal to ask for campaign \ncontributions. I think everybody would be better off. I suppose that is \nmy ideal world. But I know that cannot pass here.\n  I introduced my own bill earlier this year, S. 46. I thought it was a \ngood bill but it involved public financing. There are difficulties in \ngetting a majority on that issue. But because campaign finance reform \nis such an overwhelming priority, I was not only pleased to see some of \nthe ideas of the Senator from Arizona, but I was very surprised to see \nhow far he would come to try to reach a consensus, to try to have a \nbipartisan bill to solve this problem. I believe it is one of the \nbiggest problems we have in this country. I say the biggest problem we \nhave in terms of our day-to-day operations in trying to solve a \nparticular problem is balancing the Federal budget. That is No. 1.\n  But if we want to talk about the procedure, if we want to talk about \nthe way this Government is run and why people feel it does not run \nright, I think the most important issue is changing the way campaigns \nare financed.\n  I say this from the point of view of maybe three different groups. \nThe first group, the most important group, is the public at large. The \nSenator from Arizona says one of the reasons he thinks the Republicans \nwon on November 8 is this issue. I think he is right. I think it is one \nof the reasons Bill Clinton and some of us won in 1992. It does not \nmean we earned that support if we do not do campaign finance reform. \nBut I think it is one of the reasons. I think it has been a little bit \nsurprising to people that in a reform Congress that this issue of \ncampaign finance reform has not really come to the fore.\n  So from the point of view of the public, when they see the hundreds \nof thousands of dollars poured into the telecommunications bill or the \nregulatory reform bill, you name it, this is all happening in this \nCongress, the money race, the big contributions continue, and it makes \npeople feel that they are disconnected from their elected \nrepresentatives, that something is going on here, that after the \nelection somebody comes here and they are distracted or disconnected \nfrom them, and that the big money in campaigns has a lot to do with it.\n  So from the point of view of the public, we need this legislation. We \nalso need this legislation from the point of view of people who are \nchallengers. We were all new candidates once for the Senate. We all had \nto face the reality that people would come to us and say, ``Well, you \nmay be qualified, but where are you going to get the money?'' That \nended up being the first question I was asked any time I went anywhere \nin Wisconsin or other places trying to figure out if I could run a \ncredible race.\n How are you going to get the money?\n\n  Well, that has to change. Some of us were fortunate enough to win, \nmaybe even without a great deal of money. But I cannot even imagine the \nthousands and thousands of Americans, good Americans, people who would \nhave been wonderful Senators who did not even consider running because \nthey believe this has become a game for either the wealthy or the well \nconnected.\n  Finally, there is a third group that this should have great appeal \nfor, and that is the 100 Members of this body. Ask any Senator what \nthey do not like about their job. Most are so delighted to be here and \nconsider it a great honor. The one thing that is the bane of any \nSenator's existence, if there is one, is this necessity of raising \nmoney. For many it is a demeaning process, to be told that if you do \nnot raise $10,000 a week, you are not going to have a chance and you \nare going to have more opponents. It takes away from time with your \nfamily; it takes away from time with your constituents; it takes away \nfrom time to actually do the job here in Washington, to understand the \nissues, to talk to other Senators and to work out solutions. So from \nthe point of view of the Senate and those who seek the Senate and those \nwho elect us, it is time to come together, compromise if necessary, and \nhave a real campaign finance reform bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona has outlined already the major provisions. \nLet me just highlight what I consider to be the three core provisions \nthat I think make this bill very unique and not only strong but \nbalanced from a partisan point of view. And these are the three \nprovisions that all have to do with what happens if somebody complies \nwith the incentives and with the limits in the bill in order to get \nvarious incentives.\n  First of all, there is a provision that might be called the more \nDemocrat-supported provision. It was the one in S. 3 last year, the one \nthat passed the Democratic Senate, and that is the voluntary limit. We \nwould place a voluntary limit based on the size of the population in a \nState of how much can be spent in total in a U.S. Senate election from \nabout $1.5 million in the smaller States to a maximum of about $7 \nmillion to $8 million in California. And we know even though that \nsounds like a lot of money, it does not even compare to the $50 million \nthat was spent in a Senate race in California this past year.\n  So we provide a voluntary limit, and if you abide by the limit, you \nget benefits such as reduced television time and an opportunity to mail \non a reduced basis to the constituents in your State.\n  The second idea is what I would call a more Republican idea, an idea \nthat I have always liked, one idea I campaigned on and I believe in it, \nand that is that you should have to get a majority of your campaign \ncontributions from individuals from your own home State--not from \nPAC's, not from out-of-State interests, but a majority of the money has \nto come from the folks for whom you work, the boss--in my case, the 5 \nmillion people who live in Wisconsin. I think that is a very important \nprovision to return us to the grassroots politics it has been.\n  The third major provision has to do with a rising trend that we have \nall noticed and are all concerned about which makes the public terribly \ncynical, and that is the proliferation of big money being spent by very \nwealthy individuals to finance their own campaigns. This bill produces \na voluntary limit of approximately $250,000, depending on the size of \nyour State, saying that if you spend over that of your own money, your \nopponent gets some advantages in terms of raising funds to make it more \ncompetitive.\n  So this combination, doing something about the overall amount that is \nspent, doing something about obtaining funds from outside of your own \nhome State, and doing something about the unfairness of the system that \nallows only the very wealthy to be able to just get right in the middle \nof an election, buy recognition and win an election, these three things \nI think make for the core of a very effective bill. There are other \nprovisions that are important, but I think these three are the ones \nthat will make this bill work and make the bill pass.\n  In addition, if a complying candidate is faced by an opponent that is \npouring millions of dollars of their own money into their campaign, the \ncomplying candidate is granted the ability to raise additional campaign \nfunds beyond the limits under current law.\n  I support that principle--that is, the idea that we should provide \nincentives for candidates to limit their personal funding, and the idea \nthat if one candidate is facing someone with such vast resources, the \ncandidate without personal wealth should have access to resources of \nequal value.\n  I do have concerns about this particular provision that raises the \nindividual contribution limits and allows the complying candidate to \nraise hundreds of thousands of extra dollars. I am not sure that \nfurthers the goal of bringing down the overall costs of Senate \ncampaigns--in fact, it may only \n\n[[Page S 12834]]\nadd fuel to the fire. Providing the complying candidate with greater \nbenefits may be a better alternative to raising the contribution \nlimits. But again I support the principle of finding a way to encourage \ncandidates to voluntarily limit their personal spending.\n  There are other important provisions in this legislation as well. We \neliminate a traditional incumbent advantage--franked mass mailings, in \nthe calendar year of an election. The bill contains another provision I \nhave concerns about, a ban on political action committee contributions \nincluding the so-called leadership PAC's.\n  If such a ban is ruled unlawful, PAC contributions will be limited to \nno more than 20 percent of a candidate's campaign funds collected and \nthe contribution levels for PAC's will be lowered from 5,000 dollars to \nwhatever the applicable individual contribution limits are.\n  Some view a PAC ban as a cure-all to our campaign finance problems. I \nam not so sure of this. First, according to figures released by the \nFederal Election Commission, PAC contributions have remained at fairly \nequal levels over the past few election cycles. Aggregate PAC \ncontributions totaled $149 million in 1990, rose to $178 million in \n1992 and remained at $178 million in 1994.\n  During the same period, overall campaign spending has risen from $446 \nmillion in 1990 to $724 million in 1994--a 62-percent increase. So even \nthough overall campaign costs have skyrocketed in recent years, the \nlevel of PAC\n contributions has remained relatively constant.\n\n  That is why I have very serious doubts that banning political action \ncommittees will be very helpful in getting a grip on the rapidly rising \nlevels of overall campaign spending. The Senator from Arizona does \nhowever make a compelling point that incumbents by and large are most \nlikely to benefit from PAC's as illustrated by the shift in PAC \ncontributions from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party \nfollowing the 1994 elections.\n  Though I question the legality and rationale in banning PAC \ncontributions, I think it is entirely appropriate to limit the amount \nof PAC contributions a candidate may accept as a percentage of overall \nfundraising. The backup provision in this bill--the 20 percent \naggregate limit on PAC contributions, as well as lowering PAC \ncontribution limits so they are equal to individual contribution \nlimits--is a good idea, and I would actually support lowering that \naggregate threshold, perhaps 10 percent.\n  The bill also places new disclosure requirements and limits on the \ntremendous amounts of soft money, that is, the unregulated campaign \nfunds that are poured into Federal campaigns including Presidential \nelections.\n  Soft money represents a real problem in our political system and this \nis clearly one obstacle that Republicans and Democrats should be \nworking together to eliminate. The amount of soft money raised just \nthis year--numbering in the tens of millions of dollars--stands to \nundermine the reforms of the Presidential Election System that have \nworked so well for over 20 years now.\n  Let me say that I was disappointed in the Democratic National \nCommittee's recent fundraising effort that literally sought to sell \naccess to the President in exchange for campaign contributions. I am \nvery pleased that President Clinton, a longtime supporter of campaign \nfinance reform, denounced this effort and distanced himself from it.\n  This sort of fundraising has occurred while the White House was in \ncontrol of Democrats and Republicans alike--and let me be clear here--\nboth parties are guilty of this kind of fundraising tactic that only \nunderscores the need for comprehensive\n reform that includes soft money limits and disclosure.\n\n  Finally, the bill will codify a recent ruling by the Federal Election \nCommission that bars candidates from using campaign funds for personal \npurposes, such as mortgage payments, country club memberships and \nvacations.\n  Most of these provisions were included in S. 46, the campaign finance \nreform legislation I introduced on the first day of the 104th Congress, \nand I am delighted that Senator McCain and I were able to come \ntogether, roll up our sleeves and produce a comprehensive reform bill \nthat is fair to Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  The fact is, I do not support everything in this bill. There are \nprovisions I would like to see modified. The legislation I introduced \nin January called for full public financing for candidates that agree \nto limit there overall campaign spending. I continue to believe that \npublic financing is the best way to reform a system that has created \ndramatically unfair elections and caused Members of Congress to spend \nincreasingly more time hosting fundraisers and less time fulfilling \ntheir legislative responsibilities.\n  However, if campaign finance reform is to pass with bipartisan \nsupport, a vehicle for such reform must be found that can be supported \nby Members from both parties and from across political ideologies. I \nbelieve that this bill provides that vehicle.\n  Having a fair and competitive election system is not a Democratic or \nRepublican issue. How we elect our Representatives is a cornerstone of \nour Democratic political system. As a Nation, we have always put a \ntremendous value on participation in our Democratic process. We have \nrepeatedly passed laws, even constitutional amendments, to expand the \nrights of our citizens to vote and express political viewpoints.\n  Yet here we are with a campaign system in which the average cost of \nrunning for a seat in the U.S. Senate is estimated at $4 million. Four \nmillion dollars. That is just the average. In 1994, nearly $35 million \nwas spent between the two general election candidates in California \nalone. Nearly $27\n million was spent by the candidates in the Virginia Senate race.\n\n  So unless you win the Powerball drawing, or strike oil in your \nbackyard or are an incumbent Member of Congress, you are an automatic \nlongshot to be even considered a credible candidate for the United \nStates Senate.\n  That is not expanding participation. That is not encouraging \ndemocracy. That is sending out a clear message that unless you are \nwell-financed or well-connected, you should not be running for the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Finally, the time consumed raising contributions for reelection \nefforts is time taken away from legislative responsibilities of \nincumbents. Members of Congress should not have to chose between those \nresponsibilities or making phone calls to potential contributors.\n  What we need to do is to return to a simple proposition: That is, \nmoney should not determine the outcome of elections. Elections should \nbe decided by issues and ideas, not checkbooks and campaign coffers. \nThat does not mean that campaign contributions have no place in our \nelection system. It simply means that all candidates should have a \nlegitimate and reasonable opportunity to get their message out to the \nelectorate in their States.\n  I have reached that conclusion, the Senator from Arizona has reached \nthat conclusion and the majority of this body has reached that \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, we all know that Congress is not held in very high \nregard by the American people. They are angry, they are cynical and to \na large extent they have lost faith in their Government. All of these \nfeelings have sprung from a common belief that is shared by so many of \nour constituents--a belief that I find deeply troubling--that the \nCongress simply does not represent them anymore.\n   They see the television news accounts of Members of Congress \nrelaxing on a beach vacation paid for by lobbyists. They find out that \ntheir Representatives are receiving tens of thousands of dollars from \nthis interest group or that interest group, and they have begun to \nwonder if the average American really has any sort of voice in \nWashington DC. They feel alienated, they\n feel disconnected and soon they become distrustful.\n\n  A few weeks ago, thousands of Americans who have been frustrated by \nboth parties' inability to produce meaningful political reform met at \nthe United We Stand America Convention in Dallas.\n  Politician after politician, from both parties, ranging from the \ndistinguished Senate majority leader to the general chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, stood at the lectern in Dallas and \nrailed for campaign finance reform. Why? As one attendee at this \nconvention framed it:\n\n\n[[Page S 12835]]\n\n       When I look at a politician, I wonder who really owns him. \n     I do not see them as people with their own ideas. I think the \n     people who are financing them tell them what to think.\n\n  That viewpoint, Mr. President--one that I believe is shared by \nmillions and millions of other Americans--is precisely why we are in \nsuch need of immediate and meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  Whether it is showering Members of Congress with free gifts, meals or \nvacation trips, or funneling huge campaign contributions to incumbent \nMembers, it has become clear in the minds of the American people--and \njustifiably so--that the key to gaining access and influence on Capitol \nHill is money.\n  And that is what our election system has become all about--money. \nCandidates are judged first and foremost not on their positions on the \nissues, not by their experience or capabilities but by their ability to \nraise the millions of dollars that are needed in today's climate to run \nan effective congressional campaign.\n  The bill we are introducing today will return our campaign system to \nthe people we represent. If an individual wants to run for the United \nStates Senate and can prove that their ideas and viewpoints represent a \nbroad base of support, they will have the opportunity to do so.\n  I have said many times that we should not have a campaign finance \nsystem that favors challengers or incumbents, or candidates from either \nparty. The bill we are introducing today represents the comprehensive, \nbipartisan reform that the American people have been demanding for \nyears.\n  This bill represents a compromise that can be supported by Senators \nfrom across the ideological spectrum. It is not perfect and it includes \nprovisions which I and others might not support standing alone. Each of \nus has swallowed hard in some areas to put together a responsible, \nbipartisan proposal. Taken as a whole and on balance, it is a vast \nimprovement over our current system which can be described as unfair at \nbest and chaotic at worst.\n  Finally and very briefly, the question I am getting is: Why do you \nthink this is going to succeed? This has been tried time and again.\n  Well, I can understand that sentiment. Campaign finance reform is not \neven mentioned in the Republican Contract With America. It is not even \nthere. But there is still a strong feeling that this should be done. \nEven though there is a disconnect between what the Senator from Arizona \nhas said when he points out people believe this should be done but they \ndo not think it can be done, it will not happen, I think there are \nsigns it will happen.\n  First, this is the first bipartisan effort of its kind for 10 years. \nThat is very important.\n  Second, I think the gift ban effort showed that there is a \nwillingness on reform issues to cross party lines, to sometimes not \nagree with the leadership, and to move on a bipartisan basis to change \nthe system.\n  Third, you cannot help but notice that at the conference in Dallas \nrun by Mr. Perot, even though it may not have been expected, one of the \nleading topics was the need for campaign finance reform. And in the \nfirst speech given at that conference by our former colleague, Senator \nBoren said that the conference should go on record in favor of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill.\n  I also noticed that even before we introduced the bill today, we have \nalready had editorial endorsements across the country. It is rare to \nreceive editorial endorsements on a piece of legislation before you \neven introduce it, but this bill has already merited it. We also \nunderstand that at least a notice will go out today that a couple of \nour colleagues in the House on a bipartisan basis will introduce this \nsame bill in the House. So there is reason to believe that it will not \njust be an effort in the Senate.\n  Let me finally say I think the most telling proof that this thing can \nwork is the vote we took in July. I came to the floor of the Senate and \nsimply brought up a sense-of-the-Senate resolution along with Senator \nMcCain that said we ought to consider campaign finance reform during \nthe 104th Congress. I expected that this would just be accepted, that \npeople would say, ``Fine. Let's deal with that later.'' But the \nmajority leader, a person who has enormous respect in this body from \nevery Member, came down to the floor and indicated that he was not sure \nthere could be a bipartisan effort, and he moved to table my amendment \nto not have campaign finance reform put on the agenda.\n  Mr. President, he lost that vote. He almost never loses a vote out \nhere. He has a tremendously high success record. But 13 Republicans \njoined with various Democrats to say on a 57-41 vote that, yes, during \nthe 104th Congress we have to clean up this money mess that is in \nWashington. We have to stop this race to raise all this money out here \nthat takes us away from our constituents.\n  I think that is a good sign. It is a sign that both parties want to \nwork together. And all I can say in conclusion is the thing I \nespecially like about working with the Senator from Arizona is he does \nnot just like introducing bills; he likes to win. This is an effort to \npass a bill--not talk about it, pass a bill--send it to the President, \nand to have by January 1, 1997, a whole different way of electing \nSenators.\n  So I thank the Senator from Arizona very much, and I look forward to \nthis effort.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send this legislation to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to congratulate the \nSenator from Wisconsin for a very fine statement. I hope this is the \nbeginning of a process that can be completed. I believe we have clearly \nstated that we are interested in a bipartisan effort in this area. We \nare not interested in seeking political advantage or campaign advantage \nfor either party. We are interested in leveling the playing field for \nincumbents and challengers, which is clearly not the case today. I \nappreciate the effort of the Senator from Wisconsin and I have grown to \nappreciate not only his dedication but his tenacity.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from Maryland in \nthe Chamber, so I will yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to join my \ncolleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, in the introduction of the \nSenate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995.\n  It is well known that the American people have very little faith in \ntheir elected representatives. It is a travesty that the commonly held \npresumption is that Members of Congress are bought and controlled by \nspecial interests.\n  Another problem that affects the reputation and quality of our \nrepresentative government is that once someone gets elected, they have \na significant advantage in subsequent elections.\n  Congress needs to move away from professionalism and more toward a \ncitizen legislature. It should be more open, instead of more closed. \nAnd that's because of the role that money plays. Unless a candidate has \naccess to large sums of money he or she is pretty much cut out of the \nprocess. This leaves the field to the professional politicians.\n  This legislation will do several things. First, it will help level \nthe playing field and help reduce the advantage that incumbents have. \nAnd it will bring down the built-in advantage of individual wealth. \nSecond, it will reduce the reliance on private donations.\n  The new provisions which is the largest step in a new direction is \nthe one that requires that most of a candidate's money must be raised \nin his or her own State. For myself, I'd probably be in favor of even \nhigher requirements on this.\n  The most important element in all this is what passage of this \nlegislation would do to improve public confidence. The public is \nextremely cynical and skeptical of the process of our Congress and our \nGovernment. We need to do everything we can to turn that around. Much \nof the public's concern has to do with the role of money in our \nprocess. This would be a step in a downplaying the importance of money \nin electing our officials and in what is perceived to be its effect on \nthe decisions officials make after their election.\n  Much of the public perception of the process is justified. We have \ngot to \n\n[[Page S 12836]]\nstart doing everything we can to enhance the stature and the confidence \nthat people have in the Congress. Otherwise, we are not going to be \nable to exert the leadership we need to in other legislative areas. \nRight now we've got feet of clay, and it makes the rest of the body \npolitic weak. Until we do something about these fundamental parts of \nthe political process, Congress is not going to have the strength to \nsustain itself when we make the tough decisions on fiscal matters, and \nother important areas such as welfare, tax reform, health care, and \ncrime.\n  This proposal will help level the playing field, open up the process, \nand do away with some of the advantages of incumbency. It will reduce \nthe amount of time a candidate and office holder will have to spend on \nfundraising. It will reduce the role of money and reduce the reliance \non private political contributions. And most importantly, it will help \nrenew public confidence.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am delighted to be an original \ncosponsor of the bipartisan legislation introduced today by Senators \nFeingold and McCain, to provide for broad, sweeping reform of the way \nwe conduct and finance congressional elections.\n  I have been proud to work with my colleagues from Arizona and \nWisconsin on a number of political reform issues, and was very pleased \nto celebrate a major victory with them as allies on the gift ban, \npassed just before the recess. After several years of struggle and \ncontroversy in the face of strong and persistent resistance by certain \nof my colleagues, including last year's filibuster by our Republican \ncolleagues, it was a major victory for reformers. And in my \nconversations with people back in my State, they recognized its \nimportance and said that it gave them renewed hope that we in Congress \nmight respond to growing demands for political reform at the \ngrassroots.\n  But the gift ban, and the passage of lobbying reform, are only two \nkey elements of the political reform agenda. The more significant \nreform, in my mind, and the one that will have even more far-reaching \nconsequences for stemming the tide of special interest influence in the \npolitical process, is the effort to profoundly reshape the way we \nfinance and conduct political campaigns in this country.\n  For many years, I and others have pushed forward here in the Senate a \nnumber of campaign finance reform bills, only to see them die in the \nface of near-unanimous Republican opposition, including a sustained \nfilibuster against last year's bill. I hope that as this bill evolves, \nit will serve as the basis for the grand bipartisan compromise on this \nissue that has so far eluded us. For that to happen, each side will \nhave to consider giving up certain advantages that many believe the \ncurrent system now offers. Americans are looking for that kind of \ncooperation and compromise on political reform. They believe it's long \noverdue.\n  On the first day of this Congress, I reintroduced S. 116, my \ncomprehensive campaign reform legislation, which I believe should serve \nas a model for real, thoroughgoing reform of our campaign finance \nsystem. I said at the time that I hoped we would move forward quickly \non real reform, despite the persistent opposition of most of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. That bill has been bottled \nup by the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has thus far refused to \neven hold hearings on campaign reform.\n  There have been a number of other campaign reform bills introduced \nthis year, including the version of last year's comprehensive bill \nintroduced by Minority Leader Daschle. None of them have received \nserious consideration by the committees on jurisdiction either. I hope \nthat additional elements of my bill will be incorporated into the final \nversion of this bill if it moves forward.\n  This bill is not perfect. Some of its provisions I don't support. But \neven with its warts, I have decided to be an original cosponsor in the \nhope that it might provide a vehicle for real, bipartisan reform \nefforts this year. It does provide many of the central elements of any \nsignificant reform plan. Its enactment would go a long way toward \nrestoring integrity to our political process.\n  Perhaps most important, it would impose strict limits on the amounts \nthat candidates could spend in their campaigns. That is critical if we \nare to address the huge amount of big money that pours into campaigns, \noften from well-heeled special interests. As with my bill, and others, \nthe formula would be based on the voting age population in each State. \nCandidates who agree to abide by the limit would receive free broadcast \ntime, reduced postage rates, and broadcast discounts as incentives for \nthem to participate.\n  It also contains tough new provisions to ban special interests from \nbundling contributions, bans contributions from political action \ncommittees--with backup limits should the ban be found unconstitutional \nby the courts--bans incumbent use of taxpayer-paid mass mailings in an \nelection year, imposes tough new limits on so-called soft money \ncontributions that can be used to circumvent Federal financing rules, \nand prohibits the personal use of campaign funds.\n  Finally, it places a premium on contributions from a Member's own \nhome State, in an effort to ensure that Senators are more accountable \nto those who elected them than to big-money special interests. It \nrequires that a substantial majority of funds come from one's State, \nand that would be another big step toward reform. While it is true that \nthis specific provision has often been seen historically as being \nharder on Democrats than Republicans, I believe this is an important \nprinciple that should be preserved in some form as this bill moves \nforward.\n  As I have said, there are some real problems with this bill, and both \nof its primary sponsors have acknowledged that. I will only identify a \nfew. For example, if a noncomplying candidate refuses to abide by \nspending limits, the bill allows an increase in contribution limits for \nthe complying candidate, as a deterrent to nonparticipation. I am very \ntroubled by this provision, because I think it could, in some \ncircumstances, increase individual contribution limits, rather than \ndecrease them, as I would prefer. Last year I offered several \namendments to reduce substantially individual contribution limits. I \ncontinue to believe that this is the way to go, coupled with other \nincentives. I hope that we will ultimately provide for another way to \noffer carrots, and wield sticks, to encourage candidates to comply with \nspending limits.\n  In addition, the bill provides for a limit on personal funds spent in \na campaign to $250,000. I believe this is much too high, which is why I \noffered an amendment last Congress, approved overwhelmingly by the \nSenate, to cut this limit down to $25,000. I believe that is where the \nlimit should be set, and I intend to work with my colleagues to reduce \nthat limit.\n  In short, while this measure is not as comprehensive as earlier \nversions of campaign legislation which I have authored or supported in \nthe past, it would go a very long way toward real reform. I think that \nas the bill moves forward, it can be improved upon, and I intend to \nwork to do that. But I commend Senators Feingold and McCain for their \neffort, and I hope the introduction of this bill will help to move us \nas soon as possible toward a major overhaul of the campaign finance \nsystem, which has eluded us for so many years.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1220. A bill to provide that Members of Congress shall not be paid \nduring Federal Government shutdowns; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                federal government shutdown legislation\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat I believe is fair and necessary.\n  This bill says that if the Congress fails to do its work and cannot \nreach agreement on the Federal budget--and the Federal Government \ncannot pay its bills--Members of Congress will not receive pay.\n  Americans are being told every day that we may come to a train wreck \nover the budget. Certainly, we have major differences among Members of \nCongress and the President over what our national priorities should be. \nSome in Congress favor a huge tax cut for the rich paid for by \ncrippling the Medicare system. I think that is cruel and unfair, and I \nam going to fight it. But even if we cannot agree on priorities, \n\n[[Page S 12837]]\nall Members of Congress should agree that we must pass the budget on \ntime and enable the Government to continue operating.\n  I believe this legislation is important for two key reasons:\n  First, it will help avert the predicted Government shutdown because--\nwith their personal paychecks on the line--Members will understand the \nfear and uncertainty now being felt by the millions of Americans who \nrely on Government services--from small businesses with Federal \ncontracts to farmers to veterans to senior citizens to those who hold \nU.S. Government bonds.\n  Second, it codifies a principle that all other workers in America \nlive by: If you don't do your job, you shouldn't get paid. One of \nCongress' most important functions is to pass the Nation's budget. If \nwe fail in that critically important task, it simply makes sense that \nour pay should be docked.\n  This legislation would require that pay for Members of Congress be \ndocked if either there is a lapse in appropriations for any Federal \ndepartment or agency or the Federal debt ceiling is reached.\n  I am very pleased that a companion measure is being introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives today by Congressman Dick Durbin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DURING GOVERNMENT \n                   SHUTDOWNS.\n\n       No Member of Congress may receive basic pay for any period \n     in which--\n       (1) there is a lapse in appropriations for any Federal \n     agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a \n     regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution; or\n       (2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or \n     meet obligations because the public debt limit under section \n     3101 of title 31, United States Code has been reached.\n\n     SEC. 2. RETROACTIVE PAY PROHIBITED.\n\n       No pay forfeited in accordance with section 1 may be paid \n     retroactively.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1221. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Legal Services \nCorporation Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n               LEGAL SERVICES REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation along \nwith Senator Jeffords to reauthorize the Legal Services Corporation \n[LSC] Act.\n  Through this federally established corporation, thousands of low \nincome Americans have access to our legal system. Clients seek \nassistance with landlord-tenant disputes, domestic violence cases, \nwriting of wills, and other civil matters. Sometimes the cases need to \nbe litigated, but frequently, the clients simply need legal counseling.\n  Regrettably, Legal Services has been plagued with controversy over \nthe last decade. Critics have charged, with some validity, that Legal \nServices attorneys have acted as advocates for political causes, such \nas welfare reform and state redistricting cases. As a result, LSC has \nnot been reauthorized since 1977.\n  Today, I am introducing a Senate companion bill to H.R. 1806, \nlegislation introduced by Representatives McCollum and Stenholm in the \nHouse of Representatives. I want to give Representatives McCollum and \nStenholm credit for their hard work in putting this bill together, and \nfor their dedication to assuring that low income Americans retain \naccess to our legal system.\n  The legislation being introduced today addresses the concerns that \nhave been expressed over the past several years by limiting the types \nof activities that Legal Services attorneys can handle. For instance, \nunder the bill, Legal Services attorneys cannot represent tenants being \nevicted from public housing projects for drug dealing. In addition, \nattorneys will not be representing incarcerated individuals on prisoner \nrights cases.\n  The legislation also has new accountability provisions. Lawyers will \nbe required to keep time sheets so federal auditors can monitor the \ntypes of cases being handled. New litigation safeguards will be \nimplemented to protect against the filing of frivolous class action law \nsuits. And we will require LSC grantees to bid competitively for their \nLSC contracts.\n  Mr. President, Legal Services is an important program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the legislation being introduced today, and ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent the creation of an international bailout \nfund within the International Monetary Fund, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                international monetary fund legislation\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have spoken on a number of \noccasions in opposition to the United States bailout of Mexico. To \ndate, the United States has provided $12.5 billion for Mexico to prop \nup the Mexican peso. I remain skeptical that the United States will \never have this money repaid.\n  The Banking Committee held hearings approximately 2 months ago in \nwhich a number of Mexican citizens, some of them prominent political \nopposition leaders, said that we would never be repaid.\n  What is particularly bothersome about the Mexico debacle is that the \nUnited States taxpayer is guaranteeing repayment to investors in \nMexican bonds who at the time were earning extraordinary returns, some \n30 percent to 40 percent on Mexico bonds. These investors were aware of \nthe risks.\n  As a reponse to this crisis, the administration, along with the \nInternational Monetary Fund [IMF], is now considering the establishment \nof an international fund to bail out other countries that find \nthemselves in the same position as Mexico. The administration calls \nthis an Emergency Financing Mechanism--but the truth is that it's \nanother bailout on an international scale.\n  The most troubling aspect of this is that the new fund will create a \nmoral hazard for other countries. What will stop a country from \npursuing reckless economic policies, from going deeper into debt--\nknowing that if they fail, the newly created fund stands ready for a \nbailout. What will prevent investors from investing in the most risky \nGovernment bonds--with full knowledge that the IMF stands ready for an \nemergency bailout.\n  I think this is a bad idea, and I think the United States and the \nInternational Monetary Fund [IMF] should abandon further discussions \nabout its creation.\n  Unfortunately, I am not sure this administration will back away from \nthis proposal. For this reason, I am introducing legislation today that \nwill stop the creation of any new international bailout fund.\n  The bill will prevent any funds from being used, directly or \nindirectly, for the creation of this new international fund.\n  Mr. President, our own country is going into debt approximately $800 \nmillion a day. We simply cannot afford to be bailing out foreign \ncountries that have pursued poor economic policies. It is bad enough \nthat we have spent $12.5 billion on Mexico. After this, we should say \nno more to Mexico, and no more to any other country.\n  If the United States keeps up this spending pattern, who is going to \nbail out this country? We sent a troubling signal to the world that we \nwere not going to get our economic house in order when the Senate \nrefused to pass a balanced budget amendment, and the dollar declined as \na result. I know for certain that we will never balance the budget if \nwe continue policies like bailing out Mexico.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, if the United States is serious about \nbalancing our budget--and about avoiding other debacles like Mexico, we \nwill move quickly to stop the creation of this new fund. I would urge \nthe Senate to move forward on this legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of Greg \nWyatt, the sculptor-in-residence at the Cathedral of St. John the \nDivine.\n  Mr. Wyatt is exhibiting his sculpture, the bill of rights ``Eagle'', \nin the Russell Senate Office Building September 5-9, 1995.\n  By this exhibition of his craft, Mr. Wyatt expresses the freedoms we \nare guaranteed by the Bill of Rights through a work of art for all \nAmericans.\n  As president of the Cathedral of St. John's fantasy fountain fund, \nMr. Wyatt also contributes by instructing talented apprentices in \nappreciation for the renaissance tradition. Studio apprenticeship leads \nto the development and promotion of the arts, which benefits every \nAmerican citizen.\n  Our Bill of Rights is an historic living document that should be the \nfocus of our continuous study and appreciation, for it outlines the \nmost fundamental freedoms and protections we enjoy as Americans.\n  The ``Eagle'' that Mr. Wyatt is presenting is a tribute to those \nfreedoms and to the strength of a nation built on individual rights. As \nwe return in September to begin the remainder of the year's work, I \nurge my colleagues to take time to view this work of art and reflect \nupon all that it represents.\n  The exhibit is made possible by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation, an \norganization which works for the preservation of 19th century art and \nculture of New York's Hudson River Valley.\n  Organized to preserve the paintings and historic studio of Jasper \nFrancis Cropsey, the foundation has donated numerous works to \nsignificant institutions including the White House, the U.S. Department \nof State, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Yale University, Princeton \nUniversity, and other domestic and international fixtures.\n  Following the ``Eagle'' exhibit, the Newington-Cropsey Foundation has \noffered the sculpture for permanent placement on the Capitol Grounds.\n  At this time I would like to submit a resolution that will accept \nthis gift from the Newington-Cropsey Foundation and urge that the \nSenate pass it expeditiously.\n         senate resolution 167--congratulating cal ripken, jr.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Robb) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRichard Tissiere, an outstanding New Jerseyan, \n\n[[Page S 12871]]\nwho is being honored this week for his dedication and service to the \nlabor movement.\n  Mr. President, Richard Tissiere has had a long and successful career \nas a labor leader in my State of New Jersey. Currently he is president \nand business manager for the Laborers' Union Local 472 of the AFL-CIO.\n  Mr. Tissiere's contributions to the union began when he joined the \nlocal in 1952. He worked as a laborer, shop steward, and foreman, and \nhe continued to serve the local when he was elected in 1964 to Local \n472's executive board. The local recognized his talents and commitment \nwhen he was elected president in 1976, and when he was chosen as union \nbusiness manager in 1983. Finally, in 1990, he was acknowledged for his \ndevotion to the labor movement when he was appointed to the New Jersey \nAFL-CIO Executive Board as its vice president.\n  Mr. Tissiere has also undertaken other projects that have benefited \nthe labor movement in New Jersey. He has been actively involved as a \ncharter member for the New Jersey Alliance for Action and the Project \nBuild Labor Management Committee. For his accomplishments with the \nAlliance for Action, he was honored as a recipient of the alliance's \nEagle Award.\n  In recognition of Mr. Tissiere's work to improve the labor movement, \nhe was appointed to serve on Senator Bradley's Labor Advisory \nCommittee. While serving on the committee, he was able to display his \nleadership and push forward a positive agenda for both the committee \nand the labor movement. In 1991, Mr. Tissiere was further recognized by \nthe Governor's office when he was presented with the Peter J. McGuire \nLabor Excellence Award, one of the Governor's annual Pride of New \nJersey awards.\n  Not only has Mr. Tissiere made outstanding contributions to the labor \nmovement, but he has actively contributed his time and effort to many \npublic service endeavors. He served in the U.S. Navy, and has provided \nassistance to the Ironbound Boys and Girls Club in Newark, where he \nserved on the board of advisers. He continues his contributions to his \ncommunity by serving as an active member on the Task Force for Women in \nConstruction.\n  Mr. President, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Richard \nTissiere for his many contributions to the labor movement in New \nJersey, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12870-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        ETHICS COMMITTEE'S RESOLUTION REGARDING SENATOR PACKWOOD\n\n   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday, I voted to support \nthe Ethics Committee's resolution recommending that Senator Packwood be \nexpelled from the U.S. Senate.\n  Expulsion meets the criteria I set forth for myself in evaluating \nthis case when I was appointed to the Ethics Committee almost 3 years \nago. That criteria is straightforward.\n  First, that the victims' complaints be taken serious and given value. \nThat the women who came forward be given a fair shake, and, that they \nbe treated with respect and with dignity. And, second, that we clearly \ndemonstrate that the Senate could demonstrate that it could police its \nown. And that the Ethics Committee would process this with honor and \nbring honor to the U.S. Senate.\n  I believe the committee resolution meets these criteria. The \ncommittee of which I am a member carefully reviewed the evidence and \nfound substantial credible evidence that Senator Packwood's conduct was \nan abuse of his position, an abuse of power and that he brought \ndishonor upon the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Packwood has shown a flagrant disregard for the victims, the \nSenate, and for the citizens of Oregon. His conduct is a systematic \nabuse of women, power, and this institution.\n  He has made at least 18 unwanted, unwelcome sexual advances on women. \nHe intentionally obstructed the committee's inquiry by tampering with \nhis diary. He asked lobbyists for jobs for his wife to reduce his \nalimony payments. His offenses taken cumulatively, and even \nindividually, are unacceptable.\n  By any standard, in any workplace in the United States of America, he \nwould have been fired for this. I voted to fire Senator Packwood from \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  For me the past 34 months have been extraordinary. When then Majority \nLeader George Mitchell asked me to serve on the Ethics Committee, I \nknew that I would be the only woman on the Ethics Committee.\n  I was willing to assume that role. I knew it was a special \nresponsibility and a special duty. I knew I had a duty to the Senate. I \nknew I had a duty to the victims and I knew I had a duty to the women \nof America.\n  I wanted to be sure that I was a voice for women. Not only for the \nvictims whose voices I wanted to be heard, I also wanted to be a voice \nfor women in how they are treated in a workplace.\n  I wanted to be a voice for women who are victims in situations of \nsexual assault where often they themselves are doubly victimized. \nFirst, by the assailant and then by the very process of prosecution.\n  I also wanted to be sure that I was a voice that women's concerns \nwould not be minimized, trivialized, or disregarded. I believe that I \nworked to fulfill that responsibility. I articulated this throughout \nthe ethics process on the Packwood matter.\n  I articulated this to the men of the committee and those men have \nstepped up and honored that responsibility. I want to thank the men of \nthe Ethics Committee for the role that they played in giving value, \nworth, and voice and a fair shake to the women who came forward on this \nthe very first case in the U.S. Senate involving victims.\n  I also want to thank the women of Oregon for their patience. For it \nis those women who stood by the Ethics Committee in these 34 months and \nplaced their trust in the institutional processes of the U.S. Senate.\n  I think when our vote was taken yesterday that the Senate showed that \nwe could police our own. So, now the work of the Ethics Committee has \nbeen completed.\n  This is a sad day for the Senate, but I am glad that Senator Packwood \nhas written his own final chapter and ended his Senate career with \ndignity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/07/senate-section/article/S12871-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1995\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
