Mr. President, today, I begin a series of remarks to \ncelebrate the sesquicentennial of my home State of Iowa. It is my \nintention to say something on the history of Iowa, building up to the \nopening of the Smithsonian Institution's Festival of American Folklife \non June 26. This year the festival celebrates Iowa.\n  So, I wish to inform my colleagues that they will shortly be \nreceiving an invitation from the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the \nIowa congressional delegation to attend a birthday party for Iowa. We \nwill host the birthday party on June 26 from 6:30 until 8:30 at the \nCentennial Building of the Smithsonian located next to the Smithsonian \nCastle. I hope to see many of you as we enjoy cake and ice cream along \nwith the other invited guests, including the President, Vice-President, \nCabinet members, Supreme Court Justices, and foreign diplomatic corps. \nMany Iowa-based businesses will also be there. As a matter of fact, \neven the Maytag repairman, the loneliest man in town, may be there.\n  James K. Polk was our President when, on December 28, 1846, Iowa was \nadmitted into the Union as the 29th State. But our history began long \nbefore that date. Before the coming of settlers from the East, Iowa was \nhome to almost 17 different tribes of Indians over the years. Tribal \nnames included the Ioway, Sauk, Sioux, Potawatomi, Oto, Missouri, and \nMesquaki. The Mesquaki still live in Iowa on the Mesquaki Settlement in \nTama County, which is some of the tribe's original land. This is a \nunique situation because this land is a settlement, not a reservation. \nIt is comprised of land, now approximately 3,200 acres, which the tribe \nbought and owns outright.\n  Iowa is a very fertile land, with deep black soil and plentiful \nwater. Little did the French explorers Louis Joliet and Father Jacques \nMarquette know when they came ashore in eastern Iowa from their \nMississippi River travels in 1673 that this patch of land would become \na modern-day international agricultural giant. Mr. President, 323 years \nlater, Iowans proudly help to feed the world.\n  It is interesting to note that since 1880, Iowa has remained No. 1 in \npork production in the United States. As Don Muhm, former Des Moines \nRegister agriculture writer and very good friend of mine, writes in his \nbook ``Iowa Pork & People,'' the peak in Iowa hog farms came in 1935, \nwhen swine was raised on 185,215 farms in the State. This dropped to \n33,000 farms in Iowa in 1993. As I have proudly stated on this floor \nmany times before, 1 in 4 pigs in the United States lives in my home \nState of Iowa. And 78 percent of this country's grain-fed beef is \nraised in Iowa. In 1991, Iowa ranked first in the Nation in the \nproduction of red meat. Last year, in 1995, Iowa had the honor of \nranking No. 1 in the Nation in the production of both corn and \nsoybeans.\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\n  The good soil and abundance of good water are key to Iowa's \nagricultural productivity. There are numerous rivers and streams in the \nState. While Iowa ranks 30th in the United States by size of population \nand 23d in terms of size in land area, Iowa ranks 5th in the United \nStates in the number of bridges needed to cross those rivers and \nstreams. There are 24,844 bridges in Iowa.\n  Getting our products, both agricultural and nonagricultural, to \nmarket takes good roads. Iowa has more miles of road than 40 of the \nother States.\n  From the time the first official settlement began in Iowa in June \n1833 to the present day, Iowans have proven themselves to be an \nindustrious and blessed people. Our history is as rich as our land. We \nare proud to be Iowans, and we are proud to be Americans. During the \nupcoming days I will continue my talks on Iowa, hoping to impart to you \nand to the Nation a small part of something that is almost too big to \ndescribe--the Iowa spirit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah, [Mr. Hatch], is now \nrecognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5705-6", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5706-S5707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CODDLE-A-CONVICTED-CRIMINAL CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, an administration's law enforcement \nphilosophy manifests itself in many ways. I have spoken several times \nabout soft-on-crime Clinton administration judges. President Clinton \nhas been AWOL--absent without leadership--in the war on drugs. After \nyears of declining use the drug problem is on the rise--on President \nClinton's watch. Today, I want to speak about the Clinton coddle-a-\nconvicted-criminal program.\n  The President is responsible for protecting the constitutional rights \nof convicted criminals incarcerated in State prisons. This is pursuant \nto the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, sometimes called \nCRIPA, an act that I cast the deciding vote on and was prime cosponsor \nof, along with Senator Birch Bayh, many years ago, in the 1970's.\n  Convicted criminals do have some constitutional rights; but, \nunderstandably, those rights are very sharply circumscribed. And, to my \nmind, the Clinton administration, takes a very liberal view of these \nrights, and reads the rights of the accused and of convicted criminals \nmore favorably than many of the rest of us.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration has asserted a number of \ninstances where the constitutional rights of some of the most vicious \ncriminals at the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center, known as \nSupermax, are allegedly being violated. I cite a letter of Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights Deval L. Patrick, to Gov. Parris N. \nGlendening, May 1, 1996. I want to focus on some of these alleged \nconstitutional deprivations, or at least what the Clinton \nadministration calls alleged deprivations of prisoners' rights.\n  I remind colleagues that Supermax was constructed to house inmates \nwho by their own conduct create public safety justification for removal \nfrom traditional correctional facilities. Supermax inmates require \nclose custody and a high level of supervision. Among the inmates at \nSupermax are 105 murderers, 19 rapists, and those who have histories of \nescape or attempted escape.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues and others who are listening \npause and brace themselves for the unconstitutional deprivations to \nwhich Maryland is allegedly subjecting these murderers, rapists, and \nother hardened criminals.\n  Now, is the Clinton administration citing the State of Maryland \nbecause it beats the convicts at Supermax? No. Is the Clinton \nadministration citing Maryland because it tortures or starves these \nvicious criminals? No.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration is citing the State of \nMaryland, in part, because ``food is served lukewarm or cold'' to these \nmurderers and rapists. Doesn't your heart just bleed for these \nmurderers and rapists and other criminals? They are getting their food \nserved lukewarm or cold. The Clinton administration makes a Federal \ncase out of it. President Clinton is forcing Maryland taxpayers \nto defend against this ridiculous constitutional claim. This is the \nevolving standard of decency in the hands of liberals wielding the vast \npower of the all-mighty Federal Government. It is an abuse of Federal \npower on behalf of murderers and rapists; that is, the administration's \nposition in this matter.\n\n  If you do not believe me, Mr. President, let me read you the relevant \nparagraph from page 5 of the Clinton administration's May 1 letter:\n\n       Food served to the prisoners at Supermax is prepared at the \n     penitentiary across the street and brought to Supermax in \n     bulk. At Supermax, the food is placed into individual \n     compartmentalized thermal trays for distribution to the \n     prisoners in their cells. Food placed in the trays is not \n     promptly covered; trays brought to the housing units are not \n     promptly served. As a result, food is served lukewarm or \n     cold. Food must be served at temperatures that conform to \n     accepted health standards.\n\n  CRIPA, or the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, requires \nonly enforcing the constitutional minimum. Instead, the Clinton \nadministration makes a Federal case out of it, advancing a \nconstitutional right for hardened, convicted murderers and rapists, so \nvicious and dangerous as to need special supervision, to have their hot \nfood served hot, not lukewarm or cold.\n  This is nothing but a Clinton coddle-a-convicted-criminal approach. I \nmight say a convicted-vicious-criminal approach. The Clinton \nadministration is forcing the taxpayers of Maryland to pay the cost of \nresponding to its ridiculous demand.\n  That is not all. The Clinton administration insists that Maryland \nprovide these killers and rapists 1 hour of out-of-cell time daily. At \nleast five times per week, this out-of-cell activity should occur \noutdoors, weather permitting. Again, from the letter of Mr. Patrick. \nThat is right Mr. President, the hardened criminals who are the worst \nof the worst, who require special supervision, have a constitutional \nright to fresh air, to go outdoors. This does not represent law and \norder. This is the coddling of vicious criminals.\n  Here is how the Clinton administration describes general conditions \nat Supermax:\n\n       Inmates at Supermax are subjected to extreme social \n     isolation. Inmates are confined to single person cells 24 \n     hours a day, except for a brief period (less than an hour) \n     every 2 to 3 days when they are permitted, one at a time, \n     out of their cells to shower and walk around a dayroom \n     area. Inmates are not permitted outdoors due to staff \n     shortages. Inmates eat all of their meals in their cells. \n     Food trays are passed through a narrow food port in a cell \n     door, solid except for a vision window. Inmates are not \n     allowed to participate in any prison job opportunities or \n     any other prison recreational or educational programs. No \n     recreational equipment is provided. Inmates in adjoining \n     cells can hear but not see each other. The sole \n     opportunity for socialization occurs during the out-of-\n     cell time, when the inmate released from his cell may \n     socialize with other inmates on his block, who are locked \n     behind their cell doors.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Supermax' failure to provide sufficient out-of-cell time on \n     a daily basis as well as its failure to provide any \n     opportunity to go outdoors is unconstitutional, especially \n     given the highly restrictive regimen of daily life at \n     Maryland Supermax.\n\n  Is it any wonder Supermax inmates are isolated? These prisoners have \nbeen removed from traditional maximum security prisons as a result of \ntheir own conduct.\n  But the Clinton administration's heart just bleeds for these \nhardened, convicted criminals. Pity the inmates at Supermax. Joe the \nmurderer does not have enough time to socialize, schmooz, and compare \nnotes with Harry the murderer and rapists Ben and John. Does your heart \nnot just bleed for these criminals, Mr. President? These model citizens \ndo not get to jump on an exercise bike. So let us sue Maryland. Let us \nestablish a constitutional right for convicted murderers and rapists to \nsocialize with one another. Again, I stress, these are not merely \nmaximum security prisoners. These prisoners at Supermax are the worst \npeople in the Maryland prison system.\n\n  It is true that some courts, including the fourth circuit decision \nthe Clinton administration relies upon, have ruled that ``generally a \nprisoner must be provided some opportunity to exercise'' under the \neighth amendment, but that is in general. Mitchell v. Rice, 954 F.2d \n187, 192]. Even the total deprivation of\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\nall exercise does not always violate the cruel and unusual punishment \nclause. According to the cited fourth circuit precedent, there is no \nper se rule requiring a minimum of exercise time in all cases. The \nissue turns on the particular circumstances.\n  Moreover, the Clinton administration's misleading reading of fourth \ncircuit precedent favorable to the murderers and rapists of Supermax \nnotwithstanding, the Mitchell versus Rice case does not suggest that \nthere is a constitutional right for these prisoners to go out of doors.\n  Under the circumstances at Supermax; namely, the nature of the \ndangerous criminals locked up there, and their need for close \nsupervision, the Clinton administration should let Supermax afford \nthese inmates the brief time out of their cells every second or third \nday that the administration finds constitutionally objectionable. If \nMaryland correctional authorities want to provide more out of cell \ntime, that should be in their discretion.\n  And I certainly believe the Clinton administration ought to drop its \nposition that these particular murderers, rapists, and other closely \nsupervised criminals, have a constitutional right to fresh air. Many, \nif not all, of the murderers in this group are lucky to be breathing \nindoor air at all, which is more than their victims are doing right \nnow, I might add.\n  With respect to hot food, out-of-cell exercise time, and access to \nfresh air, the Clinton administration is seeking extraconstitutional \nconveniences and comforts for convicted criminals who do not deserve \nthem.\n  The lesson is this: an administration's crime policies are a web of \nmany factors. They include, for example, the kind of judges a President \nwill appoint. They include the prosecutorial policies of an \nadministration, its outlook on the drug problem and how to combat it. \nAnd they include the manner in which the constitutional rights of the \naccused and of convicted criminals are assessed.\n  A more liberal administration such as the incumbent administration \nwill wind up, on balance, softer on crime. A conservative \nadministration will be tougher on crime. And a conservative \nadministration will not abuse its power by trying to coerce States into \ncoddling convicted murderers and rapists.\n  Mr. President, the criminal justice system in this country has not \nbeen run very well. We should do everything in our power--the first \ntime people are convicted--for people we really can rehabilitate, whose \nlives we can change. Rehabilitation is a very important part of this.\n  But, by gosh, we have no room for coddling these convicted murderers \nand rapists. We have no room for that. And to have this administration \nstart to demand that they coddle these criminals and file lawsuits \nagainst States and have the taxpayers pay for the coddling of \ncriminals--I am not just talking about criminals, but the most hardened \ncriminals in America--I think is not only highly unusual with regard to \nthe way I look at things, and I think most people in this country look \nat things, but it is typical for some of these more liberal thinkers \nwho basically never blame the criminals for what they do, always blame \nsociety for not having helped them enough in these formative years.\n  The fact of the matter is, there is a word called ``responsibility.'' \nWe have to start requiring people to be responsible in our society even \nthough they may have come from the wrong side of the tracks. Many \npeople grew up on the other side of the tracks, in extremely difficult \ncircumstances, and overcame those circumstances without turning to \ncrime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in its capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Ohio, suggests the absence of a quorum. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5706-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5707-S5708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate and House of Representatives \nhave an excellent chance to complete action this week on the Health \nInsurance Reform Act--if Senators and Representatives are willing to \nput aside partisanship and Presidential politics and act in the public \ninterest.\n  This legislation is what the American people need and deserve. If it \nwere sent to the President today it would be signed into law tomorrow. \nBut it has been languishing in Congress for several weeks, primarily \nbecause some Republicans insist that the bill must also include a \nhighly controversial provision on medical savings accounts.\n  Senator Dole has said on several occasions that he would like to \nachieve final action on this legislation before he leaves the Senate. \nIf Senator Dole is serious about such action, it is difficult to \nbelieve he cannot make it happen. We can break the logjam this week and \npass a bill that both Republicans and Democrats can be proud of.\n  The consensus reforms in this legislation are essential and long \noverdue. Twenty-five million Americans a year will benefit from its \nprovisions. The legislation eliminates the worst abuses of the current \nhealth insurance system. Under the current system, millions of \nAmericans are forced to pass up jobs that would improve their standard \nof living or offer them greater opportunities, because they are afraid \nthey will lose their health insurance. Many other Americans abandon the \ngoal of starting their own business, because health insurance would be \nunavailable to them or members of their families. Still other Americans \nlose their health insurance because they become sick or lose their job \nor change their job, even when they have paid their insurance premiums \nfor many years.\n  With each passing year, the pitfalls in private health insurance \nbecome more serious. More than half of all insurance policies impose \nexclusions for preexisting conditions. As a result, insurance is often \ndenied for the very illnesses most likely to require medical care. No \nmatter how faithfully people pay their premiums, they often have to \nstart over again with a new exclusion period if they change jobs or \nlose their coverage. Some 81 million Americans have illnesses that \ncould subject them to exclusions for preexisting conditions if they \nlose their current coverage. Sometimes, the exclusions make them \ncompletely uninsurable.\n  The reforms that passed the Senate 100 to 0 last April deal with each \nof these problems. Insurance companies are limited in their power to \nimpose exclusions for preexisting conditions. No exclusion can last for \nmore than 12 months. Once persons have been covered for 12 months, no \nnew exclusion can be imposed as long as there is no gap in coverage, \neven if they change their job, lose their job, or change insurance \ncompanies.\n  The bill requires insurers to sell and renew group health policies \nfor all employers who want coverage for their employees. It guarantees \nrenewal of individual policies. It prohibits insurers from denying \ninsurance to those who move from group to individual coverage. It \nprohibits group health plans for excluding any employee based on health \nstatus. Individuals with coverage under a group plan will not be locked \ninto their job for fear they will be denied coverage or face a new \nexclusion for a preexisting condition.\n  The bill will also help small businesses provide better and less \nexpensive coverage for their employees. Purchasing cooperatives will \nenable small groups and individuals to join together to negotiate lower \nrates. As a result, they can obtain the kind of clout in the \nmarketplace currently available only to large employers.\n  There is nothing radical or extreme about these provisions. They were \nincluded in every proposal, Republican or Democratic, introduced in the \nlast Congress, including Senator Dole's, When it became clear in 1994 \nthat President Clinton's comprehensive health reform bill could not be \nenacted into law, Senator Dole said that we should simply pass the \nthings we all agree on. As he stated in August 1994 on the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n       We will be back . . . And you can bet that health care will \n     be near the top of our agenda. There are a lot of plans and \n     some have similarities. Many of us think we ought to take all \n     the common parts of these plans, put then together and pass \n     that bill.\n\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n\n  A week later, Senator Dole described those common parts--provisions \nto help Americans who cannot afford insurance, who cannot get insurance \nbecause of preexisting conditions, or who cannot keep insurance due to \na job change.\n  The bill that Senator Kassebaum and I introduced in 1995 followed \nthat suggestion. It included only those reforms that had broad \nbipartisan support in the last Congress. We agreed to oppose all \ncontroversial provisions--even provisions we would support under other \ncircumstances.\n  With Senator Kassebaum's leadership, the legislation was approved by \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee by a unanimous vote. By \nthe time it was debated on the Senate floor, it had 66 cosponsors--28 \nRepublicans and 38 Democrats--ranging from the most conservative \nMembers of the Senate to the most liberal.\n  When the bill was taken up by the full Senate, Senator Dole and \nSenator Roth offered an amendment that had many constructive, \nnoncontroversial provisions which strengthened the bill--fairer tax \ntreatment for small businesses, deductibility for long term care \nexpenses, tax relief for the terminally ill, and provisions to crack \ndown on fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. Senator Kassebaum and I \nwelcomed these provisions and accepted them.\n  But their amendment also included medical savings accounts, a \nproposal that would kill the bill. Fortunately, the Senate decisively \nrejected that proposal, and the amended bill, without medical savings \naccounts, passed the Senate unanimously.\n  Since then, unfortunately, a major impasse has developed over this \nissue. If the impasse can be resolved, the bill will pass. If not, the \nbill will die. Our best chance to resolve the impasse is now--this \nweek. Senator Dole wants the bill to pass before he leaves the Senate, \nand other Republicans are unlikely to reject a genuine request for \naction from their party's leader. Once Senator Dole is gone, the \nprospects of ending the impasse are much more bleak.\n  Reasonable compromises are easily within our grasp on medical savings \naccounts. It is irresponsible for Republicans to hold the other \nbipartisan reforms in this bill hostage, if they can't get their way on \nmedical savings accounts.\n  What happens to this bill is not going to make a difference in the \noutcome of the 1996 Presidential election. But it will make a \ndifference, a very large difference, to the 25 million Americans who \nwill benefit immensely from these needed health reforms. If we keep our \neyes on them--if we keep those deserving families in communities across \nAmerica uppermost in our minds, this bill will pass.\n  It is also clear who will get the blame if this bill dies. To kill \nthis entire bill because they can't get all they want on medical \nsavings accounts would be a flagrant and despicable abuse of power by \nthe Republican Party--and the American people should vote accordingly \nin the elections in November.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5707-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5708-S5709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SEBASTIAN J. ``BUSTER'' RUGGERI\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

He was born in 1914, 4 years \nafter his parents arrived in Greenfield from Sicily, and grew up \ndelivering groceries for his family's business. He went on to graduate \nfrom Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1936, and Boston University \nLaw School in 1939.\n  In 1942, after practicing law for several years, Buster joined the \nAir Force. He spent 3 years as a lawyer in the service, working his way \nup from private to lieutenant colonel and retiring as head judge \nadvocate for a base of 40,000 service members in India.\n  After the war, Buster joined the Air Force Reserve squadron based in \nGreenfield. He became commander of 85 men, retiring as lieutenant \ncolonel after 22 years.\n  After this outstanding service to the Nation, Buster focused his \nattentions once again on the private practice of law. He quickly became \nknown as the dean of the county's legal community. He is one of the \nbrightest, most dedicated, and effective trial lawyers in western \nMassachusetts. His passion and knowledge of the law and his commitment \nto justice led to a remarkably successful legal career.\n  Buster's interests extend to many other areas. He is a leading member \nof the Greenfield and Franklin County Democratic Committees. No Kennedy \nhas ever gone to Franklin County without Buster's advice, assistance, \nand friendship. He used to hold strategy sessions for my brother during \nhis campaign for President in 1960, and he's been a valuable friend and \nadviser to me throughout my years in the Senate.\n  In addition to these commitments, Buster always made time for \ncommunity service. He is a longtime member of the Lions Club and the \nElks Club, and served as deputy director for the Elks. Buster is also a \ndistinguished member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American \nLegion. His professional achievements also include serving as president \nof the Massachusetts Trial Lawyers Association and the Franklin County \nBar Association.\n  I congratulate Buster on his remarkable career, and I wish him well \nas he continues his unique leadership for his profession, his \ncommunity, and his country. I ask unanimous consent that a recent \narticle on Buster's extraordinary life be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 A ``Colorful Pisan'' in the Courthouse\n\n                         (By Russell G. Haddad)\n\n       Greenfield.--By all accounts over the past half century \n     observers could usually tell when attorney Sebastian J. \n     ``Buster'' Ruggeri didn't have a strong case.\n       The demonstrative and gregarious Ruggeri never flinched \n     from a weak hand. He would create a diversion from the facts \n     of a case by waving his hands about and performing some \n     theatrics.\n       ``If he didn't have a strong case he would about at the \n     jury,'' recalled former District Court Judge Allan McGuane \n     could hear him from two floors away,\n       John A. Barrett, Franklin County's register of probate, \n     recalls a time when Ruggeri had a 2 p.m. appointment in \n     probate court, but called to say he would be late. He showed \n     up 15 minutes late but has spent the previous hours appearing \n     in courts in Boston, Worcester and Springfield before \n     arriving in Franklin County,\n       It's just this kind of drive that over the years has earned \n     Ruggeri, still practicing full time at 82, a reputation as an \n     energetic trial lawyer who would take cases nobody else \n     wanted.\n       Ruggeri--considered the dean of the country's legal \n     community--still seems tireless. The self-described \n     ``colorful pisan'' began practicing law in 1939, and seemed \n     to thrive on crisis and providing that he could win despite \n     the odds, his long-time associates say.\n       ``In the courtroom you could feel his presence,'' Barrett \n     said. ``He commanded the attention of everybody.''\n       Ruggeri, meanwhile, looks back on his legal career and \n     takes pride in never doing anything halfway. He was a general \n     practitioner, researching while, handling divorces, doing \n     worker compensation cases, but also handled criminal cases, \n     as serious as murder, and civil actions\n       ``I was always intense in my practice and tried to treat \n     everyone fairly,'' said Ruggeri.\n       He said his family nickname--first was used by his parents \n     when they called him for dinner--was always ``Busty'' but \n     became ``Buster'' when Sen. Edward Kennedy call him that \n     years ago.\n       In his heyday, Ruggeri was known as one of the most \n     imaginative and hardworking trial lawyers in western \n     Massachusetts,\n       ``I could always express myself,'' he said smiling. ``I'm \n     at home being up front.''\n       His style worked in what Ruggeri describes as his most \n     memorable trial--a 1975 murder case in which he defended \n     Ernest W. Morran. Ruggeri in his closing statement hammered \n     away at the prosecution's case slamming his fist on the \n     jury box.\n       He ended his remarks reciting a Robert Frost poem to \n     reinforce his argument that police had ignored Morann's \n     version of what happened and arrested the wrong man in \n     Ashfield woods on a snowy night in November 1974.\n\n     ``Two roads diverged in a yellow wood And sorry I could not \n           travel both\n     And be one traveler, long I stood\n     And looked down one as far as I could\n     Two where it bent in the undergrowth.''\n\n     As if he were there today, Ruggeri finished:\n\n     ``Two roads diverged into a wood and I . . .''\n     ``. . . took the one less traveled by,\n     And that has made all the difference.''\n\n       Ruggeri explained that he learned early on in his career \n     that he could sway juries by performing an impassioned plea. \n     He had to convince the jurors that he believed in his client.\n       ``You have become a part of it,'' Ruggeri said. ``I just \n     about live it.''\n       Attorney John Callahan, who was a Northwest District \n     Attorney from 1970 to 1978 and\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\n     faced off against Ruggeri on many occasions, said he was \n     impressed with Ruggeri many, many times.\n       ``He was bright. He was tenacious. He was very effective,'' \n     Callahan said.\n       He recalled the Morran case, for which he was the \n     prosecuting attorney. He said it stands out as a prime \n     example of Ruggeri's skills and tenacity. Callahan said \n     Ruggeri did an ``unbelievable job'' in cross-examining a \n     pathologist testifying for the prosecutors.\n       The key to Ruggeri's success was preparation by hiring a \n     pathologist of his own to inspect the evidence and guide him, \n     according to Callahan.\n       ``As far as I'm concerned it was one of the best jobs that \n     Sebastian ever did,'' he said. ``Sebastian could try a case \n     off the top of his head but seldom did when it was a serious \n     matter. As he always did, he gave his heart and soul to the \n     trial as he did with many others.''\n       Ruggeri was born in 1914, about four years after his \n     parents, Anthony and Rose, moved here from Sicily. His mother \n     and father, who worked for the Boston & Maine railroad in the \n     East Deerfield yards never had any formal education but went \n     on to build a successful grocery business, A. Ruggeri & Sons.\n       The oldest of four cones--he also has an older sister--\n     Ruggeri later helped in this business delivering groceries. \n     He has fond memories of those times when his mother would \n     give cookies to neighborhood children and the market was a \n     meeting place to talk about politics and the various \n     happenings in town.\n       ``People used to come in and chew the fat for an hour,'' \n     Ruggeri said with a sparkle in his eye.\n       But above all else, his greatest impression of those days \n     was his father, who opened the store in the 1920's in the \n     basement of their house Deerfield Street house. Ruggeri said \n     his father would work practically all day, yet, have time to \n     instill morals and values in his children.\n       ``I think the world of my Daddy,'' Ruggeri said \n     affectionately. ``Me parents were next to God.''\n       However, he didn't always move in the direction his father \n     and mother wanted. On graduating from Greenfield High School, \n     Ruggeri attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1936, \n     earning a civil engineering degree. While his parents wanted \n     him to become an engineer, he has designs on a legal career \n     and eventually went to Boston University Law School and \n     graduated in 1939.\n       ``I thought engineering would be too quiet,'' the fragile-\n     looking, but strong-willed Ruggeri recalled.\n       After three years of practicing law, Ruggeri joined the Air \n     Corp in 1942. He spent the subsequent three years in the \n     service, quickly working his way up from private to \n     lieutenant colonel, retiring as head judge advocate for a \n     base of 10,000 men in India.\n       After the war, he joined the 9286th Air Force Reserve \n     Squadron, based in Greenfield. He later became commander of \n     85 men, retiring as a lieutenant colonel after 22 years.\n       A conversation about Ruggeri's military experience tends to \n     get a bit dangerous. He becomes animated, excitedly pacing \n     back and forth and swinging his arms as he tells stories of \n     being in officer cadet school and his travels in India in the \n     shadow of the Himalayan Mountains on the Chinese border.\n       Reared on local political gossip at the family store, \n     Ruggeri eventually became a leader in the local and state \n     Democratic Party, befriending the Kennedys and on numerous \n     occasions hosting them at this 13-room James Street home.\n       In his Bank Row offices, photographs of John F. Kennedy and \n     Robert F. Kennedy hang on the walls. A commemorative poster \n     from the 25th anniversary of JFK's assassination is \n     prominently placed in the waiting area just outside Ruggeri's \n     office.\n       U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy personally signed the poster \n     with a message.\n       ``To Buster--who started with Jack and has stood shoulder \n     to shoulder with all the Kennedy brothers--Ted,'' the \n     proclamation reads.\n       Kennedy, in a prepared statement, recently called Ruggeri \n     ``great friend and key supporter'' for more than 40 years \n     going back to JFK's first campaign for the U.S. Senate in \n     1952.\n       ``Ever since, no Kennedy has gone into Franklin County \n     without Buster's advice, assistance and friendship,'' Kennedy \n     said. ``He's made an enormous difference, and I know that \n     Jack and Bob felt the same way.''\n       Ruggeri, who was one of the guests invited to Rose \n     Kennedy's funeral last year, boasts that JFK's run for the \n     presidency began in his office as strategy sessions to take \n     control of the state Democratic Committee were held there. He \n     said he only asked for one job through his ties with Sen. \n     Kennedy--U.S. ambassador to Italy.\n       ``I speak Italian fluently and everything,'' said Ruggeri, \n     who in recent years has been invited to join the Republican \n     Senatorial Inner Circle. ``I could have fun in Italy.''\n       Over the years, Ruggeri acquired much downtown property in \n     Greenfield, becoming the largest single landlord in town. His \n     37 properties include a sizable chunk of Bank Row, part of \n     which is the former First National Bank building. He also \n     owns an empty Federal Street office building as well as \n     several residential properties, the Silver Arrow liquor store \n     on French King Highway and the Ruggeri Shopping Center on \n     Federal Street. He also owns 52 acres on Shelburne Road, \n     which he hopes to sell for possible use as a shopping center.\n       Ruggeri, who started buying real estate soon after he began \n     practicing law, said at one time the properties were \n     considered a badge of honor. Now many of them are vacant and \n     falling into disrepair and he owes more than $130,000 in back \n     taxes.\n       At one time the commercial properties downtown, ``had a \n     certain amount of honor to them,'' he said. ``I've got some \n     temporary burden. I'm hoping 1996 will be better for me.''\n       The life of Franklin County's oldest lawyer has been full \n     of community service. He is a longtime member of the Lions \n     Club and Elks Club, having served as past district deputy for \n     the Elks. He also is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \n     and American Legion organizations. His professional \n     affiliations included being a past president of the \n     Massachusetts Trial Lawyers Association and Franklin County \n     Bar Association. Politically, he is a member of the \n     Greenfield and Franklin County Democratic Committees.\n       Ruggeri and his wife, Margaret, were married 33 years \n     before she died in 1974. They had five children together--\n     Avis, Margaret, Phyllis, Christine and Paul, who died in a \n     1982 car crash.\n       Paul's death still appears to affect Ruggeri as he fondly \n     remembers what his son, and paw partner, meant to him and the \n     firm.\n       ``He was bringing in young clients,'' Ruggeri said. ``My \n     whole plans to turn the office over to him were shot to hell. \n     He had a great future.''\n       Ruggeri's plans to retire and hand the firm to his son had \n     been dashed, and made him push his career forward.\n       McGuane, a former state representative, thinks of Ruggeri \n     as a ``remarkable man.'' He said Ruggeri belongs to the old \n     school of being polite and courteous.\n       ``He's honest. A man of his word,'' McGuane said. ``He \n     always gave his client a full day's work for his pay whether \n     win, or lose or draw.''\n       Over his legal career, Ruggeri said he has had no regrets \n     despite having chances to become a federal judge on several \n     occasions through his association with the Kennedys.\n       ``I always wanted to be a small town lawyer,'' Ruggeri \n     said, ``I had the freedom here.''\n       Hard work has become his trademark.\n       And Ruggeri is still going strong. He received a degree in \n     patent law last summer from Franklin Pierce Law Center in \n     Concord, N.H.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5708-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5709-S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXCELLENCE: A BOYD FAMILY TRADITION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I consider myself to be extremely \nfortunate to have a staff made up of people who are not only excellent \nat what they do, but are bright, interesting, and a pleasure to be \naround.

Married at 15, she gave birth to 14 \n     children and enjoyed a loving marriage of more than 55 years \n     until the passing of her husband last year.\n       While young, she became a Sunday school teacher at Zion \n     Pilgrim Baptist Church. In that position, she instructed \n     church members in reading and writing as well as Bible \n     lessons.\n       Her interest in voting rights began in the 1950s. She \n     regularly encouraged church members and community residents \n     to register to vote, holding sessions on how to do it.\n       She persistently communicated her interest to organizations \n     such as the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People. She once accompanied a group to one of Martin \n     Luther King Jr.'s seminars on voting rights.\n       As a result of her interest, she was appointed in 1967 to \n     the Richland County Board of Voter Registration.\n       She became the first African-American woman to serve as a \n     registrar in South Carolina.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an American \ntragedy. First, Mr. President, too many children in this country are \nspending the most important formative years in a legal limbo, a legal \nlimbo that denies them their chance to be adopted, that denies them \nwhat all children should have: the chance to be loved and cared for by \nparents.\n  Second, we are sending many children in this country back to \ndangerous and abusive homes. We send them back to live with parents who \nare parents in name only, and to homes that are homes in name only. We \nsend these children back to the custody of people who have already \nabused and tortured them. We send these children back to be abused, \nbeaten, and, many times, killed.\n  Mr. President, we are all too familiar with the statistics that \ndemonstrate the tragedy that befalls these children. Every day in \nAmerica--every day--three children actually die because of abuse and \nnegligent at the hands of their parents or caregivers, over 1,200 \nchildren per year.\n  Mr. President, almost half of these children, almost half of them, \nare killed after their tragic circumstances have already come to the \nattention of the local authorities. Tonight, Mr. President, almost \n421,000 children will sleep in foster homes. Over a year's time, \n659,000 will be in a foster home for at least part of the year.\n  Shockingly, roughly 43 percent of the children in the foster care \nsystem at any one time will languish in foster care longer than 2 \nyears. Mr. President, 10 percent will be in foster care longer than 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the number of these foster children is rising. From \n1986 to 1990, it rose almost 50 percent.\n  In summary, Mr. President, too many of our children are not finding \npermanent homes. Too many of them are being hurt, and too many of them \nare dying.\n  Mr. President, most Americans have probably heard of the tragedy that \nbefell Elisa Izquierdo in New York City. Her mother used crack when she \nwas pregnant with Elisa. A month before she was born, her half brother, \nRuben, and her half sister, Cassie, had been removed from her mother's \ncustody and placed into foster care. They had been neglected, \nunsupervised, and unfed for long periods of time. In other words, Mr. \nPresident, this woman left her children alone and simply did not feed \nthem.\n  But then, Mr. President, amazingly, the children were sent back to \nthe same woman, and then Elisa was born. When Elisa was born, she \ntested positive for crack. She was taken from her mother and \ntransferred to her father's custody. Tragically, in 1994, Elisa's \nfather died. Elisa was then 5 years old. The director of Elisa's \npreschool warned officials about the mother's history of child abuse \nand drug abuse. Without any further investigation and without ordering \nany further monitoring of Elisa's home situation, a family court judge \ntransferred Elisa back to her mother.\n  In March 1995, when Elisa was 6 years old, she was admitted to the \nhospital with a shoulder fracture--a shoulder fracture, Mr. President. \nThis is a little girl from a household with a history of child abuse, \nand she shows up at the hospital with a shoulder fracture. What did the \nhospital do? The hospital sent her back to her mother.\n  Eight months later, in November 1995, she was battered to death by \nthat same mother. You see, Elisa's mother was convinced that Elisa was \npossessed by the devil. She wanted to drive out the evil, so she forced \nElisa to eat her own feces, mopped the floor with her head, and finally \nbashed her head against a concrete wall. On November 2, 1995, Elisa was \nfound dead.\n  Mr. President, this story then was on the front page of the New York \nTimes, and for days after that the story was covered. Millions of \nAmericans were, understandably, shocked. But you know, Mr. President, \nwhat shocked me when I read the story, when I heard about it, was that \nanyone would be shocked at all, because the horrible truth is that \nwhile this horrible tragedy captured the attention of the country, the \nsad fact is that atrocities such as this are happening against children \nevery single day in this country. Children are being reunited with \nbrutal abusers. They are abused again and again, and, yes, sometimes \nthey are killed.\n  Here is another story. A Chicago woman had a lengthy history of \nmental illness. She ate batteries, she ate coat hangers, and she drank \nDrano. She stuck pop cans and light bulbs into herself. Twice she had \nto have surgery to have foreign objects removed from her body. Then \nwhen she was pregnant, she denied that the baby was hers. While \npregnant, she set herself on fire. That is her idea of what being a \nparent is all about. On three occasions, her children were taken away \nfrom her by the department of children and family services, known as \nDCFS.\n  One of her children was named Joseph. Joseph's second foster mother--\nkeep in mind that this was a child that was being pushed back and forth \nbetween foster homes, back and forth with his mother. Joseph's second \nfoster mother reported to the DCFS officials that every time Joseph \ncame back from visiting his mother, he had bruises. Yet, in 1993, all \nthe children were returned to this mother--one last time.\n  A month later, in April 1993, this mother hanged Joseph; she hanged \nher little boy. She hanged her 3-year-old son. Her comment to the \npolice was, ``I just killed my child. I hung him.'' She stood him up on \na chair and said, ``bye.'' He said, ``bye.'' Then he waved. And she \npushed the chair away. She hanged this little boy.\n  Mr. President, what kind of a person does something like that to a \nchild? She told a policeman, ``DCFS was'' blankety-blank ``with me.''\n  Mr. President, why on Earth would anyone think we should keep trying \nto reunite that family?\n  Another example. Last year in Brooklyn, NY, there were allegations \nthat baby Cecia Williams and her three older siblings had been \nabandoned by their mother. As a result, they were temporarily removed \nfrom their mother's custody. It turned out they had not been abandoned \nby the mother. She had actually placed them in the care of an uncle, \nand he had abandoned the children.\n  Later, Cecia and the other children were sent back home. Last month, \nafter they were sent back home in New York, Cecia Williams died after \nbeing battered, bruised, and, possibly, sexually abused. Her mother and \nher boyfriend have been charged with the crime.\n\n  Cecia was 9 months old. Cecia is dead today--a victim of blunt blows \nto her torso, and lacerations to her liver and small intestinal area.\n  Another example. A young boy in New Jersey named Quintin McKenzie was \nadmitted to a Newark hospital after a severe beating, for which his \nfather was arrested. Quintin was placed in foster care. But when the \ncharges were dropped, he was sent back to that family. In 1988, Quintin \nwas 3\\1/2\\ years old when his mother killed him. She plunged him into \nscalding water because he had soiled his diapers.\n  In Franklin County, OH, the local children services agency, in \nanother case, was trying to help Kim Chandler deal with her children--\n7-year-old Quiana, 4-year-old Quincy, and 1-month-old Erica. In July \n1992, they closed the case on her. On September 24, 1992, all three \nchildren were shot dead, and Kim Chandler was charged with the crime.\n  In Rushville, OH, in March 1989, 4-year-old Christopher Engle died \nwhen his father dumped scalding water on him.\n  Mr. President, we could go on and on and on. Tragically, there is not \na Member of the Senate who could not cite examples from his or her own \nState of these tragedies. I could multiply example after example of \nhouseholds like these--households that look like families but are not, \nMr. President; people who look like parents, but who are not; people \nwho never, never should be allowed to be alone with any child. I do \nintend, in the months ahead, to discuss many of these stories on this \nfloor, Mr. President.\n\n  Why are atrocities like this happening? There are many factors \ncontributing to this problem. In many cases, the abuse is caused by \nparents who were themselves abused as children. In other cases, the \nparent is deeply disturbed or\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nmentally ill. Often, the parent is a teenager, who is emotionally \nunprepared for the responsibility of raising a child.\n  All of these factors were present in earlier generations. What is \ndifferent today is that too many of the young parents have no role \nmodels of good parenting. They did not have good parents themselves, so \nthey have no idea how to be parents for their own children.\n  Another major problem, Mr. President, is the decline of the extended \nfamily, the support system that used to do so much to make sure \nchildren were taken care of. In many cases, it just does not exist \ntoday.\n  Add to all of this the relatively new phenomenon of crack. Since the \nlate 1980's, we have seen an explosion of this new form of cocaine that \nis readily available, is cheap, and explosively addictive. Crack is so \naddictive that mothers have sold their children so they can get more of \nit. Someone said, when talking about crack, that crack is the only \nthing that has ever been invented by man that will cause a mother to \nbehave not like a mother and abandon all the natural instincts that she \nmight have--to leave that child, sell that child, to abuse that child.\n  Mr. President, put all these factors together and we have a major \nsocial problem on our hands. Now, we ask social workers to try to patch \nup the wounded. But the social workers are underpaid and overworked. \nWhen I was an assistant county prosecutor over 20 years ago, and then \nwhen I was the county prosecutor in Greene County, OH, I worked closely \nwith these dedicated, hard-working social welfare professionals. I have \ngreat respect and admiration for them. They are literally at the front \nline of our efforts to save children. We expect the impossible from \nthem and, frankly, do not give them all the tools and resources they \nneed to do their jobs. Often, the only options they have, and the only \nchoices they have for these children, are all bad--no good options, no \ngood choices.\n  Many times, our social welfare agencies are simply overwhelmed. Some \nexperts say that the social worker handling children ought to handle no \nmore than 15 or 20 cases at a time. But the truth is that we have \nsocial workers today handling 50, 60, 70 cases. They do not have enough \ntime or enough resources to solve the problems these kids have.\n  In summary, Mr. President, there are many causes for the tragedies I \nhave discussed. Further, there are many things that must change, many \nthings that we can do to help these children.\n  There are many things we can do, Mr. President, to lessen the time it \ntakes for children to be adopted, and to lessen the time these poor \nkids have to spend in the legal limbo of the system. Further, there are \nmany things we can do to lessen the odds of tragedies like the cases of \nElisa Izquierdo and Joseph Wallace.\n  Mr. President, I intend to keep working to find solutions to these \nproblems, recognizing that their causes are multiple--and that to solve \nthem, we must do many things.\n  But today, I would like to focus on one of the causes of these \ntragedies, one that most people have not heard about. It is the \nunintended consequence of a small part of a law passed by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare \nAct--known as CWA. The Child Welfare Act has done a great deal of good. \nIt increased the resources available to struggling families. It \nincreased the supervision of children in the foster care system. And it \ngave financial support to people to encourage them to adopt children \nwith special needs.\n  But while the law has done a great deal of good, many experts are \ncoming to believe that this law has actually had some bad unintended \nconsequences.\n  Under the CWA, for a State to be eligible for Federal matching funds \nfor foster care expenditures, the State must have a plan for the \nprovision of child welfare services approved by the Secretary of HHS. \nThe State plan must provide:\n\n       . . . that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made \n     (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to \n     prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from \n     his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return \n     to his home.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular \ncircumstances of a household may be--the State must make reasonable \nefforts to keep it together, and to put it back together if it falls \napart.\n  What constitutes ``reasonable efforts''? Here is where maybe we have \npart of the problem.\n  This has not been defined by Congress. Nor has it been defined by \nHHS.\n  This failure to define what constitutes ``reasonable efforts'' has \nhad a very important--and very damaging--practical result. There is \nstrong evidence to suggest that in the absence of a definition, \nreasonable efforts have become--in some cases--extraordinary efforts. \nEfforts to keep families together at all costs.\n  Mr. President, much of the national attention on the case of Elisa \nIzquierdo has focused on the many ways the social welfare agencies \ndropped the ball. It has been said that there were numerous points in \nthe story when some agency could have and should have intervened to \nremove Elisa and her siblings from her mother's custody.\n  I am not going to revisit that ground. Rather, my point is a broader \none: Should our Federal law really push the envelope, so that \nextraordinary efforts are made to keep that family together--efforts \nthat any of us in this Chamber or anyone listening would not consider \nreasonable?\n\n  Throughout human history, the family has been recognized as the \nbedrock of civilization. The family is where values are transmitted. It \nis where children learn behavior--develop their character--and form \ntheir personality.\n  Over the last couple of years, a remarkable convergence has occurred \nin American social thought. Liberals and conservatives are now in near-\ntotal agreement on the need to strengthen the family as an institution. \nWithout stronger families, it will be impossible to avoid a social \nexplosion in which troubled children turn into dysfunctional adults on \na massive scale.\n  But what we are confronting in the terrible stories I have just \nrecounted are not families. They are households that look like \nfamilies--but are not.\n  If you look inside one of these households, you see some children. \nAnd you see some people who--superficially, at least--resemble parents. \nBut this is not what you and I and most Americans mean when we talk \nabout families.\n  In this type of family when we have heard the horror stories, the \nchildren are beaten and abused and neglected. Mr. President, what do \nwe, as a society, do about these households--these households that are \nnot families?\n  By 1980, the child welfare system in this country had come under some \npretty strong criticism. That is why we have the bill. After many \nhearings, Congress concluded that abused and neglected children too \noften were unnecessarily removed from their parents--and very \nsignificantly that insufficient resources were devoted to the \ncommendable task of preserving and reuniting families--and that \nchildren not able to return to their parents often drifted in foster \ncare without ever finding a permanent home.\n  That is how the CWA came to be enacted. The phenomenon known as \nfoster care drift--children who get lost in a child welfare system that \ncannot or will not find them a permanent home--simply had to be faced \nand reversed.\n  Let me interject at this point, Mr. President, that I had substantial \nexperience on this issue before the passage of the CWA legislation in \n1980. As long ago as 1973, I was serving as an assistant county \nprosecutor in Greene County, OH, and one of my duties was to represent \nthe Greene County Children Services in cases where children were going \nto be removed from their parents' custody.\n  I saw first hand that too many of these cases dragged on forever. The \nchildren end up getting trapped in temporary foster care placements, \nwhich often entail multiple moves from foster home to foster home to \nfoster home, for years and years and years.\n  Congress enacted the CWA to try to solve this very real problem. \nThere were good reasons for the CWA, and the CWA has done a lot of \ngood. There are some families that need a little help if they are going \nto stay together, and it is right for us to help them. Not only is it \nright--it is also clearly in the best interests of the child to reunite \nfamilies when we can.\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes, and \nI apologize to my colleague.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, I would like to see what the \nparliamentary procedure is and ask the Chair to make a ruling. I have \n15 minutes that was assigned to me under the original schedule, and \nalso Senator Leahy. The time is about up. I would not object to the \nrequest from the Senator so he can finish his remarks so long as the \nsame procedure would be afforded to this Senator after he has finished \nhis presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection to the Senator's request?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague. Again I apologize for taking his \ntime and the Senate's time. But I would like to complete. It should not \ntake any more than just a few more moments.\n  We should not be in the position of taking children away just because \nthe parents are too poor--or just because there is a problem in the \nfamily. If the problem can be fixed, we must try to keep the family \ntogether for the children's benefit. It is just that at some point, \nwhen it comes to cases of child abuse and child neglect, we have to \nstep in and say: ``Enough is enough. The child comes first.''\n  And that is where we are now, in a lot of cases. Fifteen years after \nthe passage of the CWA, I think we need to revisit this issue, and see \nhow the system is working in practice.\n  I believe we need to reemphasize what all of us agree on--the fact \nthat the child ought to come first. We have to make the best interests \nof the child our top national priority.\n  In many of the cases we have looked at, it looks like the CWA has \nbeen not been correctly interpreted. At least that is the way it \nappears. Try to imagine what the authors of the CWA--the people who \nstood on this Senate floor and the House floor in 1979 and 1980--what \nwould they have said if they had been asked: ``Should Joseph Wallace be \nsent back to his mother? Should this little Joseph, this little boy, be \nsent back?''\n\n  I cannot believe that anyone would say he should have been sent back. \nAnd I cannot believe that it was the authors' intent that it would take \nplace. I cannot believe that they would say, ``In that case, and in \nevery case, the child must be reunited with the adult at all costs.''\n  No, I don't think so.\n  Reasonable people agree, Mr. President, on one point: Nothing--\nnothing--should take precedence over the best interests of the child. \nIt is common sense. And I think we need to make sure the CWA is \ninterpreted consistently--and correctly--to reflect that common sense.\n  It is my hope that an important new book will spark the national \ndebate that America need to have on this issue. The book is called \n``The Book of David: How Preserving Families Can Cost Children's \nLives,'' by Richard J. Gelles.\n  Dr. Gelles is the director of the Family Violence Research Program at \nthe University of Rhode Island. For years, Dr. Gelles thought children \nshould be permanently removed from their homes only as a last resort, \neven if it meant that the children may spend years moving back and \nforth between birth homes and foster homes. He now says--and I quote:\n\n       It is a fiction to believe one can balance preservation and \n     safety without tilting in favor of parents and placing \n     children at risk.\n\n  He believes that the system is weighted too far toward giving the \nmother and father chance after chance after chance to put their life in \norder--putting the adults first, rather than putting the children \nfirst.\n  Even some social-work professionals will tell you how true this is. \nKrista Grevious, a Kentucky social worker with 21 years of experience, \nsays:\n\n       I think it's probably one of the most dangerous things we \n     have ever done for children.\n\n  Patrick Murphy is the court-appointed lawyer for abused children in \nCook County, Il. He says:\n\n       Increasingly, people in this business do not look at things \n     from the point of view of the child. But the child is the \n     defenseless party here. We've forgotten that.\n\n  In 1993, Murphy published an article in the New York Times that put \nthe problem in historical context. I quote from his article:\n\n       The family preservation system is a continuation of sloppy \n     thinking of the 1960's and 1970's that holds, as an \n     unquestionable truth, that society should never blame a \n     victim. Of course, the children are not considered the \n     victims here. Rather the abusive parents are considered \n     victims of poverty and addiction. This attitude is not only \n     patronizing, it endangers children.\n\n  Marcia Robinson Lowry, head of the Children's Rights Project at the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, sums it up. She says:\n\n       We've oversold the fact that all families can be saved. All \n     families can't be saved.\n\n  Mr. President, let me make this absolutely clear. I think there is \nnothing wrong with giving parents another chance. But we have to make \nsure the child comes first. Is that child going to get a second chance \nat growing up? A second chance to be 4 years old--the age when a \npersonality is already fundamentally shaped?\n  Jann Heffner, the director of the Dave Thomas Foundation for \nAdoption, has a useful way of looking at this problem--the concept of \n``kid days.'' When you are 3 years old, 1 month of experience does a \nlot to the formation of your personality. It is not a month that can be \ntaken for granted, or treated as routine.\n\n  One helpful way of looking at it is this: If you are 50 years old, 1 \nyear is 2 percent of your life. If you are 3 years old, 1 year is one-\nthird of your life.\n  There is some important psychological activity going on with these \nchildren. And every day--every hour--really counts. Lynne Gallagher, \ndirector of the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, says:\n\n       It's as though these people think we can put the kids in \n     the deep freeze for awhile * * * and then pull them out when \n     the parents are ready to parent.\n\n  We all know how crucial those formative years can be.\n  Let me return to the work of Dr. Gelles. He says:\n\n       It is time to face up to the fact that some parents are not \n     capable of being parents, cannot be changed, and should not \n     continue to be allowed to care for children.\n\n  He advocates changes in Federal laws to protect children. He also \nthinks that child-protection officials should move to terminate \nparental rights sooner, thus freeing children for adoption.\n  I think the time is ripe for these changes. In New York City, Mayor \nGiuliani has pledged to shift the city's priorities away from family \npreservation--and toward protecting children from harm.\n  But we need to examine how much of the problem we face is a \nconsequence of Federal law--the lack of precision of the CWA \nlegislation back in 1980. And this is truly a national problem that \nneeds a national response. According to the National Committee to \nPrevent Child Abuse, child abuse fatalities have increased by 40 \npercent between 1985 and 1995.\n  I think there is something the U.S. Congress should do about that. I \nthink we should make it absolutely clear that the best interests of the \nchild are the primary concern of social policy.\n  We need to examine, Mr. President, whether in fact the 1980 Child \nWelfare Act has been misinterpreted--and whether we need to clarify it \nso there can be no misunderstanding of Congress' intent. While family \nreunification is a laudable goal, and should usually be attempted, the \nbest interests of the child should always come first. This, Mr. \nPresident, was the intention of the drafters of the 1980 law. Congress \nshould reaffirm this--by making whatever clarification is necessary in \nthe law.\n\n  To the extent that the 1980 law has been imprecise, ambiguous, and \nunclear, or just misinterpreted, it has contributed to the syndrome in \nwhich children move from child abuse to foster home to child abuse. It \nis time for us to break this cycle--to help children escape their \nabusers and find a permanent home before they have suffered absolutely \nirreparable physical and emotional damage.\n  If we make explicit our commitment to putting the best interests of \nthe child first, in almost all cases that will mean family \nreunification. The best interests of the child are almost always served \nby reuniting and preserving families. But in the cases where family \nreunification is not in the best interest of the child, in those cases \nwe must protect the child. Federal law must be clearly on the side of \nthe child.\n  I intend to introduce--in the near future--legislation that will \nclarify once\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nand for all the intent of Congress on this issue. Congress should stand \nwith the highest values of the American people. And the mind and heart \nof America are crystal clear on this issue: The children come first.\n  When they do not, we, as a society, as Americans, have every right to \nbecome outraged, to get mad--and demand change.\n  I simply conclude by saying we need to look at the best interests of \nthe child. We need to reexamine this law. We need to look at how it is \nactually working.\n  I understand that this may be an uphill battle, that there is a \nreluctance to revisit this. But I think we should revisit it. I think \nwe should look at it, keeping in mind only one thing, what really is in \nthe best interests of children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that four articles on this subject be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Dec. 4, 1995]\n\n                              Tiny Coffins\n\n                            (By Mona Charen)\n\n       Washington.--The death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, \n     allegedly at the hands of her mother, has touched New York as \n     few such cases do. Her funeral was attended by the city's \n     mayor, the state's lieutenant governor and hundreds of \n     mourners who didn't even know her.\n       It mystifies me that some cases of child abuse receive \n     extravagant attention and evoke the tears and guilty \n     questions they ought to arouse. Thousands of others are \n     ignored, their funerals sparsely attended, their files \n     closed, and we never ask how this is possible in a country \n     that calls itself civilized. According to Richard Gelles of \n     the University of Rhode Island, between 1,200 and 1,400 \n     children are killed by their parents or caretakers every year \n     in America. At least half are known to social-service \n     agencies before they die.\n       Elisa Izquierdo had been tormented for a very long time. \n     When she died from a severe beating, her body bore old scars \n     of scores of other injuries. Neighbors recalled hearing her \n     scream in pain and beg her mother not to hurt her. Her \n     cousin, who had sued for custody, revealed that the mother \n     had, among other tortures, forced the child to eat her own \n     feces.\n       The number of New Yorkers who knew of Elisa's suffering but \n     did nothing is astounding. She was being seen regularly by \n     social-service workers at her kindergarten. She was known to \n     the city's Child Welfare Administration and to a private \n     agency that intervenes in troubled families.\n       Social service agencies nationwide complain that they are \n     impossibly overburdened. ``There are people who have 40 \n     cases,'' complained a caseworker to the New York Times. \n     ``They don't have time to go back and make second visits.'' \n     Budget cuts have made it even harder to do their jobs.\n       Who else can intervene?\n       Though I am generally opposed to bureaucracy, preventing \n     child abuse is an exception. Who else but the government can \n     intervene to protect these children? The number of children \n     in foster care is increasing dramatically, from 434,000 in \n     1982 to more than 600,000 today. According to the American \n     Public Welfare Association, 70 percent of those kids enter \n     the system because of abuse, neglect or ``parental \n     conditions'' including drug abuse. In the District of \n     Columbia, social workers don't have enough cars or fax \n     machines to keep abreast of their caseloads. If child \n     protective agencies need more money, they should have it.\n       But the heart of the problem is not money; it is \n     philosophy. Most social-service agencies pursue the goal of \n     ``family preservation.'' Federal money is tied to state \n     efforts to keep biological families together. Children, once \n     removed from abusive homes, are returned again and again. \n     Social workers see their jobs as the provision of \n     ``services'' to parents who abuse their children. In one case \n     the parents of 10 children were hurting some of them. The \n     Child Welfare Administration assigned them a full-time \n     housekeeper, lamenting only that budget cuts forced them to \n     withdraw her after a year or so.\n       Unless social-service agencies nationwide can stiffen their \n     spines, stop thinking of the abusing parents as the victims \n     and focus on terminating parental rights in cases of abuse \n     and neglect, this plague of tiny coffins will continue. There \n     are thousands of would-be adoptive couples ready to provide \n     loving homes for kids who have been abused. Yet the system \n     frustrates them at every turn.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Tampa Tribune, Apr. 21, 1996]\n\n                    Take Children Out of Harm's Way\n\n                             (By Joan Beck)\n\n       Every day at least three children in America die--killed by \n     their parents or caretakers. Often they are also the victims \n     of efforts by child protection agencies to keep families \n     together, whatever the risks.\n       Such a child was David Edwards, dead at the age of 15 \n     months, whose mother, Darlene, 23, called 911 one morning to \n     say her son wasn't breathing. Paramedics arrived quickly and \n     immediately began CPR, inserting a breathing tube into his \n     throat and rhythmically compressing his chest in hopes of \n     keeping blood flowing to his brain.\n       Continuing CPR, the paramedics rushed David to a Rhode \n     Island hospital, where further efforts at resuscitation were \n     futile. An autopsy showed signs of repeated child abuse and \n     suffocation. Investigators found that after David's father, \n     Donald, had left for work, Darlene, who had been working as a \n     prostitute out of their apartment, had entertained a \n     ``trick.'' To keep David quiet, she forcibly held him down \n     and suffocated him.\n       What's chilling is that David was known to be at deadly \n     risk. His parents had earlier lost custody of David's older \n     sister, Marie, because of severe abuse. The state child \n     protective agency had been called twice about David. His \n     father had raged at the caseworker when she tried to check on \n     the child. But the casework plan had been to keep the family \n     together.\n       Questioned after David's funeral, attended only by his \n     grandparents and a state investigator, Darlene was charged \n     with murder. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was \n     sentenced to four years in prison, followed by a long \n     probation.\n       There's nothing new about David's story. Similar tragedies \n     are old stuff in big-city newspapers and on TV stations. Only \n     the names of the children are different.\n       But David shouldn't have died, insists Richard J. Gelles, \n     director of the family violence research program at the \n     University of Rhode Island. Contributing to David's death, he \n     says, are the laws, casework philosophy and public sentiments \n     that keep emphasizing the rights of biological parents and \n     the goal of family preservation.\n       Like David, more than half of the annual toll of 1,200 \n     children killed by parents or caretakers were already known \n     by state or local child protection agencies to be in danger. \n     Their deaths are heartbreaking evidence that current policies \n     and services are failing and must be changed.\n       But the answers don't come easy. The problems are \n     overwhelming the system and getting worse, as dysfunctional \n     families and single-parent homes increase, drug abuse grows \n     and state agencies are dangerously pinched for resources. In \n     his new book, ``The Book of David'' (subtitled ``How \n     Preserving Families Can Cost children's Lives''), Gelles \n     points out the worrisome realities. State and local child \n     protection agencies get almost 3 million reports of abuse and \n     neglect every year; about 38 percent are substantiated. Many \n     charges are dismissed--in part because some child abuse and \n     neglect can be difficult to detect.\n       The caseworkers who must make the life-and-death decisions \n     about which children are actually in danger and how to help \n     them, Gelles says, are typically in their 20s--liberal-arts \n     majors with about 20 hours of training. Part of that training \n     is how to fill out paperwork, and some of it emphasizes \n     keeping families together.\n       But family preservation, however appealing its philosophy \n     and goals, has been dangerously oversold as an answer to \n     child abuse and neglect, Gelles insists--and as cost savings \n     for taxpayers.\n       He urges that the rights of abusing parents be terminated \n     much faster--after no more than a year, for example, for \n     those with drug or alcohol problems who are not making good \n     progress in rehabilitation. He would also end parental rights \n     quickly in cases like David's in which abusing parents have \n     already lost custody of another youngster.\n       Gelles concedes that the foster-care system is overwhelmed \n     with the needs of all the children who should be placed out \n     of their homes for their own safety. But his other solutions \n     only nibble away at the problem.\n       Making endangered children available for adoption at the \n     youngest ages possible gives them the best shot they can have \n     at a safe and benign childhood, Gelles points out. Adoptive \n     parents are easiest to find for babies and toddlers, before a \n     youngster has been permanently damaged emotionally or \n     physically by abuse.\n       Even David's sister was eventually adopted, although she \n     was permanently disabled by her parents' abuse. New parents \n     could easily have been found for David had the rights of his \n     biological parents been terminated, Gelles points out.\n       Gelles also recommends setting up more small residential \n     group homes. He says this setting gives a child the chance to \n     make the long-term attachment to a caring adult that is \n     psychologically essential, although he does not recommend \n     such homes for youngsters under age 3.\n       Most important, every kind of help for abused children must \n     put their safety first, Gelles insists, even at the expense \n     of the rights of biological parents or the benign-sounding \n     goals of family preservation.\n       Better solutions to problems of poverty, unemployment, \n     dangerous neighborhoods, drugs, teen pregnancy, crime and \n     poor schools would also help, Gelles agrees, in hopes of \n     reducing abuse and neglect. Better welfare policies could \n     help families ``where the overriding problems are those of \n     poverty rather than inflicted injury or sexual abuse.''\n       Gelles knows there is no single answer to problems of child \n     abuse. He acknowledges that family preservation efforts do \n     help in some instances, that foster care sometimes fails, \n     that money and public patience run out. But he has done a \n     public service with his insistence that we make the well-\n     being of children the center of our welfare and protection \n     policies--in ways that we don't now.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1996]\n\n                        Adopt a Sense of Outrage\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       After Sister Josephine finished her wrathful remarks about \n     abused children at the spring adoption seminar in a \n     Washington law office, the chairman, former Pennsylvania \n     governor Robert P. Casey, spoke in praise of outrage.\n       ``If you don't have a sense of outrage as a politician, you \n     are not worth a damn. If you have lost it, get out of \n     politics.''\n       He is quite right. Sister Josephine Murphy of the Daughters \n     of Charity told of the grossly abused babies who pass through \n     her hands at St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home in \n     Hyattsville, where she is the administrator. I add, in the \n     interests of full disclosure, that I am a friend and fan of \n     hers and awestruck at her competence. I believe she could run \n     the Defense Department. I am familiar with her views on what \n     she regards as the uneven contest between women and \n     children--she notes with asperity the hullabaloo over rape in \n     contrast to the relatively mild sentences for infanticide.\n       She described graphically the sufferings of the abused, \n     abandoned and neglected; infants who have been burned at an \n     open fire; children raped and assaulted--and sent back to \n     their abusive homes by judges who don't care to know what is \n     happening. She told of a 7-year-old boy who reproached her \n     for sending him home. He warned her that when he grew up he \n     was going to ``go out and kill my mother's boyfriend.'' She \n     had a warning too. ``The money we don't spend protecting \n     children we will have to spend on jails.''\n       The Family Reunification and Preservation Act is the cause \n     of these grotesque practices. The body count of children \n     abused to death in 1995 was 1,271, according to the National \n     Committee to Prevent Child Abuse. Yet in the much-praised \n     adoption reform bills being pushed through Congress in time \n     for Mother's Day, no mention is made of this.\n       The law's folly--requiring social workers to make \n     ``reasonable efforts'' to send a child back to abusive \n     parents--was remarked upon at the seminar by William Pierce, \n     president of the National Council for Adoption. Imagine, he \n     said, if a wife-batterer were brought into court and the \n     judge ordered the wife to return to him while he tried to \n     straighten out.\n       The pendulum has begun to swing the other way, Casey says. \n     Some states have passed laws requiring delinquent parents to \n     improve within a year--or forego their parental rights.\n       Why don't politicians seize on this deadly danger to \n     children? Well, it could be dangerous to them. Douglas \n     Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, a leading \n     authority on child welfare, points out the political \n     trickiness of revising the statute. ``Don't forget,'' he \n     says, ``that six years ago David Dinkins ran for mayor of New \n     York against [Ed] Koch on a charge that he was taking too \n     many black kids away from their families.''\n       Maybe that is why today's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, one of the \n     most astute politicians in the country, is avoiding the issue \n     in the most notorious (and still reverberating) child-abuse \n     horror: the murder of 6-year old Elisa Izquierdo by her \n     mother. Giuliani has created a new child welfare agency and a \n     review panel that issued a voluminous report and suspended \n     two employees involved in the case. But he never came to \n     grips with the crime in the courtroom.\n       Elisa had been in the care of her adoring father. When he \n     died, his sister, Elisa's aunt, applied for custody. But \n     under the Family Reunification Act, the judge gave Elisa into \n     the care of her mad mother. Given that the numerous social \n     workers involved should have been more watchful and more \n     demanding, the mayor should have realized that the tragedy \n     began with the custody award.\n       Beshasrov, who served on the mayor's commission, says the \n     terrible irony is that the judge who made the decision had \n     had Elisa's mother before her when the first custody choice \n     was made. She apparently forgot all about it--and had no \n     lawyer or clerk to remind her, thereby sentencing Elisa to \n     beatings and tortures and eventual death.\n       Too bad Giuliani didn't read ``The Book of David,'' also a \n     true-life tale, by Richard Gelles of the Family Violence \n     Research Program of the University of Rhode Island. Gelles, \n     author of 20 books about child welfare, is currently in \n     Washington, working for Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn) on \n     adoption laws. David, 15 months old, died at the hands of his \n     mother, a part-time prostitute. It was avoidable. His mother \n     had also abused David's older sister, almost to death. Gelles \n     shows the tension in social workers who must work under \n     warring mandates: investigating abusive parents while drawing \n     up plans to reunite them with their endangered children.\n       The policy, Gelles says, comes of ``a persistent \n     unwillingness to put children first.'' It is also the \n     unwillingness of public men to break shibboleths. We as a \n     nation, profess to believe that all mothers are like \n     Whistler's and that a ``family'' can consist of one female, a \n     drug addict and a ``home,'' a drug den. As Casey says, \n     outrage is needed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, May 27, 1996]\n\n                          Two Words That Kill\n\n                         (By Richard J. Gelles)\n\n       What if, by changing two words in a federal law, you could \n     prevent the deaths of hundreds of children each year and also \n     prevent tens or even hundreds of thousands of abused children \n     from being victimized again and again?\n       For 16 years, child welfare policies have been guided by \n     two words: ``reasonable efforts.'' One of the cornerstones of \n     the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (PL 96-\n     272) was the mandate that states make ``reasonable efforts'' \n     to keep or reunite abused and neglected children with their \n     biological parents. This provision was designed to reduce the \n     number of maltreated children placed in foster care. Although \n     reducing the cost of out-of-home placement was certainly a \n     factor behind the reasonable-efforts provision, the major \n     rationale for these two words was the deep-seated belief that \n     children do best when raised by their biological parents and \n     that parents will stop maltreating their children if they are \n     provided with sufficient personal, social and economic \n     resources.\n       There was bipartisan support for the doctrine of reasonable \n     efforts. Conservatives supported it because it was consistent \n     with a family-values approach to social policy. Liberals \n     supported it because it was in the best tradition of the \n     safety net for children and families in need. Child advocates \n     enthusiastically embraced ``reasonable efforts'' because they \n     saw taking children from abusive parents as even more harmful \n     than the abuse, because they felt there was subtle racism in \n     the child welfare system that made minority children more \n     likely to be placed in foster care, and because ``reasonable \n     efforts'' created a new funding stream for a social service \n     system whose funding, in the 1980s, was being restricted or \n     cut.\n       Soon after the adoption of the doctrine of reasonable \n     efforts, family-preservation programs were developed. These \n     provide intensive services, such as parent education, help \n     with housekeeping, and assistance dealing with the \n     bureaucracy, to families deemed at risk of having their \n     children removed. Financially supported and marketed by \n     private foundations such as the Edna McConnell Clark \n     Foundation, embraced by the Children's Defense Fund and the \n     Child Welfare League of America, and ultimately the recipient \n     of $1 billion of federal support, intensive family-\n     preservation programs are touted as able to both preserve \n     families and protect children.\n       But reasonable efforts and intensive family preservation \n     have been a false promise. Child-welfare-agency directors and \n     workers believe that family preservation and child safety can \n     be balanced. Because they believe family-preservation \n     programs are effective, child welfare agencies and workers \n     often make every possible effort to preserve families, even \n     when what they are preserving could hardly be called a family \n     and even when there is no evidence that the parents can or \n     will change their abusive behavior. There have been nearly a \n     dozen scientifically reputable evaluations of intensive \n     family-preservation programs and not one has found that such \n     programs reduce costs, reduce out-of-home placements, or \n     improve child safety. Similarly, research finds that children \n     need a stable, giving caretaker, not necessary a biological \n     caretaker.\n       It is a fiction to believe one can balance preservation and \n     safety without tilting in favor of parents and placing \n     children at risk. More than 1,200 children are killed by \n     their parents or caretakers such year, and nearly half of \n     these children are killed after they or their parents have \n     come to the attention of child welfare agencies. Tens of \n     thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of children are re-\n     abused each year after they or their parents have been \n     identified by child welfare agencies.\n       It is time to replace the words ``reasonable efforts'' with \n     two others: ``child safety.'' It is time to fact up to the \n     fact that some parents are not capable of being parents, \n     cannot be changed, and should not continue to be allowed to \n     care for children. Of course, the change will be a bit \n     difficult than merely substituting two words. There will be \n     howls of protest from advocates who will claim that \n     abolishing ``reasonable efforts'' means that more children \n     will be placed in foster care, thus straining already over-\n     taxed state child welfare budgets. Claims that children are \n     abused or harmed by foster care will also be trotted out, \n     typically without actual research to support such claims. \n     Indeed, some children are harmed in foster care, but research \n     does show that abused children placed out of the home do \n     better in the short and long runs than children left with \n     abusive and neglectful parents. Advocates will also argue \n     that child welfare policy should not be based on child \n     fatalities, because such fatalities are rare. Well, child \n     fatalities are not rare enough. Elisa Izquierdo in New York \n     City, Joseph Wallace in Chicago, and hundreds of other less \n     publicized child fatalities were the direct results of \n     unreasonable efforts to keep children with their abusive \n     biological caretakers. A change in two words will force child \n     welfare agencies to take steps to enhance and speed up \n     adoptions and to consider the use of congregate care \n     facilities (or what some have called ``orphanages'') for some \n     children who have no other safe permanent home.\n       The 1995 report on child fatalities by the U.S. Advisory \n     Board on Child Abuse and Neglect was dedicated to children \n     killed by parents or caretakers and concluded with a \n     recommendation that all child and family programs make child \n     safety a ``major priority.'' Changing two words in welfare \n     reform legislation now before Congress would go a long way \n     toward achieving that goal.\n\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise just to take a moment of the \nSenate's time to alert the membership, and also those who are \ninterested in education, about the President's speech at Princeton \nUniversity, which is taking place at 10:40 today. That will be a very \nimportant speech about this Nation's commitment in the area of higher \neducation. What we are going to see at our universities, over the \nperiod of the next 7 years, is an expansion of the number of students \nby some 12 percent.\n  As we debated the recent budget resolution, there was going to be a \ncontinuing deterioration in the support for the Pell grants. Under the \nproposal that the President is advancing today, effectively what he is \ngoing to be putting before the Congress is a guarantee for continuing \neducation for any high school students who get a B average in their \nsenior year, to go to a community college and be able to put together \nan expanded Pell grant plus some refundable credits so that students \nwill be able to attend community colleges.\n  More than 66 percent of the Nation's community colleges will be \neligible. This, I think, is a strong commitment to provide incentives \nto young people to continue their education. It is a national \ncommitment to make sure that education has the priority that I believe \nmost families believe it should have, in terms of our Nation's \ncommitment.\n  At an appropriate time I will present for the Record a statement and \nadditional comments, but it does seem to me this is a bold initiative \nin the area of education that ought to have appeal to every working \nfamily in this country who dreams about educational opportunities for \nits children.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska and I yield whatever remaining time \nI have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5715-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the unanimous-consent agreement, there \nwill be 2 hours allotted to this issue.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Dole star wars bill the Senate is \ndebating is a reckless and expensive attempt to recreate the nostalgia \nof the cold war through the regrettable and unwarranted use of fear and \nfabrication. Over the last several years, the majority has resolutely \nturned a deaf ear to the objections of millions of men, women, and \nchildren at risk while it continually snips away at America's safety \nnet. But in a conversion worthy of Jekyll and Hyde, the majority is \npassionately arguing that we throw open the Treasury doors to create a \nnew defense safety net to take the place of the social safety net it is \nintent on unraveling. Multibillion-dollar missile launchers will \nreplace school lunches in this new gilded net. Guns in the sky will \nreplace efforts to remove guns from our school playgrounds. Money that \nused to help the poor buy heating fuel in winter will now heat lasers \norbiting the Earth.\n  The underlying premise of the Dole star wars bill is that the \nballistic missile threat targeted toward the United States is so great, \nso urgent that nothing short of a crash program similar to the race to \nthe Moon in the 1960's will do. No cost to the American taxpayers is \ntoo great. No arms control treaty is too valuable. The siren call \nbehind the Dole star wars bill is a seductive one indeed: If you \nbelieve in a strong national defense, then you must be willing to \nshield America against missile attack--a missile attack anywhere, \nanytime--regardless of the consequences. But, like the sirens tempting \nOdysseus, to heed the call will bring catastrophe, not security.\n  The packaging of the Dole star wars bill is slick and the rhetoric is \npacked with chest-thumping patriotism. But the issue of missile defense \nis much more complex than it may seem to some. A number of questions \nneed to be asked and answered before the Senate can judge the need to \nembark on a crash program to field a national missile defense system in \n6 years.\n  What is the threat of ballistic missile attack facing the United \nStates today and in the near future?\n  From where does this threat originate? And are there other less \ncostly, more effective means of meeting this threat, whatever it is?\n  What is meant when the bill requires a defense against a ``limited, \nunauthorized, and accidental attack'' What is the likelihood of such \nattacks occurring? And what type of missile defense is necessary in \norder to blunt such an attack if there is one?\n  What type of attacks against the United States using weapons of mass \ndestruction would the Dole star wars system be powerless to defend \nagainst? How are we as a nation addressing this terrorist threat and \nhow would pursuing a star wars system affect the timeliness of these \nefforts?\n  What is the cost of the mandate contained in the Dole star wars bill \nand how will it be paid for? Or to turn the question around, what \nsocial program or other defense priority will suffer as a result of \nthis expensive undertaking.\n  What are the consequences of fielding a missile defense system that \nviolates the existing limitations of the ABM Treaty, as required by the \nDole star wars bill?\n  Will implementation of the START I Treaty be endangered?\n  Will ratification of the START II Treaty by the Russian Duma be \njeopardized if we renege on our ABM Treaty obligation?\n  Will it affect other arms control agreements pending or in the future \nif America backs down and violates a treaty, such treaties as the \nChemicals Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?\n  Will implementation of the Dole star wars system prompt an expensive \nand destabilizing arms race which would otherwise not occur?\n  Is missile defense technology sufficiently mature to mandate a 2003 \ndeployment date? Of course not.\n  Will the fly-before-you-buy principle be applied to this highly \nadvanced and sophisticated technology through extensive testing and \nevaluation prior to the operational deployment?\n  What has been the record of missile defense testing to date? That is \nan important question.\n  Are we rushing to judgment on certain technologies which may be \nobsolete and marginally effective in order to meet an arbitrary date \nupon which there is no basis for its selection?\n  Finally, what are the alleged shortcomings of the administration's 3-\nplus-3 missile defense plan which the Dole star wars bill professes to \ncorrect?\n  The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the \nservice chiefs are in solid support of the two-step plan to develop the \ntechnology over the next 3 years and then--\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\nand then, Mr. President, and then only--make a decision as to the \nwisdom of deploying in 3 years. Why is this unanimous opinion of the \ncivilian and military leadership of this country in the Pentagon not \nsound?\n  These are just a few of the questions relevant to the Dole star wars \nbill at 9\\1/2\\ pages in length. That is what that bill takes up. The \nbill is deceptively modest, but beyond the printed words are many \nconsequences, both intended and perhaps unintended, which must be \nseriously considered, I suggest, before far-reaching legislation is \nvoted upon.\n  In a general sense, I am disappointed that the majority is insisting \non raising the Dole star wars bill at this time. Why is that necessary? \nThe issue is already intractably ensnarled in the web of Presidential \npolitics, and I lament the unavoidable reality that support for the \nDole star wars bill by Members of the majority party will be seen as \nsome sort of test of party allegiance and debate concerning important \nnational security issues, such as missile defenses, should be \nseparated--should be separated--completely, Mr. President, from the \ngame of Presidential chess playing.\n  Senator Dole, in his May 23 opening statement on this bill, made it \nclear that the two shall be intertwined. Perhaps the most curious \nstatement made by Senator Dole during his initial floor debate was when \nhe disavowed forcing the Secretary of Defense to do anything, though \nthe bill mandates the deployment of a highly effective multilayered \nmissile defense system capable of intersecting dozens of warheads. \nSenator Dole is quoted in the Congressional Record as saying:\n\n       The choice of what type of system is left up to the \n     Secretary of Defense . . . The decision on what is affordable \n     and effective is left up to the Secretary of Defense.\n  Why is it that the distinguished majority leader professes to defer \nto the Secretary of Defense on such fundamental aspects of the program \ndetails but feels compelled to overturn his wisdom on the need--on the \nneed--for and timing of the deployment of a national defense missile \nsystem?\n  The Senate cannot have it both ways. If Congress forces the hand of \nthe Pentagon contrary to its wishes to decide in 1996 that we shall \ndeploy such a system by the year 2003, we cannot walk away from the \ncost of the decision, the limitation it places on the type of \narchitecture to be used and the consequences such a preemptive breach \nof the ABM Treaty will have on other aspects of arms control treaties \nthat are ongoing and also affects the future efforts to curb the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, approval of the Dole star wars bill will have a \ndefinite anti effect and serious consequences, not the least of which \nare in the area of cost. In the last 34 years, the United States has \nspent $100 billion on missile defense programs. To proceed, as the Dole \nstar wars bill would have us do, would cost the U.S. taxpayers, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, $31 to $60 billion, not \nincluding operating and support costs associated with the system once \nit is deployed or the cost of buying and launching the satellites \nnecessary to maintain the system as existing satellites begin to fail.\n  According to CBO, the postdeployment costs would reach a few hundred \nmillion dollars annually by 2005 when ground-based systems and space-\nbased sensors would be in place. After 2010, though, operating and \nsupport costs would increase significantly because of the need to \nlaunch replacements for any space-based system which wear out over \ntime.\n\n  The CBO goes on to predict that at some point, new technology or \nreassessment of the defense situation could lead to changes in the \nsystem which could raise the costs even much higher. Overall costs to \nimplement the Dole star wars bill could easily approach $70 to $80 \nbillion. This is in addition to the $100 billion our Nation has already \nspent on missile defense programs.\n  Mr. President, a word of caution. Our Nation is also pursuing a \nmultilayered theater missile defense system to protect our troops in \nthe field against ballistic missile attack. I strongly support this, as \ndoes the President and the members of the Joint Chiefs. This Senator \nagrees with our uniform and civilian leaders that the theater missile \ndefenses is our most immediate concern and deserves to be our top \npriority. But the pricetag for developing, producing, deploying, and \noperating these land-based and sea-based theater systems will add a \nminimum of $20 to $30 billion, increasing our running missile defense \nbill to nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars before it is all over.\n  Before we can commit to building a $60 billion national missile \ndefense system, perhaps there should be a more involved discussion, Mr. \nPresident, of who or what are we defending against. Three of the four \nnations capable of launching a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic \nmissile are American allies. And the fourth, China, possesses an \narsenal that could easily overwhelm the sort of limited defense \nmandated by the Dole star wars bill, though why China would launch such \na suicidal nuclear holocaust is difficult to imagine.\n  The best national intelligence estimate we have is that the threat of \na Third World nation possessing the capability to strike the United \nStates is at least 50 years away. Furthermore, the nation most often \nmentioned as a rogue state and emerging threat to the United States is \nNorth Korea, though they have not ever developed or tested a missile \nanywhere near capable of striking a major U.S. population center.\n\n  Furthermore, current reports are that North Korea is economically \nbankrupt and in the process of melting down internally. Unable to feed \nitself, the North Korean Army is reported to be eating grass and roots \nin order to survive. What chance does the North Korean Communist regime \nhave to survive another 15 years, not to mention at the same time \ndeveloping and deploying a nuclear weapon and a missile delivery system \nthat could be successful in targeting the United States, at least in \nthat timeframe?\n  Most people in the United States understand that the United States \nmust be more realistic, and the likely attack on American soil using a \nweapon of mass destruction would come in the form of a terrorist attack \nsimilar to what took place at the World Trade Center or in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  Terrorist groups have the means today to launch an attack that could \nkill thousands of Americans using chemical and biological weaponry. As \nan open society, we are as a nation at extremely high risk and \nvulnerable to such attack. Only through the fine work of our \nintelligence and law enforcement community have many of these plots \nbeen foiled.\n  Why would a terrorist group or rogue nation spend 15 to 20 years and \nbillions of dollars to manufacture a rudimentary----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Why would a terrorist group or rogue nation spend 15 or 20 \nyears and billions of dollars to manufacture a rudimentary nuclear \nwarhead and long-range ballistic missile delivery system which would \nlead a noticeable trail from where it was launched, when a weapon \nconcealed in a suitcase or on the back of a rented truck can do the \nsame job right now at a small fraction of the cost and with much \ngreater anonymity?\n\n  Not only is the Dole star wars system useless in defending America \nagainst such a threat, it would divert scarce resources from the \nimmediate and pressing concerns of combating terrorism and protecting \nour troops in the field against theater ballistic missile attacks.\n  Aside from the cost of the Dole Star Wars Program, Mr. President, the \nquestion of the need to pursue a crash program of a decision to deploy \na system that is not in compliance with the ABM Treaty carries with it \nimmense consequences, not only as to the reliability of the United \nStates to uphold its treaty obligations, but also the future of ongoing \narms control programs and policies. It would be sadly ironic from the \nstandpoint of whether other nations would believe us if passage of the \nDole star wars bill jeopardizes implementation of the START I and \nratification of START II by the Russian Duma. That would be a tragedy, \nand we cannot accept that risk. These accords, if fully realized, would \neliminate over 5,000 nuclear warheads designed to strike America.\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\n  We cannot be frivolous about the future of START I and START II. \nThese are the most significant arms reduction treaties in the history \nof mankind, major strides away from the prospect of nuclear holocaust \nand the lingering shadow of the cold war. Abrogation of the ABM Treaty \nin the pursuit of enhanced national security would be foolhardy if it \nhalted the destruction of the very nuclear weapon delivery systems we \nare trying to defend against. Such a scenario, if played out, would \nlikely endanger other concrete efforts, such as the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to halt the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In short, our actions, if we go for and vote for the Dole star wars \nbill, should not be considered in a vacuum. Intended or not, \nimplementation of the Dole star wars bill would have a far-reaching, \nchilling effect on the future of arms control.\n  Often forgotten in the debate on the national missile defense is the \nquestion of whether technology is sufficiently mature enough to mandate \nthe year 2003 as the deployment date. The record of missile interceptor \ntesting to date and in the foreseeable future is one of more failure \nthan success. In the rush to deploy a prototype system using highly \nadvanced and sophisticated technology by the year 2003, we will be \nforsaking, Mr. President, the-fly-before-you-buy principle that has \nserved us well in recent years.\n  Not only will we be limiting the testing and evaluation of the system \nin a push to field a system at an earlier and unnecessary date, we will \nbe locking ourselves into certain technologies which may become \nobsolete by the year 2003.\n  Contrary to the claims of the proponents of this bill, the \nadministration is pursuing a program to develop and deploy a \ncontinental missile system to meet the future threat. The so-called 3-\nplus-3 Program is a two-step plan to develop the necessary technology \nover the next 3 years and then make a decision as to the wisdom of \ndeploying a system in the subsequent 3 years. The Secretary of Defense, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Service Chiefs are in solid \nsupport of this reasonable and responsible approach. Our best war-\nfighters and intelligence experts agree that approval of the Dole star \nwars plan would be folly in that the threat simply does not exist in \nthe near term to justify jeopardizing the arms control treaties that \nwill allow the military to fund other spending priorities within the \nmilitary.\n  The American people understand the folly of the Dole star wars bill \nas well. I have a collection of over three dozen newspaper editorials \nfrom around the country in opposition to this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that excerpts of these editorials in opposition to the Dole \nstar wars bill be printed in the Record so that my colleagues can \nbetter understand what the American public is saying about the Dole \nstar wars bill before they cast their votes on this expensive, \nunnecessary, and destabilizing proposition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              America's Editors Oppose New Star Wars Plans\n\n       Now, here's Dole & Co., seeking another $20 billion for \n     that gold-plated rat hole, lest we become vulnerable to North \n     Korea or Libya, a truly screwball idea.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am standing in momentarily for Senator \nDole. I will call on Senator Smith in just a moment.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary, some three \nor four pages of a document entitled the ``National Missile Defense \nOptions'' prepared in response to the House National Security Committee \nby the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, dated July 31, 1995, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           (From the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization)\n\n                    National Missile Defense Options\n\n\n                                abstract\n\n       This document responds to a request from the House National \n     Security Committee to report on specific programmatic, \n     funding, and architecture options for the development and \n     deployment of national missile defenses. As requested, it \n     describes architecture options that contain only ground based \n     elements, those that contain only space-based elements, and \n     those with both. The architectures described in the report \n     build on the current BMDO program, including the legacy from \n     previous years. With adequate funding and streamlined \n     acquisition, initial operational capability of these options \n     ranges from FY2000 to 2007, preliminary cost estimates range \n     from $4,800M to $43,100M (FY 95 $), and relative risks range \n     from low to high. The architectures span a large range in the \n     threat levels against which they can protect, in their \n     estimated cost, and in their support to theater missile \n     defense. None of the architectures has been formally \n     evaluated for compliance with the ABM Treaty.\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       In response to a request from the House National Security \n     Committee, dated February 21, 1995, this report describes a \n     variety of architectures that could be deployed for National \n     Missile Defense. In keeping with the DOD thrust for \n     acquisition reform, the costs and schedules are predicated on \n     successful acquisition streamlining to reduce acquisition \n     costs and shorten schedules for an operational capability.\n       Consistent with the specifics of the request, the report \n     describes example alternative architectures that are \n     compatible with technologies and prototypes being developed \n     by BMDO, and that could be made available for deployment. The \n     report provides estimates of their effectiveness, schedules, \n     relative risks, and requirements for acquisition and \n     deployment funding. The architecture options are meant to be \n     representative of general classes of national missile defense \n     systems. The performance levels, which are also meant to be \n     representative, are in fact dependent on many variables, such \n     as threat characteristics and operational procedures. The \n     examples presented are not ``tuned'' to any particular threat \n     or defense mission, so that modified weapon or sensor \n     inventories could provide different performance and could \n     handle different threats.\n       BMDO does not advocate any one or another of these \n     architectures or architecture classes as end point systems. \n     Rather, our current program has adopted a strategy of \n     evolutionary defense. This strategy addresses the wide range \n     of threat possibilities existing in the uncertain and \n     unpredictable future. The range of such threats includes \n     events such as a third world nation acquiring and threatening \n     to use a few ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass \n     destruction, China using its ballistic missiles to prevent US \n     action in Korea, an unauthorized limited attack used to \n     instigate a conflict, or a return to a nuclear standoff with \n     a major nuclear power. The BMDO program addresses all of \n     these, consistent with the assessed likelihood of these \n     threats and within its allotted funds.\n       With adequate annual budgets, all of the architectures \n     presented here can lead to an initial operational capability \n     between 2000 and 2007, but with varying risks. These dates \n     are, in some cases, earlier operational timeframes than have \n     been previously described for NMD options. These later dates \n     were valid because the programs were budget constrained, used \n     more traditional acquisition approaches, and risks were \n     limited to be low to moderate.\n       Figure EX-1 \\1\\ identifies the four architecture classes \n     discussed in the report--each with a range of capabilities \n     and acquisition costs as illustrated. These architectures are \n     classified by where their sensors and weapons would be based. \n     Other concepts that include potentially promising sea-based \n     or Navy systems will be addressed in future reports.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Figure EX-1 not reproducible in the Record.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The costs reflected by this report are rough order of \n     magnitude (ROM) projections of the remaining development and \n     acquisition costs in FY95 dollars. They reflect anticipated \n     savings from acquisition streamlining and have been developed \n     using a standard set of assumptions, some of which might not \n     actually be implemented on any given program. The candidate \n     National Missile Defense elements discussed here are not now \n     in an acquisition program and have not been subjected to the \n     rigorous planning and costing reviews usually associated with \n     defense acquisition.\n       Two measures of capability are reflected in the figure: the \n     threat levels to which the architecture can deny damage to \n     the United States with at least 50 percent probability, which \n     is equivalent to enforcing less than one leaker (on average), \n     and the area protected (i.e., US only or global). The use of \n     damage denial probability was chosen as the appropriate \n     measure of effectiveness for this report because it follows \n     from the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) established \n     for Ballistic Missile Defense and validated by the Joint \n     Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). This requirement \n     specified the confidence level and the probability that no \n     warheads would penetrate a defense system in the face of a \n     ballistic missile attack.\n       Threat levels considered in this report range from an \n     attack by four unsophisticated warheads, to an attack by 200 \n     MIRV warheads with complex payloads launched nearly \n     simultaneously by 20 boosters. The largest attack used in \n     this report is consistent with the existing JROC-validated \n     operational requirement for National Missile Defense. This \n     requirement was previously shown, in the GPALS COEA and other \n     analyses, to require multilayer defenses with space based \n     elements for high effectiveness. Some degradation in \n     performance could arise due to the responses that threat \n     countries might take to the presence of any specific defense \n     we might deploy, but such responses can be offset by \n     straightforward upgrades to the defenses discussed in this \n     report. Threats containing greater than 200 warheads also \n     remain possible for the foreseeable future.\n       The damage denial performance of an architecture is an \n     extremely stringent measure of effectiveness, demanding that, \n     on the average, leakage be reduced to one warhead or less. \n     Less perfect defense performance, such as the negation of 190 \n     of 200 attacking warheads, would also be highly valuable both \n     as a defense and as a deterrent to the use of ballistic \n     missiles.\n       Accordingly, in the body of this report, we also show how \n     well each of the architectural variants could negate the \n     warheads in the spectrum of representative attacks we \n     considered.\n       Figure EX-2 provides a brief description and summary of the \n     four architecture classes in this report, which are all \n     supported by our NMD architecture strategy and modular \n     approach. Additional design, performance, and programmatic \n     details follow. None of the proposed systems has been \n     formally evaluated for compliance with the ABM Treaty.\n       ``All Ground Based'' architectures have BM/C \\3\\, ground \n     based radars and ground based interceptors. The ground based \n     radars include early warning radars, other existing radars \n     and BMD radars. In common with the other architectures, DSP \n     or SBIRs (High) provide cueing to the BMD system. Entry level \n     defenses with 20 interceptors at Grand Forks could deny \n     damage against a few warheads, with moderate relative risk, \n     by FY 1999 to 2000 for an estimated $3,500M (the BMDO Tiger \n     Team ``2+2'' solution) or by late FY 2001 with low-moderate \n     relative risk for an estimated $4,800M. Expanding the systems \n     to multiple sites with more radars and interceptors, at costs \n     up to about $12,200M, could increase the defense \n     effectiveness. These expanded architectures could achieve \n     ``good'' damage denial performance against threats of up to \n     about 50 warheads.\n       ``Ground Based/Space Sensor'' architectures contain BM/C \n     \\3\\, ground based radars, a space based sensor constellation, \n     Space and Missile Tracking System (SBIRs [low]), formerly \n     known as Brilliant Eyes), and ground based interceptors. The \n     space sensors improve this architecture's performance. It \n     could be operational by FY 2004 with moderate relative risk. \n     This is BMDO's ``objective architecture'' that is the focus \n     of the current NMD Technology Readiness Program. An initial \n     one-site, 100-GBI option, Case A, costing an estimated \n     $11,000M, could provide ``good'' performance for threats of \n     about 20 warheads. Expanded inventories and additional \n     interceptor/radar sites could achieve ``good'' performance \n     against threat levels of 70 warheads or more with costs up to \n     about $20,100M.\n       ``All Space Based'' architectures would achieve a higher \n     capability against MIRV systems and provide coverage of \n     assets beyond the United States with costs starting at about \n     $20,000M. Two types of space based systems are considered in \n     this report, chemical lasers and rocket-boosted kinetic kill\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\n     interceptors. Space based chemical lasers offer the \n     capability to intercept during boost phase against theater \n     threats as well as strategic threats. This capability greatly \n     enhances the performance of theater missile defense \n     architectures, especially against advanced threats. A space \n     based laser (SBL) system and associated BM/C \\3\\, with costs \n     of $20,000M to $23,000M, could potentially reach IOC by 2007 \n     with relatively high risk. An enhanced laser system, \n     available at IOC two years later and with costs of $26,000M \n     to $29,000M, would provide robustness against certain \n     threats. The space based interceptor (SBI) system, including \n     SMTS and BM/C \\3\\, and costing $20,000M to $23,000M, could \n     reach IOC in 2004 at moderate to high relative risk.\n       Combinations of the two types of space based systems \n     provide ``good'' or better damage denial performance at all \n     threat levels up to 200 warheads, at a cost of $37,100M to \n     $43,100M with IOC and relative risks as noted above.\n       Finally, combined ``Space and Ground Based'' architectures, \n     which include BM/C\\3\\, weapons, and sensors on the ground \n     and in space, can achieve ``good'' or better damage denial \n     performance against all threat levels up to 200 warheads, \n     with estimated costs of $30,700M to $35,100M.\n       The relative risks shown in Figure EX-2 are subjective \n     estimates for the funding and schedules we show and the \n     architecture's maturity. The adoption of more deliberate \n     programs, coupled with the infusion of additional funding \n     could clearly reduce risk in all areas. The time scale at \n     which risk could be reduced, and the cost incurred to achieve \n     the risk reduction, depend on the maturity of the programs \n     and their technical challenges. It is likely, for example, \n     that less time and funding could be required to reduce risks \n     from moderate to low in ground-based systems than would be \n     required to reduce risks for space based lasers from high to \n     moderate. However, definitive risk reduction timelines and \n     costs for all the architectures in this report have not yet \n     been developed.\n       As shown in Figure EX-1 and EX-2, the architectures in this \n     report span a considerable range in performance and cost. \n     Ground based systems represent lowest-cost defense solutions \n     for denying damage against up to 20 warheads. Space sensors \n     would improve the cost effectiveness when threats approach \n     the performance limits of ground-based systems.

See discussion in Section 3.                                                                                                       \n\n  Mr. KYL. Second, Mr. President, let me make three quick comments \nregarding the statements of the Senator from Nebraska. Then I am going \nto call on Senator Smith, a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  There is an old saying that ``if you can't defeat something on the \nfacts, then call it names.'' Of course, we are not debating something \ntoday called the Dole star wars bill. There is no such thing. We are \ndebating something called the Defend America Act, which is a bill \ndesigned to provide a ballistic missile defense for the United States. \nTo denigrate this as some kind of star wars concept is to totally \nmisrepresent it, and that is not the way to try to debate an issue on \nthe merits.\n  Second, the Senator from Nebraska asked the question, why would the \nNorth Koreans want to develop a costly missile? Their troops are eating \ngrass. Mr. President, it is hard to figure out why the North Koreans do \nwhat they do. But the fact is, our intelligence agencies report to us \nthat they are indeed developing a missile. That is not contested by \nanyone. The only question is when that missile will be able to reach \nthe United States. That is a fact.\n  Third, there are questions about the cost and a lot of \nmisrepresentations about the cost. As I discussed for about an hour \nlast night, according to the CBO, the cost of the kind of system that \nwe are talking about here is between $10 and $14 billion. So let us not \nbe misrepresenting the cost.\n  Finally, I think most startlingly, Mr. President, the Senator from \nNebraska made the argument that the Russians might violate the START \nagreements if we go forward and, therefore, we should not go forward. I \nfind this a truly remarkable statement. We are being held hostage to \nRussian blackmail that they might violate a treaty they have with us \nand, therefore, we do not provide for our national defense? That is \nstartling. What do treaties mean?\n\n  Treaties are important. But so is providing for our national security \nby the acquisition of weapons both offensive and defensive. It seems to \nme, Mr. President, that we cannot be subjected to blackmail. The \nRussians have not even made this threat. It is Members of the United \nStates Senate who assume that the Russians might violate treaties that \nthey have signed if we go forward with the development of a national \nballistic missile defense system.\n  So it seems to me that this really demonstrates the paucity of \narguments that exist against this bill when we have to stoop to making \nthe argument the Russians might violate a treaty they have entered into \nwith us and, therefore, we better not go forward. If that is all the \ntreaties mean to the Russians, then I suggest we need both treaties and \na ballistic missile defense system.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith, who is on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from New Hampshire \n[Mr. Smith] is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nyielding, and rise today, Mr. President, in very strong support of the \nDefend America Act.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. I commend \nthe majority leader, Senate Dole, for bringing this bill to the \nattention of the Senate and to the American people.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is walking a very dangerous tightrope. For \nreasons that are unknown and certainly inconceivable to most Americans, \nPresident Clinton refuses to defend our country against ballistic \nmissiles. That is exactly what he is doing by opposing this bill, even \nthough the technology to do so is available today. The truth is, our \nNation is absolutely, completely vulnerable to ballistic missiles.\n  We have no defense--I repeat, no defense--whatever against a missile \ntargeted on our territory, our people, our industry, or any of our \nnational treasures--no defense. The Patriot missiles that everyone \nremembers from Desert Storm 5 years ago are not capable of stopping \nlong-range missiles. In fact, they can only defend small areas against \nshort-range missiles. The Patriot is what we call a point-defense \nsystem that we send along with our troops when we deploy them in harm's \nway.\n  Here at home, we have no defenses of any kind. We have no defense \nagainst long-range missiles from China, from Russia, from North Korea. \nI differ from the Senator from Nebraska. I have no idea, no idea \nwhatever what the national security meetings, classified and\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nconfidential on North Korea, I have no idea what is going on in those \nmeetings. Apparently, the Senator from Nebraska does. I do not know if \nhe has somebody sitting in on them or where he gets his information, \nbut I do not have such information, and I do not think the intelligence \ncommunities have it either. We have no defense against missiles that \nIran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya are vigorously seeking to acquire--\nvigorously. That is the truth. This is not some star wars program. That \nis an outrageous statement, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out.\n  In this Senator's view, it is unacceptable that we would refuse to \ndefend ourselves from this kind of technology being spread around the \nworld to these kinds of nations. When told of this situation, the vast \nmajority of the American people not only become upset, they become \nenraged. They cannot understand why their elected representatives would \nbe willing to leave them defenseless and then stand on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and advocate leaving them defenseless against the likes of \npeople like Saddam Hussein or Mu'ammar Qadhafi. Hardly reasonable, \nrational, leaders in the world today, let alone Kim Jong-il whom very \nfew of us know much about at all. They cannot understand why the tax \ndollars that they sometimes so reluctantly, or willingly in reluctance \ngive up, how can they not contribute for our national defense? That is \nwhat they are asking. That is what they are asking. They have a right \nto be upset. There is no excuse for not defending America against \nballistic missiles.\n  The Republican Congress agrees with the American people and took \naction last year to defend all Americans--all Americans; not certain \nAmericans, all Americans--against ballistic missiles, whatever their \nsource. In the defense bill last year, Congress established a program \nto develop and deploy a national missile defense system for the United \nStates. This program is not some elaborate star wars concept, but \nrather a very modest yet capable ground-based system that would provide \na limited defense of America against accidental, unauthorized or \nhostile missile attacks.\n  I ask anybody out there listening, or anybody participating in the \ndebate on the other side, are you certain, are you absolutely certain, \nthat Qadhafi or Saddam Hussein, Iran or Kim Jong-il do not have the \ncapability or will not have it in the very near future? If you are \ncertain, you ought to vote for them. If you are not sure, you ought to \nbe voting with us.\n  President Clinton vetoed the defense bill specifically because of the \nrequirement to defend America. That is the main reason he vetoed the \ndefense bill, because he did not want us, did not want us, to put this \nrequirement in. In fact, in his statement of policy the President \ncalled national missile defense ``unwarranted and unnecessary.'' It is \none thing to say ``unnecessary,'' that might be an opinion, but \n``unwarranted''? This is a very insightful quote. It gets right to the \nheart of the differences between this President and this Congress. To \nPresident Clinton, providing for the common defense is ``unwarranted \nand unnecessary.'' That is what he says. To the Congress, it is the \nmost fundamental of our constitutional responsibilities, the most \nfundamental. Simply put, it is a defining issue between the two of us. \nIt is an issue that defines our Nation's character, right to the heart \nof character, a commitment to the American people. How could you not \ndefend yourselves, your people, against the threat of an incoming \nmissile? It does not have to be deliberate. It could be accidental. We \nhave no defense.\n\n  It is an issue that defines the difference between the two political \nparties in this country. There cannot be compromise on it. There are \npeople here on the floor and in this Senate who are trying to work out \nsome compromise to give on something else, and we will give a little \nbit of something else. There is no compromise, no compromise on \ndefending ourselves against incoming ballistic missiles. It is an issue \nthat defines the very basic difference between the two men who are \nseeking the Presidency, President Clinton, and Bob Dole, who is the \nauthor of this bill. It is a basic difference between the two men. It \nis an issue that history will undoubtedly look back on and pass \njudgment upon for better or for worse, an issue that will define our \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, if we fail to take action to defend America now while \nwe still have the chance, we will regret it. At some point in the very \nnear future we will have waited too long. What is that point? Are you \nsure, folks over there, sure that we have not reached that point? At \nsome point in the near future we will have waited too long. The \ntheoretical threat of a hostile ballistic missile launch will have \nbecome a reality and we will have no defense. Will we be ready when the \ntheoretical becomes reality? Will be we ready? Not if we listen to this \nside of the debate. Not if we do what they are asking us to do, we will \nnot be ready.\n  What will it take for the President to recognize this? Must a missile \nequipped with a chemical, biological or perhaps a nuclear warhead, rain \ndown upon the citizens of America before we act? Must tens of thousands \nof Americans die before we act? That does not have to happen. Let me \ntell you, had we not been far-sighted enough and thoughtful enough to \nprovide the Patriot missile, we would have lost a lot more people in \nthe Persian Gulf war. It is a good thing Saddam Hussein only has a Scud \nmissile, or perhaps some of the families would be speaking here through \nus today.\n  To those of us who are cosponsoring this legislation, the time to act \nis now. Not tomorrow, not the next day, now. We have the capability to \ndo it. Our Nation is in jeopardy, ballistic missiles and weapons of \nmass destruction are spreading throughout the world. That is a fact. I \nhave had hearings. I have heard information on it. We have heard the \ntestimony. We cannot stop this. We have to protect ourselves against \nthem. Mr. President, 30 nations currently possess or are actively \nacquiring weapons of mass destruction, and the missiles to deliver \nthem. They are not all friendly nations. Just recently, the United \nStates admitted that Iran is covertly storing up to 16 ballistic \nmissiles armed with chemical or biological warheads. Iraq is the most \ninspected and thoroughly monitored country in the world, yet they still \nhave them. If we cannot find these missiles in the desert of Iraq, how \nare we going to track them in the valleys of China, North Korea, Iran, \nor Syria? The answer is, my colleagues, we cannot. We cannot track \nthem. That is the point. Even if we could, we do not have the system to \ncounter them. We cannot counter them even if we can find them.\n\n  The only solution is to develop missile defenses. This bill does \nthat. It would require that our Nation deploy a national missile \ndefense system capable of protecting all Americans by the year 2003. \nThis is not about politics. It is not about partisanship. It is about \nnational security and keeping faith with those who elected us and \ndepend upon us to safeguard their lives and property, yet this bill is \nbeing filibustered, that is the bottom line, by the other side of the \naisle--filibustering a bill to defend America. What an outrage. If we \nignore this obligation, we will have failed in our most fundamental \nconstitutional responsibility. You do not filibuster the defense of the \nUnited States of America. We can filibuster a lot of things around \nhere, and we do it all the time, but not the defense of America. It \nruns against every principle I have ever stood for, and it ought to run \nagainst every principle that others in here stand for.\n  Mr. President, as we discuss and debate the merits of this \nlegislation, I want to specifically address what I believe are some \nfundamental and extremely dangerous flaws in the administration's \nposition. First off, the administration has continually emphasized that \nthey see no long-range missile threat emerging within the next 15 years \nthat could threaten the United States.\n  I would note that when the administration is pressed to describe how \nthey came up with the 15-year number, versus 10 years, or 20 years, \nthere is no real methodology. Essentially, it appears to have been a \nnice round number that the administration came up with.\n  The classified national intelligence estimate that the administration \nuses to support this assertion is anything but reassuring. And contrary \nto the assertions of the Clinton administration, it does not rule out a \nrogue nation acquiring ballistic missile capabilities that could \nthreaten the United States.\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\nRather, it projects the view that it is unlikely that such a situation \nwould arise.\n  Essentially, it relies upon the perceived intentions of other \ncountries rather than their actual technical capabilities. That is a \nvery dangerous way of assessing the threat environment, and it runs in \ndirect conflict with our historical experience.\n  Our experience following World War II is very instructive. During \n1945 and 1946, the United States conducted operation paperclip in order \nto employ Dr. Werner von Braun and his team of German scientists. My \ncolleagues may recall it was von Braun and his associates who had \ncreated the German V-2 rocket. The transfer of these experts and their \nequipment provided the United States with nearly instant ballistic \nmissile capability. Under the Hermes project, with the infusion of \ngerman technical expertise, we soon began launching V-2 rockets.\n  A year later, the development of a two-stage vehicle based on the V-2 \nwas begun. The so-called bumper vehicle went on to establish range, \naltitude, and speed records. By the late 1950's, frustrated by \ndifficulties in the Atlas program, Gen. Bernard Schriever, a pioneer of \nthe U.S. Ballistic Missile Program, ordered that our existing Thor \nballistic missile be modified to include a new second stage. This \nsecond stage provided strategic range capability for our ballistic \nmissiles within a year, increasing the range of the Thor missile from \n1,500 miles to approximately 5,000 miles.\n  Mr. President, the lesson here is quite simple. The acquisition of \nkey technical experts can dramatically accelerate the pace of \ndevelopment for a country seeking to field ballistic missiles. In \naddition, the range of existing systems can be rapidly increased by \nincorporating additional stages. In the 1940's, designing and building \nballistic missiles was a new and challenging endeavor. But with focus, \ndetermination, and national level support, it was done very rapidly.\n  By contrast, in the 1980's and 1990's, the schools and universities \nof the West teach advanced technology to students from all over the \nworld. Missile designs are well understood, missile components are \navailable on the world market, and whole missile systems can be bought \nand delivered, as in the case of the Soviet Scuds to China, the North \nKorean Scuds to Iraq, Chinese M-11 missiles to Pakistan, and Chinese \nCSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia. Since most of today's ballistic \nmissiles are mobile, training and launching by customer nation crews \ncan take place in the missile's country of origin, so that the first \nactual launch of a missile from the customer country may occur without \nadvance warning.\n  Additionally, ballistic missiles do not need to have a long range to \nthreaten the United States. In the 1950's, the United States launched \nseveral ballistic missiles from the deck of a ship, and sent them to \nhigh altitudes where their nuclear payloads were detonated. Most of the \npopulation of the United States live near the east and west coasts, and \nthus are highly vulnerable to a ship-launched missile that could be \ncovertly deployed in merchant traffic several hundred miles off the \ncoast at sea. The modifications to such a ship would not need to be \nobvious, a few test missile launches could be performed in remote \nlocations to avoid detection.\n  The problem with the administration program is that it seeks to wait \nuntil the last possible moment to deploy missile defense. But \nhistorically, we have proven very poor at making such intelligence \nestimates. Just look at Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons program. The real challenge for the United States is to deploy \ntheater and national missile defenses as rapidly as possible in order \nto discourage potential proliferators from developing, building, \nbuying, or otherwise acquiring offensive ballistic missiles. That is \nwhat deterrence is all about. But you can't have deterrence without the \ncapability to actually defeat or defend against a threat. Without \nmissile defenses there is no deterrence.\n  Perhaps most absurd is the administration's argument that the \ntechnology of the future will be more advanced than that of today, so \nwe should wait for the future technology to be available before we \nbegin formal acquisition of missile defenses. If we followed that model \nwe would never procure any weapons systems because they would always be \nsurpassed by future technology.\n  What this argument fails to recognize is that real objectives and \ndeadlines are the critical instruments for focusing the efforts of the \nmanagement and technical communities in government and industry. The \nexperience of operating a real system with real military personnel \ncannot be replaced by paper and pencil, or computer system designs. In \naddition, the longer we wait to commit to deploy a national missile \ndefense, the more we will encourage our adversaries to pursue their own \noffensive ballistic missile programs. Without an actual system \ndeployed, or at the very least a commitment to, and timetable for, \ndeploying a system, there is no deterrent value.\n  The Russians have now accumulated 30 years of experience in building \nand operating ballistic missile defense systems, including the nuclear-\ntipped Moscow area defense and several mobile systems such as the SA-5, \nthe SA-10, and the SA-12. This unique experience has been cited by our \nmilitary as a major advantage for the Russians. It must be rectified.\n  Mr. President, I also want to address the issue of how ballistic \nmissile defense relates to strategic arms reduction. The administration \nand certain Members of Congress have falsely sought to link this \nlegislation with Russian ratification of the START II Treaty. Simply \nput, it is bogus linkage.\n  The truth is that no provision in the Defend America Act threatens \nRussia or undermines the deterrent value of its strategic offensive \nforces. Nothing in this bill would disadvantage Russian security in any \nway. The numbers of defensive systems the bill envisions to combat \naccidental or rogue nation attacks are simply too few to affect the \ndeterrent value of Russia's strategic arsenal.\n  The ABM Treaty was constructed during the cold war and is premised on \nmutual assured destruction. But the world is no longer bipolar, it is \nmultipolar. Mutual assured destruction is not relevant in today's \nenvironment. It will not deter aggression by adversaries other than \nRussia.\n\n  The truth is defenses threaten no one. If Russia and the United \nStates are no longer targeting nuclear weapons on each other, how could \nthe deployment of a limited defense against other potential adversaries \nthreaten Russia in any way?\n  We are providing billions in foreign aid to Russia to support them \neconomically, politically, and to aid in dismantlement of their nuclear \narsenal. When relations are this cooperative, how can anyone reasonably \nassert that we are provoking Russia or undermining the relationship by \ndefending ourselves against the likes of Kim Jong-Il or Saddam Hussein.\n  The truth is that any linkage between the Defend America Act and the \nSTART II Treaty is purely artificial. It is pure fear mongering by \nthose who use it for political purposes here at home. Frankly, it is \nshameful.\n  Those in Russia who are trying to link the two know full well that \nnothing in this bill threatens Russia in any way. They are merely \ntrying to coerce further concessions. The truth is, we have \nconsistently heard Russian officials seek to link START II to NATO \nexpansion, compliance with the CFE Treaty, national missile defense, \nand virtually every other possible pressure point. Again, it is purely \nbogus linkage. And where I come from, it is called extortion. It should \nnot be rewarded.\n  If we do legitimize this fallacy, and pay the ransom that some are \ndemanding, where will it end? What will the next hostage be? How many \ntimes will we allow Russia to exercise a veto over our defense policy? \nAnd at what cost to our security?\n  Mr. President, let me close with one final observation. National \ndefense should not be a partisan issue. As elected representatives, we \nhave no more fundamental or important constitutional responsibility \nthan to provide for the defense of this country. As it currently \nstands, this Nation, its people, treasures, and industry, are \nabsolutely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. The technology is \nhere today, all that is lacking is the political will to do so. We \ncannot delay any longer. We must get on with the business of defending \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n  If we allow politics to prevail and we leave our citizens naked \nagainst aggression, I fear that the results will be catastrophic. If we \nwait for a ballistic missile to rain down upon our Nation, wreaking \nchaos and destruction, it will be too late. We will have failed our \ncitizens. We will have failed the Constitution. We will have failed \nthis sacred institution.\n  I believe deep in my heart that history will look back upon this \ndebate as a key point in our Nation's history. Let us consider the \nconsequences of our actions very carefully. Let us keep faith with the \nAmerican people who rely upon us to protect their security. They have \nno one else to turn to. It is our responsibility. It is our obligation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Defend America Act as reported by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have several people who would like to \nspeak. Several people were down for 15 minutes, but I ask them if they \ncan adjust that. Otherwise, we will not be able to get around on the \nrequests. Senator Exon would like 2 minutes, which I will yield to him \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 more \nminutes first.\n  Mr. NUNN. Following that, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, let me close with one final observation. I \nfeel very strongly that this issue has become a partisan political \nissue. It should not be a partisan political issue. We have no more \nfundamental or important constitutional responsibility than to provide \nfor the defense of this country. And to be on the floor filibustering a \nbill that defends America, protects America from incoming missiles is \nan outrage. We can disagree on the degree, we can disagree on the \narchitecture, we can disagree on the timing. But we ought not to be \nfilibustering it. We ought to be having an up-or-down vote on it. I \nthink everybody ought to be on record today--not having it put off, but \nbe on record today. Are you for it, or are you against it? We ought to \nbe recorded so the American people can judge us when the time comes.\n  This Nation's people, treasury, and industry are vulnerable to \nmissile attack. The technology is here. All that is lacking is the \npolitical will. We cannot delay any longer. We have to get on with the \nbusiness of defending America. History, I think, will look at this \ndebate as a key point in our Nation's history. Let us consider the \nconsequences of our actions carefully and keep faith with the American \npeople, who rely upon us to protect their security. They do not have \nanybody else to turn to. It is our responsibility, our obligation. All \nwe are asking is that we exercise it. All the Senator from Arizona is \nasking for is a vote. All the Republican leader is asking for is a \nvote. We are not asking for anything else. We are not even asking for a \nvictory, we are asking for a vote so that we can be recorded.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Exon, and then \n10 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes. \nFollowing that, Senator Dorgan has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I was struck to hear the term that people on \nthe other side were startled that we would oppose this, that we are \nbeing blackmailed by Russia, and that we are being held hostage by \nRussia. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that already the opposition is saying we \nare against missile defenses on this side. We are not against missile \ndefenses. The talk was made about the Patriot, how important that was \nin the gulf war. This Senator and most of the Senators on this side \nwere leaders, when we were in charge of the Senate, in developing the \nPatriot missile. What we are against is hastily moving, as the Dole \nstar wars bill would do, to a missile defense that is untested, \nuntried, with no assurance whatsoever that it will work.\n  Go with us. We are with the experts at the Pentagon. We are with the \nPresident. We want a missile defense, but we want it in a timely \nfashion and not rush to violate treaties that the United States of \nAmerica signed in good faith.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from CBO relating to the \ncost issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Floyd Spence,\n     Chairman, Committee on National Security, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed H.R. 3144, the Defend America Act of 1996, as \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on National Security \n     on May 1, 1996. The bill calls for deployment by 2003 of a \n     system to defend the nation against an attack by ballistic \n     missiles, but does not specify how much funding would be \n     available for this purpose. Based on plans and estimates of \n     the Department of Defense, the costs of complying with the \n     bill would total $10 billion over the next five years, or \n     about $7 billion more than is currently programmed for \n     national missile defense.\n       Through 2010, total acquisition costs would range from $31 \n     billion to $60 billion for a layered defense that would \n     include both ground- and space-based weapons. The wide range \n     in the estimate reflects uncertainty about two factors--the \n     type and capability of a defensive system that would satisfy \n     the terms of the bill, and the costs of each component of \n     that system. These figures do not include the cost to operate \n     and support the defense after it is deployed. The attachment \n     provides additional details on these estimates.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1996 \n     excludes from the application of that bill legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the national security or \n     the ratification or implementation of international treaty \n     obligations. CBO has determined that the provisions of H.R. \n     3144 fit within that exclusion.\n       H.R. 3144 would not affect direct spending or receipts and \n     thus would not be subject to pay-as-you-go procedure under \n     section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Raymond \n     Hall and David Mosher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Budgetary Implications of H.R. 3144, the Defend America Act of 1996\n\n       This document addresses the budgetary implications of H.R. \n     3144, as ordered reported by the House Committee on National \n     Security on May 1, 1996. The Defend America Act of 1996 would \n     require the United States to deploy a national missile \n     defense by the end of 2003 that provides ``a highly effective \n     defense of all 50 states against limited, unauthorized and \n     accidental attacks . . . [that would be] augmented over time \n     to provide a layered defense against larger and more \n     sophisticated ballistic missile threats as they emerge.'' \n     Those two requirements form the basis of CBO's estimate. \n     According to the bill, the initial defense must include \n     interceptors, ground-based radar, space-based sensor, \n     including the Space and Missile Tracking System (SMTS), and a \n     battle management and command and control system to tie the \n     components together. The interceptors can be ground-, sea-, \n     or space-based. The space-based weapons could be lasers or \n     kinetic energy interceptors (also known as Brilliant \n     Pebbles). The layered defense that would eventually follow, \n     according to the bill's second requirement, would likely be \n     achieved by adding space-based weapons to the ground-based \n     system.\n       CBO estimates that H.R. 3144 would cost nearly $10 billion \n     over the next five years, or about $7 billion more than is \n     currently programmed for national missile defense. Through \n     2010, the system would cost between $31 billion and $60 \n     billion. None of the estimates include the cost to operate \n     and support the defense after it is deployed. Our estimates \n     are derived from data provided by the military services and \n     the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). While we \n     have been unable to review many of the details behind those \n     estimates, we believe that they are the best that are \n     currently available. In some cases, though, we adjusted the \n     Department of Defense's (DoD) estimates to better reflect \n     procurement costs and potential risks. For example, we added \n     about $3 billion to hedge against technical and schedule \n     risks in the development programs. We also reduced the \n     estimated cost of deploying 500 space-based interceptors by \n     $4 billion. We did not, however, adjust the estimates to \n     reflect cost increases that typically occur in developing \n     systems that advance the state of the art.\n       Minimum Requirements and Costs. The low end of the range of \n     estimates reflects what we believe would be the smallest \n     system that would meet both of the bill's principal \n     requirements. As proposed by the\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\n     Army, the initial defense would consist of 100 interceptors \n     based at Grand Forks, South Dakota. Combined with SMTS, this \n     system would be able to defend all 50 states against an \n     unsophisticated attack of up to 20 warheads under many \n     scenarios, according to BMDO. The interceptors would be armed \n     with the Army's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV). To track \n     incoming warheads, four new phased-array radars would be \n     deployed, one each in Grand Forks, Alaska, Hawaii, and New \n     England.\n       This initial defense would cost $14 billion--about $8.5 \n     billion for the ground-based system and $5 billion for the \n     SMTS space-based sensors. (The ground-based system could cost \n     roughly $4 billion less if the Air Force's proposal for a \n     Minuteman-based system was adopted.) The upper layer, which \n     would be added sometime after 2006, would employ 500 space-\n     based interceptors similar to Brilliant Pebbles--the less \n     expensive of the two types of space-based weapons. It would \n     make the defense capable of protecting the United States from \n     a more sophisticated attack of up to 60 warheads according to \n     BMDO, and would cost an additional $14 billion. CBO adds \n     another $3 billion to these estimates to hedge against \n     potential risk associated with the development programs. \n     Thus, the total cost of the layered defense would be about \n     $31 billion.\n       Potential Increases in Requirements and Costs. The bill \n     specifies that the defense shall protect the United States \n     against limited or unauthorized attacks, but does not specify \n     how big the attack might be. The high end of the range \n     reflects the costs of a system to protect the United States \n     against a more potent threat--for example, an attack that \n     could have 200 warheads accompanied by sophisticated \n     countermeasures. DoD bases its operational requirement for a \n     national missile defense on such a threat.\n       CBO assumes that the ground-based layer would include 300 \n     interceptors deployed at 3 sites and would cost $13 billion, \n     or about $4.5 billion more than the costs of meeting the \n     minimum requirements. SMTS satellites would be deployed at a \n     cost of $5 billion. The space-based layer would include a \n     combination of 500 space-based interceptors ($14 billion) and \n     20 space-based lasers ($25 billion) for maximum \n     effectiveness. Again, $3 billion is added in anticipation of \n     technological and integration problems. The total cost of \n     this high-end layered defense would be about $60 billion. \n     Except for the lasers, this system would be similar to the \n     Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) system \n     proposed by past administrations.\n       Cost Comparison. The estimate for the ground-based systems \n     described above is about two-thirds less than previous \n     estimates associated with earlier proposals, for example the \n     GPALS system. The earlier proposals focused on the \n     challenging threat of an unauthorized attack by the Soviet \n     Union. Today the focus is on smaller and less capable \n     threats--as a result, the defense's components may be \n     somewhat less capable. Past proposals also called for a \n     robust program that included substantial efforts to test the \n     systems and to reduce and manage the technical and schedule \n     risks associated with such an ambitious development effort. \n     It is unclear how much these efforts can be reduced without \n     increasing risk to unacceptable levels. But if current plans \n     must be revised to include more thorough testing and larger \n     efforts to reduce risks, and if the purpose of the defense \n     evolves into protecting against larger and more sophisticated \n     threats, costs of the ground-based systems could approach \n     those developed for systems like GPALS--thus, costs of the \n     high-end system could greatly exceed $60 billion by 2010.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 30, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: In your letter of April 4, 1996, you asked \n     about the cost of deploying the national missile defense \n     system proposed in the Defend America Act of 1996 (S. 1635). \n     I have attached the cost estimate that the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) prepared for S. 1635, which should answer \n     your questions.\n       At your request, CBO also examined the compliance issues \n     that the Defend America Act could raise with respect to the \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Because the bill does \n     not specify a missile defense system in detail, it is \n     difficult to identify precisely the possible conflicts with \n     the treaty. But some fundamental issues would arise \n     regardless of the specific architecture of the defense. The \n     bill anticipates those conflicts by requiring that the \n     Secretary of Defense report to the Congress on the problems \n     with the treaty that he expects to encounter in the course of \n     developing and deploying the defense. The bill also urges the \n     President to negotiate amendments to the treaty with Russia \n     that would permit the United States to deploy its defense. If \n     an agreement cannot be reached within one year of the \n     enactment of the bill, however, it directs the President to \n     consider withdrawing from the treaty.\n       In brief, our reading of the bill suggests that some \n     systems would violate the treaty in its current form, while \n     others may or may not. Space-based weapons would clearly \n     violate the treaty's prohibition on ABM components that are \n     based in space. Sea-based weapons are similarly prohibited. \n     Together, those prohibitions would make it difficult to \n     deploy a layered national missile defense that would comply \n     with the ABM treaty in its current form.\n       Other issues are not as clear and are often debated. For \n     example, in Article I of the treaty, each side pledges ``not \n     to deploy ABM systems for defense of the territory of its \n     country.'' Critics argue that deploying any national missile \n     defense, no matter how capable, would violate that provision. \n     But, the Army and Air Force claim that the small, ground-\n     based national missile defenses that they have proposed would \n     comply with the treaty.\n       Issues of compliance could arise even for a ground-based \n     defense that complies with the numerical and geographic \n     limits specified in the ABM treaty (no more than 100 ground-\n     based interceptors and one ABM radar, all located at Grand \n     Forks, North Dakota). The principal issue is whether the new \n     tracking radars that would be deployed in the Pacific and on \n     U.S. coasts would substitute for the ABM radar at Grand \n     Forks. Under many scenarios, particularly attacks on Alaska \n     and Hawaii, the Grand Forks radar would never see warheads or \n     intercepts because its view would be blocked by the Earth's \n     curvature. For the same reason, the radar could not be used \n     to send course corrections directly to an interceptor. \n     Instead, such a defense would use ground-based repeater \n     stations to communicate with an interceptor. According to \n     opponents, that would mean that forward-based tracking radars \n     would substitute for the ABM radar, a practice that the \n     treaty strictly prohibits. Supporters of the proposed \n     defenses counter that forward-based radars would not be \n     substitutes because the fire-control solutions and \n     instructions to an interceptor for correcting course would \n     still come from Grand Forks.\n       The degree to which the Space and Missile Tracking System \n     (SMTS) conflicts with the treaty is also being debated. \n     Critics of space-based sensors argue that they could, in \n     effect, substitute for an ABM radar. The Russians have \n     reportedly expressed similar concerns about SMTS. The \n     argument is similar to that made against forward-based \n     tracking radars: if an entire intercept can occur out of view \n     of the ABM radar at Grand Forks, something must be \n     substituting for the radar. Supporters of SMTS contend that \n     the system would be an ``adjunct'' to the ABM system, much \n     like the space- and ground-based early warning sensors that \n     the United States deployed before the ABM treaty was signed \n     in 1972. (An adjunct is a device that could not, by itself, \n     substitute for or perform the functions of an ABM radar). \n     Those early warning sensors were not limited by the treaty \n     and advocates believe that SMTS should not be limited either. \n     According to press accounts, the U.S. government reported to \n     the Congress in 1995 that SMTS might, in some configurations, \n     comply with the treaty. This document reflects a U.S. \n     position and does not imply that Russia agrees with that \n     interpretation. Differences would have to be worked out in \n     negotiations.\n       Finally, your staff asked that we examine operating and \n     support costs. We have not had time to analyze those costs \n     fully, but we can report that those costs would reach a few \n     hundred million dollars annually by 2005 when ground-based \n     systems and space-based sensors would be in place. After \n     2010, operating and support costs would increase \n     significantly because the Department of Defense would have to \n     launch replacements for any space-based systems, which wear \n     out over time. Of course, at some point new technology or a \n     reassessment of the defense situation could lead to changes \n     in the system, which could have a large impact on costs.\n       If you wish further details on our analysis, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are David \n     Mosher, who can be reached at 226-2900, and Raymond Hall, who \n     can be reached at 226-2840.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, surely the American people, who watch and \nlisten, must think we have the attention of houseflies. We are having a \ndebate here in the U.S. Senate about balancing the Federal budget, \nabout amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget, about \ncutting spending, about being frugal, about dealing with this country's \ndebt. And then immediately trotting on the floor of the Senate is a new \nproposal--by the same folks who say they lead in reducing the budget \ndeficit, lead in reducing spending--they say to us now, ``We want to \nspend an additional up to $60 billion for, yes, a star wars program.''\n  I want to correct some of the statements that have just been made. \nThere is no filibuster. The petition to invoke cloture, to close off \ndebate, was filed simultaneously with the bill coming to the floor. How \ncan someone, without even smiling about it, file a cloture motion \nbefore debate even begins? There is no filibuster.\n  We are going to have a debate on this. That is what we insist on. \nThose who want to initiate a $60 billion program without debate do no \nservice to defense policy in this country, in my judgment.\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n  Second, this bill is star wars. Here is the bill, page 6: ``Ground-\nbased interceptors, sea-based interceptors, space-based kinetic energy \ninterceptors, space-based directed energy systems.''\n  Call it what you want. It is star wars; $14 billion, my eye. We have \nspent $96 billion on star wars and missile defenses. This chart was put \ntogether by the Congressional Research Service, and we have funded so \nmany programs over the last 40 years that nobody can read this. It is a \nnational missile defense family tree that is so complex you cannot read \nit. It is a bunch of boxes and lines tracing the development of dozens \nof programs. These are the things that we have funded. This is all the \nwork done for missile defenses.\n  What we have to show for all this in this country today is one \nabandoned antiballistic missile facility--it is in my State. Over $26 \nbillion in today's money was spent on it. It was declared mothballed \nthe same year it was declared operational.\n  Are there threats against this country? You bet. What are they? A \nglass vial of deadly biological agents to be brought in in someone's \npocket, threatening a subway or a city is a threat. A truck bomb parked \nin front of a Federal building is a threat. A cruise missile armed with \na nuclear warhead is a threat. An intercontinental ballistic missile is \na threat. You can list a whole series of threats against this country.\n  Have we ever had an effective system to knock down any missile coming \nin? No, we have not. Why? Any missile launched against this country \nwill have a return address. We will know exactly where it was launched \nfrom, and this country will vaporize them. That is what our nuclear \ndeterrent has prevented from happening to our country for many years. \nThat has been our missile defense for 40 years.\n  Now, do we need to research missile defenses? Yes, we are doing that. \nWe are spending a great deal of money doing that. We spent $96 billion \non all of this to date. But I want to talk about a number of different \napproaches to defending our country.\n  The best way to defend America is to destroy an adversary's missile \nbefore it is launched. I have a piece of metal here in my hand that \ncomes from silo number 110, in Pervomaysk, Ukraine. This silo had an \nSS-19 in it. That SS-19 had 6 warheads, each of them 550 kilotons: each \nwarhead 20 times the explosive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. \nThis twisted lump of metal was part of that silo with that missile. The \nsilo does not exist anymore, because we helped to blow it up.\n  Let me show you a picture of it. This is that silo blown up, with the \nmissile gone. There is no missile there. The missile was destroyed. \nHere is a man sitting on the floor--Senator Nunn--who, along with \nSenator Lugar, with the Nunn-Lugar initiative, will, in my judgment, \nforever change the dimensions of this nuclear deterrent and these \nissues of nuclear threat by creating a program in which 212 submarine \nlaunchers are gone in the Soviet Union, 378 ICBM missile silos are \neliminated, and 25 heavy bombers gone. Do you know what is indicated in \nthis photo is today? This is silo 110. It just so happens--and it is a \npure coincidence--that the Secretary of Defense is visiting silo 110 \ntoday. The U.S. Secretary of Defense is visiting this site. Do you know \nwhat is here today? Sunflowers--not missiles, but sunflowers.\n  What we have done is destroyed a missile in its silo by destroying \nthe silo and moving the missile and warhead, and the missile is cut up \nand it is gone. That happens to be an effective missile defense. \nSenator Nunn and Senator Lugar and others who fought so valiantly for \nthis program are reducing the nuclear threat in this country.\n  I have a picture of the destruction of a heavy bomber. Here they are \nsawing off the wings. This picture shows Russians using American \nequipment to cut up a Russian bomber. That heavy bomber--it is a TU-95 \nBear bomber--could launch 16 cruise missiles against our country.\n\n  Defending America means that you get the enemy, through arms \nagreements, to reduce these kinds of weapons. The fact is what the \nother side brings to the floor of this Senate--and they can protest \nforever about it, and they are wrong--is a proposal that will threaten \nthe arms agreements by which missiles and bombers and other strategic \nweapons are being reduced now in other parts of the world. The fact is \nthey want to abrogate the arms control treaties. In my judgment, that \nis shortsighted.\n  The Ukrainian President on June 1st--a couple of days ago--certified \nthat his country, which used to have 4,000 strategic and tactical \nnuclear warheads, now has zero--zero. The Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram in the Defense Department, with the leadership of Senators \nNunn, Lugar, and others, has done a remarkable job. Is this the only \nthing we ought to do? No. It is remarkably successful. We should do \nmany additional things, but the last thing we ought to do is jump on \nthis horse and ride off into the sunset to build a $60 billion program \nthat threatens to undermine all of these arms agreements that have led \nto all of this progress. This makes no sense at all.\n  I thought you all were conservatives. You keep coming to the floor \ntalking about the deficit, and the first thing you do when we finish \nthat discussion is come to the floor with a big, spanking new, gold-\nplated weapons program that is going to cost $60 billion, a program we \nhave already spent $96 billion on according to the Brookings \nInstitution. I am telling you, it does not add up.\n  Do those who oppose the so-called Defend America Act, which is really \na star wars program, believe Americans should not be defended? Of \ncourse not. There are dozen of ways of defending America. We ought to \ndo research and deploy, and do a whole range of them, the most \nimportant of which, in my judgment, is the deployment and \nimplementation of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program initiated by \nSenators Nunn and Lugar. But there are others.\n  President Clinton says, let us do the research necessary--several \nbillion dollars. Let the system be available for deployment if we see \nthat the threat exists. And I know we have all of these claims by \nothers about Korea. Look, Korea spends from $2 to $5 billion a year on \ntheir entire defense program. We are a country that spends $270 billion \na year. There is no credible evidence that Korea has tested anything \nclose to a weapon that is going to deliver a nuclear warhead to parts \nof the United States. Worry about a suitcase bomb put in the trunk of a \nYugo car parked at the dock of New York City. That is a threat. Worry \nabout a biological agent. That is a threat. But this bill would put all \nof our eggs in this basket and say that the sky is the limit, even \nthough it is the taxpayers' money. This bill would have us embark on a \n$60 billion spending program, and when we are finished we might have \ncovered--unlikely, but maybe--one small slice of the range of threats \nthat confront this country. I think if you talk about shortsightedness, \nthis bill ranks up there with an Olympic performance.\n  Our military leaders in the Department of Defense have told us that \nthis bill would endanger our security. General Shalikashvili wrote to \nSenator Nunn to say that ``efforts which suggest changes, or \nwithdrawal, from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of \nSTART II and could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I.''\n  In other words, this bill could pull the rug out from under the very \nthing that is reducing the nuclear threat, the very thing that results \nin weapons being destroyed. A missile silo that used to hold a missile \nwith six warheads aimed at American cities and American military \ntargets now has sunflowers planted on top of it. The missile and its \nwarheads are gone.\n\n  This proposal pulls the rug out from under that kind of an approach. \nI just do not understand that proposal at this time being brought to \nthe Senate.\n  No matter what claims are made on the other side, this is not a \ndebate between those who think Americans should be defended and those \nwho believe Americans should not be defended. That is preposterous. \nThat is an absurd contention. All of us believe we ought to spend money \nwisely to defend this country's liberty. All of us believe we ought to \nmake the investments necessary to guarantee the safety of the American \npeople.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Georgia for the time. We will have more \nto discuss about this subject later, and I\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nam anxious to engage in further debate when we get to debate on the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana, Senator Coats, a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, following Senator Coats' remarks, I will \nyield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to add some \nwords to this debate. Obviously, we all believe that while we can \ndebate what the fundamental role of the Congress and the Government is, \npriorities ought to be established. This is true particularly in the \ndomestic spending areas where there is no constitutional responsibility \nof the Federal Government. However, there is a clear constitutional \nresponsibility for Congress to provide for the national defense. In \nthat regard, we are addressing what I think is one of the most \nfundamental and most important decisions that this Congress is going to \nmake in the next several days; that is, what kind of defense we will \nprovide for the United States? To date, our country has enjoyed the \nbenefit of its strategic location--surrounded by oceans east and west, \nand friendly neighbors to the north and south. Our strategic location \nhas enabled us to ensure the defense of American soil. Today, however, \nthe advance of technology, the development of long-range ballistic \nmissiles, and the proliferation of those missiles among nations who \nhave not had a history of responsible leadership poses a real threat to \nthe United States. Over the last several years we have engaged in a \ndebate over how to best address this emerging new threat.\n  The Senator from North Dakota raised the issue of other compelling \nthreats. Indeed, there are other threats Americans face from a \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear weapons delivered through ballistic \nmissiles. A truck packed with explosives, a ship cargo container that \nsailed up into one of our ports, or any number of other means of \ndelivering weapons of mass destruction are clearly threats we must take \nseriously. However, the fact that these threats exist does not mean we \nshould ignore the very real threat posed to American citizens by \nproliferating ballistic missile technology. people.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about other effective \ndeterrents. He discussed the success that Americans had with a strategy \nof deterrence through mutual assured destruction. During that \nparticular era, there were two superpowers engaged in a stand-off. \nMutual assured destruction seemed the most feasible strategy to counter \nSoviet missile threats. But, in that era, there was no threat of \nmissile proliferation such as we face today. There was a very serious, \nbut very definable, cold war between the two superpowers, each \npossessing thousands of nuclear warheads that could be used in \nretaliation against the other should a first strike be launched. As we \nall know, the strategy of mutual destruction is no longer a viable \nmeans of deterrence.\n  There is a also a moral imperative at issue with the concept of \nmutual assured destruction. Simply to say that our best protection \nagainst a missile attack that could injure or kill millions of \nAmericans is our capability to respond in kind against the country that \nlaunched the attack, violates basic moral considerations our Nation \ncould not support today.\n  I found it interesting that the Senator from North Dakota spoke of \nsunflowers now growing over former missile sites. Most of us would like \nto see sunflowers growing over every missile site, not only in the \nformer Soviet Union but in other countries around the world. \nUnfortunately, this has not been the case. More than 25 countries--\nincluding China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and India--\npossess or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles capable of \ncarrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. They are actively \npursuing ballistic missile technology for their fields--not sunflowers. \nAnd, as we all know, we have had little success discouraging these \nnations from acquiring missile technology.\n  North Korea has been developing ballistic missiles such as the Taepo \nDong II, a missile with a range of up to 6,000 miles that can certainly \ntarget Alaska and Hawaii. North Korean President Kim Jong-Il has \nreportedly ordered the development and deployment of strategic long-\nrange ballistic missiles tipped with more powerful warheads. By many \nestimates, in less than 10 years, North Korea will be able to deploy an \noperational intercontinental ballistic missile force capable of hitting \nthe American mainland.\n  The administration is ignoring these very serious trends. Instead, it \nhas adopted a wait-and-see strategy in its approach to the defense of \nour Nation. Much of the administration's position is derived from a \nrecent national intelligence estimate report by U.S. intelligence \nagencies. The NIE claims that no country will be able to acquire \nballistic missile technology capable of reaching the United States for \nat least 15 years. But NIE's choice of 15 years is based on \ncalculations most Americans would hardly find reassuring. The 15-year \nestimate is based primarily on the indigenous development of missile \nsystems, ignoring the rapid rate of ballistic missile technology \nproliferation so evident today.\n  In addition, the NIE based its threat calculations without regard to \nHawaii and Alaska. The report projects that no rogue nation will \npossess the technology capable of hitting the lower 48 States for 15 \nyears. In qualifying its estimate, the NIE discounts the more immediate \nthreat of North Korea's Taepo Dong II missiles to these States. Yet, in \nAugust 1994, John Deutch, then Deputy Secretary of Defense, testified \nbefore Congress that ``If the North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 \nmissile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at \nrisk.'' At that time, the CIA estimated that this system would be \ndeployed before the year 2000.\n  It is unfortunate that the United States today has little control \nover the proliferation of ballistic missile technology. But, the time \nhas come for us to recognize this fact and act accordingly. Mutual \nassured destruction and other strategies have come and gone. They are \nno longer appropriate for the era in which we live, nor the threats \nAmerica might face in 21st century. The administration's position of \nadhering to a policy whose assumptions are based on the perceived \nintentions of countries rather than their emerging capabilities and the \nrealities of the world today is a serious mistake.\n  Even the NIE report warns that a future political crisis in Russia or \nChina could lead to an unauthorized ICBM launch against the United \nStates. Russia today is embroiled in political turmoil resulting from \nreform and the civil war in Chechnya, while China remains in the throes \nof uncertain changes in political leadership. Both China and Russia \nhave also been actively selling technology to other nations. Indeed, \nrecent reports indicate that China is attempting to buy SS-18 missile \ntechnology from Russia and the Ukraine--technology that would \nsignificantly enhance China's ability to target American soil. \nTechnology transfers such as these give countries a major advantage in \ndeveloping indigenous nuclear weapons and delivery systems, to include \nballistic missiles. Libya and Iraq's leaders have made their desire to \nobtain such weapons quite clear, while North Korea has been willing to \noblige by selling its missiles to interested parties.\n\n  There are many other countries actively engaged in buying advanced \ntechnologies and missiles. If rogue nations are successful in buying \nsystems already developed, or can acquire the technology to build their \nown indigenous systems, the United States may well face a threat even \nsooner than expected. In testifying before Congress earlier this year, \nJim Woolsey--President Clinton's first Director of Central \nIntelligence--addressed the grave nature of ballistic missile \ntechnology, stating that:\n\n       Ballistic missiles can, and in the future they increasingly \n     will, be used by hostile states for blackmail, terror, and to \n     drive wedges between us and our friends and allies. It is my \n     judgment that the administration is not currently giving this \n     vital problem the weight it deserves.\n\n  Who is to say that the current intentions upon which the \nadministration rationalizes its position may not quickly shift to the \ndisadvantage of the\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nUnited States? Should one of these countries decide to target the \nUnited States--for the reasons Jim Woolsey cited--how will we defend \nAmerica? Reassurances that a ballistic missile defense system is under \ndevelopment will do nothing to defend American citizens, just as it \ndoes nothing to deter future aggressors.\n  Even if NIE's 15-year threat window were realistic, a strategy of \nwaiting to deploy a defensive system until we are certain we will face \nan imminent attack fails to recognize the reality that deploying a new \nsystem with advanced technology will invariably require fine-tuning. \nThis hedge strategy risks the welfare of American citizens in the face \nof a direct threat to our national security.\n  Proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical weapons and the means \nto deliver them is a dangerous game. While we must continue our efforts \nto prevent rogue nations from acquiring this technology and thus \nendangering us, we must also concede that ultimately we are powerless \nto deter the acquisition of this technology. If we cannot deter the \nproliferation of ballistic missile technology, we must at least \ndiminish the incentive for attacking the United States and nullify the \npotential consequences of such an attack. We can do this by developing \nand deploying a national missile defense system. In the end, it is the \nonly plausible strategy to protect American citizens from the future \nthreat of a ballistic missile attack. As former British Prime Minister \nMargaret Thatcher recently remarked:\n\n       Acquiring an effective global defense against ballistic \n     missiles is . . . a matter of the greatest importance and \n     urgency. But the risk is that thousands of people may be \n     killed by an attack which forethought and wise preparations \n     might have prevented.\n\n  It is the reality of the proliferation of ballistic missile \ntechnology, the capability of providing nuclear, chemical or biological \ndestruction through the delivery on ballistic missiles, and the \nproliferation of those missiles that demands we give serious \nconsideration to a national missile defense system. We are making \npositive strides in providing theater missile defense protection for \nour troops abroad. But, in my opinion, we are not taking the steps that \nwe need to take to provide that same kind of protection to Americans \nhere at home.\n  It is a risky strategy to continue to postpone the basic decisions \nthat need to be made relative to deployment of a national missile \ndefense system. We can argue over timing. We can argue over the \ndeployment. We can argue over the cost that is appropriate in \nrelationship to our budget each year. But we must not deny our citizens \nprotection from the grave potential of a future ballistic missile \nattack on the United States.\n  There is a little doubt that the cloture vote which will take place \nat 2:15 will succeed. The previous speaker has challenged us to get to \nthe debate. We will need his help in order to get to that debate. \nIndeed, we are going to need help from those who have opposed the \nproposal before us in order to get to the heart of the critical issues \naddressed in the Defend America Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also rise in opposition to the motion \nto proceed on this bill, this so-called Defend America Act. The bill is \nbad policy for many reasons. Several of my colleagues have already \nmentioned some of those.\n  First, the bill would undermine Russia's ratification of the START II \nTreaty, and undermine the implementation of the START I Treaty. These \ntreaties will destroy vastly more Russian nuclear weapons than any \nmissile defense program that is being proposed in this legislation.\n  A second reason the bill is bad policy is that the bill would mandate \nthe premature deployment of a national missile defense that we do not \nknow today how to deploy, whatever the proponents of the bill may \nargue.\n  A third very significant reason why this bill is bad public policy is \nthat it would divert many billions of dollars--the estimate is about \n$60 billion--from higher Pentagon priorities, particularly around the \nturn of the century when the Republican defense budgets fall below the \nPresident's defense budgets.\n  I do think we need to ask where the money is coming from. As the \nSenator from North Dakota said a few moments ago, it is ironic that the \neffort is being made to move ahead on this legislation the same week \nthe Senate is being asked to once again vote on whether or not to \nembrace a balanced budget constitutional amendment. We also need to ask \nat what expense to our other defense capabilities would we be adopting \nthis kind of legislation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe those other \ndefense capabilities are more important. We need to heed their advice \non this.\n  The proponents of this bill do not know what system they are \ndemanding to deploy. They do not know what it will cost. They seem at \nbest indifferent to the reaction that we would find in Russia, and at \nworst they seem to rush to embrace the demise of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty as a welcome consequence of this bill.\n  We need to ask ourselves why is this not the position of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff? Why do the Joint Chiefs put higher priority on \npreserving START I and going forward with START II and on developing \nother defense capabilities, including theater missile defenses? The \nproponents of this legislation have no answers to those questions.\n  Let me spend a few minutes talking about some of the reasons I am \ndeeply skeptical of our ability to develop highly effective national \nmissile defenses, as called for in this bill, in the timeframe that is \nset out and required by this bill. I have followed this debate fairly \nclosely since March 1983, shortly after I came to the Senate and \nPresident Reagan gave his famous star wars speech. We now know, many \nyears later, that President Reagan had essentially been sold a bill of \ngoods by the proponents of star wars. He was told that an x-ray laser, \ndriven by a nuclear explosion in space, could wipe out a whole swarm of \nattacking Soviet ICBM's. But the x-ray laser proved to be neither \ntechnically sound nor politically viable. The nuclear component of the \nSDI program was gone within a couple of years. Instead, the goal became \na nonnuclear national missile defense composed of a wide range of \nkinetic-kill and directed-energy weapons coupled with advanced space \nand ground sensors that could provide some sort of astrodome-like, \nleak-proof protection for the American people against all ballistic \nmissile attacks.\n  Mr. President, there was almost no one in the technical community at \nthe time who thought that it was possible to develop what I just \ndescribed. I distinctly remember being briefed at Sandia National \nLaboratories in the mid-1980's on their red team analyses of the \nvarious proposals being put forward as part of the strategic defense \ninitiative [SDI] by contractors. The red team always won. Nevertheless, \nwe spent billions of dollars in pursuit of this goal that not even the \nproponents of this bill support today.\n  It was not until Senator Shelby and I offered an amendment in 1989 \nthat Congress even tried to look at the component parts of the SDI \nProgram and put some priority on those that made sense, at the same \ntime scaling back those that did not. That amendment, which was debated \non the eve of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, put first priority on \ndeveloping theater missile defenses, and it called for sharp cutbacks \nin the more exotic space-based SDI systems, such as the system that was \nthen known as Brilliant Pebbles.\n  The Persian Gulf war heightened the consensus that our first priority \nshould be theater defenses, if we could come up with some type of \ntheater defenses that, in fact, were effective. The Patriot interceptor \nclearly had been ineffective against the Iraqi Scud attacks during the \nwar, as the Senator from Arizona noted yesterday. So in 1990, under \nSenator Nunn's amendment, priority was once again given to theater \ndefenses.\n  Why has it been so hard for us to come up with effective theater \nmissile defense systems? Since 1989, we have spent over $10 billion on \ndeveloping theater missile defenses. The President proposed another $2 \nbillion in fiscal year 1997, the budget that we are still working on. \nSome of these systems, such as THAAD, are now entering testing, but, \nthus far, they have not had great success in the way of hitting \ntargets.\n  Why is that, Mr. President? It is true because hitting a bullet with \na bullet is\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\na very, very difficult thing to accomplish. A theater ballistic missile \nwill be moving at up to 5 kilometers per second or 3 miles per second \nas it approaches its target. Think about that. Three miles per second. \nAn interceptor missile sent up to intercept it travels at approximately \nthe same speed and it has to maneuver so that it ends up in the same \nbreadbasket-sized space at precisely the right moment as the two \nmissiles approach each other at up to 6 miles per second. That is a \npretty good trick.\n  The Congress has been calling for highly effective theater missile \ndefenses for at least 7 years now. We have been supporting research for \nfar longer. And yet, as I said, we have not hit very much. We all hope \nthat our investments in THAAD and Navy Lower Tier and improved Patriot \nand MEADS and Navy Upper Tier will eventually result in a reasonably \neffective theater defense capability. We know that that is a capability \nour military commanders want because finding and destroying small \ntruck-mounted Scud-sized missiles before they were launched proved very \ndifficult in the Persian Gulf war.\n  However, after 7 years, in which Congress consistently approved the \nrequests for theater missile defense system funding--in fact, added \nfunds during several of those years--we still do not have a highly \neffective theater missile defense, although we, hopefully, have some \npromising candidates. Anyone who told us that theater missile defenses \nwould be easy back in the 1980's should have conceded their mistake by \nnow. Anyone who promised astrodomes for national missile defense should \nhave lost credibility with Congress and the American people a long time \nago.\n  Yet, it is that same crowd who is pushing this legislation. They are \nmuch more careful about promising astrodomes now. Instead, this bill \ncalls for deployment ``by the end of 2003'' of ``a National Missile \nDefense system that--\n\n       (1) Is capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) Will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats as they emerge.''\n\n  Seven years from now, according to this bill, we are supposed to have \nsolved a harder problem than theater defenses, namely national missile \ndefense, and deployed a system. The proponents totally disregard the \nlessons of how hard it has been to develop theater defenses over the \npast 7 years. These technological developments can-not be made on a \ncongressionally mandated time schedule.\n  We also need to ask what the threat is that is conjured up to justify \nspending this $60 billion contemplated in this bill. Is it a real \nthreat like the mobile Scuds that our troops faced in the Persian Gulf? \nThe intelligence community does not think so. Yet, the threat you hear \nthe most about from the proponents of this bill is the potential threat \nthat North Korea could develop a missile, the Taepo Dong II, capable of \nattacking the Aleutian Islands sometime soon. The proponents attack the \nintelligence community for not leaping to the conclusion that this \nthreat justifies deployment of a national missile defense now.\n  Let me put a few facts on the table about this potential threat.\n  North Korea's total gross national product is about $25 billion. That \nis less than one-third of 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product. \nIn fact, that country is bankrupt, Mr. President. Its people are \nmalnourished, if not starving. Its total defense budget is less than $6 \nbillion, which is approximately one-fortieth of our own, and yet those \nwho want to pursue a crash national missile defense system criticize \nthe intelligence community for unanimously judging that it might be \ndifficult for North Korea to develop a long-range missile in the next \n15 years.\n  If North Korea's Taepo Dong II--a missile that does not today exist--\nis the justification for this bill, it is a pretty thin justification \nindeed. But let us take this argument further. Let us give the \nproponents of this bill the benefit of the doubt. Let us say that this \nbankrupt country actually started building such an intercontinental \nballistic missile tomorrow. Are we a pitiful helpless giant incapable \nof responding? Does our $267 billion defense budget provide our \nPresident and our military leaders no options to deal with this threat? \nShould we sue for peace? Of course not.\n  The Taepo Dong II, if it ever exists, would be a large immobile \nmissile. We would know about its development immediately through our \nintelligence capabilities. And we would be able to destroy it by a \npreemptive strike long before it was ready to be launched, just as \nIsrael once dealt with the Iraqi nuclear complex.\n  If the threat is a rogue nation, like North Korea, Iraq, Iran, or \nLibya, developing an ICBM, then clearly preemption with our existing \nmilitary capabilities would clearly handle such a threat with very high \nconfidence. It is a far higher confidence level than we are ever likely \nto achieve with a national missile defense system. The American people \nwould support such a preemptive strike, just as they support today the \nthreat of preemption which Secretary Perry has made to the underground \nLibyan complex should it begin to manufacture chemical weapons.\n  There is an editorial, which I want to cite on this point, that was \nin the May 13, 1996 edition of the Patriot & Evening News out of \nHarrisburg, PA. This is an article called ``Offense is Best Missile \nDefense.''\n  The author makes the obvious point about the threat from rogue \nstates. He says:\n\n       If a nation hostile to the United States should acquire the \n     capability to send a missile our way, dare we wait until it \n     is fired to see if our missile defense system actually works? \n     Or would we in fact use other military means to go in and put \n     it out of commission before it was fired?\n       The answer surely is that you do not place the fate \n     of thousands of American lives on unproven technology of \n     uncertain proficiency. You eliminate the threat before it \n     eliminates you, a strategy that would make deployment of a \n     missile defense system pointless and redundant.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \narticle appear at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So, Mr. President, the threat of a rogue nation really \ncannot and should not be the justification for this bill and the \nexpenditure of tens of billions of dollars.\n  But let us also look at the technical side of national missile \ndefense. As the senior Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, has said many \ntimes on this floor, we do not today know how to do this, whatever a \ncontractor may claim. With ICBM's we are talking about bullets \nintercepting bullets with closing velocities of up to 10 miles per \nsecond. The President and Secretary Perry propose to continue research \nin this area at the rate of half a billion dollars per year to see if \nwe can solve the technical problems. That is an adequate amount in my \njudgment, given how little has been delivered thus far after the \nexpenditure of many tens of billions of dollars. I am from Missouri \nlike Harry Truman when I hear any promises about how close we are to \nsolving the technical problems of national missile defense. Someone is \ngoing to have to show me with real test results. I have heard such \npromises before. The American people have heard such promises before.\n  Mr. President, if the threat from rogue states is remote and capable \nof being handled by other means, as I believe it is, if we have no \ntechnical solution in hand, if we risk undermining the benefits of \nSTART I and the START II Treaty as well, then why on Earth should we \nmove ahead to pass this bill? The proponents threaten us with some \nvariation of the astrodome 30-second political spot. They feel the \nAmerican people will be outraged that we do not have a national missile \ndefense system. But it is much more likely that the American people \nwill see this legislation for what it is, a fiscally, technically, and \nstrategically unsound bill that will damage both our Treasury and our \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I believe it would be folly for us to proceed to enact \nit and the American people will not be fooled into believing otherwise. \nI appreciate the time and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    [From the Harrisburg (PA) Patriot & Evening News, May 13, 1996]\n\n                    Offense Is Best Missile Defense\n\n\namerica needs a system to protect deployed troops, but should take out \n                   attack capability of rogue nation\n\n       Should the United States develop and deploy a system to \n     destroy incoming missiles fired by a rogue state, such as \n     Iran or North Korea?\n       That is the issue in what the House leadership has dubbed \n     ``Defend America Week,'' as it considers legislation that \n     would deploy a missile defense system by the year 2003.\n       At stake, Republicans argue, is the nation's security in a \n     world where all sorts of nations are equipping themselves \n     with or seeking weapons of mass destruction.\n       Also at stake are billions of dollars, and perhaps the \n     ability of our military forces to carry out more conventional \n     missions, for the defense pot isn't likely to get much bigger \n     even if Congress votes for deployment of expensive defensive \n     missiles.\n       Is such a deployment necessary? The Clinton administration \n     proposes to spend $600 million annually for five years to \n     develop a system, but not deploy it unless a clear threat \n     emerges. No nation that might pose such a threat has the \n     capability to launch a missile that can reach American \n     shores. And the best intelligence estimate is that such \n     capability is at least 15 years away.\n       It should be noted that the administration does propose to \n     fund the development and deployment of a theater anti-missile \n     system to protect American military forces overseas from \n     attacks such as those by Scud missiles we saw during the \n     Persian Gulf War.\n       Not only is there no immediate threat that would require \n     deployment of a national missile-defense system, the so-\n     called ``Defend America Act'' doesn't even define the type of \n     system that would be developed or deployed. That suggests a \n     considerable gap between the idea and an actual system \n     capable of picking off a missile before it inflicts harm on \n     this country.\n       Indeed, one of the arguments against early deployment is \n     that the pace of technology could well render such a system \n     obsolete in the estimated three years required for it to \n     become operational.\n       The costs are not inconsequential. Deployment of even a \n     modest, single site, ground-based system could amount to $5 \n     billion, though it would be of doubtful worth. A more \n     ambitious system would cost on the order of $25 billion. A \n     multi-site system could run $44 billion or more, but would \n     also violate the ABM treaty with Russia, which limits each \n     country to one ABM site.\n       More to the point, if a nation hostile to the United States \n     should acquire the capability to send a missile our way, dare \n     we wait until it is fired and see if our missile defense \n     system actually works? Or would we in fact use other military \n     means to go in and put it out of commission before it was \n     fired?\n       The answer surely is that you do not place the fate of \n     thousands of American lives on unproven technology of \n     uncertain proficiency. You eliminate the threat before it \n     eliminates you, a strategy that would make deployment of a \n     missile defense system pointless and redundant.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

I hope we can go back and recall some of that debate because \nit started, in characterizing the threat, 2 years ago, when James \nWoolsey, who has already been identified as the CIA Director under \nPresident Clinton, who has stated that we know of between 20 and 25 \nnations that have or are in the final stages of developing weapons of \nmass destruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear, and are \ndeveloping the missile means in delivering those weapons. He said this \n2 years ago.\n  I suggest that those who look wistfully back and say, ``Isn't it \nwonderful that the cold war is over,'' that the threat could very \neasily be, and I think it is, greater than it was during the cold war. \nDuring the cold war, we had the U.S.S.R. and the United States as two \nsuperpowers. So it made some sense to some people to come up with \nagreements to downgrade nuclear capability because there were only two \nnuclear superpowers out there. But if we are talking about 25 to 30 \nnations now and we establish some type of relationship with Russia, \nsince the U.S.S.R. is no longer in existence, then we still have 25 or \n30 other nations that are building up their nuclear capability at the \nsame time we are tearing ours down.\n  Is the threat out there? The Russians have the SS-25, the SS-18, \nwhich is a MIRV'd missile, I think, with 10 warheads. They have the \ncapability of launching. And North Korea's Taepo Dong II missile that \nthe Senator from New Mexico talked about, that is something that the \nexperts say is within 5 years--and I have heard lower figures than \nthat--of being able to reach the United States. We are talking about \ntechnology that exists. We are talking about missiles that can reach \nlong distances and can reach the United States from such places as \nChina, Russia, and North Korea.\n  I also suggest that we do not need to talk about the gross national \nproduct of North Korea. That should not enter into this debate. I do \nnot care what their gross national product is. If they have a Taepo \nDong II missile that can reach the United States, it only takes one. \nComing from Oklahoma, I can tell you, one bomb is enough.\n  So when you look at the threat, I think you need to consult the \nindividuals who are the experts and the ones who said we know what \ncapability is there.\n  We have had this debate already. We had this debate in 1991. We \ndecided we would protect ourselves against the threat of a missile \nattack by the year 1996. Here it is 1996.\n  We are having this debate again. Technology has improved. As far as \nthe Senator from New Mexico's statement about hitting a bullet with a \nbullet--yes, that is a difficult thing, but there is not a person in \nthe United States who was not watching CNN during the Persian Gulf war, \nand we all saw Patriot bullets hitting Scud bullets. That was 5 years \nago. Mr. President, we can hit a bullet with a bullet.\n  When you are talking about the proper function of Government, I \ncannot think of any function that is more significant than protecting \nthe citizens of the United States.\n  We had a lot of discussion about the cost of this. I hear these \nfigures being batted around, $30 and $60 billion. The fact is we \nalready have somewhere between $44 and $50 billion invested in our \nAegis ships. We have 22 cruisers and destroyers already floating out \nthere with launching capability.\n  We want to get them upgraded so they can reach up into the upper tier \nand defend us against missile attack. I do not see anything un-American \nabout that. That money has already been spent. We have that investment. \nWe are down now to a very small amount of money that could bring us to \nthe reality of being able to defend ourselves.\n  Here is Team B of the Heritage Foundation, which is made up of a lot \nof very knowledgeable people, such as Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, former \nSDIO Director and Associate NASA Administrator, and Lt. Gen. Daniel \nGraham, the former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  We have all of these people sitting down determining the cost of \nactually coming up with a system that will protect America using the \nNavy's Aegis system. They say it is going to be somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $3 billion, plus $5 billion if we are going to field \nthe satellites we need to be able to detect where one of these missiles \nis launched.\n  To be able to use our satellites to detect a missile that is coming \ntoward the United States will cost, according to the Heritage experts, \napproximately $5 billion. If you take the CBO report and look at what \nit really says--and they talk about the figures $31 to $60 billion--\nwhat they are talking about is if you want to buy every available \nmissile defense technology there is.\n  What we are suggesting in this bill right here is that the President \nand the Secretary of Defense look at all the technology, look at the \nland-launched missiles, look at the Navy's Aegis system and space \nsystems and pick the right combination that will defend America.\n  What the CBO did was to add up the cost as if we adopted everything. \nIt is like going into a used car lot and buying every car in the lot, \nnot just the one that is going to take care of our needs.\n  So the cost is not that much. If the CBO is right, and if it is \nbetween the $30 and $60 billion--let us assume it is $40 billion--that \nis the total cost from 1997 to the year 2010. That is 14 years.\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\n So we would be taking approximately $3 billion a year.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about the fact that there was \nnot any real threat from North Korea. I suggest that the Senator go \nback and reread what Gen. Gary Luck, the United States commander in \nSouth Korea, came out and stated this year before the Armed Services \nCommittee. He said we have very serious threats. Granted, we are \ntalking about more of a theater missile problem there in Korea. But he \nsaid: With 37,000 Americans in South Korea, we need to start working on \nthis system right now because we know what the Taepo Dong II missile is \nadvancing and we know what kind of threat it will be not just to South \nKorea but to the United States.\n  So I would like, rather than to listen to someone who has very little \nknowledge about the technology that is available out there, to listen \nto those who are the experts. I also add that the experts--I was very \nproud of the four chiefs of the four services the other day coming out \nand saying that out military procurement is underfunded by $20 billion \nunderfunded--recognizing we in America are not paying proper attention \nto defending America. It took a lot of courage for them to say that.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota goes on and on talking about $60 \nbillion, $90 billion, large sums of money, as if none of that has \nalready been spent. I suggest, Mr. President, that the vast majority of \nwhat we need for missile defense has been spent, that we could take the \namount of money that has been spent and spend about 10 percent more and \nhave a system in place that would be able to shoot down an ICBM missile \nif it came toward the United States.\n  Coming from Oklahoma, I think I am probably a little more sensitive \nto what kind of a disaster can take place. I was there the day after \nthe bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. It is easy to sit \nhere, read the accounts in the paper, maybe watch TV and not be too \nimpressed with how personal this is. When you have a close friend whose \nson and daughter were in that building, were killed in that building, \nand they did not know it for 3 days; when you see the disaster, the \nmillions of dollars that were lost, the half billion dollars that was \nidentified in property damage, the 168 lives; and then you realize that \nthe explosive power of the bomb that went off in Oklahoma City was \nequal to a ton of TNT, while the smallest nuclear warhead that we know \nabout today that our intelligence community can document is 1 kiloton, \na thousand times the size of the bomb that wiped out the Murrah Federal \noffice building in Oklahoma City--I just say to those who like to keep \ntheir head in the sand, those who like to believe that there is no \nthreat out there, a lot of the experts disagree with you. And what if \nyou are wrong?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, had been on the floor and would like to speak. But he is not \nhere now.\n  Mr. KYL. If he is not here, Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona for yielding time to me.\n  The most often heard criticisms of this legislation that have come to \nmy attention and that I have read in the op-ed pieces and the \nnewspapers consist generally of three main arguments: First, the system \ncosts too much; second, we will violate the ABM Treaty; third, this is \nnot the real threat we are dealing with right now, that it is more of a \nterrorism threat, that people could bring a nuclear weapon in a \nsuitcase and put it anywhere in the United States, and that this is \nwhat we have to concentrate our attention on.\n  Let me take those arguments and just say that on the basis of the \nfacts--not the rhetoric, not the eye wash, not the double-talk, but the \nfacts--before our Committee on Defense Appropriations, we have heard of \na system that, using a sea-based system, we can deploy a missile \ndefense system with existing ships, cruisers, that are now in the \ninventory of the U.S. Navy and at sea around the world that have a \nfiring system that is capable of being used for launching interceptors. \nThis can be deployed over a 5-year period at a cost of between $2 and \n$3 billion.\n  Think about that. That is within the budget request being submitted \nby the President of the United States for missile defense. Other \ntestimony came from the Air Force. The highest ranking officers of the \nAir Force described before our committee a ground-based system, the \ntechnology for which already exists and is proven to be very promising \nin this area. The cost? $2 to $2.5 billion. Now, come on.\n  There was testimony from the Army, the highest ranking officials in \nthe Army, about a ground-based system for missile defense. One estimate \nwas from $5 to $7 billion over a period of years to deploy this system.\n  The reason those costs are so low is because we have already invested \nsubstantial sums of money. Those investments are not wasted if we will \ngo ahead and deploy a system in an orderly way, using the technology \nthat is there.\n  Second, opponents of national missile defense say we will violate the \nABM Treaty. The Defend America Act, which I am cosponsoring, along with \na number of other Senators, specifically provides that the President \npursue high-level discussions with the Russian federation to achieve an \nagreement to amend the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the National \nMissile Defense System being developed for deployment under section 4. \nIt does not say violate the treaty. It suggests that if there is a need \nto amend the treaty to keep from violating it, the President should \nwork to accomplish that objective. We do not know what the Russians \nwould say to that kind of proposal, but we ought to at least explore \nit. But to say that the Defend America Act violates the ABM Treaty is \njust not true.\n\n  Third, opponents of national missile defense say that the kind of \nthreat that we are confronting right now isn't that serious. Well, it \nis. There are some 20 countries, maybe more, who either have or are in \nthe process of acquiring missile technology capable of delivering \nlethal warheads, nuclear, biological, and other types of lethal \nwarheads over long distances that could create mass destruction, \nputting at risk, right now, our troops in South Korea, those deployed \nin other regions of the world. Our interests everywhere are threatened.\n  Now, of course, we are worried about terrorism. That is why we passed \nthe antiterrorism bill the other day. Of course, we are worried about \ndoing enough in terms of surveillance and keeping up with what is going \non and what kind of threats exist against the United States and its \ncitizens. That is why we have intelligence-gathering agencies. That is \nwhy we are urging that the President submit a request for more funds \nfor these things rather than less. So we are fighting that battle. We \nare dealing with that threat. To use as an excuse that we should not \nhave a missile defense system because there are other threats that may \nbe more obvious, does not argue, in any way, against the passage of \nthis bill. That is the point.\n  I am tired of hearing these same old arguments, dredged up, reused \nand rephrased, in the New York Times editorial page and by others \ncontributing their information through that source to this debate. I \nthink they are wrong. They are certainly not accurate.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator has 36 minutes and 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senate bill 1635, the so-called Defend \nAmerica Act, is really misnamed. It should more appropriately be called \nthe Reducing America's Security Act, because it would reduce our \nsecurity by jeopardizing the massive reductions of former Soviet \nnuclear weapons that are scheduled to take place under START I and \nSTART II.\n  Those reductions are not going to take place, we have been so \ninformed, if we unilaterally commit to deploy a system which violates \nthe agreement between ourselves and Russia, the ABM\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nTreaty. That is the bottom line. Everybody can try to wriggle away from \nthat and try to avoid that issue if they want, but we have an agreement \nwith Russia. That agreement prohibits or precludes the kind of systems \nwhich the Senator from Mississippi just described. Sea-based ABM \nsystems are not allowed under that agreement. We have been told if we \ncommit to deploy systems which violate that agreement with Russia that \nthey will not proceed to dismantle weapons under START I and they will \nnot ratify START II.\n  That is the issue which we face. Which course of action is more in \nour security interest: proceeding with huge reductions in Russian \nnuclear weapons or violating an agreement with Russia and keeping those \nweapons in place?\n  It is not whether there is a potential threat. There is a potential \nthreat. The question is whether or not we address that threat in a \nrational, reasonable way, which does not create greater dangers to \nourselves. If we address a potential threat in a way which causes \nRussia to say, ``OK, you are committing now to violate an agreement \nwhich you have worked out with us, and we are, therefore, going to stop \ndismantling our nuclear weapons under START I and we are not going to \nratify START II,'' we have not only cut off our nose to spite our face, \nbut we have produced a far more threatening situation involving \nthousands of nuclear weapons which will continue to exist, which \notherwise will be dismantled.\n  Now, that is not just Democrats in the Congress talking, and that is \nnot just the administration talking. That is the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. That is the Chiefs of Staff themselves. That is our \nregional CINC's around the world. They are telling us it is not in our \ninterest to proceed down the line of threatening an agreement which \nwill result in Russia, saying, ``OK, if you are going to have \nprohibited defenses, then, folks, we are not going to dismantle the \nweapons that we otherwise were willing to dismantle.''\n\n  Of course we want to defend against potential threats. But we do not \nwant to do so in a way which creates worse threats for ourselves. That \nis what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is telling us. That \nis in a letter to Senator Nunn, in which he tells us that the Chairman, \nthe Chiefs, the CINC's, do not approve a course of action which \nthreatens to undermine an agreement that we have with Russia.\n  His letter to Senator Nunn reads:\n\n       In response to the recent letter on the Defend America Act \n     of 1996, I share congressional concern with regard to the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles and the potential threat \n     that these missiles may present to the United States and our \n     allies.\n\n  Then he says:\n\n       Efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from the ABM \n     Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and, \n     as articulated in the Soviet statement to the United States \n     of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw from START \n     I.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       I am concerned that failure of either START initiative will \n     result in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands \n     more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both the costs and \n     the risks that we may face.\n\n  We have our highest uniformed military authority, not just the \ncivilian heads of the Department of Defense, but our highest uniformed \nmilitary authorities who have said they do not want us to commit now to \ndeploy a system by a year certain, as this bill requires. That \nunilateral commitment to deploy a system which would violate the ABM \nTreaty, as would the system which my good friend from Mississippi just \noutlined, the sea-based ABM system, that will lead Russia to withdraw \nfrom START I and not ratify START II, leaving us in a much more \nthreatening situation than the one which we would otherwise face.\n  What the Defense Department wants us to do instead is put ourselves \nin a position where we can deploy, should the threat warrant it and \nshould the costs make it cost-effective and the technology make it \nmilitarily effective. That is the so-called 3-plus-3 approach. It gets \nus to a position where we can decide within 3 years to have a deployed \nsystem within 3 additional years. But it would not commit us now, \nprematurely, to such a deployment both for the reason which I just \ngave, which is that it threatens the ABM agreement with Russia which \nhas allowed them to dismantle thousands of weapons and would cause them \nto stop dismantling more, but also from the Defense Department \nperspective, it prematurely commits us to technologies before we know \nwhat are the best technologies in order to meet this potential threat.\n  So the question is not whether we want to defend America. Of course, \nwe want to defend America. The question is how best to defend America, \nhow best to defend against potential threats, and how best to do so \nwithout creating a worse situation for ourselves. I want to emphasize \nthis fact so this does not appear to be Senator Dole and Speaker \nGingrich on the one side and the administration on the other side. This \nis the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Chiefs themselves.\n  At the end of his letter, as he emphasized, ``I have discussed the \nabove position with the Joint Chiefs and the appropriate CINC's, and \nall are in agreement.'' What they are in agreement with is the danger \nof ruining our chances for continuing massive reductions of former \nSoviet nuclear weapons by threatening the ABM Treaty, and also in \nagreement on the administration's approach which I have just outlined, \nthe so-called 3-plus-3 approach.\n  There are other threats, as my good friend from Mississippi has \npointed out. There are lots of threats, lots of terrorist threats we \nface, including threats that could come in a suitcase, threats that \ncould come in trucks, threats of chemical weapons, threats of \nbiological agents, and we must spend a lot more time and more resources \naddressing terrorist threats. We have to rate these threats in terms of \nlikelihood.\n  The head of the CIA, John Deutch, has ranked threats, and when he \nranked the threat of terrorists using weapons of weapons of mass \ndestruction, whether chemical or biological weapons or nuclear weapons, \nwith the threat of ballistic missiles delivering nuclear weapons or \nother weapons of mass destruction by rogue states, he listed the \nmissiles delivering the weapons as a far distant third. And so we, too, \nmust make decisions on allocations of resources, based on the \nlikelihood of the threat. That is part of our job in Congress.\n  Now, the CBO has estimated this Dole-Gingrich missile defense system \ncould cost $60 billion, roughly. The CBO estimate apparently is not \naccepted by the folks who insist that we accept CBO estimates on \neverything else. I think it is obvious why there is the inconsistency \nhere, and it is an inconsistency. If there is an estimate of a certain \namount by CBO, it seems to me that we ought to be consistent and say, \nOK, if we are going to accept the CBO numbers in terms of budget \ndeliberations, the estimates should be given some kind of a prima facie \ncredibility in terms of other areas as well.\n  So there is a significant cost here. Is it worth it? We do not know \nyet. The answer is that it may be, but may not be. If it creates a \nsystem which can effectively defend us from in-coming missiles, and if \nthere is a real threat of those missiles coming in, and that system \nwill not create worse threats than the ones we are considering, it may \nwell be. So we have to weigh the likelihood of the threat.\n  When is the threat likely to emerge? The CIA estimate is not in the \nnext 15 years, in terms of any new states having the capability to hit \nthe continental United States, other than Russia and China. And so we \nhave to weigh the likelihood of those threats and the cost of defending \nagainst those threats against all the other aspects that go into this \nkind of a decision.\n  We have other ways to defend ourselves. We have arms control and \nthreat reduction efforts, like the START I and START II treaties and \nthe Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that are leading to \nmassive reductions of former Soviet nuclear weapons. We have \ndeterrence, which is a very critical way of defending ourselves--\nfrequently not even considered anymore, but still it was the heart of \nthe ABM Treaty. So there are other ways in which we can and want to and \nmust defend ourselves, in addition to having some kind of an \nantiballistic missile system, as we clearly see in the case of Russia.\n  There are two nations that already have such ballistic missiles: \nRussia and China. The Russians are now reducing their nuclear weapons \nunder the\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nSTART I Treaty, and once the START II Treaty enters into force Russia \nwill make even greater reductions. These two treaties will result in \nthe reduction of two-thirds of the nuclear weapons that the Soviet \nUnion deployed at the end of the cold war. That is a huge increase to \nour security--a two-thirds reduction in nuclear weapons. Mr. President, \nI want to emphasize that the reductions we expect from START I and \nSTART II will be some 6,500 nuclear weapons that were deployed as \nrecently as the end of 1991--far more nuclear weapons than those of all \nthe other nations combined that possess nuclear weapons.\n  In addition to these reductions, the United States and Russia have \nde-targeted their missiles. That means that if there were an accidental \nlaunch of a Russian missile--which the intelligence community estimates \nto be a very very remote possibility--the missiles would land in the \nocean and not on each other's territory. So we have already taken the \nmost important step to reduce the risk of an accidental launch of a \nRussian missile by detargeting our missiles.\n  Mr. President, Americans are understandably far more concerned about \nthe threat of terrorists bringing weapons into the United States. Here \nare some polling results: 67 percent believe that it is more likely \nthat the United States will be attacked by terrorists bringing weapons \ninto the country than being attacked by nuclear ballistic missiles. \nOnly 3 percent of those polled thought the threat of ballistic missile \nattack was more likely than terrorist attack.\n  Our intelligence community has the same assessment of the relative \nlikelihood of threats to our Nation. It views the threat of a terrorist \nattack in the United States using chemical or biological weapons as \nmore likely than a ballistic missile attack. In testimony before the \nGovernmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations earlier \nthis year, Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch said that \nterrorists would be most likely to use chemical weapons to attack the \nUnited States, than biological agents, and finally nuclear weapons. \nDirector Deutch said that ``chemicals are the weapon of choice for a \nterrorist group.'' Nothing in this Dole-Gingrich legislation would do \nanything to prevent a terrorist attack, such as the Tokyo subway gas \nattack. This bill focuses exclusively on the much less likely prospect \nof a ballistic missile attack against the United States\n  And on the view of the threat and appropriate funding level, the \nsenior military leadership believe there are higher priorities that \nshould be funded ahead of unrequested missile defense funds. For \nexample, at the beginning of this year the Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil, which is made up of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and all the Vice Chiefs of Staff, sent a memorandum to the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology stating their views \non prioritizing and funding missile defense programs. The memorandum \nstates:\n\n       This memorandum is to inform you of the Joint Requirement \n     Oversight Council's (JROC) position of prioritizing a Theater \n     Missile Defense (TMD) capability over a National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) capability.\n       The JROC believes that with the current and projected \n     ballistic missile threat, which shows Russia and China as the \n     only countries able to field a threat against the U.S. \n     homeland, the funding level for NMD should be no more than \n     $500 million per year and TMD should be no more than $2.3 \n     billion per year through the FYDP [Future Years Defense \n     Plan]. Those funding levels will allow us to continue to \n     field critical TMD/NMD systems to meet the projected threats \n     and, at the same time, save dollars that can be given back to \n     the Services to be used for critical recapitalization \n     programs.\n       We believe the proposed TMD/NMD acquisition levels are \n     balanced and proportional and offer great potential for \n     achieving an affordable ballistic missile defense \n     architecture that meets our joint warfighting needs.\n\n  So these are the views of the senior military leaders. They know the \nthreat and they know what is a reasonable and prudent response to the \nthreat. They also know that there are more pressing defense needs on \nwhich to spend our limited resources than committing to spend tens of \nbillions on a missile defense system in carrying out a commitment to \ndeploy a system by 2003, without even knowing the results of \ndevelopment and testing. That is why they recommended these more \nprudent levels of spending, which is consistent with what the Defense \nDepartment requested this year.\n  The (DOD) plan is to develop our missile defense technology so that \nwe can make a deployment decision in 3 years if needed, and then be \nable to deploy a system after 3 more years, as early as 2003, if there \nis a threat that warrants deployment and if it is cost-effective. This \nso-called ``3 plus 3'' plan makes no commitment now to deploy. It \ncommits us to improve significantly our missile defense technology and \ncapability so we could deploy if and when that makes sense in terms of \nthreat and costs.\n  By committing now to building a system that will be operational in \n2003, the Dole bill could lock in the least capable technology and \nprovide us with what the Pentagon terms a very ``thin'' system. It \nwould thus deny us the ability to pick the best technology available in \ncase a serious threat does emerge. The Defense Department has testified \nto Congress that for each year beyond 2003 that we wait before \ndeploying a system we will increase the capability of the system we \nmight not prematurely commit, but develop it properly and eventually \nbuild. Since there is no threat now from rogue nations, we should take \nthe time to get it right in case we need to deploy. That is the \nPentagon's plan and we should support it and reject the Dole-Gingrich \nplan.\n  Mr. President: Let me cite the provisions of this legislation that \nare of greatest concern:\n  Section 3 states:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy by the end \n     of 2003 a National Missile Defense system that --\n       (1) is capable of providing a highly effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated threats as they \n     emerge.\n\n  Section 4 states:\n\n       (a) To implement the policy established in section 3(a), \n     the Secretary of Defense shall develop for deployment an \n     affordable and operationally effective National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) system which shall achieve an initial \n     operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2003.\n       (b) The system to be developed for deployment shall include \n     the following elements:\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks and includes one or more of the following:\n       (A) Ground-based interceptors.\n       (B) Sea-based interceptors.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n  I would point out, Mr. President, that all of the last three of these \nelements are strictly prohibited by the ABM Treaty.\n  Finally, Section 7 states:\n\n       . . . Congress urges the President to pursue high-level \n     discussions with the Russian Federation to achieve an \n     agreement to amend the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the \n     national missile defense system being developed for \n     deployment under section 4.\n\n  Mr. President, it seems clear to me that when the bill states that \nthe President would need an amendment to the ABM Treaty ``to allow \ndeployment of the national missile defense system being developed for \ndeployment under section 4'', as this bill does, it is an abundantly \nclear indication that the bill envisions a system that would not be \npermitted by the ABM Treaty. That is exactly what this bill is about. \nThe administration sent to Congress yesterday its statement of \nadministration policy concerning this bill. I will quote the first \nsentence of this administration statement. ``If S. 1635 were presented \nto the President in its current form, the President would veto the \nbill.'' Mr. President, yesterday was a historic day for U.S. and \ninternational security. We learned that the last of the nuclear weapons \nleft over from the former Soviet Union have been removed from Ukraine. \nSo Ukraine is nuclear weapon-free, as it promised. When the Soviet \nUnion collapsed it gave rise to four nations with nuclear weapons on \ntheir soil: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. In addition to \nRussia, there were suddenly three new nuclear weapon states that had \nmore nuclear weapons than the rest of the other nuclear weapon states--\nBritain, France and China--combined. Through hard work and cooperation, \nwe are on the path to making those three states nuclear weapon free. \nUkraine is to be commended for this\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\naction. But this kind of cooperative threat reduction is not possible \nwhen we threaten to unilaterally violate a key treaty with Russia, or \ntake actions that will jeopardize the huge reductions in former Soviet \nnuclear weapons. If we want to increase America's security, we should \nsupport cooperative threat reduction efforts--not threaten them. The \nSenate should reject this Dole-Gingrich legislation that would reduce \nAmerica's security.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that three \ndocuments be printed into the Record at this time. One is the letter \nwhich I have made reference to from General Shalikashvili, which I have \nquoted. Next is the document from the Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil [JROC] which has prioritized and recommended an appropriate \nlevel of funding for the theater missile defense and national missile \ndefense programs, and other aspects, which are relevant to this debate. \nLast is a statement of administration policy regarding the Dole-\nGingrich bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn. In response to your recent letter on the \n     Defend America Act of 1996. I share Congressional concern \n     with regard to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and \n     the potential threat these missiles may present to the United \n     States and our allies. My staff, along with the CINCs, \n     Services and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization \n     (BMDO), is actively reviewing proposed systems to ensure we \n     are prepared to field the most technologically capable \n     systems available. We also need to take into account the \n     parallel initiatives ongoing to reduce the ballistic missile \n     threat.\n       In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or \n     withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian \n     ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet \n     Statement to the United States of 13 June 1991, could prompt \n     Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure \n     of either START initiative will result in Russian retention \n     of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons thereby \n     increasing both the costs and risks we may face.\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     cost and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM treaty. The current National Missile Defense Deployment \n     Readiness Program (NDRP), which is consistent with the ABM \n     treaty, will help provide stability in our strategic \n     relationship with Russia as well as reducing future risks \n     from rogue countries.\n       In closing let me reassure you, Senator Nunn, that I will \n     use my office to ensure a timely national missile defense \n     deployment decision is made when warranted. I have discussed \n     the above position with the Joint Chiefs and the appropriate \n     CINCs, and all are in agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     John M. Shalikashvili.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The Vice Chairman of\n\n\n                                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Memorandum for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \n         and Technology.\n     Subject: National missile defense.\n\n       1. This memorandum is to inform you of The Joint \n     Requirements Oversight Councils (JROC) position of \n     prioritizing a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) capability over \n     a National Missile Defense (NMD) capability.\n       2. The JROC believes that with the current and projected \n     missile threat, which shows Russia and China as the only \n     countries able to field a threat against the US homeland, the \n     funding level for NMD should be no more than $500 million per \n     year and TMD should be no more than $2.3 billion per year \n     through the FYDP. These funding levels will allow us to \n     continue to field critical TMD/NMD systems to meet the \n     projected threats and, at the same time, save dollars that \n     can be given back to the Services to be used for critical \n     recapitalization programs.\n       3. We believe the proposed TMD/NMD acquisition levels are \n     balanced and proportional and offer great potential for \n     achieving an affordable ballistic missile defense \n     architecture that meets our joint warfighting needs.\n     W.A. Owens,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Thomas S. Moorman, Jr.,\n       General, USAF, Vice Chief of Staff.\n     J.W. Prueher,\n       Admiral, US Navy, Vice Chief of Naval Operations.\n     F.D. Hearney,\n       Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n     Ronald H. Griffith,\n       General, US Army, Vice Chief of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 1996.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    [This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.]\n\n     S. 1635--Defend America Act of 1996--(Sen. Dole (R) KS and 23 \n         cosponsors).\n       If S. 1635 were presented to the President in its current \n     form, the President would veto the bill.\n       S. 1635 would commit the United States now to deployment by \n     2003 of a costly system for national missile defense (NMD) to \n     defend the United States, inter alia, from a long-range \n     missile threat from countries other than the major declared \n     nuclear powers. For the reasons explained below, committing \n     the United States now to such a deployment is not only \n     unnecessary, but could be harmful to our broader national \n     defense interests.\n       The costly deployments required by S. 1635 would divert \n     vital defense funds from other more pressing defense needs. \n     The bill encourages deployment of space-based laser \n     satellites that would cost billions and would violate the ABM \n     treaty. The CBO has estimated that such an NMD would cost \n     $31-$60 billion through 2010. These amounts do not even \n     include the costs of operating and supporting such a system. \n     Such unnecessary NMD spending--within the defense budget \n     levels proposed by the Administration through 2002--would \n     jeopardize modernization efforts for other, more pressing \n     defense missions. Moreover, the budget resolutions passed by \n     the House and Senate would provide $10 to $16 billion less in \n     2001 and 2002 for defense than the Administration's budget \n     plan. Proceeding with the NMD program envisioned by this \n     bill, under these defense budget levels, would cripple \n     modernization.\n       The immediate commitment to a specific system to defend \n     against a threat that does not now exist is both imprudent \n     and dangerous. By mandating an NMD deployment decision now, \n     the bill would force the Department of Defense (DOD) to \n     commit prematurely to a technological option that may be \n     outdated when the threat emerges. The bill embraces much of \n     the failed ``Star Wars'' scheme, which depends on advances in \n     technology that are at least a decade away.\n       The Administration's Deployment Readiness Program will \n     continue to develop national missile defense technology for \n     three years--the minimum time needed to develop a workable \n     defense--after which time the United States can make an \n     informed decision to deploy a system by 2003 if so warranted \n     by the threat. The Intelligence Community has estimated that \n     there will be sufficient warning time to make this timetable \n     possible. This ``3+3'' approach to national missile defense \n     ensures that a system will be fielded with the best \n     technology available if and when the threat emerges. The \n     Administration approach also preserves the correct priority \n     in the Ballistic Missile Defense program. This program fully \n     funds Theater Missile Defense to defeat a threat that is here \n     and now, and complements a comprehensive defense against \n     weapons of mass destruction that includes prevention, \n     deterrence, and defense.\n       Finally, by setting U.S. policy on a collision course with \n     the ABM Treaty, S. 1635 would put at risk continued Russian \n     implementation of the START I Treaty and Russian ratification \n     of START II. These two treaties together will reduce the \n     number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by two-\n     thirds from Cold War levels, significantly lowering the \n     threat to U.S. national security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time during the quorum \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the Defend America Act. I won't comment on every aspect of this \nimportant legislation, but there are certain issues which bear \nhighlighting.\n  Although we in Alaska may sometimes wish we were further away from \nWashington, DC, I think the citizens in my State would be shocked to \nlearn that this administration apparently dismisses the strategic \nimportance of Alaska, the other noncontiguous State, Hawaii, and U.S. \nterritories. Have President Clinton and his advisers forgotten which \nState Japan chose to strike first, and what event drove us into World \nWar II?\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\n  President Clinton has said, ``The possibility of a long-range missile \nattack on American soil by a rogue state is more than a decade away.'' \nThis statement ignores testimony in 1994 by John Deutch, then Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, ``If North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 \nmissile, Guam, Alaska and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at \nrisk.'' Does the President really mean that Alaska is not American \nsoil?\n  As President Clinton's first Director of the CIA, James Woolsey, \nstated,\n\n       [T]he contiguous 48' frame of reference for this NIE \n     (National Intelligence Estimate), if the document is used as \n     a basis for drawing general policy conclusions, can lead to \n     badly distorted and minimized perception of the serious \n     threats we face from ballistic missiles now and in the very \n     near future--threats to our friends, our allies, our overseas \n     bases and military forces, our overseas territories, and some \n     of the 50 states.\n\n  Very few of those in opposition to this bill give much thought to the \nactual nature of the threat that currently exists. As I've mentioned, \nthe intelligence community has documented that the North Koreans are \ndeveloping the capability to strike my State of Alaska with \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. That is not to mention those \nnations with adequate current capability such as Russia and China or \nthose nations racing to gain such technology such as Iraq, Iran, and \nLibya.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues dismiss the threat from North \nKorea because that country is on the verge of collapse. I would remind \nmy colleagues of some historical facts. First, North Korea has a \nhistory of reckless, irrational acts. This is the country which \nlaunched the invasion of South Korea in 1950 resulting in the deaths of \n3 million of her countrymen and more than 33,000 American troops; a \ncountry whose agents detonated a bomb in Rangoon killing 16 South \nKorean officials; a country whose agents blew up a Korean Airlines \nflight killing 115 passengers and crew; and a country whose military \nhacked American personnel to death in the DMZ. Using missile blackmail \nmay be just the type of desperate act North Korea might try to get the \nUnited States to start talking about a separate defense treaty, \nsomething that country has sought for years.\n  Third, if anything, the United States is extending the life of the \nNorth Korean regime by providing vast sums of free oil and expensive \nnuclear reactor technology under the terms of the agreed framework.\n  So I would not be so quick to dismiss North Korea as a threat.\n  An extremely important aspect of this bill is that it would allow the \nUnited States to act in its best interests abroad without the fear of \nhaving U.S. cities held hostage by hostile nations possessing \nintercontinental missiles. For instance, during the recent series of \nChinese missile tests off the coast of Taiwan, President Clinton \nrightly sent in United States warships to stabilize the situation. \nDuring the crisis, a high level Chinese diplomat stated in a thinly \nveiled threat of nuclear missile blackmail that the United States would \nnot come to the aid of Taiwan because it was more worried about Los \nAngeles than Taipei.\n  And although we are not debating this particular aspect of missile \ndefense right now, I believe Majority Leader Bob Dole was exactly right \nin his recent speech on Asia when he called on President Clinton to \nbegin to work with Japan, South Korea, and our other Asian allies in \ndeveloping, testing, and deploying ballistic missile defenses--a \nPacific democracy defense program. I believe this concept should be \nextended to Taiwan, which we know from the recent Chinese tests of \nmissiles just off Taiwan's shores, is vulnerable to missile blackmail. \nThe United States is committed by law to providing for Taiwan's \ndefense, but thus far, we leave her defenseless to this significant \nthreat.\n   Mr. President, the United States is a global power with vested \ninterests both politically and commercially all over the world. We \nsimply cannot allow U.S. policy to be determined by those who would \npractice missile blackmail.\n  It is a fact that today in 1996, with the Soviet Union and the \nspecter of communism no longer casting a shadow over global peace, the \nworld is in many ways even more dangerous than when the cold war raged.\n  In place of a global struggle between the West and expansionist \ncommunism, we now have the proliferation of weapons and missile \ntechnology that has the potential to make every nation hostile to the \nUnited States and our allies a serious threat by virtue of simply \nbuying what they need on the open market. Despite very detailed arms \ncontrol treaties that are in place, we have seen time and again, that \nnations determined to get weapons technology usually do.\n  Let's take a look at Iraq, the world's most heavily inspected \ncountry, where United Nation's teams have been on the ground for years, \nand where we are constantly surprised by new revelations of Iraqi \nefforts to rebuild their offensive capabilities.\n  During the days of the cold war, the policy of both the United \nStates, and the Soviet Union was called MAD, or mutually assured \ndestruction. This policy was based on mutual fear. Should the Soviets \nlaunch an attack on the United States, our response would have been \nreciprocal in nature. Essentially, if you attack us, we will attack \nyou. The Defend America Act seeks to move us away from such a hair \ntrigger defensive posture. Indeed, according to the Washington Post \n``both countries have more to fear from rogue nations than each \nother.''\n  Many of those wanting to acquire ballistic missiles today, not only \nlack the stability of our old nemesis, but have actually used weapons \nof mass destruction on their neighbors and their very own citizens. \nThese same countries have also stated very publicly their desire to \npurchase weapons technology that would allow them to reach the United \nStates. Libya's Mu'ammar Qadhafi has often spoken of his desire to \n``have missiles that can reach New York'' to serve as a deterrent to \nUnited States diplomatic action.\n  Most Americans will remember watching Iraqi Scud missiles rain down \non Israel and Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. In fact, the greatest \nsingle loss of American life in the gulf war occurred during a Scud \nmissile attack.\n  The situation is so dire that the Secretary of Defense, William \nPerry, recently issued a report declaring that the proliferation of \nmissile technology ``presents a grave and urgent risk to the United \nStates and our citizens, allies, and troops abroad.''\n  The need for a missile defense system is obvious. It would provide a \nlimited defensive capability to defend the United States against a \nlimited attack by a rogue nation, accidental or unauthorized launch \nagainst the United States.\n  Lastly, I would like to address the issue of cost. This is very \nimportant because the opponents of this bill are making claims that \nhave little to do with reality. The Congressional Budget Office did \nindeed issue a report saying that a particular configuration of a \nmissile defense system could cost upward of $30 to 60 billion. However, \nif one were to actually read the bill, it does not mandate any \nparticular type of system configuration. In the letter accompanying the \nreport, CBO Director June O'Neill stated that the costs for such a \nsystem ``would be $10 billion over the next five years, or about $7 \nbillion more than is currently programmed for national missile \ndefense.''\n  The Washington Times in an article last month wrote that the \ndifference of $3 billion is a hedge amount used by the CBO against \ntechnical or schedule risks that are typically associated with such an \nundertaking. The $31 to 60 billion numbers are for something far more \ngrandiose than the bill envisions.\n  I would also like to pose one question to my friends in opposition to \nthis bill: What price would they place on Anchorage? Or Los Angeles or \nNew York or any American city? What is the price we are ready to pay to \nprotect ourselves from some maniac who finds himself in charge of \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver them?\n  I guarantee that, God forbid, should an American city ever be hit \nlike the Israeli cities were during the gulf war, there would be a hue \nand cry across this land asking why we do not put up even a limited \ndefense capability when we clearly had the know-how.\n  To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the opponents of this bill seem to know \nthe price of everything and the value of nothing. This bill will give \nthe United States a limited capability to defend itself at a modest \ncost in an increasingly unstable world and should be passed.\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to S. \n1635, the so-called Defend America Act. I know supporters call it the \nDefend America Act, but I'm going to call it what it is--the De-Fund \nAmerica Act.\n  Why do I call it that? Because its main effect will be to add tens of \nbillions of dollars, if not more, to the deficit over the next 15 \nyears, without increasing the security of the United States one bit.\n  As a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, I cannot support this bill. I do not know how anyone can \nbring this fiscal black hole to the floor, and with a straight face \nbring up consideration of the balanced budget amendment in the same \nweek. Something is wrong with that picture.\n  As an editorial in the Des Moines Register said on May 6, 1996, \n``[b]ackers [of this version of National Missile Defense] find it most \nprofitable to start with a few billion, and when it's gone, point to \nthe past expenditures as justification for future shovelings down the \nsame rathole.''\n  The same editorial says that De-Fund America Act booster, \nRepresentative Curt Weldon, told industrial supporters, ``[i]f you keep \nrelying on the facts and logic, then we're going to lose this battle.'' \nI couldn't agree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. According to the CBO, the ballistic missile shield \nmandated by the De-Fund America Act will cost between $30 and $60 \nbillion just to develop and deploy. Ironically, the very same people \nwho insisted that President Clinton rely on the CBO in the budget \nnegotiations are the ones now claiming that the CBO can't be trusted on \nthe De-Fund America Act.\n  The defunders think the CBO numbers are too high. I should state here \nthat I don't necessarily trust the CBO numbers either--I think the \nnumbers are way too low.\n  For one thing, the CBO has not yet come out with specific numbers on \nhow much this technology will cost to operate, but it has told my staff \nthat the operational cost will be an additional ``hundred of millions \ndollars a year during the early stages.'' I suspect the total figure \nwill exceed $100 billion once all of the costs are calculated.\n  Mr. President, we've already spent about $100 billion in 1996 dollars \nto build a technological defense against ballistic missiles. During the \nReagan star wars years alone, the United States taxpayers forked over \n$38 billion. Proponents of this act are quick to point out that it is \nnot star wars. And I agree. It is not even star wars. Like most \nsequels, this one is not as good as the original, and the price of \nadmission has increased. The proponents of the De-Fund America Act want \nthe taxpayers to fritter away another $100 billion on a still \nunrealistic but wimpier version of President Reagan's fantasy.\n  The defunders also claim we have no defense against intercontinental \nballistic missiles. Mr. President, it is true that we do not have a way \nto shoot down intercontinental missiles after they have been launched. \nBut we do have a demonstrated cost-effective means of eliminating them.\n  Existing arms control agreements have already resulted in the \ndestruction of over 300 intercontinental ballistic missiles and over \n800 ballistic missile launchers, and the removal of over 3,800 nuclear \nwarheads from deployment. Furthermore, these agreements have persuaded \nKazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus to give up nuclear weapons altogether. \nIn fact, just yesterday President Clinton announced that the last \nnuclear warhead was removed from the Ukraine.\n  The De-Fund America Act is like a million-dollar mansion consisting \nof a leaky roof but no walls. It may provide very expensive protection \nfrom sky-diving intruders, but it leaves the occupants unprotected from \nthe more mundane threats. Mr. President, Americans know all too well \nthat weapons of mass destruction are more likely to arrive by rented \ntruck than ICBM. Wasting $60 to $100 billion on this not-even-star-wars \nprogram is fiscally irresponsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 1635, the De-Fund America Act.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, May 6, 1996]\n\n                        ``Defraud America Week''\n\n       Somebody forgot to tell Congress that the Cold War ended.\n       Somebody also forgot to tell Congress that even if Russia \n     were still a superpower with the demonic intention of \n     destroying the United States, a ``Star Wars'' system would \n     offer little if any defense.\n       Somebody forgot to tell Congress that the nation is trying \n     to face up to its deficit problems, trying to economize by \n     dumping wasteful, illogical, unworkable projects.\n       But congressional Republicans are sailing blithely onward, \n     their vision apparently clouded by the same hypnotic hype \n     that put Star Wars on the drawing boards 12 years and 29 \n     billion wasted dollars ago.\n       They have launched an effort to deploy a national missile \n     defense system by 2003. A spending bill comes up for \n     consideration next week.\n       Total cost is unknown. Backers find it most profitable to \n     start with a few billion, and when it's gone, point to past \n     expenditures as justification for future shovelings down the \n     same rat hole.\n       Whose missiles will it defend us against? Questions like \n     that are out of order. According to a publication of the \n     Union of Concerned Scientists, Pennsylvania Congressman Curt \n     Weldon, organizer of the Congressional Missile Defense \n     Caucus, told industrial supporters last year, ``If you keep \n     relying on the facts and logic, then we're going to lose this \n     battle.''\n       The Star Wars pushers are calling next week ``Defend \n     America Week.'' A wag suggests ``Defraud America Week.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Defend America Act would put the \nUnited States on the right track to defending Americans against the \nthreat of ballistic missile attack.\n  Despite the claims of the opponents of this bill, the threat to U.S. \ncitizens from ballistic missiles today is real. China and Russia \ncurrently possess nuclear-tipped ICBM's which could strike major United \nStates cities. Press reports indicate that China is also seeking to \nincrease its ICBM force by acquiring some of Russia's SS-18 ICBM's. \nMore than 25 countries have or are in the process of acquiring weapons \nof mass destruction and the means to deliver them.\n  Yet today, America has absolutely no means of protecting our citizens \nfrom a ballistic missile strike. Even after a high-ranking Chinese \nofficial voiced a veiled threat of nuclear attack on Los Angeles, no \none seriously believes China, or any other nation, today intends to \nlaunch such an attack. But the fact remains that we cannot defend our \npopulation from the devastating effects of an accidental launch of a \nsingle ballistic missile from China or Russia.\n  If we do not act now, we will have no capability to protect the \ncitizens of Alaska and Hawaii if North Korea were to launch its newest \nmissile, the Taepo-Dong II, which may be operational in 3 to 5 years. \nAnd we are not taking effective action to defend against the \nproliferation of missiles and technology to rogue nations who are \nactively seeking to acquire them, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, and \nLibya.\n  Mr. President, ballistic missiles are the only offensive weapons in \nthe world against which our country has deliberately chosen not to \ndefend itself. Why do we have no defense against the most devastating \noffensive weapon in the world today?\n  There are several good reasons for deploying defenses against \nballistic missiles. The potential for an accidental ballistic missile \nstrike on the continental United States exists today, and future \nthreats are emerging. Providing a credible defense against missile \nattacks would serve as an additional deterrent against their \nintentional use. In addition, defenses would help stem proliferation by \nmaking ballistic missiles less attractive to potential adversaries.\n  Senator Dole recently called on President Clinton to apply to East \nAsia what the President recently discovered about Israel: missile \ndefense is essential to our allies' security. Senator Dole urged the \nformation of a new Pacific democracy defense program with Japan, South \nKorea, and our other Asian allies to develop, test, and deploy \nballistic missile defenses. With American leadership and know-how, we \ncan create an allied missile defense network that provides protection \nfor people and territory from the Aleutians to Australia. The Defend \nAmerica Act would provide the same protection for Americans at home.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration has tried to downplay the\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nthreats from ballistic missiles and the advantages of defenses by \nissuing intelligence estimates that conclude that no new missile \nthreats will exist for 10 to 15 years. This is simply wishful thinking \nthat ignores current reality.\n  President Clinton has stymied every effort of the Republican-led \nCongress to build a missile defense system for our Nation. He vetoed \nlast year's defense authorization bill which included a provision that \nwould have focused the Defense Department's missile defense program on \nbuilding a limited defensive capability for the United States as \nrapidly as possible. President Clinton has also refused to consider \nmeaningful changes to the ABM Treaty of 1972 which would permit the \ndeployment of effective missile defenses for America.\n  Now, the Senate Democrats refuse to allow a full debate on Senator \nDole's bill, the Defend America Act, which would put the United States \non a rapid track toward deploying a system to defend the American \npeople against limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \nattacks. The American people should hear a full debate on this matter.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I believe we must balance the clear need \nfor missile defenses with our ongoing efforts to balance the Federal \nbudget. We must focus on deploying an effective missile defense system \nthat is affordable within the constraints of a limited defense budget \nand which is balanced against other high-priority defense programs. But \nwe must remember that being a day late and a dollar short in addressing \nthe ballistic missile threat to this Nation could cost far more than \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that an effective defense against a \nlimited missile attack is both feasible and affordable. Opponents of \nany type of national missile defense have purposely misconstrued a \nrecent Congressional Budget Office cost estimate of the Defend America \nAct. They have chosen the highest figure contained in the CBO report \nand are claiming that it is the cost of the missile defense system \nsupported by Senator Dole and Republicans in Congress. That is patently \nfalse.\n  Senator Dole's Defend America bill says that the United States should \nhave a highly effective system to defend against limited ballistic \nmissile strikes. The bill does not specify all of the components of \nsuch a system; it leaves that to the experts at the Pentagon.\n  The CBO estimated that the missile defense system required in the \nDefend America Act would cost less than $14 billion over the next 13 \nyears--or about a billion dollars a year. That is less than one-half of \n1 percent of the annual defense budget, now about $267 billion. \nCompared to the cost of the Seawolf submarine, $2.5 billion per \nsubmarine, or the B-2 bomber, over $1 billion per aircraft, $1 billion \na year to defend all of America from the devastation of a ballistic \nmissile strike is clearly affordable.\n  The Pentagon has also proposed some very cost-effective initial \nmissile defense systems. The Air Force has proposed a 20-interceptor \nsystem that would cost about $2.25 billion and could be deployed in \njust 4 years. The Army has a more extensive 100-interceptor system that \nwould cost about $5 billion. Last year, the Clinton administration's \nSecretary of Defense said it could be done for about $5 billion.\n  The Defend America Act does state that, as threats emerge in the \nfuture, the United States should have a more capable, layered missile \ndefense system. CBO estimated the cost of a robust layered system at \n$31 to $60 billion. That estimate assumes we would decide to deploy \nspace-based interceptors, space-based lasers, and just about every \nother possible technology. But nothing in the bill requires those \ntechnologies to be included in a missile defense system, unless the \nthreat clearly justifies their deployment.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration's false confidence that \nAmerica is safe from missile attack jeopardizes the safety of all \nAmericans. The Republican Congress, led by Senator Dole, is prepared to \nprovide for America's common defense, a duty set forth in the \nConstitution. It is time we deployed a system that will defend \nAmericans at home.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we need to vote on a \nmotion to proceed to legislation dealing with an issue so critical to \nAmerica's future as national missile defense. In his speech to the \nCoast Guard Academy, the President stated that he supports missile \ndefense. Yet, today I expect that a majority of the other side of the \naisle--at the Clinton administration's request--will vote against the \nmotion to proceed to the Defend America Act. The fact is that the \nPresident speaks of his support for national missile defense, but acts \nin opposition to it. Last year the President vetoed the Defense \nauthorization bill specifically citing the provision making it U.S. \npolicy to deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. Many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle also profess their support of \nmissile defense but are quick to add that they cannot support this \nbill. It is hard to understand their reasons. They cite technological \nquestions, mention costs, but ignore the fact that this bill puts the \nvery decision of what system is chosen in the hands of President \nClinton's own Secretary of Defense. That leads me to one conclusion: \nThe Clinton administration and its allies seek to avoid debate on \ndefending America. This is unfortunate and irresponsible. I believe \nthat an open debate and discussion on this national security issue is \nvitally important because there are many misconceptions--about the \nthreat our Nation faces, about the present state of our missile defense \nprograms, about the cost of an effective national missile defense \nsystem.\n  The greatest misconception held by a majority of the American people \nis that the United States can defend itself against ballistic missile \nattack. Most Americans think that if a ballistic missile is fired at \nthe United States, we can shoot it down. The truth is, we cannot. We \nhave no defense--I repeat--no defense against ballistic missiles.\n  As we enter the 21st century, there is no greater threat to our \nNation, than that posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. The list of countries \nacquiring chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and ballistic \nmissile technology numbers around 25 at present--and is steadily \ngrowing. President Clinton's former CIA Director, Jim Woolsey, \ntestified at length to the Congress on the nature of the proliferation \nthreat and was critical of recent intelligence estimates which were \nnarrowly focused and based on questionable assumptions. You would not \nknow from some of today's remarks by opponents of the Defend America \nAct that the cold war is over. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Yet, \nthe Clinton administration, some on the other side of the aisle--and \neven some members of the press--are acting as if we are still in the \n1970's and 1980's. They speak of star wars, space shields, mutual \nassured destruction. But, the world has changed. We must look to the \nfuture, not the past.\n  I would like to quote from one of the key Clinton administration arms \ncontrol experts, Mr. Bob Bell. He is quoted in today's Washington Post \ndefending changes being made to the Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] \nTreaty, saying ``* * * were we going to take account of this change in \nthe stra- tegic situation over the last five years * * *?''\n  That is what we are talking about here--taking account of the change \nin the strategic situation. This bill recognizes that the threat our \ncountry faces has changed and it seeks to respond to it in a measured \nand responsible fashion.\n  The Defend America Act does not require abrogation of the ABM Treaty. \nIt urges the President to negotiate with the Russians on changes to the \nABM Treaty--just as the administration has been doing with other arms \ncontrol treaties only at the Russians' request. Which makes me wonder \nif the Russians asked for changes to the ABM Treaty would the Clinton \nadministration have a different position?\n  As for our ability to defend America--there should be no doubt that \nwe have the technological capability to effectively defend our citizens \nfrom the growing threat of ballistic missiles. What is needed is the \nwill and leadership to deploy an effective national missile defense \nsystem by 2003. A national missile defense system cannot be built \novernight. The development and production of new tanks, new\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nfighter planes takes years. And, when these new weapons systems, for \nexample the Stealth fighter, are finally deployed they are not \nobsolete.\n  Finally, on the matter of cost. The CBO estimates are so wide ranging \nthat they are almost irrelevant as a guide to decisionmakers. We need \nto look at our defense needs and affordability. And an effective \nnational missile defense system can be deployed affordably. One can add \nany number of unnecessary requirements to a number of weapons system \nthereby making them unaffordable. This is no different than building a \nhouse. A family of four probably needs a three bedroom home--not a 10-\nbedroom mansion. This does not mean that a 10-bedroom house cannot be \nbuilt--if one has the money.\n  Mr. President, let us get past the distortions and the hollow \nrhetoric and move toward a serious debate on defending America. I would \nlike to quote from a great western leader, former Prime Minister \nMargaret Thatcher:\n\n       With the collapse of the Soviet Union there was also a \n     dispersal of weapons of mass destruction and of the \n     technologies to produce them. This has gone much further than \n     we envisaged; and it now constitutes quite simply the most \n     dangerous threat of our times. Yet there is still a \n     conspiracy of silence among Western governments and analysts \n     about it.\n\n  Mr. President, let us end the conspiracy of silence. The American \npeople deserve better. The most basic responsibility our Government has \nto its citizens is to protect them from harm. To ignore the changing \nworld and cling to past thinking is inexcusable.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to present some brief remarks \nabout the latest Republican missile defense proposal, the Defend \nAmerica Act. Though I have spoken at some length on missile defense \nissues and the Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty--see Congressional \nRecord, September 6, 1995, p. S-12659-12667, and August 3, 1995, p. \n11253-11255--I want to take this opportunity to explain how it is not \nonly possible for a patriotic U.S. Senator to vote against a bill \nbearing such a proud title, but to do so without hesitation.\n  In good conscience, I just do not believe that the national security \ninterests of the United States would be advanced by this legislation \nand would like now to outline my reasons why I have come to this \nconclusion.\n\n\n                             the abm treaty\n\n  First, I believe the ABM Treaty is worth preserving. This bill sets a \ncourse that will lead inevitably to a U.S. departure from that treaty. \nthis is reason enough to oppose this bill.\n  The ABM Treaty has advanced U.S. security interests and it has done \nso without unilaterally restricting America's ability to defend itself, \nas some of the treaty's critics have suggested. Critics forget that the \ntreaty is bilateral and has substantially restricted Russia's freedom \nboth to deploy its own defenses against or strategic missiles and to \nproliferate strategic missile defense systems to other countries. The \ndemise of the ABM Treaty would release Russia from those restrictions. \nThe treaty has worked to help preserve and stabilize nuclear \ndeterrence, which remains a vital element in maintaining our national \nsecurity even in a post-cold-war world.\n  I do not believe that the treaty has unduly restricted U.S. missile \ndefense options. We have already spent a fortune on missile defense and \nhave little to show for it. A recent study by the Brookings Institution \nhas concluded that America has already spent some $99 billion dollars \non missile defense since 1962. and contrary to the blanket claim by \nsome of the proponents of the pending legislation, our Government is \naggressively working to improve U.S. defenses against theater missile \nattacks. Indeed, it is the present administration that is spearheading \nour national effort to place theater missile defense at the forefront \nof our missile defense priorities. Because the ABM Treaty does not \nprohibit the United States from investing in theater missile defenses, \nthe treaty is an inappropriate target of the repeated Republican \nattacks we have been seeing in recent years.\n  The ABM Treaty is not unchangeable. It has specific provisions for \nconsultations leading to amendments of the treaty. These provisions do \nnot include, however, the freedom for one side to pass legislation \nunilaterally reinterpreting key provisions of the treaty. The current \nbill, however, accelerates the deployment of antiballistic missile \nsystems that have capabilities against strategic ballistic missiles. It \nalso specifically includes air-based, space-based, and all ground-based \ninterceptors as elements of the national missile defense architecture, \ndespite the requirement in the ABM Treaty that such systems shall not \nbe developed, tested, or deployed. I believe that America's interests \nare best preserved by sticking to the consultative procedures provided \nin the ABM Treaty and for adapting the treaty to changing conditions \nonly via this process of mutual agreement.\n\n\n                                  cost\n\n  Enough has been said and written about the sky-rocketing costs of \nmissile defense. I will not add much to this discussion other than to \necho the concerns that people across the Nation have been expressing \nabout the staggering $99 billion that the Brookings Institution has \nestimated that the United States has already spent since 1962 on \nmissile defense systems. This, coupled with the Congressional Budget \nOffice's recent estimate that the Defend America Act will cost the U.S. \ntaxpayer as much as another $60 billion--and this does not include \noperation costs--leads to a form of ``sticker shock'' that comes close \nto rivaling GAO's estimated $250 billion that will be needed to clean \nup our nuclear weapons complex.\n  It is worth noting here that the current U.S. funding levels and \npriorities for missile defense have been solidly and consistently \nsupported by both the military and intelligence communities.\n\n\n                               the threat\n\n  Thanks to the leadership of this administration, we are focusing our \nmissile defense expenditures on real threats, that is to say, theater \nmissile threats, rather than nonexistent ICBM threats from so-called \nrogue nations that our entire national security establishment continues \nto define as long-term in nature. This threat definition has the \nsupport of the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other top \nU.S. national security officials throughout the Government. \nIncidentally, it also has the overwhelming support of editorial opinion \nfrom newspapers from across the country.\n  The Defend America Act, however, operates from a fundamentally \ndifferent set of assumptions. It assumes the present existence of a \ngrave missile threat to America's homeland and it presumes that the \nbest way to address missile threats is via expensive taxpayer-funded \nmissile defense projects.\n  Nobody disputes that missile proliferation is a danger that America \nmust take seriously in the years ahead, and indeed, it is a deep \nawareness of this threat that has driven a wide range of U.S. efforts \naimed at the nonproliferation of ballistic missiles. Our approach is \nnot driven narrowly by the dream of a technical fix--which will \nalways remain out of reach--but a combination of technological, \npolitical, and diplomatic efforts not just to defend ourselves against \nimminent attacks, but more importantly, to prevent the acquisition of \ndestabilization missile systems in the first place, to retard or \nreverse the growth of existing missile systems, and to eliminate \noutright missile systems via multilateral negotiations.\n\n  With respect to dealing with the missile proliferation threat, let me \nput it this way: the best Defend America Act is one that would \nstrengthen export controls, strengthen sanctions, strengthen \nmultilateral regimes, strengthen transparency of missile projects \naround the world, eliminate destabilizing missile systems, and improve \nU.S. capabilities to collect and to analyze data about missile \nproliferation. Yet there is absolutely nothing in this bill that \naddresses this integrated, global approach to the problem. Instead, the \npresent bill proposes to force the President to throw vast sums of \nmoney to deploy technical fixes that are neither fixes nor based on \nproven technology.\n  Small wonder that proponents of the proposed legislation are finding \nthemselves defending the Defend America Act rather than elaborating a \nnew road map for addressing the missile threat in a more comprehensive \nmanner. A legislatively mandated deployment of a\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nnational missile defense system by the year 2003 would actually \nincrease the threat to the United States--it would jeopardize the \ncapabilities of our nuclear deterrent force, it would be accompanied by \nan expansion of the offensive nuclear arsenals of both Russia and the \nUnited States, it would probably mean the end of the START process of \nstrategic arms reductions, it would eliminate all hopes of getting \nnuclear arsenals, and it could well jeopardize the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, as more and more countries come to realize that \nthe nuclear weapon states are not serious about implementing their arms \ncontrol disarmament responsibilities under the treaty. To this extent, \nthe Defend America Act resembles more accurately an Attack America Act.\n  America has many options available to address the missile threat \naside from the nostrums offered by star wars. Diplomatically, we are \nworking to reduce and to reverse the proliferation of all weapons of \nmass destruction. Militarily, we are investing in the finest \nconventional military capabilities that exist anywhere on Earth, and \nthey are backed up by the finest global intelligence capabilities on \nEarth. Why must we continually denigrate or short change these \ncapabilities in congressional debates on missile defense? Advocates of \nthe pending legislation appear sometimes to believe that America just \nhas no option to address missile threats other than buying missile \ndefense hardware. I believe we should be voting here today to expand \nour effort on the diplomatic front to address these threats, while \nmaintaining our conventional military and intelligence capabilities, \nbut there is nothing in this bill that would justify such a vote.\n\n\n                               technology\n\n  It is an extremely difficult and often underestimated challenge to \nuse a missile to shoot down another missile. As I have mentioned \nearlier, the $99 billion our country has already spent on missile \ndefense has not yet produced any comprehensive or reliable defense \nagainst incoming strategic missiles. It is far easier to prevent \nmissile attacks by eliminating missiles, preventing their \nproliferation, and developing multilateral sanctions and export \ncontrols, than it is to develop and deploy a magic missile shield that \nwould span our vast country.\n\n  Even the theater missile systems--including THAAD, Navy Lower Tier, \nNavy Theater-Wide, and MEADS--that are called for in this legislation \nrequire substantial additional research and testing before any \nresponsible deployment would be possible. PAC-III is the only one of \nthe many systems identified for deployment in this bill that will be \nready for deployment anytime soon.\n  The administration has its priorities straight and I believe these \npriorities are in line with what most Americans would regard as \nprudent--we must address current threats first and keep our powder dry \nin the event future threats arise. We must redouble our diplomatic \nefforts to ensure that those threats do not arise. The current bill \nwould not only aggravate the foreign missile threat, for the reasons I \nhave discussed earlier, but would compel the President to deploy \nexpensive and unproven missile defense systems.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  For all the reasons above, I cannot support this legislation. Yet the \ndebate today and various foreign and defense policy debates in recent \nmonths has revealed not only some severe shortcomings in this \nlegislation. The debate also reveals the apparent inability of the \nRepublican Party to come up with a comprehensive, integrated plan of \naction to guide America's military and diplomatic priorities over the \ncourse of the last Presidential term of this millennium.\n  Where does the Republican Party stand on nonproliferation? What does \nit have to offer to strengthen export controls?\n  What is it doing to toughen U.S. sanctions and ensure their \nimplementation? Where are the Republican votes when we need them when \nit comes to strengthening sanctions and export controls?\n  What is it proposing to address proliferation threats arising from \noutside the narrow domain of Russia and the rogue regimes, a field of \nvision which features a blind eye as its prominent characteristic?\n  What is it offering to strengthen international organizations and \nregimes to prevent proliferation or to increase its costs?\n  While the administration proceeds with diplomatic efforts to curb \nNorth Korea's nuclear and missile programs, what besides SDI do the \nRepublicans have to offer that stands a better chance of addressing \nthese threats?\n  What does it propose to do about the ongoing arms race in South Asia \ninvolving nuclear weapons and missiles, and how will its SDI schemes \nprotect our allies, including Israel, against threats from weapons of \nmass destruction that are not delivered by missiles?\n  What does it offer to address the grave threats posed from expanding \ninternational commercial uses of plutonium, one of the deadliest \nelements on Earth?\n  The answer, unfortunately, is absolutely nothing. I stand ready to \nwork closely with my fellow colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto join in forging effective responses to these threats. I know such \ncooperation is possible; indeed, none of the nonproliferation \nlegislation that I have authored over the years would have been \npossible without it. But I hardly believe that there is anything in the \nDefend America Act [DAA] that offers any basis whatsoever for forging a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  Because of this, Mr. President, I believe that history will relabel \nthe DAA as DOA.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago, the Congressional \nBudget Office issued a $60 billion cost estimate for the Defend America \nAct--an ill-advised Republican effort to resurrect the discredited star \nwars missile defense system. Several days later, House Republicans \nresponded to this bloated price tag by doing the right thing. They \npulled the bill from floor consideration, and a bad idea might have \nfallen by the wayside had not the majority leader picked up what his \nHouse colleagues rejected as imprudent and scheduled a Senate vote on \nit for today.\n  One can only speculate about the motivation behind this vote. But \nwhether it is election-year politics or simply misplaced priorities, \nthe Senate's course should be clear. The Defend America Act threatens \nour national security and undermines essential efforts to balance the \nfederal budget. The Senate should vote it down.\n  The grossly misnamed Defend America Act would be more appropriately \nentitled the Jeopardize America Act. The bill would direct the \nDepartment of Defense to deploy by 2003 a national missile defense \nsystem that allegedly would defend the United States against limited, \nunauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks. That system, \naccording to its promoters, could be ``augmented over time to provide a \nlayered defense against larger and more sophisticated threats as they \nemerge.''\n  Sound familiar?\n  The bill has a certain tinny ring about it. Look closely and you will \nsee that the Defend America Act is really the fifth variant of Ronald \nReagan's failed star wars experiment. To implement this proposal, the \nact calls for changing or withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in order to \npermit the deployment of a combination of ground-, sea-, and space-\nbased components--a clear revival of the star wars program that \ndisappeared with the end of the cold war.\n  All of this is particularly disturbing when you consider that \nenactment of this legislation is both harmful to United States-Russian \nrelations and, according to our own military and intelligence experts, \nunnecessary to combat the threats we are likely to face in the next \ndecade or more.\n  The Russians have been very clear in their views on unilateral \ntampering with the ABM Treaty to facilitate the deployment of a \nnational missile defense system. In a May 1 letter to Congress, General \nJohn Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:\n\n       Efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from the ABM \n     Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and . \n     . . could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I. I am \n     concerned that failure of either START initiative will result \n     in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands more \n     nuclear weapons thereby increasing both costs and risks we \n     may face.\n\n  Compounding the arms control concerns is the timing. The Senate vote \non\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\nDefend America is scheduled just 2 weeks before the Russian elections \nso crucial to that country's continued peaceful transition to \ndemocracy. We have to be concerned that the Defend America Act hands \nthe Communists a pre-election gift with its distinctly unpropitious \necho of cold war antagonisms.\n  What is worse, our military and intelligence experts say such \nrisktaking is not warranted. According to public accounts of the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, a classified consensus report by all of \nour intelligence agencies, ``no country other than the major declared \nnuclear powers will develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in \nthe next 15 years that could threaten the contiguous 48 states and \nCanada.''\n\n  The irony of a defense system that actually threatens our security is \nonly part of the story. Immediately after the first vote on the Defend \nAmerica Act, the Senate is scheduled to vote on the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. That strikes many Senators on both sides \nof the aisle as an odd sequence of events. One moment we are voting on \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget; the next we are \nraising the deficit by tens of billions of dollars.\n  Since the mid-1980's, Congress has spent nearly $40 billion on \nballistic missile defense, and all we have to show for it are canceled \nchecks from defense contractors. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimate of an additional $60 billion for this latest version of a \nhighly complex, interwoven system is charitable. It covers only the \ncosts to acquire the system. It fails to include either the costs to \noperate this system or cost overruns. And, if history is any guide, \ncost overruns alone for a system of this complexity could easily double \nthe estimate.\n  Who will pay this tab?\n  Of course, in the long run it will be the American taxpayers. In the \nshort run, however, either the deficit will be increased, spending will \nbe slashed on important domestic priorities such as education and the \nenvironment, or the Defense Department will have to juggle its own \naccounts. To accommodate such a huge expense, more conventional defense \npriorities such as readiness, procurement and force structure may \nsuffer.\n  There is a better, less expensive and more effective way to do the \nsame job.\n  The President's national missile defense policy also meets any threat \nby 2003 but in a much wiser and far more fiscally responsible manner. \nIt beats the Republican plan hands down on three counts.\n  First, it's superior common sense. The President believes that, as \nSenator Sam Nunn notes, we should ``fly before we buy.'' At a minimum, \nwe should look before we buy. Under the President's plan, we would \ncontinue to develop the technologies for a national missile defense \nsystem, then assess the situation, and deploy it only if it is needed.\n  Second, it's superior technologically. The President's policy would \nallow us to develop more capable and cost-effective defense systems \nthat can meet the exact nature of the threat as it emerges.\n  Third, it's superior diplomatically. The President's approach would \ngive us time and latitude to negotiate amendments to the ABM Treaty \nwith the Russians that allow us to continue on the path of reducing \nMoscow's nuclear arsenal. It would not rush us headlong into an \ninternational arms control crisis.\n  Even the Republican revolutionaries in the House had the wisdom to \nsee that this bill would commit our Nation to an unwise, unaffordable, \nand dangerous policy. They scrapped it because the Defend America Act \nis indefensible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5715-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5738-S5741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DEFEND AMERICA ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is revisiting the star \nwars system of the 1980's, renamed for the 1990's as the Defend America \nAct. It was a bad idea then and it is a bad idea today.\n  The suggestion in the title Defend America Act is that to defend \nAmerica requires nothing more than deploying a national missile \ndefense. In reality, this legislation would pour exorbitant sums into \nbuilding a missile defense system that would make our Nation more \nvulnerable to missile attack, while at the same time ignoring the more \nlikely threats to our territory and citizens. The Defend America Act \nmisses the point, and at no small cost to the American taxpayer.\n  The bill requires the Defense Department to deploy a national missile \ndefense by 2003. This approach has several flaws. First, the threat \nfrom limited missile attacks against the United States is remote. \nThroughout the cold war, when the superpowers were antagonists and had \nfar larger nuclear arsenals than they field today, we chose not to \ndeploy missile defenses because the cost did not justify the protection \nthey could provide.\n  Why should we decide to deploy missile defenses now, when the cold \nwar is over, when we have far more cooperative relations with Russia, \nand when they have a much smaller superpower arsenal? The Secretary of \nDefense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff state that now is not the time to \ndeploy a national missile defense. But the Republicans reject that \nadvice and want to build this wasteful system.\n  The second flaw in this bill is that deploying a missile defense \nsystem now will put U.S. policy on a collision course with the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty. The bill promotes the use of ABM components \nprohibited by this important treaty. Moreover, the bill recommends \nformal withdrawal from the treaty if the Russians fail to agree within \na year to re-write the treaty to permit a national missile defense. \nProvisions like these send a strong signal to the Russians that \ncooperation to achieve nuclear arms reductions is not a United States \npriority. The passage of this bill would put other nations on notice \nthat we do not take our treaty obligations seriously.\n  Members of the Russian Parliament have stated that they will oppose \nratification of START II if the United States takes steps to develop or \ndeploy ballistic missile defenses in violation of the ABM Treaty. By \nendangering the prospects for START II ratification by Russia, the \nMissile Defense Act will ensure that we will face many thousands more \nRussian nuclear weapons in the near future than if arms reductions are \nimplemented. Discarding the ABM Treaty would reverse the logic of \ndeterrence and arms control that Republican and Democratic Presidents \nhave pursued for the last four decades.\n  Further, the current threat does not justify the multi-billion dollar \nexpenditures required to field a national missile defense by 2003. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the total acquisition cost \nof this program will range from $31 to $60 billion, and cost billions \nmore to operate. At a time when we are trying to balance the budget and \nmeet essential needs, it is impossible to justify this massive new \ndefense expenditure.\n  Although this bill purports to defend America, it fails to address \nthe most pressing threats to American security. The World Trade Center \nand Oklahoma City bombings remind us that terrorist use of nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons on American soil remains a far greater \nthreat than a ballistic missile attack by a foreign nation. Loose \ncontrols on nuclear material from the former Soviet Union raise the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation by hostile nations or groups. The \npolicies--and expenditures--contained in this bill in no way address \nthese vital threats.\n  In contrast, the Clinton administration's defense policy addresses \nthese varied threats. First, it takes specific steps to increase \nnuclear safety. In April in Moscow, the G-7, Russia, and Ukraine met at \na nuclear safety summit to discuss means of increasing controls over \nnuclear materials and defending against nuclear smugglers. The \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, sponsored in Congress by Senators \nNunn and Lugar, achieved to the removal of thousands of nuclear \nwarheads from former Soviet arsenals and the destruction of hundreds of \nmissile launchers, and has safeguarded vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear \nmaterials.\n  The Clinton administration also addresses ballistic missile threats, \nbut in a more sensible fashion. The Defense Department supports theater \nmissile defense programs to defend our forces in the field. To deal \nwith the possibility of a future ballistic missile threats to U.S. \nterritory, the Pentagon supports an affordable level of spending on \nanti-missile defenses. This program, called 3+3, will ensure that 3 \nyears from now, we will be able to decide\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nwhether to deploy a missile defense system that could be in place in 3 \nyears. Our senior military leadership agrees that this is the most \nsensible way to protect against unforeseen missile threats.\n  The Defend America Act would spend money we don't have to defend \nagainst threats that don't exist. We need a strong defense, but we must \nprepare to meet real threats. Failure to do so will end up wasting \nbillions of taxpayer dollars. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Conrad from North Dakota \nwanted to speak. We had set aside certain time for him. The debate was \noriginally scheduled to conclude at 12:30. I wanted to serve notice \nthat Senators on our side of the aisle or on this side of the question \nthat would like to speak, they need to come over momentarily so that we \ncan get back to the original time schedule, which is 12:30. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when our side has 4 \nminutes of time remaining. Rather than waiting, I will make some \nremarks at this time. As Senator Nunn said, if others wish to speak, \nthey should come to the floor immediately.\n  Let me just respond to the key point that Senator Levin made because \nit is an important question. It is what the effect would be as a result \nof the United States developing and deploying a national missile \ndefense--what the effect would be on the START I and START II Treaties. \nThese are the two treaties that called for the United States and Russia \nto reduce our nuclear inventories. Under START I, we would bring the \nnumber of warheads down to, I believe, 6,000. And 6,000 warheads is \nstill a lot of warheads. That is why the U.S. Senate has also ratified \nthe START II Treaty, which would take it down below that to, I think, \n3,500 warheads. And 3,500 warheads is still a lot of warheads, but the \nRussian Duma has not even ratified START II yet.\n  The argument I find curious, and which I characterized as \n``startling'' a while ago, is that the United States Senate would be \ndeterred from acting to defend America on the basis that the Russians \nmight violate the START I Treaty by refusing to reduce their warheads \nto the required 6,000 level under START I, if the United States should \ntake action--which is perfectly legal--which does not violate any \ntreaty whatsoever, but which provides for our defense against ballistic \nmissile attack. I find that a very curious notion. But, more \nimportantly, it does not seem to be a reason for the United States not \nto act. If we cannot act to defend ourselves because we believe that \nsomeone else will, as a consequence, violate a treaty that they have \nwith us, then of what worth is that treaty? And of what worth would a \nfollow-on treaty be? If people believe that the Russians are going to \nviolate the START I Treaty if we develop a ballistic missile defense \nsystem--which is totally legal--then how valuable is it for the \nRussians to sign onto a START II Treaty, which would bring their \nwarheads down even more?\n  This is not a matter of either/or. I agree with my friends on this \nside who say it is desirable to bring those numbers of warheads down, \nto chop up the bombers, and to close the missile sites. That is a good \nthing. And it comes side by side with defending America. We still have \na defense budget. We are still defending ourselves. Ballistic missile \ndefense is one of those areas of defense that we have been providing \nfor. One of my colleagues said we have already spent a lot of money in \nthat area. It is true. All we are saying is let us spend just a little \nbit more money and provide an actual system that will defend America. \nIt does not violate any treaties, and there is no reason for the \nRussians to be concerned that, as a result of this, they should begin \nviolating treaties that they have signed with the United States. So it \nseems to me that is not a good argument to make against this bill.\n  The bottom line here is this is the Defend America Act. The majority \nleader, Bob Dole, has asked that we be able to vote on this, and this \nafternoon we are going to have a vote to decide whether we are going to \nvote--in other words, a vote to invoke cloture--to stop debate for the \ntime being and actually begin debate on the bill so we can eventually \nbring it to a vote up or down. Some of my colleagues would prefer not \nto vote on the bill. I would prefer that they vote either yes or no. \nThey do not have to agree with us that the Defend America Act is a good \nidea. We ought to at least be able to get a vote on the bill. The vote \nthat is going to occur this afternoon is not a vote on the Defend \nAmerica Act. It is simply a vote on whether we should proceed to \nconsider the Defend America Act. I hope that our Senate colleagues \nwould at least agree that we can go that far even if they do not want \nto end up voting for it for the reasons articulated.\n  Let me reserve the remainder of time on this side, and again urge \nSenators if they wish to speak on the bill, they need to get here \nbecause the original time was to expire at 12:30. We have extended that \nfor 10 or 15 minutes. If Senators are not here to speak, we will close \ndebate on the bill before long.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 21 minutes and 54 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. If there are any other Senators that would like to speak, I \nwould certainly invite them to come over at this time.\n  In brief response to my friend from Arizona, he mentioned that those \nof us who have expressed some concern about the relationship between \nwhat we perceive to be a participatory breach of the ABM Treaty as \ncontained in the Dole-Gingrich bill, and the Russians--it will be \nnecessary to continue to draw down their missile and nuclear weapons \ncategory as contained and required in START I, and as will be required \nin START II, if ratified--that there is this connection in the Dole-\nGingrich bill, and anyone virtually reading this bill and who is \nfamiliar with the ABM Treaty would consider this to be tantamount to \nnotice that the ABM Treaty is going to be breached.\n  In section 4(a)(1), little (b) under section 4, very clearly the \nsystem to be developed for deployment shall include the following \nelements: No. 1, an interceptor system that optimizes defensive \ncoverage of the continental United States, and so forth, and includes \none or a combination of the following: (a) ground-based interceptors; \n(b) sea-based interceptors; (c) space-based kinetic energy \ninterceptors; (d) space-based direct energy interceptors, and so forth.\n\n  Three out of the four of those named would violate directly the ABM \nTreaty. I do not think the ABM Treaty is sacred ground. I believe there \nought to be modest amendments to the ABM Treaty.\n  As I suggested in my remarks yesterday, if the Senator wants to carry \nout the spirit of his remarks which is saying for the Russians we are \nnot going to violate the ABM Treaty and now you do not violate START I, \nwe will not be violating the ABM Treaty if we deploy a ground-based \nsystem--and we would not. That is correct. But if we deploy any of the \nother systems named in this Dole-Gingrich bill we would.\n  So if he would like to vote strictly on the proposition he just \noffered then we will have a chance to do that on my substitute because \nthat is what it does. It says we will go forward with a treaty, an ABM \nTreaty compliance system with 100 interceptors at Grand Forks, and then \nwe will seek an amendment to the treaty as provided in the treaty to be \nable to go to two sites and 1,200 missiles, which would indeed be the \noriginal ABM Treaty exactly as it was before there was an amendment in \nthe 1970's. That would be treaty compliant. If we did that, there would \nbe no question that the Russians would have no right to violate START \nI. They would have no excuse for basically not ratifying START II. But \nwhen you basically say to the Russians what we are going to do here is \nget you to draw down to 3,500 warheads, and then about the time you do \nthat under the START II treaty we are going to deploy perhaps a sea-\nbased system, a space-based system, or space-based direct energy \nsystem, what you are saying in effect is we want you to comply with the \nSTART I and START II, but just about the time you get through \nimplementing it we are going to in all likelihood break out of the ABM \nTreaty. That is the message that is going forward here.\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nThat is the message everybody understands that has studied the ABM \nTreaty.\n  So to say we basically are fearful that the Russians are breaking \ntheir obligations and leaving out of the equation that we are serving \nnotice we are going to break ourselves, I think, is a little bit \nmisleading.\n  So I say to my friend from Arizona that, if he would like to vote on \nthat proposition staying within the ABM Treaty, or seeking an amendment \nwithin a reasonable timeframe to that treaty to permit a better system \nthan the one-site system, he will have every opportunity to do that \nwhen we get to a vote on this because that is exactly what the Nunn \nsubstitute will provide.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee that I would love the \nopportunity to vote on both the proposal that Senator Dole has made and \nalso the substitute that Senator Nunn would like to make. That is what \nthis cloture vote is all about. If we do not vote for cloture we are \nnot going to have that opportunity.\n  Second, there is no difference in concept between the proposal of the \nSenator from Georgia and our proposal. We are not engaging in an \nanticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty with this bill. We provide two \nspecific mechanisms, both of which are treaty compliant, to proceed. \nOne of them is similar to that which the Senator from Georgia proposes. \nIn his substitute he is suggesting that we have not one ground-based \nsite but two. Under the current ABM Treaty that would be in violation \nof the treaty if we went forward to build that.\n  So in his legislation he provides that we should seek an amendment to \nthe treaty to accommodate this second site. Likewise, in the Dole bill, \nthe bill before us today, it reads on page 9, line 8, ``In light of the \nfindings in section 2 and the policy established in section 3 [in other \nwords, that we should build a national missile defense system] the \nCongress urges the President to pursue high level discussions with the \nRussian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend the ABM Treaty''--\nto allow the deployment of the system. We ask for the same thing.\n  In other words, to the extent that we might go beyond what the ABM \nTreaty allows, the Senator from Georgia is correct to say that some of \nthe things in the bill, if they were done--it is up to the President to \ndecide whether they would be done--but if they were done those things \ncould be considered beyond the scope of the ABM Treaty. In that event, \nwe then ask the President to engage in the negotiations with the \nRussians to amend the treaty to permit it. In the event that the \nRussians would not agree to it, we then invoke a second provision of \nthe ABM Treaty which specifically provides that the United States can \ngive notice of withdrawal from the treaty if we determine it is in our \ninterest to do so. We tried for an entire year of negotiations, whereas \nthe ABM Treaty would allow us to withdraw within a period of only 6 \nmonths.\n  We are not breaching the ABM Treaty. We are not even engaged in an \nanticipatory breach--in other words, a breach sometime in the future. \nWe are simply saying that we are going to embark upon a course of \naction which will provide for the defense of the United States, and, if \nin the future some provision of that would not be consistent with the \nABM Treaty then, (a), the President should try to negotiate amendments \nto the treaty just as the Nunn substitute provides; and (b), if that is \nnot possible, then the United States can give notice of withdrawal from \nthe treaty which the treaty itself provides.\n  It is a little bit like the argument that someone does not like to \namend the U.S. Constitution in some respect. They said the Constitution \nshould not be amended. Of course, the Constitution has within it an \nexplicit provision for amending it. It has been amended some 23 times \nnow, or 24. I have lost track. The fact is we have amended the U.S. \nConstitution. The ABM Treaty has a provision for amendment of the ABM \nTreaty. Just because we want to do something that might be inconsistent \nwith the current treaty does not mean that thereby we are in violation \nof the treaty, if we are able to amend the treaty or even if we give \nnotice under the treaty that we are going to withdraw from it because \nit is in our national interest to do so. That is not a breach of the \ntreaty. It is using the actual provisions of the treaty to further the \ninterests of the United States.\n\n  So, I certainly respect the judgment of the Senator from Georgia that \nwe must be very cautious about how we proceed. We have to take into \nconsideration how other nations might react, and certainly Russia is \nimportant in this regard. But, by the same token, we cannot fail to \nact, if something is in the interests of the United States, in \nanticipation that the Russians might not like it or that they might, as \na consequence of what we do that is perfectly legal, begin to violate \nsome treaty that we believe to be in our best interests.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for one brief moment?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to stop at this point and yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not want to make the argument for the Russians here, \nbut I think they would do the same thing we are talking about in the \nbill that you are talking about. If they see that on our side the ABM \nTreaty is going to likely be violated, then they will serve notice \nunder START I that it was not in their national interests. To say, on \nthe one hand, we are complying because we are going to give notice and \nthen get out, but, on the other hand, they could not do the same thing \nand they are therefore violating the treaty is also, I think, a little \nmisleading.\n  I think it works both ways. If they want to get out of START I, they \nhave the right to do so, or if we want to get out of START I. We both \nhave those reciprocal clauses in both ABM and START I, and I think that \nwould be the way either side would go about devolving from the position \nof compliance.\n  Mr. KYL. I might say to the Senator that while that might be the \nright of the Russians, you have to consider what is in the national \ninterest of Russia and the United States. We will both act in our \nnational interests whatever we deem that to be.\n  Mr. NUNN. Exactly.\n  Mr. KYL. There are a lot of arguments made by Russians themselves \nthat relate to the cost of continuing to maintain an arsenal. My guess \nwould be that the Russians would at least want to draw their arsenal \ndown to the levels called for in START I, because it is very expensive \nto maintain that degree of arsenal.\n  There is also a counterargument made that they might not agree to the \nSTART II Treaty that we have already ratified because of the high cost \nof compliance in bringing those warheads down. The Senator from Georgia \nhas been a leader in the United States in trying to provide assistance \nto the Russians to enable them to afford to do that. It is an expensive \nproposition.\n  Mr. NUNN. Right.\n  Mr. KYL. I guess what I am saying here is that the Russians \nthemselves have made two contradictory arguments, both of which might \nbe true. That is to say, No. 1, it is expensive to maintain these \narsenals; No. 2, it is expensive to get rid of them. Probably they will \ndo what is in their best interests regardless of what the United States \ndoes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I think they certainly will act in what they believe is \ntheir national interest. I think the real key here is whether we can \nenter into a period of time with Russia, and we have some hope of doing \nthat, where we both have similar national interests in both defensive \nweapons as well as drawing down offensive weapons. So we reduce the \nthreat to them, they reduce the threat to us. We both move together in \ntrying to develop some type systems to defend our own territory, that \nare certainly more sophisticated than what Russia has now, and we have \nnone at all. So I am very much in favor of moving down the path of \ncooperation with the Russians if it is possible. If it is not possible, \nwe have to go back to the national interest clause under the ABM \nTreaty.\n\n  As I have said many times, I do not think the ABM Treaty is sacred. I \nthink it was in our interests when it was entered into, but it has to \nbe adjusted over the period of time. It is all-important the way you go \nabout adjusting it, though. I think if you talk to anyone now who is \nfamiliar with the history of the ABM Treaty, if they read the Dole-\nGingrich bill before us, the way it is worded, the entire tenor of\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nthe bill is tantamount to serving notice that we are going to move in \nour own independent direction.\n  At some point, we may have to do that, but I do not think the year is \nnow, and I do not think it is time now to give up on a mutual approach \nthat can save us billions and billions of dollars and also increase the \nsecurity of our people. I do not think that hope should be written off.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the goals as \narticulated by the Senator from Georgia. We have some slight difference \nas to how to get there, but he certainly has articulated the issue \nwell.\n  I ask at this point, if there is no one else who desires to speak, \neven though there be time remaining, if there is no other person \ndesiring to speak other than the leaders, that it would be possible to \nyield back any remaining time and proceed to allow leaders to speak as \nthey desire and then to hold the cloture vote at 2:15 or as soon \nthereafter as appropriate.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I agree with the suggestion of my friend \nfrom Arizona. There is apparently no one else on this side who plans to \nspeak at this point in time. I certainly would agree to that procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time has been \nconsidered yielded back. Leaders will be accorded an opportunity to \nspeak prior to the cloture vote, which will be when the Senate \nreconvenes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5738-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, Let me emphasize that I regard the Defend \nAmerica Act of 1996 as a vital piece of legislation--one which provides \na clear and concise blueprint for protecting the American people from \nthe growing threat of attack from ballistic missiles carrying nuclear \nchemical or biological warheads. I am also convinced, Mr. President, \nbeyond peradventure, that it is critical that the United States begin \nimmediately the 8-year task of building and deploying a national \nmissile defense. Finally, I am disappointed that this legislation is \nbeing subjected to a filibuster.\n  This past winter, shortly after the Clinton administration vetoed the \nmissile defense provisions in the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, I, \nalong with others, questioned the wisdom of the administration's stated \nassumption that no country ``other than the declared nuclear powers'' \nwould threaten the ``continental'' United States with a ballistic \nmissile for at least 15 years. An incredible statement. I was \nastonished then and I am astonished now, when I think about it, by the \nintellectual bankruptcy of such a statement.\n  Mr. President, I shall make four points in this regard: First, I \ncontinue to wonder how the administration could so cavalierly make \ndecisions about the deployment of a national missile defense, while \nexplicitly excluding declared nuclear powers from the threat calculus. \nOne has only to consider China, which fields dozens of submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles, hundreds of warheads on heavy bombers, \nroughly 24 medium and long-range ballistic missiles, and has several \ncrash modernization initiatives in progress. Moreover, China intends to \ndeploy, by the end of this century, four new types of ballistic \nmissiles. Furthermore, the United States has very clear indications \nthat Red China is, at this very moment, pursuing MIRV technology.\n  Now, then, Mr. President, this is the very same country, mind you, \nthat has\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\njust finished flexing its military might by conducting live missile-\nfiring exercises in the Strait of Taiwan, in a clear effort to bully \nand cower a valued and longstanding ally of the United States. This is \nthe same country--China--that issued thinly veiled threats this spring \nsuggesting that nuclear weapons would be used against the United States \nif the United States intervened on behalf of Taiwan. Assistant \nSecretary of State Winston Lord acknowledged that Chinese officials had \ndeclared that the United States, ``wouldn't dare defend Taiwan because \nthey [China] would rain nuclear bombs on Los Angeles'' if we did.\n  Now, if this is not nuclear blackmail, it will do while the Clinton \nadministration folds its hands until the first nuclear missile hits the \nwest coast. China's ability to hold the United States hostage to such \nthreats is made possible by the fact that a band of latter-day Luddites \nhere in Washington have consistently refused even to consider building \nthe very strategic missile defenses necessary to protect the American \npeople from such an attack.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the defenders of the ABM Treaty to give \nup their pious devotion to an antiquated arms control theology and come \nto grips with the realities of the post-cold-war world. Dr. Henry \nKissinger, the architect of the ABM Treaty, put it best when he \nrecently wrote, ``The end of the cold war has made . . . a strategy of \nmutually assured destruction largely irrelevant. Barely plausible when \nthere was only one strategic opponent, the theory makes no sense in a \nmultipolar world of proliferating nuclear powers.''\n  He went on to say that MAD, mutually assured destruction, would not \nwork against blackmail with nuclear weapons. Yet, that is exactly what \nwe are faced with when China blatantly threatens Los Angeles, U.S.A.\n  Second, I cannot fathom the administration's sensibilities when it \ndrew a distinction between threats to the United States and threats to \nthe continental United States. The last time I checked, nearly 2 \nmillion U.S. citizens live in Alaska and Hawaii. These people and their \nfamilies are no less deserving of protection than anyone living in \nArkansas or North Carolina or Washington, DC, or anywhere else. It is \nsimply incredible that those who oppose ballistic missile defense are \ndoing so based on their view of the threat to only 48 out of the 50 \nStates of the Union. This is all the more galling since it is an \nindisputable fact that North Korea is developing a series of missiles \ncapable of striking both Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Third, I call Senators' attention to a key caveat in the much \npublicized 1996 threat assessment that has been largely overlooked. \nThat assessment declared that ``foreign assistance is a wild card that \ncan sometimes permit a country to solve difficult developmental \nproblems relatively quickly. Such external assistance can hinder our \nability to predict how soon a system will become operational.''\n  Good Lord, Mr. President, this one statement alone unravels the whole \nball of yarn. Foreign assistance is the norm in the development of \nballistic missile systems, not the exception. The Soviet Union \ncollaborated on ballistic missiles with 14 countries around the globe, \nall of whom can now field some type of Soviet-made missile.\n  Russia recently was caught shipping entire missile sections to Iraq. \nBoth Libya and Egypt have transferred missiles to other countries. \nChina has sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia and missile \ntechnology to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. In turn, Iran is working \nwith North Korea and Syria on various missiles, and North Korea is \nsupplying both missiles and missile production facilities to anybody \nwho is prepared to pay for them with cash.\n  Recently, Mr. President, I was astounded to discover that Russia and \nUkraine may be concluding a secret deal with China to transfer ICBM \ncomponents. A report by the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that \nCommunist China is seeking to enhance its strategic arsenal with \ncomponents from Russia's most lethal type of intercontinental ballistic \nmissile--the SS-18.\n  Dubbed ``Satan'' by Western intelligence services, the SS-18 is the \nworld's most destructive weapon to date. It has the ability to drop 10 \nmegaton-rated warheads within 600 feet of their targets. Acquisition of \njust the booster stage of this missile would give China the ability to \nlaunch nuclear warheads against any and every city in the United States \nof America--a strategic reach of up to 6,820 miles that China, thank \nthe Lord, does not yet possess.\n\n  Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that Secretary of Defense Perry \nhas held open the door to the possibility that SS-18 boosters could be \nused commercially by the Chinese to boost satellites into orbit. He \nstated during an interview with reporters from the Washington Times \nthat ``I guess our answer would be only if it's very tightly \ncontrolled, so you can have great confidence this technology is not \nbeing diverted to some other application. That would be the only \nexception I would make.''\n  Well, speaking just as one Senator, I must say, in no uncertain \nterms, that I believe any such exception would be made at the peril of \nthe national security of the American people. The Defense Intelligence \nAgency has specifically noted that ``China's interest in using SS-18 \nboosters in its civilian program seems odd because the SS-18's engine \ncharacteristics may be incompatible with many sensitive satellite \npayloads.'' I might add that the Foreign Relations Committee, of which \nI am chairman, recommended Senate ratification of the START II Treaty \nsubject to the understanding that the treaty would rectify a \nlongstanding inequity of previous arms control agreements by completely \neliminating this monster missile forever. Secretary Perry's comment \nappears to open the door for Satan's coming under the red flag of \nCommunist China.\n  For the record I should mention that the START II Treaty specifically \nprohibits Russia from transferring SS-18's to any recipient whatsoever \nor whomever, and does so from the date of START II's signature. The \nForeign Relations Committee even attached a condition stating that \n``space-launch vehicles composed of items that are limited by the START \nTreaty or the START II Treaty shall be subject to the obligations \nundertaken in the respective treaty.'' Case closed. In my judgment, \nthere should not be any question about whether the transfer of SS-18 \ntechnology to China is acceptable. I contend that it absolutely is not.\n  The truth of the matter is that no amount of policy reformulation by \nthe administration can change the fact that the United States is \nvulnerable to nuclear-tipped missiles fielded by China, or anyone else. \nRectifying this dangerous deficiency requires leadership and action. It \nis an all the more pressing issue because the current course charted by \nthe administration fails to recognize the inherent danger in China's \npursuit of an advanced nuclear arsenal.\n  Mr. President, any further delay in the development by the United \nStates of a flexible, cost-effective national missile defense is \nunconscionable. I am honored to be a cosponsor of the Defend America \nAct and urge Senators to support this legislation to ensure that the \nAmerican people in all 50 States are protected from attack by ballistic \nmissiles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5741-7", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5742-S5744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncelebrate a birthday. June 4, 1996, marks the 50th anniversary of the \nsigning of the National School Lunch Act by President Harry Truman. \nWhile turning 50 is not a happy occasion for most of us, the \ncelebration of this birthday is one that should make all of us happy.\n  The link between proper nutrition and a child's ability to grow and \nto learn is undisputed. The School Lunch Program was founded in part, \nbecause President Truman saw the alarmingly large number of World War \nII draftees who failed their physicals due to nutrition-related \nproblems. President Truman declared it a ``measure of national security \nto safeguard the health and well being of the nation's children.'' \nPresident Truman was right.\n  Numerous scientific studies have documented the nutritional benefits \nof the program--children who eat school meals perform better on \nachievement\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\ntests and are late and absent from school less often than children who \ndid not participate in the programs. Any parent or teacher will tell \nyou that a child who has not eaten cannot think and cannot learn.\n  In speaking at the 1969 White House Conference on Food Nutrition and \nHealth, President Nixon said that ``a child ill-fed is dulled in \ncuriosity, lower in stamina and distracted from learning.''\n  Over the last year or so the school nutrition programs have been the \nsubject of a lot of debate, with many extreme Republicans in the House \nsupporting a repeal of the School Lunch Act. This is a program that has \nalways enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Agriculture Chairman Lugar and Senators Dole and Cochran have always \nsupported the program, and have really helped make it what it is today. \nBack in 1981 Senators Dole, Cochran, and Helms wrote, then-White House \nchief of staff, Jim Baker and urged the Reagan administration not to \nmake cuts to the program.\n  In 1995, the Vermont School Lunch Program served over 7,663,000 \nlunches to students in 335 schools in Vermont. For many of these \nchildren school meals are their main source of nutrition. School \nlunches provide one-third to one-half of the recommended daily \nallowances for key nutrients.\n  The school nutrition programs have done a fabulous job for the last \n50 years of providing American children healthy school meals that \nprepare them to learn today and to compete tomorrow. This program is an \nexample of what is working and what is good about Government.\n  Today's school nutrition programs are healthier than ever. As part of \nthe Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act of 1994 that I was \nable to pass as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, all schools must \nmeet the dietary guidelines for Americans by the 1996-97 school year.\n  Many schools are ahead of the deadline and are already meeting these \nguidelines that lower the sodium and fat content of the school meals. \nFor those schools that need help, USDA is working with them.\n  We in Congress are also working with the schools and asking them what \nthey need. Just last week the President signed H.R. 2066 giving schools \nmaximum flexibility in how they meet the new dietary guidelines. So I \nthink that we have reached a very good medium of Federal support and \nguidelines while giving the individual schools the flexibility to do \nwhat works best for them.\n  Last year marked a major milestone in the history of the National \nSchool Lunch Program--for the first time in 50 years we made historic \nchanges in the nutrition standards for school meals. Under the \nleadership of Under Secretary Haas we have the School Meals Initiative \nfor Healthy Children.\n  Then, realizing that change cannot be mandated, Under Secretary Haas \nundertook one of the most sweeping, innovative programs in the history \nof the program--Team Nutrition.\n  Team Nutrition's mission is to improve the health and education of \nchildren by creating innovative public and private partnerships that \npromote food choices for a healthy diet through the media, schools, \nfamilies, and communities across the country.\n  For 50 years, the National School Lunch Program has prepared children \nfor a healthier future.\n  Today, as we move into the 21st century, we are celebrating and \nbringing together all those who care about the health of our Nation's \nchildren. That's what Team Nutrition is all about--local community \ncoalitions joining together to promote nutrition education for children \nand families. Already Team Nutrition has over 12,000 schools signed up. \nTeam Nutrition is reaching millions of children in thousands of \ncommunities and inspiring educators, families, and community leaders to \nwork together to improve the health of our Nation's children.\n  I am also pleased that one of my former communication directors, \nAlicia Bambara, is working with the Under Secretary on this effort and \ndoing a wonderful job. She also worked to found a shelter for homeless, \npregnant women in the District of Columbia.\n  I would like to congratulate the School Lunch Program and give a \nspecial thanks to a few special people who have helped bring so many \nhealthy meals to Vermont school children: Jo Busha, the head of the \nVermont Child Nutrition Program, Marlene Senecal, Connie Bellavance, \nand Sue Steinhurst at the Vermont School Food Service Association and \nRob Dostis with the Campaign to End Childhood Hunger. I also would like \nto thank all of the wonderful school food service professionals who \nwork so very hard at this important task.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article which gives an excellent \nhistory of the program's first 50 years be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Decades of Dedication--The Early Years\n\n                      (By Patricia L. Fitzgerald)\n\n       Despite all the changes of the past 50 years--technology, \n     economics, demographics, legislation--the history of school \n     foodservice is truly remarkable for how much has stayed the \n     same. The mission hasn't changed since the earliest programs \n     in the 19th century: Provide meals to children at school to \n     ensure their health and promote their ability to learn. And \n     while many faces have changed, the school foodservice \n     profession has always been composed of individuals who have a \n     true and dedicated commitment to this mission.\n       Many of the obstacles that confronted the profession's \n     pioneers still exist--in different forms--today. These \n     include managing tight budgets, surviving political \n     maneuverings, meeting nutritional requirements in the face of \n     children's tastes and preferences and fighting resistance to \n     consider school meals an integral and intrinsic part of the \n     education system.\n       But where did all of this--the need, the dedication, the \n     challenge--begin? How did two groups of foodservice directors \n     find themselves merging together in 1946 to create a \n     profession dedicated to advancing standards and managing a \n     new federal program?\n\n\n                                 roots\n\n       According to historical records, the first known program to \n     combine lunch and education began in 1790, in Munich, \n     Germany. Court Rumford, Benjamin Thompson, established the \n     Poor People's Institute, which included a program of teaching \n     and feeding hungry, vagrant children. Half of the day, the \n     children worked making clothes for the army and the other \n     half they received an education. Food was primarily a soup \n     made from potatoes, barley and peas.\n       Throughout the 19th century, all over Europe, charitable \n     organizations began to take on the burden of feeding and \n     educating children in poverty, but as the century wore on, \n     local governments began to pick up more and more of the \n     financial burden. By 1877, the Paris government started \n     school ``cantines,'' providing meals at public expense for \n     children in need. In England, the Education (Provision of \n     Meals) Act passed in 1905, after lobbying from 365 private \n     and charitable organizations. And in Holland in 1900, a royal \n     decree ordered municipals to supply food and clothing to \n     needy school children.\n       These efforts in Europe were paralleled by ones in the \n     United States. In 1853, the Children's Aid Society in New \n     York served meals to students attending vocational school, \n     but it wasn't until 1919 that the Board of Education assumed \n     full responsibility for all lunch programs in Manhattan and \n     the Bronx. The movement was similar in other U.S. cities. In \n     Philadelphia, for example, the Starr Center Association began \n     serving penny lunches in one school in 1894; in 1909, \n     responsibility for operating and supporting the lunch program \n     was transferred to the city's school board.\n       In smaller cities, ``charitable organizations'' often meant \n     the mothers of the children at school. In 1904, the Women's \n     School Alliance of Wisconsin began furnishing lunches to \n     children in Milwaukee. The meals were prepared in the homes \n     of women who lived near the schools and were willing to cook \n     and serve. And in rural areas, the responsibility was often \n     assumed by the teachers themselves, preparing soups and other \n     hot dishes from meats and vegetables brought by the children.\n\n\n                          the great depression\n\n       The stock market crash of 1929 brought a whole new urgency \n     and visibility to the issue of hunger in America. As \n     unemployment skyrocketed, the country's middle class suddenly \n     became the ``new poor,'' and the country looked to the \n     government for help.\n       Unfortunately, President Herbert Hoover's administration \n     had no answers, and the Depression wore on without relief. \n     Instead of slowing the expansion of local school lunch \n     programs, the bleak economics drove home their value. In many \n     communities, a school meal program was initiated and provided \n     by a legion of volunteers.\n       Aid came in the form of new president Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt's New Deal, and the establishment of a number of \n     ``alpha-bet organizations,'' government programs designed to \n     provide opportunities for employment. In 1933-34, burgeoning \n     school lunch programs in 39 states found valuable assistance \n     from the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Relief \n     Administration. And in 1935, the Work Projects Administration\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\n     (WPA) was created; needy women all over the United States \n     found work under WPA programs to prepare and serve school \n     lunches. And with much of the labor burden off of school \n     districts, lunch prices could be kept low, which increased \n     participation.\n       Donated commodities were another key to early school lunch \n     success. While unemployment in the cities was rampant, \n     America's farmers were having bumper crops. But without a \n     market to buy, surpluses grew, prices fell and farmers began \n     to go out of business. In 1935, the government began to \n     remove price-depressing surplus foods from the market, and \n     school lunch programs were one excellent outlet for the \n     goods.\n       Throughout the 1930s, many states and cities began to adopt \n     legislation--often including appropriations--that mandated \n     schools to serve lunch to students. By 1937, 15 states had \n     passed laws specifically authorizing local school boards to \n     operate lunchrooms, serving meals at cost or less.\n       The numbers tell the story. By 1941, WPA school lunch \n     programs were in all states, the District of Columbia and \n     Puerto Rico, serving an average of nearly 2 million lunches \n     daily and employing more than 64,000 people.\n\n\n                         a sense of permanence\n\n       When America went to war, it sent its boys overseas and its \n     women to work in the defense industry. By 1944, the WPA's \n     payroll was gone, but the demand for continuation of lunch \n     programs was not. In 1944, Congress earmarked funds to \n     maintain the programs for the year and repeated this action \n     in 1945. Behind the scenes, a campaign to establish a \n     permanent, reliable federal subsidy for school lunch was in \n     the works.\n       In 1946, Congress recognized the need to establish a \n     national, permanent, federally funded school lunch program. \n     Section 2 of the final law succinctly explains the \n     legislators' rationale: ``It is hereby declared to be the \n     policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to \n     safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children \n     and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious \n     agricultural commodities and other food, by assisting the \n     States, through grants-in-aid and other means, in providing \n     an adequate supply of foods and other facilities for the \n     establishment, maintenance, operation and expansion of \n     nonprofit school lunch programs.''\n       After considerable lobbying by the burgeoning school \n     foodservice profession and with the support of some heavy \n     hitters in the Senate, Congress passed the National School \n     Lunch Act of 1946, which was signed into law by President \n     Harry Truman on June 4. In addition to defining \n     appropriations--including those for administrative expenses--\n     the new law set minimum nutritional requirements for three \n     types of acceptable lunches.\n\n\n                            a new profession\n\n       Although school foodservice began with unskilled \n     volunteers, it was quick to grow into a bona fide profession \n     during the 1930s. Cafeteria management and foodservice \n     direction were new careers. And the early pioneers (see \n     sidebar, page 50) developed high standards for sanitation, \n     nutrition and home economics. The Thirties saw the formation \n     of two national organizations created to further this brand-\n     new profession: the Conference of Food Service Directors and \n     the National School Cafeteria Association.\n       After passage of the National School Lunch Act, these two \n     groups agreed to a merger conference to join forces and \n     create a new organization. On October 10-12, 1946, in \n     Chicago, the School Food Service Association was born (the \n     word ``American'' wouldn't be added to the name of the \n     organization until 1951). There were 300 school foodservice \n     professionals in attendance, representing programs in 34 \n     states, as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \n     Constance C. Hart, a school foodservice director from \n     Rochester, N.Y., and a founder of the Conference of Food \n     Service Directors, was elected ASFSA's first president.\n       Through the end of the 1940's, the Association concentrated \n     on getting on its feet, administering the new federal school \n     lunch program and providing professional development \n     opportunities for its growing membership. In 1947, member \n     rolls were 709. Oklahoma became ASFSA's first state \n     affiliate. The first annual convention was held in Dallas in \n     November. Attendance at the convention was 478, and there \n     were 39 exhibitors, including many still-familiar names, such \n     as American Dietetic Association, The Cleveland Range \n     Company, Florida Citrus Commission, The Hobart Manufacturing \n     Company and the National Livestock and Meat Board. In 1948, \n     membership remained steady, Betsy Curtis was president and \n     the convention was held in Detroit.\n       Dr. Mary deGarmo Bryan took the helm in 1948-49, and \n     ASFSA's first constitution was adopted. That year also saw \n     the development of the Association's first membership \n     publication: School Meals. Membership grew to 920. Thelma \n     Flanagan's term as 1949-50 president say many actions that \n     gave shape to the infant association. We'll examine these in \n     the next installment of ``Decades of Dedication.''\n\n\n                              O PIONEERS!\n\n       The school foodservice profession owes a debt to all of the \n     leaders that guided it through the turbulent waters of change \n     and growth over the past 50 years. In this issue we pay \n     special tribute to just a few of those who fought for the \n     establishment of a federal school lunch program and helped \n     shape a brand-new profession. Their influence is still felt \n     today.\n       Dr. Mary deGarmo Bryan. A professional educator, she was \n     largely responsible for the professional standards of the \n     program, teaching many of the first generation of school \n     foodservice professionals. Her 1936 text, The School \n     Cafeteria, was one of the bases for the school lunch program. \n     A professor at Columbia University Teachers College for over \n     20 years, deGarmo was president of ASFSA in 1948-49.\n       Marion Cronan. Through her regular column, ``The School \n     Lunch,'' in Practical Home Economics magazine, Cronan was \n     instrumental in bringing the professional concerns of lunch \n     programs to the attention of a foodservice audience. She \n     served as ASFSA president for 1967-68.\n       Thelma Flanagan. Considered by many to be Florida's ``first \n     lady of the profession,'' Flanagan also made an indelible \n     impact on the national association. As ASFSA's 1949-50 \n     president, Flanagan was responsible for giving the fledgling \n     association some shape, creating specialized departments and \n     instituting long-range planning. Today, the Thelma Flanagan \n     Gold Award recognizes states that excel in meeting ASFSA's \n     Plan of Action.\n       Constance Hart. Director of Lunchrooms for the Rochester, \n     N.Y., public school system in 1942, Hart was an early \n     proponent for nutrition education in the schools. A founder \n     of the Conference of Food Service Directors in 1935, Hart \n     became ASFSA's first president, elected at the merger meeting \n     between the Conference and the National School Cafeteria \n     Association. She served in 1946-47.\n       Senator Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.) As chair of the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee's Appropriations Subcommittee, his \n     support of the National School Lunch Act was invaluable for \n     getting the bill through Congress.\n       John Stalker. In 1935, Stalker headed Massachusetts' \n     commodity distribution program and became the state's \n     director of school foodservice programs. Stalker set \n     nutrition and management standards that were national models. \n     He designed ASFSA's first emblem and served as a valuable \n     legislative leader at both the state and national levels.\n       Frank Washam. Director of Chicago's school lunch program, \n     Washam was a leader in the National School Cafeteria \n     Association and a leader in the movement to obtain permanent \n     federal support for school lunches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5742-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5744-S5745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago--it was in 1972--when the TV commentators network reported \nthat the people of North Carolina had elected me to the Senate. It was \n9:17 p.m. and I recall how stunned I was.\n  It had never really occurred to me that I would be the first \nRepublican in history to be elected by the people of North Carolina to \nthe U.S. Senate. Needless to say, it was a memorable moment in my life \nand I, that evening, made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  Keeping that commitment for almost 24 years, it has proved enormously \nmeaningful to me. I have been inspired on countless occasions by the \nestimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited during the more \nthan 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are understandably concerned, and greatly \nso, about the total Federal debt which back in February of this year \ncrossed the $5 trillion mark for the first time in history. It is \nCongress that has created this monstrous debt which coming generations \nwill have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always are \ninclined to discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no \nPresident can spend a dime of Federal money that has not first been \nauthorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the United \nStates.\n  That is why, on February 22, 1992, I began making these daily reports \nto the Senate. I decided that it was important that a daily record be \nmade of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday--Monday, June 3, 1996--stood at \n$5,136,903,015,098.32. On a per capita basis, the existing Federal debt \namounts to $19,384.92 for every man, woman, and child in America on a \nper capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday--which identified the total Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness on Friday, May 31, 1996--shows an increase of more than $8 \nbillion--$8,394,510,205.52, to be exact. That increase alone is enough \nto match the total amount needed to pay the college tuition for each of \nthe 1,244,737 students for 4 years.\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\n\n\n               PRESIDENT CLINTON'S HOPE SCHOLARSHIP PLAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today, in his commencement \naddress at Princeton University, President Clinton announced a dramatic \nnew proposal called the Hope scholarship plan, to bring college \neducation within closer reach for all Americans. This important new \ninitiative guarantees free tuition for large numbers of students \nattending the Nation's community colleges. For students at 4-year \ncolleges, it supplements Pell grant aid, and it strengthens the tuition \ntax deduction in the President's budget by adding a new education tax \ncredit. The plan is fully paid for with savings that achieve a balanced \nbudget by 2002.\n  This initiative is modeled on the GI bill of rights of the World War \nII era, which gave so many veterans the skills needed in those years to \nparticipate fully in our expanding economy. We rejected the idea of a \ncash bonus for soldiers. Instead, we invested in their futures and the \nfuture of the Nation by making higher education available and \naffordable for returning veterans. The investment has more than paid \nfor itself. For every dollar invested in grants under the GI bill, the \nNation received more than $8 in economic returns.\n  The Hope scholarships, announced by President Clinton, are based on \nthe same principles--investing in the future of America by investing in \neducation and training for all citizens. The President's proposal \nrecognizes what business leaders have been telling us for years, that \nhigh skills are the key to high wages for American workers in the \nglobal economy.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60 percent of all jobs \ncreated between now and the year 2005 will require education beyond \nhigh school.\n  The Hope scholarship plan will make at least two years of college \npossible for every American. It will guarantee $1,500 in tuition \nassistance a year, through Pell grants or a refundable tax credit or \nboth, for 2 years to every student in the country who attends a \ncommunity college, earns at least a ``B'' average in the second year, \nand stays off drugs.\n  Community colleges enroll 48 percent of all undergraduates and over \nhalf of all minority students. Many community college students are \nworking adults returning to college to improve their skills. Based on \ncurrent surveys, more than half of the Nation's students maintain a \n``B'' average.\n  The $1,500 credit is designed to pay full tuition costs at community \ncolleges. But it can also be applied to the first 2 years of tuition at \n4-year colleges for students who maintain a ``B'' average in the second \nyear. Alternatively, students and their families will be able to choose \na tax deduction of $10,000 a year per family for the first 2 years. For \nthe last 2 years of college and graduate school and professional \nschool, the tax deduction remains available to all families with \nincomes below $100,000 or to individuals with incomes below $70,000.\n  These important new benefits build on the 33 percent increase in Pell \ngrant funding in the President's budget. By comparison, the Republican \nbudget resolution cuts Pell grants by 18 percent over the next 6 years \nand denies grants to 1.3 million students altogether. The President's \nbudget increases the maximum Pell grant award by almost $800 by 2002.\n  The Hope scholarship plan recognizes the need for high skills in \ntoday's economy, and helps to meet that need. It offers realistic help \nto students and working adults seeking to acquire new skills. I commend \nthe President for this initiative, and I urge the Congress to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that President Clinton's \naddress may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5744-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5745-S5747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n Remarks by the President at Princeton University Commencement Address\n\n       The President. Thank you very much. President Shapiro, \n     members of the faculty, alumni, to parents and friends of \n     this graduating class, especially to the graduates of the \n     Class of 1996--(applause.) Let me thank you co-Presidents, \n     George Whitesides and Susan Suh, who came to say hello to me \n     this morning; and compliment your valedictory address by \n     Bryan Duff, and the Latin address by Charles Stowell. I \n     actually took four years of Latin in high school. (Laughter.) \n     And even without being prompted, I knew I was supposed to \n     laugh when he was digging me about going to Yale. (Laughter.)\n       I want to also thank Princeton for honoring the high school \n     teachers and the faculty members here for teaching, for today \n     we celebrate the learning of the graduates and we should be \n     honoring the teachers who made their learning possible. I \n     thank you for that. (Applause.)\n       It's a great honor to be here in celebrating Princeton's \n     250 years. I understand that Presidents are only invited to \n     speak here once every 50 years. President Truman and \n     President Cleveland--you've got to say one thing, for all the \n     troubles the Democrats have had in the 20th century, we've \n     had pretty good timing when it comes to Princeton over the \n     last 100 years. (Laughter and applause.)\n       I want to thank President Shapiro for his distinguished \n     service to higher education in our country. I thank Princeton \n     for its long and noble service to our Nation. I also am \n     deeply indebted to Princeton for the contributions it has \n     made to our administration and my presidency.\n       My Press Secretary, Mike McCurry, sat in these seats in \n     1976. I'm sure that Princeton had something to do with the \n     fact that he not only thinks, but talks so fast. The Chair of \n     our National Economic Council, Laura Tyson, was a Princeton \n     Professor then, and Mike McCurry's thesis advisor. And you \n     got back from me Professor Alan Blinder, who was a \n     distinguished member of the Council of Economic Advisors and \n     the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a brilliant \n     contributor to our efforts to improve the economy. I want to \n     thank Alan Blinder here among his colleagues and these \n     students for what he has done.\n       I thank Tony Lake and Bruce Reed and John Hilley and Peter \n     Bass, all members of our staff who graduated from Princeton. \n     Two Princeton graduates who are no longer living--Vic Raiser \n     and his son, Monty, were great friends of mine. Vic's wife, \n     Molly, is here--our protocol chief. And if it hadn't been for \n     him I might not be here today, and I want to recognize their \n     contributions to Princeton and Princeton's gifts to them.\n       I also want to say that one of my youngest staff members is \n     a classmate here--Jon Orszag. And when the ceremony is over \n     I'd like to have you back at work, please. (Laughter.)\n       I would like to talk to the senior class today about not \n     only the importance of your education, but the importance of \n     everyone else's education to your future. At every pivotal \n     moment in American history, Princeton, its leadership, its \n     students have played a crucial role. Many of our Founding \n     Fathers were among your first sons. A president of Princeton \n     was the only university president to sign the Declaration of \n     Independence. This hall was occupied by the British since \n     1776, liberated by Washington's army in 1777, and as the \n     President said, sanctified forever to American history by the \n     deliberations of the Continental Congress in 1783.\n       In 1896, the last time there was a Class of '96, when \n     Princeton celebrated its 150th anniversary and, as has been \n     said, Grover Cleveland was President, Professor Woodrow \n     Wilson gave his very famous speech, ``Princeton in the \n     Nation's Service.'' I read that speech before I came here \n     today. And I'd like to read just a brief quote from it: \n     ``Today we must stand as those who would count their force \n     for the future. Those who made Princeton are dead. Those who \n     shall keep it and better it still live. They are even \n     ourselves.'' What he said about Princeton 100 years ago \n     applied then to America and applies to America even more \n     today.\n       At the time of that speech 100 years ago, America was \n     living as it is living today, through a period of enormous \n     change. The Industrial Age brought incredible new \n     opportunities and great new challenges to our people. \n     Princeton, through Wilson and his contemporaries, was at the \n     center of efforts to master these powerful forces of change \n     in a way that would enable all Americans to benefit from them \n     and protect our time-honored values.\n       Less than 3 years after he left this campus, Woodrow Wilson \n     became President of the United States. He followed Theodore \n     Roosevelt as the leader of America's response to that time of \n     change. We now know it as the Progressive Era.\n       Today, on the edge of a new century, all of you--our Class \n     of '96--are living through another time of great change, \n     standing on the threshold of a new Progressive Era. Powerful \n     forces are changing forever our jobs, our neighborhoods, the \n     institutions which shape our lives. For many Americans, this \n     is a time of enormous opportunity. But for others, it's a \n     time of profound insecurity. They wonder whether their old \n     skills and their enduring values will be enough to keep up \n     with the challenges of this new age.\n       In 1996, like 1896, we really do stand at the dawn of a \n     profoundly new era. I have called it the Age of Possibility \n     because of the revolution in information and technology and \n     market capitalism sweeping the globe--a world no longer \n     divided by the Cold War. Just consider this: There's more \n     computer power in a Ford Taurus every one of you can buy and \n     drive to the supermarket than there was in Apollo 11 when \n     Neil Armstrong took it to the moon. Nobody who wasn't a high-\n     energy physicist had even heard of the World Wide Web when I \n     became President. And now even my cat, Socks, has his own \n     page.\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\n      (Laughter.) By the time a child born today is old enough to \n     read, over 100 million people will be on the Internet.\n       This Age of Possibility means that more Americans than ever \n     before will be able to live out their dreams. Indeed, for all \n     of you in the Class of '96, this Age of Possibility is \n     actually an age of high probability, in large measure because \n     of the excellent education you celebrate today.\n       But we know that not all Americans see the future that way. \n     We know that about half of our people in this increasingly \n     global economy are working harder and harder without making \n     any more money; that about half of the people who lose their \n     jobs today don't ever find another job doing as well as they \n     were doing in their previous one.\n       We know that, therefore, our mission today must be to \n     ensure that all of our people have the opportunity to live \n     out their dreams in a nation that remains the world's \n     strongest force for peace and freedom, for prosperity, for \n     our commitment that we can respect our diversity and still \n     find unity.\n       This is about more than money. Opportunity is what defines \n     this country. For 220 years, the idea of opportunity for all \n     and the freedom to seize it have literally been the defining \n     elements of America. They were always ideals never perfectly \n     realized, but always our history has been a steady march of \n     striving to live up to them.\n       Having these ideals achievable, imaginable for all is an \n     important part of maintaining our sense of democracy and our \n     ability to forge an American community with such disparate \n     elements of race and religion and ethnicity across so many \n     borders that could so easily divide this country.\n       And so I say to you, creating opportunity for all, the \n     opportunity that everyone has, that many of you are now \n     exercising, dreaming about your future--that is what you must \n     do in order to make sure that this Age of Possibility is \n     really that for all Americans.\n       When I took office, I was concerned about the uncertain \n     steps our country was taking for that future. We'd let our \n     deficit get out of hand, unemployment had exploded, job \n     growth was the slowest since the Great Depression. The \n     country seemed to be coming apart when we needed desperately \n     to be coming together.\n       I wanted to chart a new course, rooted first in growth and \n     opportunity--first, to put our economic house in order so \n     that our businesses could prosper and create jobs; second, to \n     tap the full potential of the new global economy; third, to \n     invest in our people so that they would have the capacity to \n     meet the demands of this new age and to improve their own \n     lives.\n       This strategy is in place, and it is working. The deficit \n     is half of what it was. The Government is now the smallest \n     it's been in 30 years. As a percentage of the Federal work \n     force, the federal government is the smallest it's been \n     since 1933, before the beginning of the New Deal. We \n     signed over 200 trade agreements. Our exports are at an \n     all-time high. Fifteen million of our hardest-pressed \n     people have gotten tax cuts. Most of the small businesses \n     have as well.\n       We've invested in research and defense transformations. \n     We've invested in new technologies. And we've invested in \n     environmental protection and sustainable development. And I \n     will say, parenthetically, the great challenge of your age \n     will be to prove that we can bring prosperity and opportunity \n     to people all across the globe without destroying the \n     environment, which is the precondition of our successful \n     existence. And all of you will have to meet that challenge, \n     and I challenge you to do it. (Applause.)\n       Our economy, while most of the rest of the world was in \n     recession, has produced 8.5 million new jobs, the lowest \n     combined rates of inflation, unemployment and home mortgages \n     in three decades, the lowest deficit as a percentage of our \n     income of any advanced economy in the world, 3.7 million more \n     American homeowners, and record numbers of new small \n     businesses in each of the last 3 years.\n       We are doing well, but we must do better if we are going to \n     make the promise of this new age real to all Americans. That \n     means we have to grow faster. How fast can we grow? No one \n     knows the exact answer to that. But if we look at the long-\n     term, if we believe in our people and invest in them and \n     their opportunities, and our people take responsibility, the \n     sky is the limit.\n       We must look with the greatest skepticism toward those who \n     promise easy and quick solutions. We know that the course \n     that leads to long-term growth is in the minds and spirits \n     and ideas and discipline and effort of people like those of \n     you who graduate here today. We are on the right course; we \n     must accelerate it, not veer from it.\n       We have to finish the job we started in 1993 and balance \n     the budget--not only because we want to free you and your \n     children of the legacy of debt, but because that will keep \n     interest rates down, increase savings, expand companies, \n     start new small businesses, help more families buy homes and \n     more parents send their children to college.\n       We know we have to continue to fight for fair and open \n     trade because we proved now if other markets are as open to \n     our products and services as we are to theirs, we'll do just \n     fine. We know we have to do more to help all Americans deal \n     with the economic changes of the present day in a more \n     positive way by investing in the future and targeting tax \n     cuts to help Americans deal with their own problems and build \n     strong families.\n       We know we have to continue to invest in the things that a \n     government needs to invest in, including research and \n     development, and technology, and environmental protection. We \n     know that since so many people will have to change jobs more \n     often than in the past, we have to give families the security \n     to know that if they change jobs they can still carry with \n     them access to health care and pensions and education for a \n     lifetime.\n       But finally and most importantly, if we really want \n     Americans--all Americans--to participate in the future that \n     is now at your fingertips, we have got to increase the \n     quality and the level of education not just for the graduates \n     of Princeton and Georgetown and Yale and the state \n     universities of this country, but for all the American \n     people. It is the only way to achieve that goal. (Applause.)\n       The very fact that we have been here or our forebears have \n     for 250 years is testimony to the elemental truth that \n     education has always been important to individual Americans. \n     And for quite a long time, education has been quite important \n     to our whole country. Fifty years ago when the Class of '46 \n     was here, coming in after World War II the G.I. Bill helped \n     to build a great American middle class and a great American \n     economy. But today, more than ever before in the history of \n     the United States, education is the fault line, the great \n     Continental Divide between those who will prosper and those \n     who will not in the new economy.\n       If you look at the census data, you can see what happens to \n     hard-working people who have a high school diploma or who \n     drop out of high school and try to keep up in the job market, \n     but fall further and further behind. You can also see that if \n     all Americans have access to education, it is no longer a \n     fault line, it is a sturdy bridge that will lead us all \n     together from the old economy to the new.\n       Now, we have to work to give every American that kind of \n     opportunity. And we've worked hard to do it--from increasing \n     preschool opportunities, to improving the public school \n     years, to increasing technology in our schools. And this \n     spring the Vice President and I helped to kick off a Net \n     Day in California where schools and businesses and civic \n     leaders hooked up nearly 50 percent of the schools to the \n     Internet in a single weekend. What I want to see is every \n     schoolroom and every library in every school in America \n     hooked up to the Internet by the end of the year 2000. We \n     can do that. (Applause.)\n       And I am very proud that I was asked to announce today that \n     a coalition of high-tech companies, parents, teachers and \n     students are launching Net Day New Jersey this week to \n     connect over a thousand schools in New Jersey to the Internet \n     by this time next year. That will make a huge difference in \n     making learning more democratic and information more \n     accessible in this country. I thank them for that. Every \n     single person in New Jersey who will be a part of that. \n     (Applause.)\n       But we have to face the fact that that is not enough. We \n     have to do more. Just consider the last 100 years. At the \n     turn of the century, the progressives made it the law of the \n     land for every child to be in school. Before then there was \n     no such requirement. After World War II, we said 10 years are \n     not enough, public schools should extend to 12 years. And \n     then, as I said, the G.I. Bill and college loans threw open \n     the doors of college to the sons and daughters of farmers and \n     factory workers. And they have powered our economy ever \n     since.\n       America knows that higher education is the key to the \n     growth we need to lift our country. And today that is more \n     true than ever. Just listen to these facts. Over half the new \n     jobs created in the last 3 years have been managerial and \n     professional jobs. The new jobs require higher-level skills. \n     Fifteen years ago the typical worker with a college degree \n     made 38 percent more than a worker with a high school \n     diploma. Today, that figure is 73 percent more. Two years of \n     college means a 20-percent increase in annual earnings. \n     People who finish 2 years of college earn a quarter of a \n     million dollars more than their high school counterparts over \n     a lifetime.\n       Now, it is clear that America has the best higher education \n     system in the world, and that it is a key to a successful \n     future in the 21st century. It is also clear that because of \n     cost and other factors, not all Americans have access to \n     higher education.\n       I want to say today that I believe the clear facts this \n     time make it imperative that our goal must be nothing less \n     than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as \n     universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today. \n     (Applause.)\n       We have put in place an unprecedented college opportunity \n     strategy: Student loans can now be given directly to people \n     who need them, with a provision to repay them based on the \n     ability of the graduate to pay--based on income. This is a \n     dramatic change which is making loans more accessible to \n     young people who did not have them before. Americorps, which \n     by next year will have given over 65,000 young people the \n     chance to earn their way through college by serving their \n     country and their communities. More Pell Grants, scholarships \n     for deserving students every year.\n       Now we want to go further; we want to expand work-study so \n     that a million students can work their way through college by \n     the year 2000. We want to let people use money from their \n     Individual Retirement accounts\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\n     to help pay for college. We want every honor student in the \n     top 5 percent of every high school class in America to get a \n     $1,000 scholarship.\n       And we also want to do some other things that I believe we \n     must do to make 14 years of education the standard for every \n     American. First, I have asked Congress to pass a $10,000 tax \n     deduction to help families pay for the cost of all education \n     after high school--$10,000 a year. (Applause.)\n       Today I announced one more element to complete our college \n     strategy and make those 2 years of college as universal as 4 \n     years of high school--a way to do it, by giving families a \n     tax credit targeted to achieve that goal and making clear \n     that this opportunity requires responsibility to receive it.\n       We should say to Americans who want to go to college, we \n     will give you a tax credit to pay the cost of tuition at the \n     average community college for your first year, or you can \n     apply the same amount to the first year in a 4-year \n     university or college. We will give you the exact same cut \n     for the second year, but only if you earn it by getting a B \n     average the first year. A tax deduction for families to help \n     them pay for education after high school; a tax credit for \n     individuals to guarantee their first year of college and the \n     second year if they earn it.\n       This is not just for those individuals, this is for \n     America. Your America will be stronger if all Americans have \n     at least 2 years of higher education.\n       Think of it: We're not only saying to children from very \n     poor families who think they would never be able to go to \n     college, people who may not have stellar academic records in \n     high school, if you're willing to work hard and take a \n     chance, you can at least go to your local community college \n     and we'll pay for the first year. If you're in your 20s and \n     you're already working, but you can't move ahead on a high \n     school diploma, now you can go back to college. If you're a \n     mother planning to go to work, but you're afraid you don't \n     have the skills to get a good job, you can go to college. If \n     you're 40 and you're worried that you need more education to \n     support your family, now you can go part-time, you can go at \n     night. By all means, go to college and we'll pay the tuition.\n       I know this will work. When I was the governor of my home \n     state, we created academic challenge scholarships that helped \n     people who had good grades and who had good behavior to go to \n     college. But my proposal today builds mostly on the \n     enormously successful HOPE Scholarships in Georgia, which \n     guaranteed any student in the state of Georgia free college \n     as long as they had a B average. This year those scholarships \n     are helping 80,000 students in the state of Georgia alone--\n     including 70 percent of the freshmen class at the University \n     of Georgia.\n       In recognition of Georgia's leadership, I have decided to \n     call this proposal America's HOPE Scholarships. And I want to \n     thank the Governor of Georgia, Zell Miller, who developed \n     this idea. I also would like to recognize him--he came up \n     here with me today--and thank him for the contribution that \n     he is now going to make to all of America's future.\n       Governor Miller, where are you? Would you please stand up? \n     Here he is. Thank you.\n       Let me say, as all of you know, money doesn't grow on trees \n     in Washington, and we're not financing deficits anymore. I'm \n     proud to say, as a matter of fact, for the last 2 years our \n     budget has been in surplus, except for the interest necessary \n     to pay the debt run up in the several years before I became \n     President. So we are doing our best to pay for these \n     programs. And this program will be paid for by budgeted \n     savings in the balanced budget plan. We cannot go back to the \n     days of something for nothing or pretend that in order to \n     invest in education we have to sacrifice fiscal \n     responsibility.\n       Now, this program will do three things. It will open the \n     doors of college opportunity to every American, regardless of \n     their ability to pay. Education at the typical community \n     college will now be free. And the very few states that have \n     tuition above the amount that we can afford to credit, I \n     would challenge those states to close the gap. We're going to \n     take care of most of the states. The rest of them should help \n     us the last little way.\n       Second, it will offer free tuition and training to every \n     adult willing to work for it. Nobody now needs to be stuck in \n     a dead-end job or in unemployment. And finally, this plan \n     will work because it will go to people who, by definition, \n     are willing to work for it. It's America's most basic \n     bargain. We'll help create opportunity if you'll take \n     responsibility. This is the basic bargain that has made us a \n     great Nation.\n       I know that here at the reunion weekend the Class of '46 \n     has celebrated its 50th reunion. And I want to just mention \n     them one more time. Many members of the Class of '46 fought \n     in the second world war. And they came home and laid down \n     their arms and took up the responsibility of the future with \n     the help of the G.I. Bill. That's when our Nation did its \n     part simply by giving them the opportunity to make the most \n     of their own lives. And in doing that, they made America's \n     most golden years.\n       The ultimate lesson of the Class of 1946 will also apply to \n     the Class of 1996 in the 21st century. Because of the \n     education you have, if America does well, you will do very \n     well. If America is a good country to live in you will be \n     able to build a very good life.\n       So I ask you never to be satisfied with an age of \n     probability for only the sons and daughters of Princeton. You \n     could go your own way in a society that, after all, seems so \n     often to be coming apart instead of coming together. You \n     will, of course, have the ability to succeed in the global \n     economy, even if you have to secede from those Americans \n     trapped in the old economy. But you should not walk away from \n     our common purpose.\n       Again I will say this is about far more than economics and \n     money. It is about preserving the quality of our \n     democracy, the integrity of every person standing as an \n     equal citizen before the law, the ability of our country \n     to prove that no matter how diverse we get, we can still \n     come together in shared community values to make each of \n     our lives and our family's lives stronger and richer and \n     better. This is about more than money.\n       The older I get and the more I become aware that I have \n     more yesterdays than tomorrows, the more I think that in our \n     final hours, which all of us have to face, very rarely will \n     we say, gosh, I wish I'd spent more time at the office, or if \n     only I'd just made a little more money. But we will think \n     about the dreams we lived out, the wonders we knew when we \n     were most fully alive. This is about giving every single, \n     solitary soul in this country the chance to be most fully \n     alive. And if we do that, those of you who have this \n     brilliant education, who have been gifted by God with great \n     minds and strong bodies and hearts, you will do very well and \n     you will be very happy.\n       In 1914, Woodrow Wilson wrote as President, ``The future is \n     clear and bright with the promise of the best things. We are \n     all in the same boat. We shall advance and advance together \n     with a new spirit.'' I wish you well, and I pray that you \n     will advance, and advance together with a new spirit.\n       God bless you and God bless America.

KNOX III, 1926-96\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Seymour \nH. Knox III, a civic and business leader from Buffalo, NY. Seymour \nKnox, age 70, died on May 22, 1996, at his home in East Aurora, New \nYork, after a long battle with cancer.\n  Like his father before him, Seymour Knox created a lasting \ninstitution for the city of Buffalo by which he shall be remembered. \nFor the father, this was the Albright-Knox Art Gallery. For the son, it \nwas the Buffalo Sabres hockey team. Seymour, in cooperation with his \nbrother Northrup, led an investor group that acquired a National Hockey \nLeague Franchise in 1969. For over a quarter century, the Sabres have \nmade the long winter a bit more enjoyable for the people of Buffalo, \nand with the recent completion of the Marine Midland Arena, Seymour \nKnox has assured that this alliance will long continue.\n  Apart from his interest in hockey, Seymour Knox was a leading \ninvestment executive at Kidder Peabody and Co., and active in the \ncommunity. He was chairman of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, the body \nwhich oversees the gallery created by his father, and was also named \nchairman of the Smithsonian Associates in 1984. He was also active in \nthe Buffalo YMCA, the U.S. Squash Racquets Association, and the Seymour \nH. Knox Foundation. He will long be remembered as someone who cared \ndeeply about the city of Buffalo and who used his standing in the \ncommunity to improve the lives of countless citizens.\n  Seymour Knox will be fondly remembered by his wife, Jean; his \nbrother, Northrup: his three sons, Seymour IV, W.A. Read, and Avery F.; \nhis daughter, Helen K. Keilholtz; and five grandchildren. We offer our \ncondolences and prayers to his family.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article from the Buffalo \nNews be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, May 23, 1996]\n\n      Seymour Knox III Leaves Legacy to the Community He Cared For\n\n       Seymour H. Knox III was born to wealth, and he put it to \n     good use for his community. Like his father before him, Knox \n     left Buffalo an institution that will forever bear his mark. \n     In his father's case, it was a nationally known art gallery. \n     In his case, it is a nationally famous sports team. Buffalo \n     is richer for both of them.\n       To say it simply, Buffalo needs more people like Seymour H. \n     Knox III. His death Wednesday, from cancer, came a few days \n     after the public got its first look at the Marine Midland \n     Arena, which Knox worked arduously to bring into being. It \n     will be the new home of the Buffalo Sabres major-league \n     hockey team, his hard-won creation and his enduring \n     contribution to his home town.\n       More than one friend and more than one fan will express \n     regrets that Knox did not live to see the day when his team \n     would skate onto the ice of the new arena. But at least he \n     knew it would happen.\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\n       Through the efforts of Knox and his brother, Northrup, the \n     Buffalo franchise in the National Hockey League was secured \n     in 1969. From the beginning to this death, Seymour Knox III \n     was chairman of the partnership that owned the team. Most of \n     the time he was also president of the team.\n       Titles aside, the hockey-loving public knew Knox simply as \n     the one who got the team for Buffalo and served as its head \n     man through the years. He was the guy in the gold seats a few \n     rows above the Sabres' bench.\n       Knox also kept the team here. In an age when professional \n     owners change cities at an alarming rate, Knox was loyal to \n     Buffalo even though its comparatively small market might have \n     made other pastures seem greener. The point of the new arena \n     is to make the team financially strong, securing it for \n     Buffalo for the foreseeable future. Knox's vision made the \n     Marine Midland Arena possible. His legacy will be the \n     exciting hockey games of the future--games that will help \n     make Buffalo a better place to spend the winter.\n       Knox was also important to Buffalo for numerous other civic \n     endeavors. Those included the chairmanship of the Buffalo \n     Fine Acts Academy, governing body of the Albright-Knox Art \n     Gallery, which, to a great degree, was his father's gift to \n     Buffalo. The gallery's most distinguishing feature is its \n     modern art collection put together with care by the late \n     Seymour H. Knox Jr.\n       His son's contribution is less genteel, but a community \n     needs many aspects to its life. It is richer for both of \n     these gifts.\n       From the start, the hockey team has played at Memorial \n     Auditorium, Buffalo's aged indoor sports place, now slipping \n     into retirement.\n       At the last Sabres game in the Aud a bit more than a month \n     ago, Knox was given a prolonged ovation by a capacity crowd. \n     Fans know why the Sabres exist. They let it show. Knox gave a \n     short speech, closing with the words: ``Farewell, old \n     friend.''\n       Buffalo people can repeat those words today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5747-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of one \nof the smartest investments this Nation has ever made, the National \nSchool Lunch Program.\n  In 1943, Winston Churchill said that ``there is no finer investment \nfor any community than putting milk into babies.'' That sort of \ninspired investment is what the School Lunch Program is about. The only \nnutritious meal some children eat in a day, a school lunch can help to \nlengthen attention span, increase learning capacity and dramatically \nimprove overall health.\n  The School Lunch Program currently operates in 95 percent of our \nNation's schools and serves 26 million children each school day. It is \na remarkable success, and I urge my colleagues to join me in commending \nthe people who make that success possible, from the people at the USDA \nwho run the program, to the State and local nutritionists who plan the \nmeals and the school food service workers who serve them to our \nchildren. Each of them is helping to make our country stronger and \nhealthier, and we thank them for it.\n  The School Lunch Act was passed not as an act of charity, not even as \na matter of educational efficacy, but as a matter of national security \nafter shocking numbers of young men failed their physicals in World War \nII because of preventable, nutrition-related illnesses.\n  Last year, Department of Agriculture updated Federal regulations to \nrequire school meals to meet the Federal dietary guidelines for \nAmericans. The resulting Schools Meals Initiative for Healthy Children \nwill make a good program even better.\n  Recognizing that simply adopting policies does not always guarantee \nchange, the Clinton administration launched Team Nutrition in June 1995 \nto unite public and private organizations in promoting healthful \ndietary habits through schools, community organizations and the media. \nThis groundbreaking measure also provides the training, technical \nassistance, and nutrition education that are critical to the School \nMeals Initiative's successful implementation.\n  Last fall marked the introduction of the Team Nutrition Schools \nProgram, which brings together teachers and principals, schools and \nfamilies, community leaders and school food service professionals to \nwork for healthier school meals.\n  This fall, the USDA will build on the success of Team Nutrition by \nproviding every school district with the help they may need to make \nsure the meals they serve their students meet the Federal dietary \nguidelines. I'm proud to have sponsored the amendment that will enable \nthe USDA to get that information and assistance out to schools ahead of \ntheir original target date.\n  Our Nation has done much to alleviate childhood hunger and \nmalnutrition in the 50 years since President Truman signed the National \nSchool Lunch Act. Rickets and other nutrition-related illnesses that \nonce were common among poor children in this Nation are now mercifully \nrare because we channelled the will and resources of this great Nation \nagainst them.\n  But the challenge is not ended. Every month, 5 million children go \nhungry in this country. One out of every eight children under the age \nof 12. So today, as we celebrate 50 years of success with the School \nLunch Program, let us remember these children and recommit ourselves to \nseeing that they, too, are able to share in the abundant blessings of \nour land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5748-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5748-S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wasn't able to get to the floor during the \ntime set aside during debate on the Defend America Act, but it's an \nimportant topic and I would like to address it now.\n  Mr. President, we all want to defend America and I yield to no one in \nmy commitment to a strong national defense, but I believe the Defend \nAmerica Act in its current form could actually reduce U.S. security. I \nreach this conclusion based on a review of four key aspects of a \nnational missile defense system:\n  First, the nature of the threats that the United States faces today \nand will likely face 10 years from now.\n  Second, the technological implications of building a system today \nversus in the future.\n  Third, the question of affordability.\n  And fourth, the impact on existing arms reduction treaties.\n  On all counts, the available evidence weighs against deployment of a \nnational missile defense system in the near term. Consider the threat. \nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nwe have witnessed a remarkable reversal in the arms race and, as such, \nthe nature of the nuclear threat to America. The Soviet nuclear \narsenal, over 13,000 nuclear weapons strong at the height of the cold \nwar, will be reduced to about 3,500 weapons under START II. By any \nmeasure, this adds up to a more secure America.\n  Today, instead, the ballistic missile threat can be summed up in \nthree scenarios: An accidental attack by land-based ICBM's from Russia \nor China, an unauthorized attack by a Russian submarine, or a very \nlimited attack by a rogue nation such as North Korea or Iraq. Note, \nsince we are addressing missile defenses, that I am referring to \nmissile threats. This is not to suggest that other means of delivery \nare any less threatening, whether trucks, ships, aircraft, or even \nsuitcases. I also consider the threat of biological or chemical attack \nas more likely if not more devastating than nuclear attack.\n  The Russian and Chinese missile attack scenarios are nothing new--we \nhave lived with such threats for decades. But the third threat is in my \nmind the most problematic in the long term. While worst-case United \nStates intelligence estimates forecast that North Korea may be only a \nfew years away from deploying ICBM's that can reach portions of Hawaii \nand Alaska, other potentially hostile nations are at least a decade \naway from such a capability. Although their direct purchase of long-\nrange missile components or systems is always possible, the balance of \nevidence suggests that it would be premature to commit to a near-term \ndefense capability when we're not even sure when, whether, and how the \nthreat will develop.\n  The Defend America Act calls for deployment by 2003, or 8 years out. \nIt may seem as though we're splitting hairs, but this is an important \ndistinction between those trying to mandate a date certain for \ndeployment, and those willing to invest responsibly and deploy after \nthe technology has proven itself and the threat is closer to the \nhorizon.\n  Consider the technological implications of building a system today \nversus at the turn of the century or later. I\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nsupported funding in the eighties for what was referred to as the \nstrategic defense initiative. But then as now, in the absence of a new \nand compelling threat on the order of a reinvigorated Soviet Union, \nwhat is the driving force to lock into today's technology? My \nRepublican colleagues seem to believe that we can set a completion \ndate, spend huge sums of money on the problem, and magically achieve a \nfix. How easily we forget the optimistic projections for the \nperformance of the Patriot missiles in the gulf war, and of the x-ray \nlaser that was inaccurately touted in the eighties as the definitive \nsolution for knocking down hundreds of missiles and warheads. The \nchallenge for hitting a bullet with a bullet is not less daunting today \nthan in the past. We cannot simply dictate a solution.\n  But even if we could achieve the technology in the near term, what \nare the costs over the long run if we buy today, discover that the \ntechnological window has again been broken through, and then turn \naround and buy anew in another 5 or 6 years? If we ever expect to \nachieve a balanced Federal budget, it won't be through impetuous, \nimpulsive buying of an extremely expensive system.\n  Which leads me to the issue of affordability. A range of numbers are \nthrown around as estimates of the costs for a national missile defense. \nCBO recently came out with an estimate of $60 billion which has been \nwidely reported in the press. But we all should acknowledge the great \nuncertainties in this type of estimation. A small change in the \nassumptions about the accuracy of our sensors, or the probability of \nkill of our interceptors, or whether the threat uses decoy or \nmaneuvering warheads, can change the final cost estimates by an order \nof magnitude. I'm willing to put tens of billions into an effective, \nlimited national missile defense. But I cannot condone pouring billions \nof the taxpayer dollars into an unproven capability whose costs could \nexplode and needlessly drain other vital defense programs.\n  But for those Senators who believe the threat is imminent, and that \nthe technology is achievable in the near term, and that the costs will \nbe reasonable, I urge them to carefully consider what the Defend \nAmerica Act would mean for existing and future arms control agreements. \nMany Senators today have pointed out that the act anticipates a breach \nof the ABM Treaty, and that it could undermine the START process. But \nwe need to understand in more detail the value of these treaties and \nwhy their erosion or loss could actually decrease America's security. \nMr. President, I would like to address this matter in some depth.\n  Let's first step back to the years before the 1972 ratification of \nthe ABM Treaty, when the debate over missile defenses was in full \nforce. Those opposed to any kind of limits on missile defense \ndeployments were highly critical of those willing to deliberately \nconstrain America's ability to defend its citizens against missile \nattack. But missile defense advocates needed to meet two tests: the \nfirst, generally referred to as arms race stability; the second, crisis \nstability.\n  Arms race stability refers to a situation between armed nations where \nthere are few incentives for a vicious cycle of tit-for-tat weapons \ndeployments. In an unstable setting, the deployment of a system by one \nside is met by the same or more deployments by the other side, which in \nturn is countered by more deployments by the first side, and so on ad \ninfinitum.\n  Historically, the nation facing an expanded threat might respond with \nnew offensive capabilities, better defenses, or both. But in the case \nof missile defenses, the technologies available in the sixties and \nseventies for intercepting incoming nuclear warheads with nonnuclear \ninterceptors were proving very costly. And with the introduction of so-\ncalled MIRV'd ballistic missiles in the 1960's--where several nuclear \nwarheads could be placed on a single missile and targeted \nindependently--offensive nuclear forces became, by comparison, quite \ninexpensive. The cost to deploy one additional nuclear warhead on a \nMIRV'd ICBM was significantly less than the cost of the many \ninterceptors and related sensors required to destroy that warhead.\n  By this dynamic, it was convincingly argued by ABM Treaty proponents, \nany United States attempts to deploy costly strategic defenses would be \nmet by even less costly Russian deployments of more nuclear warheads \nthat could simply overwhelm the defenses. This situation would have \nbeen highly unstable from an arms race perspective. Assisting the \noffense in this equation was the possibility of deploying on ICBM's \nhundreds of decoys and radar-reflecting chaff along with the nuclear \nwarheads to confuse the U.S. interceptors and their sensors.\n  During the 1980's, technologies had advanced, improving the prospects \nfor more cost-effective defenses. Particularly promising were space-\nbased systems which could destroy ICBM's during their early flight \nbefore they deployed their warheads, and lasers which showed potential \nfor engaging many targets in a short period. And yet despite over $35 \nbillion in R expenditures since President Reagan launched the \nStrategic Defense Initiative in 1983, it would still appear that--at \nleast in the case of Russia and perhaps China--the incremental cost for \nthe offense is lower than for the defense.\n  START II, still awaiting Russia's ratification, will not only reduce \nRussia's nuclear arsenal to about 3,500 warheads, but, of equal \nimportance, the treaty requires the elimination of land-based MIRV'd \nsystems. If the United States decides to deploy national missile \ndefenses early in the next decade and the Russians want to maintain \ntheir ability to target the United States, they could simply deploy \nmore MIRV'd ICBM's at a lower cost. Indeed, if the United States did \ndecide to unilaterally deploy national defenses without first reaching \nan agreement with the Russians, it would be an entirely rational and \nappropriate response for Moscow to forgo START and retain or build more \nof its most cost-effective countermeasure--MIRV'd ICBM's. We could \nagain face a Russian arsenal of over 11,000 warheads.\n  We could easily push the Russians to reverse course and hold onto or \neven produce more of their most formidable MIRV'd ICBM, the SS-18--a \nmissile that we spent enormous diplomatic capital to have dismantled. \nThe cold war SS-18 force of over 300 ICBM's housed roughly 3,000 large, \nhighly accurate nuclear warheads. Its capability to devastate the \nUnited States ICBM force created much anxiety during the cold war, \nprimarily because it gave the Soviets an incentive to launch a \ndisarming first strike in the midst of a crisis with the United States \nor NATO.\n  The choice is a stark one: on the one hand, a United States national \nmissile defense that could handle limited attacks from many potential \nthreats, but would be incapable of defeating a major Russian attack \nbecause the Russians respond by maintaining a daunting arsenal of \nMIRV's; and on the other hand, a Russian devoid of its most devastating \nthreat to our country--its large, MIRV'd, highly accurate ICBM's. On \nthis point alone, I would oppose pushing legislation that would tell \nthe Russians we plan to violate the ABM Treaty by the year 2003. This \nseems especially shortsighted since we're not even sure the technology \nwill be available by then even if we double the national missile \ndefense budget.\n  We used to also consider the issue of arms race stability in the \ncontext of other potential threats today. Here national missile \ndefenses show more promise.\n  A single nuclear weapon can transform a minor nation into a serious \nregional power overnight. The most obvious example is Iraq. Initial \nmargins of public and congressional support for the United States \ndeployment to the gulf were slim. But if Saddam Hussein had possessed a \nworking nuclear device when Iraq invaded Kuwait, some argue that the \nUnited States would have steered clear of the gulf.\n  For those rogue nations considering entry into the nuclear club, the \nexistence of even a limited but effective U.S. missile defense \ncapability, whether for theater or national defense, creates a \ndisincentive for embarking on the economically and diplomatically \ncostly path of nuclear development. Granted, missile defenses will not \nstop the rogue leader from delivering a weapon via truck, ship, \naircraft, cruise missile, or even a suitcase, but his inability to \ndeliver a rapid missile strike against the United States or allied \nforces in the theater or U.S. civilians in North America helps dampen \nhis enthusiasm for nuclear development, or\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\nfor that matter biological or chemical weapons development.\n  Next, examine the nation with a fledgling or modest nuclear arsenal, \nor biological or chemical weapons. Many of these nations, such as North \nKorea or China, not only have weapons of mass destruction, but have or \nwill soon have the means for delivering them to United States \nterritory. A U.S. national missile defense could help deter such \nnations from pursuing and producing more longer-range ballistic \nmissiles.\n  As the Russian and United States nuclear inventories shrink \ndramatically under START, China could see an opportunity to become a \npeer in the nuclear superpower league by deploying a hundred or so \nMIRVed ICBM's, each with 10 or so MIRV's. The technology and costs to \ndo so would not be prohibitive. But with a capable national missile \ndefense, the United States could, in part, deter Beijing from pursuing \nsuperpower nuclear status.\n  Well what about crisis stability?\n  Crisis stability refers to a situation where the antagonists in a \ncrisis do not have powerful military motivations--quite independent of \ntheir political and diplomatic incentives--to launch a preemptive \nattack. Imagine two warships sailing side by side--guns trained on each \nother--tensely anticipating the initiation of a battle. If each captain \nknows he can fire a first shot and sink the other ship before his \nopponent can even get off a shot, then the situation is unstable.\n  On first inspection, missile defenses would seem to have lent \nstability to the United States-Soviet nuclear standoff during the cold \nwar. Like the two warships, one side would be less inclined to attack \nthe other knowing that the first attack would be diluted by defensive \nsystems and then met by a destructive counterattack. But proponents of \nthe ABM Treaty saw things differently. What if during that first \nstrike, the attacker could not only overwhelm the opponent's defenses \nand destroy most of them, but also destroy much of his offensive \narsenal in the process?\n  In this scenario, the attacker still has his defenses in place and \nmany offensive weapons that allow him to hold the opponent's cities \nhostage, while his opponent can only respond with a handful of \nsurviving weapons. ABM Treaty proponents concluded that, by creating an \ninviting incentive to strike first, national missile defenses could in \nfact increase the odds for nuclear conflagration.\n  Today, the advent of more capable defensive technologies suitable for \ndeployment in space could only exacerbate the advantage for the first \nstriker, simply because many of the large and vulnerable defensive \nassets in space would be easier to detect and destroy than the warheads \nthey're meant to intercept. As long as defensive systems are vulnerable \nthemselves to attack, we will incur a crisis stability problem if we \nand an opponent deploy extensive national missile defenses.\n  We are now less concerned, of course, about a tense United States-\nSoviet standoff, which hopefully will remain in the ashheap of \nhistory--assuming Yeltsin fends off a Communist revival. Other nuclear \npowers are a different story. Clearly U.S. missile defenses would play \na useful role in controlling escalation in a crisis or conflict with a \nlesser nuclear power, who could not confidently hold a U.S. city \nhostage in the face of U.S. missile defenses.\n  Another component of crisis stability involves dynamics that are \nbeyond the control of rational leaders, such as an accidental or \nunauthorized launch, or an attack whose origins are unclear, or a minor \nattack that is misinterpreted as a major one. Here, too, missile \ndefenses can add to crisis stability by providing the option to defeat \nthese limited attacks before a commitment is made to launching a major \ncounterstrike.\n  On balance, the Defend America Act gets a mixed review from an arms \nrace and crisis stability standpoint. My overriding concern, however, \nis that the advantages of a national system--even in the context of a \nrogue nation, accidental, or unauthorized attack--do not outweigh the \nconsequences of undermining START and engendering extensive Russian \nMIRVed ICBM redeployments.\n  The Russians have made it very clear that unilateral United States \nabrogation of the ABM Treaty, as anticipated by the Defend America Act, \nwill force Moscow to forgo START II ratification. This is not mere \nrhetoric. Russia's heavy MIRVed ICBMs give Moscow its best ``bang for \nthe buck.'' The Russian military is strapped for cash and can barely \nafford modernization of its strategic nuclear forces. If Russia's \nstrategic position vis-a-vis the United States is undermined, it would \nbe perfectly rational as I stated earlier for Moscow to renege on \nSTART.\n  In light of these concerns, I cannot support the Defend America Act \nin its current form. We should not pass legislation which mandates \ndeployment of a national missile defense by 2003, and requires the \nPresident to renegotiate the ABM Treaty to ease its restrictions on the \ndevelopment of such a system. As my Democratic colleague from Ohio has \nnoted, we can no more dictate the development of an unproven technology \nthan to mandate a cure for cancer. And we cannot unilaterally \nrenegotiate a major treaty.\n  I believe a more measured approach is needed. First, we need to \ncontinue basic research on national missile defenses at the requested \nlevel and in compliance with the ABM Treaty. This means no space-based \nsystems or space-based tracking in an ABM mode.\n  Second, we should continue to vigorously pursue programs, such as \nNunn-Lugar, that will reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and related technologies. The return on the dollar of these \nprograms is self-evident and I will not advocate them further here. Let \nme just add that we should not lose sight of an equally troubling \ndelivery system, such as a truck, ship, aircraft or suitcase, that \ncould be used to transport a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon to \nor near our territory or military forces. If we are not balanced in our \nresponses to all means of delivering weapons of mass destruction, we \ninvite a hostile regime to take the path of least resistance and simply \nbypass our multibillion dollar missile defenses. I applaud Senator \nNunn's initiative to broaden the scope of the national missile defense \nlegislation to consider all strategic weapons and means of delivery.\n  Third, we need to continue to achieve a theater missile defense \ncapability quickly, but avoid spreading ourselves too thinly. We're \nspending a great deal of money on several theater systems when in \nreality nothing will be fielded for years, and we're uncertain if one \nor more approaches will ever fully work or be highly cost-effective. I \nwas skeptical of the optimistic estimates of Patriot performance prior \nto the gulf war, and not surprised when we learned that early news \nreports had grossly overstated its performance during the war.\n  My fourth recommendation, therefore, is to expend considerable \nresources on the most mature theater system, PAC-3, to demonstrate that \nwe can achieve a basic capability against a moderate threat. By \nmoderate threat I mean a limited attack by missiles that were not \nspecifically designed to defeat our defenses with decoys, maneuvering \nreentry vehicles, and the like. If we successfully conclude this mini-\nManhattan Project, we can accelerate the other technologies to achieve \nthe kind of layered defenses that would greatly improve overall missile \ndefense performance.\n  Fifth, we should create an architecture that could be expanded into \nspace at a later date if merited by the threat, but stick to ground and \nairborne systems for now. This means that as we make decisions on the \noptimal technologies for national defense interceptors, sensors, and \ncommunications systems, we ensure that they are compatible with future, \nmore robust technologies and systems.\n  Sixth, we need to work with the Russians to amend the ABM Treaty to \nallow for mutual tiered expansion of missile defense systems. In other \nwords, after we've proven a basic system that fits within the treaty's \nconstraints, and after we've achieved key research milestones on a more \nexpansive system, we should then be able to approach the Russians for \njoint approval of testing or deployment of the next tier of defenses.\n  The Russians might decide to go along with the next phase even if \nthey have not reached the same capability, or ask for a delay in the \njoint approval to give them time to reach some sort of parity in \ndefensive capability. We\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nmight even want to permit asymmetries in a modified ABM Treaty or START \nIII, where the Russians would be allowed relatively more offensive \ncapabilities as the United States deploys national defenses.\n  At each step, we could consider any requests by the Russians for \nassistance to improve their own defenses. Although I am not convinced \nsuch assistance would be in our best interests, this might be a small \nprice to pay if we want to deploy national defenses and keep the ABM \nand START Treaties alive.\n  A good initial step, as proposed by Senator Nunn in the context of \nhis substitute amendment, is for both sides to agree to rescind the \n1974 Protocol to the ABM Treaty, which reduced the number of national \nmissile defense sites allowed by the original treaty from two to one. \nIf we try to deploy a ground-based national defense system constrained \nto one site, we are looking at an inordinate inefficient and therefore \nexpensive system.\n  Allowing for space-based tracking in an ABM mode also makes sense if \neach side is interested in a more capable and cost-effective limited \nnational defense. Another area that could prove win-win for both sides \nis construction of jointly manned, ground-based missile launch \ndetection centers near each other's ICBM fields.\n  Finally, we have to engage the Chinese sooner rather than later on \ntheir growing nuclear arsenal. According to press accounts, China has \ndeployed CSS-3 and CSS-4 ICBMs, the latter of which are capable of \nreaching most of the continental United States. China has also \nreportedly tested the CSS-4 missile armed with MIRVs. Most recently, \nthe Washington Times reports that the Chinese are acquiring technology \nfrom the Russian SS-18. It would not require an inordinate amount of \nresources for China to deploy dozens of additional ICBMs with MIRVs, \nmeaning possibly hundreds of new warheads that could rain down on \nUnited States cities.\n  Now is the time to discourage the Chinese from embarking on an \nambitious, and highly destabilizing, nuclear arms build-up. That is \nwhy, Mr. President, it is crucial that the United States pursue \ntrilateral negotiations with Russia and the People's Republic of China \non MIRVed ICBMs. I have drafted a Sense of the Senate resolution \nrelated to this matter, and may offer it during consideration of the \nfiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reiterate my opposition to the Defend \nAmerica Act, urge a more measured approach and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, as one who has spent much of his Senate \ncareer seeking to broaden and expand educational opportunity, I want to \ncommend President Clinton for the education proposal that he today \nplaced at the forefront of his domestic agenda. I also take special \npride in the fact that he set forth his proposals in his commencement \naddress at Princeton University, which is my alma mater.\n  While we have not had the opportunity to examine the package in any \ndetail, I am particularly drawn to two of the President's proposals. \nThe first of these is the Hope scholarship plan. Its thrust and purpose \nis most certainly consistent with my longstanding belief that we ought \nto guarantee 2 years of education beyond high school to every student \nwho has the drive, desire, and talent.\n  As I have said many times, the idea that 12 years of education is \nsufficient education for our young people is, quite simply, an \noutmoded, turn-of-the-century concept. As we approach the turn of a new \ncentury, it is truly high time that we discarded that notion. The vast \nmajority of leaders in the growth industries of our Nation recognize \nthat a skilled work force requires at least 2 years of education beyond \nhigh school. But while we have talked about trying to change an \noutdated policy, it is President Clinton who has brought the talk to an \nend and laid out a plan to make the concept of 14 years of education a \nreality.\n  The Hope scholarship plan would provide a $1,500 tax credit for the \nfirst year of education after high school, and another $1,500 for the \nsecond year if they worked hard, stayed off drugs, and earned at least \na ``B'' average. It is a plan that would reward efforts and \nachievement, twin objectives with which I strongly concur.\n  It is a plan that would make a tuition-free education possible for 67 \npercent of all community college students. For students with financial \nneed, it would work in concert with the Pell grant and further ease the \nburden of paying for a college education.\n  While it would have its most profound impact on students attending \ncommunity college, it would also be of immense help to students \npursuing a 4-year degree. Students and their families could opt for \neither the $1,500 tax credit or a $10,000 tax deduction. It would be \ntheir decision as to which option better suited their needs.\n  With respect to the proposed $10,000 tax deduction, I am especially \npleased that the administration has refined its original proposal. It \nwill now be targeted to hard-pressed middle-income wage earners. These \nare the very families who today find that paying for their children's \neducation is increasingly beyond their financial reach.\n\n  The other proposal to which I am drawn is the President's proposed \n33-percent increase in the maximum Pell grant over the next 7 years. \nFor fiscal year 1997, the President has already proposed increasing the \nmaximum grant from $2,470 to $2,700, a 1-year increase of almost 10 \npercent. And, according to today's announcement, the maximum grant \nwould continue to receive yearly increases, and would reach a maximum \naward of $3,128 by fiscal year 2002.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal will not redress the terrible imbalance \nbetween grants and loans that has become so pronounced over the past \ndecade and a half. Where a deserving student's financial aid package \nwas once 75 percent grants and 25 percent loans, today it is the \nopposite--almost 75 percent loans and only 25 percent grants. Yet, even \nthough the President's proposal may fall short of the mark, it is \ncertainly a welcome step in the right direction. It also stands in \nstark contrast to the budget resolutions approved by both the House and \nSenate. They would freeze the budget authority for the Pell Grant \nProgram.\n  In all candor, however, we should take the President's Pell grant \nproposals as only the first step. We ought to give it our careful and \nthoughtful consideration, and then do him one better by enacting \nlegislation that truly addresses the enormous and growing debt burden \nincurred by literally millions of college students as they struggle to \npay for a college education. While I realize I may sail against the \npolitical winds, I continue to believe deeply that the Pell grant ought \nto be made an entitlement, which would free it from the pitfalls of \nyearly appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I believe deeply that education is a capital \ninvestment. What we put into the education of our children is returned \nto us many times over. Every study we know shows that there is a direct \nrelationship between more education and higher personal income. Better \neducation means better jobs, and better jobs mean a stronger and more \nvibrant economy. We must be careful, however, that the cost of an \neducation and the debt undertaken in getting it do not overtake us.\n  I welcome the President's proposals. I applaud the initiative he has \ntaken. I congratulate him for placing a priority on education. While we \nhad little advance notice of these proposals and virtually no time in \nwhich to mull them over, I hope very much that we will\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\ngive them careful and thoughtful consideration, and that they will not \nbe overwhelmed by election year politics.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the U.S. \nConstitution and what I believe is the essential need to exercise \nextreme restraint in regard to amending this great document. As recent \narticles in a number of publications and newspapers have pointed out, \nthis Congress, Mr. President, the 104th Congress, perhaps unlike any in \nrecent memory, seems intent on amending the U.S. Constitution. I do not \nquestion the sincerity of those efforts. The history of our \nConstitution and those amendments that have been adopted, as well as \nthe mechanism crafted by the framers for adopting amendments, counsels \nthat caution govern any efforts to amend this great document, our \nConstitution.\n  Since its ratification in 1788, the Constitution of the United States \nhas been the single greatest protector of individual rights known to \nman. It is superior to any of its predecessors, and has been the \nbenchmark against which all other constitutions since adopted have been \njudged. Perhaps the greatest tribute to the U.S. Constitution, Mr. \nPresident, and the greatest tribute to those who drafted the document, \nis that in the 208 years since its ratification, the people of this \nNation have only amended it on 27 occasions. This equates with only \nabout one amendment every 7.7 years.\n  However, Mr. President, this figure is a little bit misleading when \none looks closely at the actual history accompanying those 27 \namendments. It becomes obvious that those specific instances where the \npeople of this Nation have moved to amend their Constitution have \nactually been few and far between, and those efforts have typically \nonly been in response to some fundamental deficiency or flaw in our \ndemocratic system of government.\n  As we look at the 27 amendments, Mr. President, for example, the \nfirst 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, were \nadopted as part of an agreement to actually garner support for the \npassage of the underlying Constitution itself; 10 of the 27 were \nadopted at the very outset of our country. Anti-Federalists who opposed \nthe Federal Constitution were opposed to its adoption unless and until \na more explicit statement on the rights of man was added to the \nConstitution. The fervent belief that certain rights should remain \nsquarely within the province of the individual manifests itself in the \nBill of Rights.\n  While the Bill of Rights was adopted almost simultaneously with the \nConstitution, becoming effective in 1791, what the Bill of Rights did \nwas set a tone which on most subsequent occasions has been followed. \nThat tone was that constitutional amendments should be reserved for \nresponse to shortcomings in our democratic way of governance in \ngeneral, not to attend to the emotion or issue of the day each time. I \nthink this is evidenced by the adoption, following the Civil War of the \n13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. These three amendments, much like the \nBill of Rights, spoke directly to the rights and equality of men, and \nextended to African-Americans rights previously that were denied to \nthem, denied to them under the original Constitution, and even under \nthe original Bill of Rights.\n  Further, many of our constitutional amendments deal directly with the \nability of citizens to participate in democracy, they go to the very \ncore of whether everyone can participate. The 17th, 19th, 24th and 26th \namendments improve citizen involvement in elections by allowing for the \ndirect election of Senators, extending the franchise to women, \nabolishing the poll tax, and reducing the voting age. The essence of \ndemocracy itself, Mr. President, is participation. These amendments \nfostered that fundamental element of our Nation. For that reason, I \nthink they were all probably appropriate uses of the unusual and unique \nability to amend the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, obviously there have been other amendments albeit few \nrising to the level of the importance of the Bill of Rights and the \nCivil War amendments. However, I have noted these not to argue their \nimportance, but to illustrate that throughout our history most \namendments to the Constitution have been restricted to addressing \nsystemic problems with our Government--problems which actually inhibit \none's ability to participate in the benefits of democracy. In other \nwords, these have to do with basic errors or problems that have arisen \nin our system that simply mean somebody cannot participate fully in our \ndemocracy. They have not, almost in every case, been amendments that \nhave to do with one particular issue at a time that is dividing our \ncountry.\n  Of course, on one glaring occasion we did depart from this standard \nand we adopted the ill-fated 18th amendment--the prohibition amendment. \nThe result of this misguided venture into social policy resulted 14 \nyears later in the adoption of another amendment, 1 of the 27, the 21st \namendment, which repealed prohibition. So that is 2 of the 27, a lousy \nidea that did not work, followed by the repeal of this venture into \nsocial policy.\n  Another aspect of our Constitution which argues for restraint in \namending this document is found in the Constitution in article V. \nArticle V establishes two methods for amending the Constitution. First, \nthe Constitution may be amended by constitutional convention. The \nsecond method allows the Constitution to be amended if approved by two-\nthirds majority of both Houses of Congress, and then, of course, \nratified by three-fourths of the States. These explicit methods for \namendment were, in essence, a compromise between the unworkable \nunanimity requirement for amending the Articles of Confederation, one \nof the reasons that we had a constitutional convention, and the notion \nheld by many of the Framers that some mechanism must exist to address \npotential shortcomings in the new Constitution. The compromise that is \nembodied in article V established a difficult but not impossible \nstandard for amendment which, like the Constitution itself, I think, \nhas served this Nation very well.\n  While article V protects the people from constitutional uncertainty \nand alteration based solely upon the will of an ever-changing political \nmajority, it also provides an avenue for amendment when it is truly \nnecessary.\n  The result of this has been to preserve the Constitution as it was \nintended to be. With only 27 amendments, it remains a general statement \nof principles used to help define a new nation, as opposed to a step-\nby-step method of governance.\n  In so doing, I think article V has prevented the U.S. Constitution \nfrom simply becoming littered with a flurry of well-meaning but \nunnecessary amendments. Article V has prevented the Constitution from \nevolving into a document that would be almost unrecognizable in terms \nof length and scope to the Framers, who drafted it over 200 years ago. \nThis is the really important thing, Mr. President, because it points \nout the fundamental distinction between a Constitution and ordinary \nstatutes.\n  There is a big difference in our system. As I understand it, there is \nless of a difference in the system in England. There, there is no \nwritten Constitution; Parliament is supreme. Technically speaking, \nParliament can pass any law, and it then becomes the supreme law of the \nland. We have broken that system. We chose to have a simple, brief \ndocument that was greater than the legislature, that was greater than a \nparliament, that was greater than a Congress. It is the notion of a \nlimited written Constitution. That is the difference between us and the \nEnglish system. And, in fact, it was part of the reason, in my view, \nwhy the revolution was fought. Our citizens wanted a document over \nwhich no legislative body had supremacy, except for in the very unusual \ncircumstances that were\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\noutlined in article V, or a combination of a very significant \nsupermajority of Congress and very significant supermajority of States \ntogether would have to be the only ones that could ever amend that \ndocument.\n  As Prof. Kathleen Sullivan pointed out recently in an article \ncleverly entitled, ``Constitutional Amendmentitis'':\n\n       The very idea of a Constitution turns on the separation of \n     the legal and the political realms. The Constitution sets up \n     the framework of the Government. It also sets forth a few \n     fundamental political ideals (equality, representation, \n     individual liberties) that place limits on how far any short-\n     term majority may go. This is our higher law. All the rest is \n     left to politics.\n\n  Mr. President, let there be no doubt that had this standard that \nKathleen Sullivan very eloquently stated had not prevailed throughout \nour history, the fundamental character of our Constitution would be \ngreatly diminished today.\n  In the course of our history, it is estimated that nearly 11,000 \namendments to the Constitution have been introduced. Had not our \npredecessors and the standards embodied in article V combined to reject \nthe vast majority of these efforts, it is uncertain what our \nConstitution might look like today. It, obviously, would not look \nanything like the Constitution. You probably could not find anything in \nthere that the Founding Fathers had put together. It would not be, as \nChief Justice John Marshall argued, a framework of the great outlines \nof our society.\n  So let us say that throughout our history people had proposed in each \nlegislative session and gotten through a constitutional amendment about \nthings like school prayer or balancing the budget, or flag burning--I \nam sure there would have been a variety of social concerns that each \nsession of our Congress would have tacked onto the Constitution. Let me \ntell you something else because I believe in the whole Constitution. I \nthink our first amendment would not look anything like it does today. I \nalso think that the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which I \nbelieve in, and which protects the right to bear arms, might not be \nthere either.\n  See, that is what happens when you start down this road. When anybody \ngets a bright idea, instead of trying to pass a bill that can be \nchanged without going through the constitutional process, somebody \nsays, ``Let us do a constitutional amendment.'' Well, that is the \ngreatest threat to our basic liberties than anything we can do \nlegislatively--whether it be the right to free speech or a person's \nright to simply have a firearm if they want to go hunting. Somebody \ncould try to get rid of that. If we go down this road, there is no end \nto it.\n  It is with this Nation's reluctance to amend the Constitution in mind \nthat I rise today to voice my concern that the lessons of our \nconstitutional history have been lost in the 104th Congress. I have had \nthe honor of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee for a little \nmore than a year now, along with the Presiding Officer. And in that \ntime the full committee has voted on three amendments to the \nConstitution, and, in the near future, as many as four more may be \nforthcoming.\n  To date in the 104th Congress, over 135 constitutional amendments \nhave been proposed. But what is more troubling is that the 104th \nCongress has voted on more amendments to the Constitution than any of \nits predecessors in recent history. The other body has voted on four \namendments, while this body has voted on two and debated a third. As \nthe distinguished retired Judge Abner Mikva wrote in the Legal Times \nrecently, ``The 104th Congress has taken floor action on more \nconstitutional amendments than any other Congress in the last 30 \nyears.''\n  I note that an amendment to require a supermajority to raise taxes \nwas brought to the House floor recently solely because it was tax day--\nApril 15. They knew they were not going to win on that vote. That was \nwell known. It was brought to the floor simply so that proponents could \nstand up on tax day and make speeches. The thought that an amendment to \nthe Constitution could be offered solely because it offers a good sound \nbite opportunity seems to be a little indefensible. I think it is a \ndeparture from the time when the Framers met in Philadelphia, guided \nonly by a tenuous opportunity to craft a framework to guide a new \nNation.\n  Throughout the course of many of the debates on amendments, the \nargument has been made that Congress should simply pass proposed \namendments and let the people of the Nation decide their fate. However, \nto do so defies our sworn obligation to uphold the Constitution of this \nNation. I fell into this trap here. I think many of my colleagues know \nof my strong desire to see campaign finance reform in this country. The \nway we do things around here, sometimes an amendment is tacked onto \nanother bill. On one occasion, I actually voted for a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that would have started us down the road toward a \nconstitutional amendment that would have overturned Buckley versus \nValeo. It would have limited how much could be spent in campaigns. I \nunderstand how people feel when they are frustrated and want to turn to \na constitutional amendment. I think I made a mistake, and I would not \nvote that way now because I realize that everybody has a bright idea \nabout how to change the Constitution. We need to find a way to solve \nour problems and do our job without messing up the fundamental document \nthat has helped make this country so great. So this session I am \nworking on legislation, along with the Presiding Officer, where through \nthe legislative process we will try to change the campaign system \nwithout changing the U.S. Constitution's first amendment. So all of us \nhave fallen into this trap. This is not an attempt to suggest that it \nis only Democrats or only Republicans. It is just very tempting. But it \nis a mistake.\n  The Framers of the Constitution set a very high standard for \namendment and explicitly intended that the Members of Congress play a \nsignificant role in adopting any changes to our national charter. In my \nestimation, Mr. President, this is a responsibility of the highest \norder and not one we should abandon.\n  In fact, what separates the U.S. Constitution from many State \nconstitutions, which can go so far as to protect the right to due \nprocess and the right to fish in the same document, is that the \nCongress and the people must ratify amendments. We should remain \nmindful of the Framers' intent and the obligations each of us is sworn \nto uphold. In other words, we are not supposed to kick out \nconstitutional amendments in the Congress and just say let everybody \ndecide on it. That is not what was intended. It was intended that we \nshould give it extremely close scrutiny, and in only very rare \ncircumstances should we send constitutional amendments out for \nratification.\n  Mr. President, if adopted, the amendments considered in the 104th \nCongress would signal the biggest single constitutional remodeling \nsince the Bill of Rights. It is an effort which I believe is \nunnecessary and ill conceived. It is certainly not consistent with our \nhistory of constitutional amendment.\n\n  There can be little doubt that many great challenges lie before our \nNation as we head toward a new century. However, the Constitution \ncannot provide the courage or answers we need to solve our problems, \nnor was it intended to do so. Ultimately, the responsibility for this \nNation lies with the people, the people in this Congress and the people \nwho send us here to do their work.\n  For over 200 years the Constitution has served this Nation well and \nit is essential to the continuing development of our young Nation that \nthe Constitution remain a statement of general principles. In charting \na different course, one which allows the Constitution to serve as the \nmethod of addressing each difficult challenge that faces this Nation, \ninevitably we sacrifice the integrity of this document.\n  We will lose the fundamental integrity of the Constitution which I \nbelieve underlies everything we do.\n  We must guard against the U.S. Constitution becoming what James \nMadison feared would be little more than a list of special provisos.\n  I hope that as we continue our work here in this highly political \nyear we will bear Madison's concerns in mind as well as the history \nsurrounding efforts to amend the Constitution. It is a history worth \nfollowing. A history which defines not only the nature of this great \ndocument but also defines the fundamental character of this Nation. It \nis a history which has helped to ensure that this simple, yet \nbrilliant,\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\ndocument has remained the cornerstone of our freedoms. The spate of \nconstitutional amendments considered during this Congress are at odds \nwith this important precedent.\n  By departing from the fundamental notion that our Constitution \nestablishes the framework or the great outlines of our society and \nseeking to use it to address specific problems, the Constitution will \nbecome something less than it was intended to be. We should quell our \ndesire to amend this great document and address the problems that \nconfront this Nation. Although they are many, none can truly be \nattributed to a constitutional deficiency.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to speak on the Defend America \nAct. First, let me state I am very disappointed that the Senate, one, \nhad to file a cloture motion, and, two, was unsuccessful in obtaining \ncloture so we could at least take up the Defend America Act, debate it, \ndiscuss it and vote on it.\n  It is unfortunate the Democrats in the Senate today decided to \nfilibuster even moving to consider legislation which would allow us to \nfurther develop systems capable of defending America. Even right now we \nare defenseless against intercontinental ballistic missiles. I want to \ncompliment Senator Dole for scheduling this for a floor vote, I \ncompliment the House of Representatives for passing it, but I am \ndispleased that the Senate was not able to consider this legislation.\n  It is unfortunate to think that we need to have 60 votes just to move \nto consider the Defend America Act. I am happy to cosponsor this act. I \nthink it is good legislation, needed legislation.\n  It was part of the defense authorization bill that we passed last \nyear that unfortunately President Clinton vetoed. He vetoed it for \nwhatever reason. I think in the campaign he continued to refer to the \nstrategic defense initiative, star wars. But for whatever reason, he \nleaves us defenseless against incoming intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, missiles that could have a nuclear warhead, missiles that \ncould have a chemical warhead or a biological warhead. Right now we do \nnot have defense capabilities.\n  Regrettably, the vote today was almost straight party line. We had \nall Republicans vote in favor of taking up this legislation. One \nRepublican Senator was necessarily absent. We had one Democrat, Senator \nHeflin, that voted for it. I compliment Senator Heflin. I hate to see \nhim leave the Senate. He has been one of the Senators I think that \nshows courage on occasion and says, ``I'm going to do what is right for \nthis country.'' The Senator from Alabama, I compliment him for his \nvote.\n  What was right for this country was voting for the Defend America \nAct. We do need to develop capabilities to be able to destroy incoming \nmissiles that we do not have today. President Clinton does not agree \nwith that. And I am going to go through a statement that talks about \nwhat the Defend America Act does, and what it does not do, and why it \nis needed.\n  The Defend America Act of 1996 states clearly and simply the United \nStates should be defended against limited, unauthorized or accidental \nballistic missile attacks and calls for the deployment of a national \ndefense system to protect America.\n  This bill does not violate any treaty. It only urges the \nadministration to negotiate with Russia changes to the 1972 Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty to allow for the deployment of an effective \nmissile defense system.\n  If an agreement is not reached within 1 year after the bill is \nenacted, the President and Congress are to consider withdrawing from \nthe treaty, as provided under article 15 of the treaty.\n  Why is the legislation needed? Currently the United States is \nundefended. We are defenseless against ballistic missile attack. Most \npeople are surprised and even shocked to hear this. They are of the \nmistaken belief that the United States can defend itself against \nincoming ballistic missiles. They are wrong.\n  While the United States remains defenseless, Russia long ago \nrecognized the value of missile defenses and deployed its own missile \ndefense system around Moscow.\n  In the ultimate irony, the United States is now assisting Israel in \nacquiring its own missile defense system to protect Israeli citizens. I \nwish the Clinton administration could explain why it will help Israel \ndefend its citizens against missile attack but refuse to protect \nAmericans against missiles. That does not make sense. Maybe it makes \ngood politics, but it does not make good policy.\n  Mr. President, the threats are real, and they are growing. It is \nclear that ballistic missile threats to the United States are growing \nfrom a couple of sources, unauthorized or accidental ballistic missile \nattacks from Russia and China and also from small dictatorships now \nfielding missile forces.\n  We may no longer think in terms of having to defend ourselves against \na massive Soviet missile attack. Yet political instability and \npolitical uncertainty in Russia and China emphasize the need to guard \nagainst a possible unauthorized or accidental missile launch.\n  China has proven willing to threaten the use of ballistic missiles \nfor political and military blackmail, as shown during the Taiwan Strait \ncrisis in March of this year. One month before Chinese military \nexercises and its launching ballistic missiles into the Taiwan Strait, \na Chinese official warned Charles Freeman, Deputy Chief of Mission at \nthe U.S. Embassy in Beijing, that ``the United States would not \nintervene on Taiwan's behalf, because Americans would not be willing to \nsacrifice Los Angeles on Taiwan's behalf,'' as reported in the Los \nAngeles Times on January 27, 1996, page 5.\n\n  Recently, lower level Chinese officials made a not-so-veiled threat \nto American officials. Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for \nEast Asia and the Pacific, quoted these Chinese officials as saying the \nUnited States ``wouldn't dare defend Taiwan because they'd [China] rain \nnuclear bombs on Los Angeles,'' as reported in the Boston Globe, March \n18 of this year.\n  Other ballistic missile threats exist or are also on the horizon. \nMore than 25 countries currently possess, or are seeking to acquire, \nweapons of mass destruction--namely, nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons. Many countries that already have shorter range ballistic \nmissiles are seeking to acquire more sophisticated, long-range \nballistic missiles. Rather than defend Americans, the Clinton \nadministration is rationalizing its inaction by hiding behind \nquestionable intelligence estimates.\n  While recent intelligence estimates say that a new ballistic missile \nthreat to the United States will not appear for the next 15 years, this \nanalysis is flawed for several reasons. First, it focuses only on \nindigenous development and assumes that international trade does not \nexist. The Secretary of Defense, William Perry, recently admitted the \nintelligence community's estimate ``could be foreshortened if any of \nthose nations were able . . . to get direct assistance from countries \nthat already have [such systems], either sending them missiles, selling \nthem missiles, or giving them important component or technology \nassistance.'' That was in his statement before the Senate\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nArmed Services Committee on March 3 of this year.\n  In fact, Secretary Perry recently acknowledged that, ``We do have \ninformation that China was seeking SS-18 technology from Russia.'' That \nwas May 22 of this year. The SS-18 is a massive, 10-warhead ICBM. By \nintegrating SS-18 technology into its current ICBM arsenal, China would \ngreatly enhance the range and sophistication of its nuclear weapons \ncapability. We should remember that China has sold ballistic missiles \nto other countries and has exported missile technology to Iraq, Iran, \nand Pakistan.\n  Second, the estimate that no new threat to the United States will \nappear within 15 years focuses only on the continental United States. \nWhat about Alaska? What about Hawaii? The Clinton administration \napparently prefers not to include the cities in these States as part of \nour Nation, even though they could be vulnerable to a North Korean \nattack in just a few years. In 1995, the Acting Director of Central \nIntelligence, Adm. William Studeman, acknowledged that ``if Pyongyang \nhas foreshortened its development program [of the Taepo Dong I or Taepo \nDong II], we could see these missiles earlier'' than 3 to 5 years. That \nwas before the Intelligence Committee on April 3, 1995.\n  Finally, intelligence estimates are often wrong. Several years before \nJapan attacked Pearl Harbor, Maj. George Fielding Elliot, author and \nmilitary science writer, declared, ``A Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \nis a strategic impossibility,'' as quoted in September of 1938. This \nprediction is chillingly similar to the ones we are hearing from \ncritics of the Defend America Act today.\n  Looking at the situation today, while recent 1995 national \nintelligence estimates state, ``We [the intelligence community] are \nlikely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years \nbefore development,'' it was the same community that failed to detect \nthe breadth of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Once international \ninspections were conducted after the Persian Gulf war, it was revealed \nthat Iraq's nuclear program was far larger and more advanced than the \nUnited States intelligence community had predicted, and the inspections \nshowed that Saddam Hussein was just months away from deploying a \nnuclear bomb, not years, as the intelligence community had estimated.\n  Just several months ago, CIA Director John Deutch admitted Iran, \nIraq, North Korea, and Libya all had explored the possibility of buying \nfissile materials as a way of rapidly acquiring an arsenal of nuclear \nweapons. So far, according to Deutch, none has succeeded in these \nefforts. But the CIA Director further stated the United States and its \nallies ``have been lucky so far.'' That was in the Washington Post of \nMarch 21 of this year. Mr. President, I am not willing to depend on \nluck to keep Americans safe from ambitious leaders such as Iraq's \nSaddam Hussein and North Korea's Kim Jong-il, who are eagerly seeking \nto acquire more weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  The Clinton administration prefers to rely on cold war theories and \nan outdated 1971 treaty to protect America. The Republicans' Defend \nAmerica Act provides a vision for the future where the United States \nand Russia negotiate changes to the moribund 1972 Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, commonly called the ABM Treaty, to allow for national \ndefense against the emerging threats to both Russia and the United \nStates from Third World countries. Just like the last guest lingering \nat a dinner party, the ABM Treaty has overstayed its welcome.\n  Let us be very clear. Nothing in the Defend America Act requires the \nUnited States to withdraw from or violates the ABM Treaty. The act \nmerely reiterates that withdrawal from the treaty is a legal option \nunder the provisions of the ABM Treaty itself and urges considering \nsuch withdrawal if negotiated changes are not forthcoming within 1 \nyear. Some of the statements that were made earlier today, I think, \nfrankly, are not the case, or maybe our colleagues have not read this \nlegislation as closely as they should have.\n  The imperative for deploying a national defense system has never been \nmore clear. Yet the Clinton administration refused to take immediate \nsteps to defend America. Last year, we worked hard to include similar \nlanguage in the 1996 DOD authorization bill, requiring the President to \ndeploy by a certain date a missile defense system to protect our \ncountry. President Clinton vetoed this bill largely because of this \nprovision. So we passed the defense authorization bill without it.\n  Now we try to pass it as an individual item. The Democrats \nunfortunately, with one exception, Senator Heflin from Alabama, said, \n``No, we do not want to consider it. We do not want to debate it.'' Mr. \nPresident, I think that is a sad day for our country. It bothers me \nwhen I think of the fact that we had Americans lose their lives in \nSaudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war because a Scud missile came in \nand our only defense capability at that time was the Patriot \nantimissile defense. But the Patriot is a very limited defense and was \nonly partially successful. It destroyed a couple of missiles that were \nfired toward Israel and fired toward Saudi Arabia, but destroyed them \nin their backyard, as the missile was coming in, in some cases just \nright before it reached its target. As I said, it was only partially \nsuccessful.\n  That is not a defense capability against more sophisticated weapons. \nThe Scuds that the Iraqis were firing at Americans, Saudi Arabians, and \nIsraelis, those were old missiles, old technology, way behind the \ntimes, not sophisticated in any way, that we can only knock down. Our \nsuccess rate was limited. People would be really shocked if they \nrealized we do not have the capability to shoot down incoming missiles. \nWe need it. We have the technology to develop it. It can be done a lot \nmore economically than the Congressional Budget Office said. It came up \nwith an estimate that said over the next 14 years it might cost $31 to \n$61 billion.\n  In our bill we said ``affordable.'' Frankly, if it costs $31 billion \nand you do that over 14 years, that is a couple of billion a year. I \nthink that is a good investment. I think it would be done a lot more \neconomically than that. Should we not make an investment? Is that not \nreally what the Federal Government is all about, protecting our \nfreedom, protecting our country, protecting our people? When we find \nout we are defenseless against intercontinental ballistic missiles, we \ndo not have the capability to shoot them down, do we not owe it to our \ncountry to invest in a system to destroy these missiles before they get \nin our backyard? If you have a weapon such as a nuclear warhead, it \ndoes not do any good to destroy it over your city, before it reaches \nthe target. Then it is too late. It would maximize damage. If it is \nbiological, the same is true, as well as with a chemical weapon. You do \nnot gain anything destroying it just before it hits the target. You \nneed to destroy it well before it gets into your backyard.\n  We would like to have the opportunity to utilize the technology \nadvances that we have in this country to be able to defend our country. \nUnfortunately, the Clinton administration and Democrats in the Senate, \nwith one exception, have said ``No, we are not going to do it. We want \nto worship at the altar of a treaty from 1972 that says we are not \ngoing to defend ourselves.'' Now, the 1972 treaty does allow you to \nhave at least 100 interceptors, and it also says you can renegotiate. \nThat is really what we are saying we would do. We do not abrogate, we \ndo not violate the ABM Treaty under the Defend America Act. I am \nbothered by the fact that our colleagues would play politics with an \nissue so important as defending American citizens.\n  I am bothered by the fact that this administration finds it \npolitically acceptable to develop anti-missile systems for Israel, but \nnot the United States. That bothers me. It bothers me when I read \nstatements by high-level officials in China talking about the \npossibility of destroying Los Angeles, and we do not have the \ncapability to avoid that should they be irrational enough to ever try \nto carry out such a threat. It bothers me when I see 25 nations around \nthe world, many of which are not real friends of the United States, \nseeking earnestly to develop intercontinental ballistic missile \ntechnology with a variety of warheads that could threaten not only the \nUnited States, but our allies, and we do not do anything to give us \ndefense capabilities.\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\n  That is what Senator Dole was trying to do with the Defend America \nAct today. That is what Senator Wallop, who was one of the real leaders \nin trying to develop strategic defense initiative for years, was trying \nto do. We have a significant investment that this country has made, and \nnow we have an administration that says: We do not think there will be \na threat for 15 years, so let us not do anything. Or let us develop \nmissile systems, and we will pay for three-fourths of it in Israel \nbecause, politically, that is popular.\n  Why is it not popular in the United States if we want to help Israel \ndefend itself? I was in Israel prior to the Persian Gulf war, and I \nurged the administration to get Patriot missiles over there to shoot \ndown the Scuds. It partially worked. But the Patriot is certainly not \ngood enough for an ICBM. We can develop systems to shoot down in-coming \nmissiles before they get in our back yards. We should do it. If it is \nan investment of a couple of billion dollars, or $4 billion, or $31 \nbillion over the next 14 years, that is a good investment for \nprotecting the American people, our interests and our cities. We should \ndo it.\n  Yet, unfortunately, our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle \nsay, no, they are going to protect President Clinton and play politics. \nPresident Clinton does not want it, so we are not going to do it. I \nthink that is a serious, serious mistake. We should not play politics \nwith the security of the American people and American interests. I am \nafraid that is what happened today. I regret that decision.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, once again I rise in support of the \npending proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced \nFederal budget. The reason is quite simple. After all of the turmoil of \nthis past year, after all of the posturing and the pandering and the \npromises and the Government shutdowns, Congress and the President have \nnot come to an agreement to balance the Federal budget. Short of a \nconstitutional requirement, I have serious doubts that the Congress and \nthe President will do so.\n  Admittedly, there is some political Presidential posturing going on \nwith this impending vote. The majority leader, who is his party's \npresumptive Presidential nominee, is calling up this vote knowing full \nwell that he does not have the necessary two-thirds majority. On the \nother hand, the President is proudly stating to the public that his \nefforts in his deficit reduction plan have resulted in reducing the \nannual deficit from when he took office from $294 billion to nearly \n$130 billion this year. He has invited the majority leader to the White \nHouse for further negotiations on balancing the budget.\n  When the majority leader leaves, I hope that the new majority leader \nwill be extended an invitation to go to the White House and to go \nthrough negotiations and settle the differences.\n  In actual dollars and cents, I believe that over the 7-year period \nthere is something in the neighborhood of $12 trillion involved in the \nbudget process, and the difference between the White House's and the \nRepublican Party's position is only $100 billion. That is less than 0.8 \nof 1 percent. And that difference we ought to be able to resolve, get \ntogether and work out.\n  However, this is a political year. We must recognize that. The Senate \nhas just completed action on a $1.6 trillion budget resolution proposed \nby the majority party which seeks to balance the budget by 2002 with a \ncombination of tax and spending cuts. I supported a proposal submitted \nby the President which also called for a balanced budget and would \nachieve a balanced budget, but contained fewer tax cuts and less \ncutting of the Medicare Program. However, this proposal was not \nadopted.\n  The Senate and the House must settle their differences in regard to \nthe budget figures, and then the Appropriations Committees must act, \nand a reconciliation bill must be passed. All of this must be signed by \nthe President. It is going to be a long, hot summer here in Washington \nwhile the rest of the country simmers at our inaction.\n  The budget process is not easy, as we have learned from last year. It \ndoes not guarantee that the President and the Congress will enact a \nbalanced Federal budget. We have seen this, gone through Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings and other proposals which tried to achieve a balanced budget. \nBut all of these have come up wanting. That is one of the reasons why I \nfeel that we need the discipline which a constitutional amendment will \nprovide.\n  I believe that most of my colleagues are well intentioned and want to \nenact balanced budgets for the benefit of generations of Americans yet \nto be born. Unfortunately, I have seen in my Senate career--some 18 \nyears that I have been here--that we can often find an easy excuse for \nnot fulfilling our commitment to deliver a balanced budget each year.\n\n  There is a way out of the thicket right now in regard to the adoption \nof the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A handful \nof Senators, I think as many as eight, have indicated they would vote \nfor the constitutional amendment if a compromise can be reached with \nregard to the Social Security issue.\n  This compromise would not allow Social Security trust fund revenues \nto be used when calculating whether the budget is balanced. Admittedly, \nthis will make balancing the Federal budget more difficult because the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses will no longer be used to mask the \ntrue size of the deficit.\n  A constitutional amendment will remove all doubt, regardless of \nwhether we reach any compromise pertaining to Social Security trust \nfunds or not. A constitutional amendment will remove all doubt, and the \nFederal Government will have to balance its budget. The process will \nstill be difficult, but it will be necessary to achieve the final goal \nas required by this proposed amendment to the Constitution.\n  Amending the Constitution, in my judgment, is a last-resort method \nwhich should be utilized sparingly and only when the national interest \nso demands. I am often asked to cosponsor worthy proposals to amend the \nConstitution, but I rarely do so under the test that I have just \nmentioned.\n  The balanced budget amendment meets that test. The national interest \ndemands that we act to allow the States the opportunity to ratify the \nproposed amendment. They may not do so. And if that is the case, then \nthe will of the American people will have been spoken. Therein is the \ngenius of our Nation's organic document. Ultimately, the sovereign \npower of the Government rests with the people.\n  These will perhaps be my last comments--or perhaps not my last \ncomments on this, but among my last words on this great issue. Further, \nthe first bill I introduced when I came to Congress was a bill calling \nfor a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. I truly \nbelieve that on behalf of the generations of Americans yet unborn, this \nproposed amendment is necessary to prevent them from inheriting an even \ngreater debt than they now most certainly will incur.\n  Politics aside, now is the time to act, once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5756-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5756-S5757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATO ENLARGEMENT FACILITATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier today I think Senator Brown of \nColorado in my behalf and in behalf of others introduced the NATO \nEnlargement Facilitation Act.\n  I am certainly pleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, Senator Brown--who has been a real leader on this issue--the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and a number \nof\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nother colleagues. This legislation is intended to expedite the \ntransition to full NATO membership of emerging democracies in Central \nand Eastern Europe. This bill builds on earlier bipartisan legislation, \nsuch as the NATO Participation Act of 1994, which reflects the strong \nbipartisan support for the policy of enlarging the NATO alliance. NATO \nhas expanded its membership on three occasions, each time enhancing \nsecurity and stability in Europe. Bringing eligible Central and Eastern \nEuropean nations into NATO will serve that same critical purpose. For \nnearly 4 years, the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe have \nsought to protect their freedom and independence by becoming members--\nfull members--of Western institutions, especially NATO. They have \nrepeatedly petitioned for membership. Moreover, they have seized every \nopportunity for such association, proving their flexibility and \nseriousness. They have become partners for peace, but they desire to \nbecome real members of a real alliance. The need for a more inclusive, \nmore effective atlantic alliance that would respond to present security \nneeds has been clear at least since violent aggression began in the \nformer Yugoslavia--where the world witnessed the ineffective response \nof the United Nations, the European Community, the Western European \nUnion, NATO, and the United States.\n  Since that time, it became clear that the elaborate architecture of \nEuropean security developed during the cold war era was, and is, not up \nto the challenges of the post-cold-war world.\n  Meanwhile, the window of opportunity for consolidation of new \nfreedoms, independence, and security is closing. Forging new \nrelationships and new institutions is increasingly difficult and \ncontroversial. In my view, further delays will undermine the \ngovernments and confidence of people recently freed from the \nexpansionist ambitions of aggressive neighbors. Yet, the Clinton \nadministration has acted as if time were not a factor--as if there were \nno threats to the independence of the newly self-governing democracies.\n  Secretary Christopher in a recent speech stated that the \nadministration's policy was ``slow, but deliberate.'' I believe the \nadministration's policy is deliberately slow. The Clinton \nadministration has consistently avoided concrete steps toward NATO \nenlargement--studying and discussing, but not acting. Mr. President, \nthis legislation is designed to facilitate NATO enlargement by \nproviding targeted security assistance for those countries most likely \nto become eligible to join NATO. The NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act \ncreates a $60 million assistance program composed of Foreign Military \nFinancing [FMF] loan and grant programs and the International Military \nEducation and Training [IMET] program. This legislation declares \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic eligible for this assistance \nand authorizes the President to designate others as they meet the \ncriteria in current law.\n  This legislation, however, does not name countries to be NATO \nmembers. That is a decision for the alliance to take. This legislation \nseeks to make up for time lost due to a lack of U.S. leadership. It is \nalso important to note that this bill is a beginning, not an endpoint. \nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will likely be the first \ncountries in Central and Eastern Europe to join NATO-- not the last. \nFinally, this legislation should not be interpreted as a lessening of \nU.S. interests in close ties with other countries in the region. The \nfreedom and security of all of Europe's new democracies are a big \nconcern to us.\n\n  I believe that the United States and NATO must act decisively--before \nthe window of opportunity closes. When the Bush administration was \nconfronted with the challenge of German reunification, Western leaders \nswiftly reached agreement on policy and acted resolutely to achieve it.\n  As with German reunification, the act of including Central and \nEastern European democracies in NATO is not and cannot reasonably be \nseen as an affront--much less a threat--to any other country, least of \nall Russia. All actual and potential members of the NATO alliance share \nan interest in a peaceable, democratic Russia. Furthermore, the United \nStates has a distinct national interest in a firm security relationship \nwith Russia. Any United States Government should, and we expect, will \nwork cooperatively with a democratic Russia for the consolidation of \nsecurity in Europe--but not by denying NATO membership to Europe's new \ndemocracies.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement has enjoyed bipartisan support since \nthe end of the cold war. I hope that all of my colleagues will support \nthis legislation in that same bipartisan spirit.\n  Let me say that we also, of course, addressed in our press conference \nearlier today, when we were honored to have former President Lech \nWelesa of Poland with us, that no countries are named. It is very \nlikely that the first three countries invited will be Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic. Though we have not forgotten the Baltic States \nof Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and other Central and Eastern European \ncountries when they have complied and when they have been selected by \nNATO.\n  So my view is that we have had the good beginning. The former \nPresident of Poland was very impressed, and he feels that we may now be \non the way to achieving something that has been eluding these freedom \nloving people for a number of years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5756-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it has been my practice as Senator \nRepublican leader to pay tribute to colleagues who are retiring from \nthe Senate.\n  Usually, these remarks are delivered shortly before the Senate \nadjourns for the year.\n  However, my announcement of 2 weeks ago that I will also be leaving \nthe Senate has moved up my time schedule.\n  In the coming days, then, I will be devoting some of my leader time \nto share a few memories of those of our colleagues who will not return \nto this Chamber when the 105th Congress convenes next January.\n  Let me start with a friend of all of us, Senator Howell Heflin of \nAlabama.\n  For 18 years, Howell Heflin has represented Alabama with distinction \nhere in the U.S. Senate. But to many here in this Chamber, and to \ncountless Alabamans, it is not ``Senator'' Heflin, it is ``judge'' \nHeflin.\n  Prior to his arrival in the Senate, judge Heflin served for 6 years \nas chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, earning a reputation for \nfairness and common sense. It's a reputation that has continued through \nhis service here in the Senate.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Heflin has become \nknown, in the words of the almanac of American politics, as ``a careful \nlawyer who picks at the rules of law with the delicate touch of a watch \nrepairman.''\n  It took someone with that touch to successful revise America's \nbankruptcy laws, as Senator Heflin did in 1994.\n  Alabama, like Kansas, is a State with a strong agriculture heritage, \nand I have enjoyed serving with Senator Heflin on the Agriculture \nCommittee, and learning a great deal from him about issues ranging from \npeanuts to the boll weevil.\n  But as I reflect back on our 18-year friendship, the one incident \nthat remains most clearly in my mind was Senator Heflin's vote \nauthorizing President Bush to use force to remove Saddam Hussein from \nKuwait. Senator Heflin was 1 of 11 Senate Democrats who has the courage \nto break with their leadership and stand with the President. History \nwill always reflect that this was the right decision and that had the \n52 to 47 vote gone differently, it would have been a tremendous blow to \nAmerica's prestige.\n  Elizabeth and I are proud to call Howell and ``Mike'' Heflin our \nfriends, and we wish them many more years of health and happiness as \nthey return to the state they love so much and have served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5757-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5757-S5758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, ``I am less dynamic than many,'' Senator \nClaiborne Pell once said in his typical quiet manner, ``But I have my \nown course, which I set and try to follow.''\n  For six terms, Claiborne Pell has followed that course in \nrepresenting America's smallest State in terms of geography with a \ncommitment and dedication that is anything but small.\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\n  Foreign policy and the environment are just two of the many issues on \nwhich the contributions of Senator Pell will be long remembered.\n  But, as countless college students over a quarter century can tell \nyou, the one cause which will be forever linked with the gentleman from \nRhode Island is education.\n  His basic education opportunity grant--justifiably renamed the Pell \ngrant in 1980--has provided many financially challenged young Americans \nwith the resources necessary to receive a college degree.\n  The great educator Henry Adams once said, ``a teacher affects \neternity. He can never tell where his influence stops.'' Senator Pell \nwill leave this Chamber with the knowledge that he will never be able \nto tell where his influence stops--because it would be impossible to \nknow or quantify the difference that Pell grants made in the life of \ncountless Americans.\n  I am proud to be called a conservative Republican and Senator Pell is \nproud to be known as a liberal Democrat. Despite the fact we were on \nthe opposite side of many issues, however, I never doubted the fact \nthat Senator Pell's word was his bond, and I knew that, no matter what, \nI could always count on Senator Pell's friendship.\n  I look forward to counting on that friendship for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5757-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have learned over the years that Kansans \nand Coloradans share more than a common border. We also share a deep \nbelief in the values of hard work, honesty, and personal \nresponsibility.\n  And, as westerners, we share a healthy skepticism of those who think \nthey are better qualified to tell us how to run our affairs because \nthey happen to work in the Nation's Capital.\n  For 6 years, the Colorado point-of-view has been represented in this \nChamber with great energy and eloquence by Hank Brown.\n  Senator Brown hit the ground running when he arrived in the Senate, \nand he has not stopped since, making a difference on nearly every major \nissue we have debated.\n  Hank Brown understands the dangers of deficit spending, and the \nbenefits that would come with a balanced budget. And, as a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, he worked closely with Senator Domenici in \nwriting the historic Republican plan to balance the budget.\n  Senator Brown also has exhibited tremendous political courage in his \nwillingness to speak forthrightly about the absolute necessity to \nreform entitlement programs if our children are to live in financially \nsolvent Nation.\n  From a personal point of view, I am grateful that Senator Brown has \nprovided me with the same candor with which he has addressed the issues \nof our day. I always knew that when I asked Hank a question, I would \nreceive in return the plainspoken truth.\n  From the skies above Vietnam to the floor of Congress, Hank Brown has \ndevoted his life to forthrightly serving his country. Though he is \nleaving the Senate after just one term, I have no doubt that he will \nkeep on doing precisely that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5758-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5758-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5758-S5760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE LAPSE OF \n THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                  151\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency declared by Executive Order \nNo. 12924 of August 19, 1994, to deal with the threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by \nthe lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, June 4, 1996.\n\n  President's Periodic Report on the National Emergency Caused by the \n             Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979\n\n       1. On August 19, 1994, in Executive Order No. 12924, I \n     declared a national emergency under the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et \n     seq.) to deal with the threat to the national security, \n     foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by \n     the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as \n     amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) and the system of \n     controls maintained under that Act. In that order, I \n     continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the \n     provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as \n     amended, the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 768 et \n     seq.), and the delegations of authority set forth in \n     Executive Order No. 12002 of July 7, 1977 (as amended by \n     Executive Order No. 12755 of March 12, 1991), Executive Order \n     No. 12214 of May 2, 1980, Executive Order No. 12735 of \n     November 16, 1990 (subsequently revoked by Executive Order \n     No. 12938 of November 14, 1994), and Executive Order No. \n     12851 of June 11, 1993. As required by the National \n     Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I issued a notice on \n     August 15, 1995, continuing the emergency declared in \n     Executive Order No. 12924.\n       2. I issued Executive Order No. 12924 pursuant to the \n     authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and \n     laws of the United States, including, but not limited to, the \n     IEEPA. At that time, I also submitted a report to the \n     Congress pursuant to section 204(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. \n     1703(b)). Section 204 of IEEPA requires follow-up reports, \n     with respect to actions or changes, to be submitted every 6 \n     months. Additionally, section 401(c) of the National \n     Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) requires that the \n     President, within 90 days after the end of each 6-month \n     period following a declaration of a national emergency, \n     report to the Congress on the total expenditures directly \n     attributable to that declaration. To comply with these \n     requirements, I have submitted combined activities and \n     expenditures reports for the 6-month periods from August 19, \n     1994, to February 19, 1995, and from February 19, 1995, to \n     August 19, 1995. The following report covers the 6-month \n     period from August 19, 1995, to February 19, 1996.\n       3. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12924, the \n     Department of Commerce has continued to administer and \n     enforce the system of export controls, including antiboycott \n     provisions, contained in the Export Administration \n     Regulations (EAR). In administering these controls, the \n     Department has acted under a policy of conforming actions \n     under Executive Order No. 12924 to those required under the \n     Export Administration Act, insofar as appropriate.\n       4. Since my last report to the Congress, there have been \n     several significant developments in the area of export \n     controls:\n\n\n                      a. multilateral developments\n\n       Wassenaar Arrangement for Export Controls for Conventional \n     Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. The Bureau of \n     Export Administration (BXA) of the Department of Commerce \n     participated in several rounds of negotiations to establish a \n     successor regime to COCOM. On December 19, 1995, 28 countries \n     (former COCOM partners, cooperating countries, Russia, and \n     the Visegrad states) agreed to establish a new regime, called \n     the Wassenaar Arrangement, to control conventional arms and \n     munitions and related dual-use equipment. The Wassenaar \n     Arrangement will be headquartered in Austria. The first \n     plenary meeting of the new regime was held in Vienna in April \n     1996.\n       Australia Group. The Australia Group (AG) is an informal \n     multilateral body formed in 1984 to address concerns about \n     proliferation of chemical and biological warfare \n     capabilities. Currently, 29 governments, representing \n     supplier or producer countries, are members. The AG operates \n     by consensus.\n       At the October 1995 plenary meeting, the Biological Weapons \n     Experts conducted a technical review of the AG biological \n     control list, which has been in force for 3 years. There was \n     agreement on tightening the controls on certain \n     microorganisms and equipment (e.g., fermenters) that can be \n     used in the production of biological weapons. Regulations are \n     being drafted to reflect these changes in biological weapons \n     export controls.\n       The AG also agreed at the October 1995 plenary to tighten \n     controls on license-free sample shipments. Accordingly, BXA \n     will monitor its recently revised sample shipments rule to \n     determine if it should be modified.\n       The United States shared its experiences at the October \n     1995 meeting in implementing\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\n     its chemical mixtures regulations, and is seeking a \n     comprehensive understanding of how other members implement \n     the AG mixture controls.\n       Members agreed to U.S. proposals at the October 1995 \n     meeting for intensified information exchange and other \n     measures to better address chemical and biological warfare \n     terrorism.\n       Nuclear Suppliers Group. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), \n     currently composed of 32 member countries, maintains a \n     control list of nuclear related dual-use items and guidelines \n     for their control.\n       NSG member countries have recently completed a technical \n     review of the dual-use control list and are presently engaged \n     in restructuring the present control language to better \n     reflect nuclear proliferation concerns as well as to allow \n     the more effective implementation of export controls for \n     these items.\n       The Department of Commerce continues to issue license \n     denials for NSG-controlled items as part of the ``no-\n     undercut'' provision. Under this provision, a denial \n     notification received from an NSG member country precludes \n     other member countries from approving similar transactions, \n     thereby assuring that the earlier denial is not ``undercut.'' \n     There are procedures for member countries to consult on \n     specific denials if they wish to disagree with the original \n     denial.\n       Missile Technology Control Regime. The Missile Technology \n     Control Regime (MTCR), founded in 1987 and currently \n     comprising 28 member countries, is an informal group whose \n     members coordinate their national export controls to help \n     prevent missile proliferation. Each member country, under its \n     own national laws, has agreed to abide by multilateral MTCR \n     Guidelines for controlling the transfer of items that \n     contribute to missile programs. These items are identified in \n     an MTCR Equipment and Technology Annex to the Guidelines.\n       The Department continues to implement the Enhanced \n     Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI), which is a ``catch-\n     all'' control on items that are not on the MTCR Annex, but \n     could be used directly in projects of missile proliferation \n     concern. As a result of U.S. leadership, similar controls \n     have now been adopted by over half of the MTCR members.\n       As a consequence of bilateral missile nonproliferation \n     agreements with Russia and South Africa, those two countries \n     have conformed their national export controls to MTCR \n     standards and were formally admitted to membership in the \n     MTCR in October 1995.\n       The United States also supported Brazil's candidacy for \n     membership in the MTCR, and Brazil was accepted unanimously \n     in October 1995.\n\n\n             b. bilateral cooperation/technical assistance\n\n       As part of the Administration's continuing effort to \n     encourage other countries to strengthen their export control \n     systems, the Department of Commerce and other agencies \n     conducted a wide range of discussions with a number of \n     foreign countries.\n       Russian Exchanges. In October 1995, BXA hosted a large \n     delegation of senior Russian industry executives and \n     government export control officials. They met in Boston and \n     in Washington, D.C., to discuss industry-government \n     cooperation on export controls. The purpose of this program \n     was to bring together U.S. and Russian business executives \n     and government officials to discuss such issues as the \n     administration of export controls, legal reform, licensing, \n     industry compliance, and enforcement.\n       In December 1995, BXA participated in an interagency \n     delegation to a briefing hosted by the Russian government on \n     the operation of Russia's export control system. Russian \n     ministries, organizations, and enterprises gave \n     presentations.\n       Central Asian/Caucasus Export Control Forum. In November \n     1995, BXA participated in an interagency delegation as co-\n     hosts with Turkey in an export control forum for seven \n     Central Asian and Caucasus states (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \n     Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \n     Uzbekristan). Presentations were given on legal, legislative, \n     and non proliferation issues, including licensing, \n     enforcement, and industry-government relations.\n       Nonproliferation and Export Control Cooperation. In late \n     1994, BXA created the Nonproliferation and Export Control \n     Cooperation (NEC) team to marshal BXA's resources and \n     expertise to support U.S. export control cooperation programs \n     in the former Soviet Union, other newly emerging states in \n     the Central Asian, Transcaucasian, and Baltic regions, and \n     certain central European states. From August to December \n     1995, the NEC team, with representatives from the Departments \n     of State, Defense, and Energy, and the U.S. Customs Service, \n     coordinated 14 cooperative exchanges with Belarus, \n     Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and \n     Poland. These cooperative exchanges focused on the legal \n     bases for export control systems, regulatory procedures, \n     licensing processes, preventive enforcement mechanisms, \n     industry-government relations, and systems automation.\n\n\n     c. regulatory actions: published and pending regulatory reform\n\n       For almost three decades, the EAR have been amended \n     frequently to respond to various national security, \n     nonproliferation, and foreign policy crises. Until recently, \n     the EAR had never been subjected to a systematic and \n     comprehensive review for the purpose of coordinating and \n     restructuring these many amendments to create a set of \n     regulations that is internally consistent and easier to \n     use. Last May, BXA published a proposed rule that included \n     a comprehensive revision and reorganization of the EAR \n     that will, in accordance with the goal set by the Trade \n     Promotion Coordinating Committee, ``make the regulations \n     more user-friendly.'' The BXA has involved the exporting \n     community in every step of the process, releasing early \n     drafts as ``discussion packages,'' conducting ``town \n     hall''--style-fora in 13 States, and redrafting to \n     incorporate the many industry comments and suggestions \n     received once the proposed rule was published. In November \n     1995, BXA circulated a draft interim rule for interagency \n     review. The BXA delivered the interim rule to the Federal \n     Register in February for publication in March.\n       General License Eligibility Extended to Semiconductor \n     Manufacturing Equipment. BXA published a final rule on \n     February 14 to expand general license eligibility to most \n     destinations to include certain semiconductor manufacturing \n     equipment: ion implanters, etching systems, chemical vapor \n     deposition equipment, certain ``cluster tools,'' masks, \n     reticles, and test systems.\n       High-Performance Computers. On January 25, BXA published a \n     rule that implements the President's October 6, 1995, \n     announcement of a major reform of computer export controls. \n     The rule liberalizes export controls on all computers, and \n     establishes four tiers of countries and a new policy for each \n     tier. This new rule will provide significant benefit to the \n     international competitiveness of the U.S. computer industry. \n     This rule was effective January 22.\n       Nuclear Controls. On February 1, BXA published an interim \n     rule to amend a number of Export Control Classification \n     Numbers (ECCNs) in order to make the U.S. Nuclear Referral \n     List conform more closely with the items contained in the \n     multi-lateral NSG Annex published by the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency and adhered to by the United States and other \n     subscribing governments in the NSG. In addition, this rule \n     removed Poland from general license General Nuclear Suppliers \n     Group (GNSG) restrictions, and added Argentina, New Zealand, \n     South Africa, and South Korea to the countries that are \n     eligible to receive exports under general license GNSG.\n       Expansion of Foreign Policy Controls for Sudan. In \n     December, BXA circulated for interagency review a draft rule \n     that will establish foreign policy controls on exports to \n     Sudan. New controls are being published with the \n     comprehensive revision and reorganization of the Export \n     Administration Act. These controls are consistent with the \n     Secretary of State's determination that the Government of \n     Sudan has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism.\n       Expansion of General Licenses GLX and GTDR. On December 20, \n     1995, BXA published a final rule that expands general license \n     for exports for civil end-users in countries of the former \n     Soviet Union, Romania, and the People's Republic of China \n     (GLX) eligibility to include: microprocessors with a \n     composite theoretical performance not exceeding 500 million \n     theoretical operations per second, memory integrated \n     circuits, certain digital integrated circuits, field \n     programmable gate arrays and logic arrays, portable \n     (personal) or mobile radiotelephones not capable of end-to-\n     end encryption, and software to protect against computer \n     viruses. In addition, revisions were made to expand \n     eligibility for general license for technical data (GTDR) \n     with written assurance to include certain virus protection \n     software.\n       Specially Designed Implements of Torture. On November 28, \n     1995, BXA published a final rule that expanded foreign policy \n     controls on specially designed implements of torture. \n     Previously, such implements were controlled as ``crime \n     control and detection'' commodities in the same category as \n     handcuffs, police helmets, and shields. As such, they did not \n     require a validated license for export to member countries of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia, \n     Japan, or New Zealand. This new rule created a control list \n     entry requiring a validated license for export of specially \n     designed implements of torture to all destinations, including \n     Canada. Applications for such exports will continue to be \n     subject to a general policy of denial.\n       Chemical Mixtures. On October 19, 1995, BXA published a \n     final rule that implements the agreement reached by the AG in \n     December 1994 on certain technical revisions in the AG's \n     harmonized controls on chemical weapons precursors. The rule \n     refines and clarifies the scope of controls on exports of \n     sample shipments and mixtures containing controlled precursor \n     and intermediate chemicals. The rule also revised the list of \n     countries eligible to receive AG benefits under U.S. \n     regulations by adding Poland, the Slovak Republic, and \n     Romania.\n\n\n               D. STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES/ECONOMIC SECURITY\n\n       In late 1994, the National Security Advisor directed that \n     an interagency study be prepared to assess the current and \n     future international market for software products containing \n     encryption (PRD/NSC-48). The directive was in response \n     to industry claims that U.S. export controls on certain \n     powerful encryption technologies were providing no benefit \n     to national security, and were hampering the software \n     industry's ability to compete in the global marketplace. \n     On January 11, the Department of Commerce announced the \n     public release of the study,\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n     jointly prepared by BXA and the National Security Agency. \n     The study provides an in-depth evaluation of the \n     international market, reviews the availability of foreign \n     encryption software, and assesses the impact that U.S. \n     export controls for encryption have had on the \n     competitiveness of the software industry. The study found \n     that the U.S. software industry still dominates world \n     markets, but the existence of strong export controls, both \n     in the United States and other major countries, is slowing \n     the growth of the international market.\n\n\n                         e. export enforcement\n\n       Over the last 6 months, the Department of Commerce \n     continued its vigorous enforcement of the EAR through \n     educational outreach, license application screening, spot \n     checks, investigations, and enforcement actions.

Mishkin each furnished or agreed to \n     furnish 144 items of information about Helena Rubinstein, \n     Inc.'s business relationships with or in Israel. The \n     Department further alleged that Cosmair, Inc., did not \n     prevent Mr. Mishkin from furnishing information about Helena \n     Rubinstein, Inc.'s business relationships with or in Israel. \n     The Department alleged that, in so doing. Cosmair, Inc., \n     violated the EAR by permitting the doing of an act prohibited \n     by the EAR.\n       The companies and Mishkin each agreed to pay the civil \n     penalties in separate but related settlements, which \n     combined, constitute one of the largest for the Office of \n     Antiboycott Compliance (OAC).

In \n     addition, the Department alleged that, in furtherance of the \n     conspiracy, and in connection with each of these exports, \n     Stephens made false or misleading representations of material \n     fact to a U.S. agency in connection with the preparation, \n     submission, or use of export control documents.\n       In a separate matter, Weisser's Sporting Goods plead guilty \n     on November 20, 1995, in the Southern District of California, \n     to one criminal count of violating U.S. export control laws \n     in connection with the export of shotguns to South Africa. \n     Sentencing for the criminal violation took place on January \n     16, 1996.

Sundstrand \n     Dijon is a repair and testing facility for Sundstrand \n     equipment located in Dijon, France.

The Department of \n     Commerce alleged that, on 41 separate occasions between June \n     1990 and June 1992, U.S. Robotics exported U.S.-origin, high-\n     speed computer modems from the United States to South Africa, \n     Liechtenstein, Czechoslovakia, New Zealand, and Singapore, \n     without obtaining from the Department the required validated \n     licenses. In connection with each of these exports, the \n     Department also alleged that the company falsely represented \n     on air waybills and Shipper's Export Declarations that the \n     modems qualified for export under general license when, in \n     fact, a validated license was required. To settle the \n     allegations, U.S. Robotics will pay $300,000 of the $400,000 \n     penalty the Department imposed. Payment of the remaining \n     $100,000 is suspended for 1 year and will be waived if, \n     during the 1-year period of suspension, U.S. Robotics does \n     not violate the Act, Regulations, or any conditions of the \n     Department's order.\n       Civil and Criminal Penalties Imposed on Oregon Company.

On \n     the same day, Patrick Lumber was sentenced to pay a criminal \n     fine of $225,000 by the United States District Court in \n     Portland, Oregon, following the company's guilty plea to a \n     two-count indictment charging it with violating the IEEPA. \n     The United States charged that, in 1993, Patrick Lumber \n     exported two shipments of yellow pine wood worth over \n     $800,000 from the United States to Libya in violation of the \n     IEEPA.\n       Under Secretary Affirms ALJ Decision and Order Imposing \n     $10,000 Civil Penalty on Florida Freight Forwarder for \n     Antiboycott Violations.

The ALJ found that, in 1988, a Stair Cargo \n     branch office in Inglewood, California, complied with a \n     boycott-related request from Kuwait to provide the name of a \n     supplier of goods and services for clearance by Kuwaiti \n     boycott authorities, thereby furnishing information about \n     that firm's business relationships with persons known or \n     believed to be blacklisted. The ALJ also found that Stair \n     Cargo failed to report to the Department its receipt of the \n     boycott-related request, as required by the Regulations.

Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, which I call the Lame Ducks Can't Fly Act, to prevent \nFederal officials who are about to leave office from traveling abroad \ncourtesy of U.S. taxpayers.\n  The bill would prohibit any Member of Congress who is leaving office \nfrom traveling to another country at taxpayer expense in the last 6 \nmonths of the Member's term. This prohibition could be waived by the \nSpeaker of the House or by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. If \na waiver is granted, a detailed statement must be printed in the \nCongressional Record indicating the purposes and costs of the travel.\n  Similarly, the bill would prohibit any political appointee in the \nexecutive branch from traveling overseas at taxpayer expense following \nan election in which the President is not returned to office. The \nprohibition for executive branch appointees could be waived if the \nPresident determines that such travel cannot reasonably be postponed \nuntil the new President takes office, and that the travel is essential \nto protect or promote vital national security interests.\n  Mr. President, after the general election in 1992, many Americans \nwere outraged when they saw Governmental officials traveling abroad on \nseemingly nonessential trips, even though they were about to lose their \njobs. One delegation, for example, traveled to China and Hong Kong \naboard a military jet that reportedly cost about $12,000 per hour to \nfly. Another trip was planned for Moscow before it was abruptly \ncanceled when the plans were reported in the press.\n  In recent months, press reports have highlighted the serious concerns \nof many Foreign Service officers about abuses of official travel \nprivileges by U.S. officials from all branches of government. The \nproblem has grown to such an extent that the American Foreign Service \nAssociation has issued a policy statement calling for 14 changes in \nGovernment official foreign travel policy. The Association's first \nrecommendation is to prohibit travel abroad by officials within 6 \nmonths of the end of their term.\n  Mr. President, it can be tempting for elected or appointed officials \nto have one last junket before losing their jobs. But it is wrong. And \nit is not fair to taxpayers--many of whom have a hard time making ends \nmeet. These costs may be small compared to the budget deficit. Yet \nthese kinds of abuses are outrageous, and they sap the trust of \nAmericans in their Government.\n  Mr. President, there are times when travel abroad by lame duck \nofficials is necessary to protect important national interests. \nHowever, there is no excuse for wasting taxpayer dollars on \nnonessential travel.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the legislation, and ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the purchase of foreign beef by a school \nparticipating in the school lunch, school breakfast, or child care food \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5763-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5764-S5773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMENDMENT TO THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH ACT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould require schools participating in the National School Lunch \nProgram to buy American beef. The bill would extend this requirement \nalso to the School Breakfast Program and the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram [CACFP]. This is a simple bill. Further, given the current \nsituation faced by American cattlemen, this bill should command \nbipartisan support.\n  Currently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] is bound by the \nBuy American Act, which requires USDA to purchase American beef for the \ncommodities distribution portion of these programs. However, no similar \nrequirement is placed on schools which purchase their own foodstuffs \nand then receive Federal reimbursement for the meals they serve \nstudents. Schools are encouraged to buy American, but are not bound to \ndo so. My bill would provide consistency throughout these child \nnutrition programs. Simply put, if schools expect to be reimbursed, we \nexpect schools to buy American beef.\n  Why should this bill be passed? Plain and simple, immediate action \nmust be taken to help our Nation's cattle industry. Cattle prices have \nplummeted to their lowest level in years. High grain prices and drought \nalso have contributed to the economic crisis facing our ranchers. The \nresult is that South Dakota's cattlemen are facing some very tough \ntimes. Some South Dakota producers soon may be forced to leave the \ncattle business altogether unless markets begin to improve. Their \nplight is spilling over to affect other businesses in the small towns \nand cities where they live. We should look at all possible ways to \nstimulate the American beef market. A requirement that schools purchase \nAmerican beef will increase demand.\n  This is just one advance in our battle to improve conditions for \nAmerican cattlemen. As I have advocated, Congress and the \nadministration should work actively on multiple fronts. I plan to \nintroduce legislation that would require all beef sold to consumers be \nlabeled, indicating in what country the beef was produced. This \nrequirement would make it easier for schools and other consumers to buy \nAmerican beef.\n  I recently requested that the USDA prohibit formula or basis pricing \non forward contracted cattle, require that forward contracts be offered \nin an open, public manner and require that packer-fed cattle be sold in \nan open, public market. I hope they will take action on this front \nsoon. These are all actions the Clinton administration can take without \ncongressional action.\n  I also urged President Clinton to begin an investigation into cattle \nimports from Mexico. Many South Dakota producers have serious concerns \nthat recent import surges may be due to Mexico transshipping cattle \nfrom other countries into the United States, which is a blatant \nviolation of trade agreements. Again, the President need not wait for \ncongressional action.\n  Finally, and most important, the Clinton administration should begin \nan anti-trust action on the meatpacking industry. This is very \nimportant for our cattlemen. I have called on the administration time \nand again to enforce fully our anti-trust laws. I am still waiting for \naction.\n  Mr. President, with a combined effort by Congress and the President, \nI am confident we can once again make our cattle industry healthy and \ncompetitive. I am proud to be an active voice for South Dakota's \nlivestock producers. This issue requires immediate attention and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in addressing this serious problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMERICAN BEEF IN CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS.\n\n       The National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 28.

A bill to amend the NATO Participation Act of 1994 to \nexpedite the transition to full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             The NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new bill for \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  In 1994, when the administration seemed reluctant to allow countries \nin Central Europe to join NATO, we drafted a bill titled the ``NATO \nParticipation Act of 1994.'' That measure set forth in U.S. statute a \npolicy, for the first time, that would ensure NATO expansion to include \nthose countries in Central Europe that want to be free and want to join \nin a mutual pact for self-defense. The bill marked a significant change \nof course for the United States.\n  The administration's reluctance to move forward with NATO expansion\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nbrought back memories of the tragic events of World War II, of both the \nSoviet invasion of Poland and the German invasion of Poland and other \ncountries in Central Europe. Indeed, that reluctance brought back the \ntragic memories of the post-World-War-II era, when at key times this \ncountry turned its back on people who had fought to be free and then \nfound themselves enslaved by the Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, that NATO Participation Act had to be offered four \ntimes on the floor of the Senate before we finally got it adopted \nformally by Congress and signed into law by the President. It was \nopposed vehemently by the administration at every opportunity. But, in \nthe end--and I might add, after much hard work of many fellow Americans \nwho had insisted upon its passage--it passed both houses of Congress \nand was then embraced by the administration.\n  Unfortunately, even though that measure had passed giving the \nPresident necessary authorities to establish a transition program for \ncountries moving toward NATO membership, the administration failed to \nmove ahead with a clear plan for expansion of NATO to those Central \nEuropean countries that had not only exhibited an interest in it, but \nhad specifically asked to become members.\n  In response to that failure and to again move policy along, we \ndrafted and introduced the NATO Participation Act II, officially titled \nthe ``NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995.'' That measure went \nfurther than NATO Participation Act I. The NATO Participation Act I \nauthorized the President to establish a transition program and plan for \nNATO expansion. NATO Participation Act II called on the President to \nevaluate those countries moving toward NATO membership and to name \nspecific countries that would be determined eligible for NATO \ntransition assistance, and it expanded our powers to work with them and \nto develop a mutual arms policy.\n  That act, initially opposed by the administration, eventually was \nembraced by the administration as it moved toward passage. That \nexpanded our ability to provide transition assistance to allow Central \nEuropean countries to protect themselves and their independence. Alas, \nthe administration with its discretionary power to name countries that \nthey consider eligible to move forward toward NATO membership, has \nrefused to act.\n  Months ago, I specifically contacted the administration and asked \nwhat steps they were taking, as they had promised they would, to move \ntoward this goal. According to the foreign relations committees, the \nadministration can find no country in Central Europe it views as ready \nfor transition assistance.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, because of the administration's refusal to act, \nwhat has been done is to raise the question as to whether or not NATO \nwill ever be expanded. To simply give it lip service and say--as the \nadministration has done--that it is not a question of whether we expand \nNATO, it is a question of how and when, dodges the issue. The real \nissue is whether or not we will recognize other countries having a \nsphere of influence and control over Central Europe. The central issue \nis whether or not free men and women around the world will stand by \nidly if the security and independence of Central Europe is threatened.\n  These are not hollow questions. These tragic questions were answered \nin World War II. Many historians believe that the failure of the free \ndemocracies to come forward and stand up for Central Europe was one of \nthe reasons that Hitler rose to such heights and gained so much \nstrength before the free world was mobilized to stop him. It is not an \nidle question when, at the end of World War II, the Soviet Union spread \nits influence and its armies over Central Europe, and free men and \nwomen failed to stand up for their freedom then.\n\n  Mr. President, it speaks to the core issue, and the core issue is \nwhether or not we will turn our backs on the free men and women of \nCentral Europe once more. This bill, the third NATO Participation Act, \nthe expansion facilitation act of NATO offered in 1996, speaks to that. \nIt specifically names three countries--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic--as qualifying for the program; requires the President to name \nother countries meeting a series of additional criteria; and permits \nthe President to name any other countries to the transition assistance \nprogram that meet the existing criteria of the NATO Participation Act.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly proud to join with Senator Dole in \nintroducing this bill. Bob Dole deserves a great deal of credit for his \nmany efforts to expand NATO rapidly and to bring the nations of Central \nEurope into NATO. From the very first time that Senator Paul Simon and \nI introduced the NATO Participation Act as an amendment to the Foreign \nOperations Bill in July, 1994, Bob Dole has been a cosponsor. He has \njoined every effort to hasten NATO expansion, spoken out clearly and \nfrequently against the foot-dragging of this administration and has \nbeen more than just a cosponsor of every NATO Participation Act that \nhas been written. His frequent inputs and the keen insights of Mira \nBaratta and Randy Scheunemann of his staff have been invaluable to our \nefforts to put the United States back in the lead in expanding NATO.\n  In January, 1994, when the issue of expanding NATO to include the \nCentral European powers first became an issue at the NATO summit, Bob \nDole stated, ``If NATO governments embrace this new role of ensuring \nstability and security in Europe, the logic of expanding NATO becomes \nincreasingly clear . . . The Partnership for Peace should not be used \nas a means to dismiss the legitimate security concerns of the new \ndemocracies in Central Europe.''\n  In 1995 he stated that, ``Russia continues to threaten prospective \nNATO members over alliance expansion, thereby confirming the need to \nenlarge NATO sooner rather than later.''\n  Just recently, he reiterated his commitment to NATO expansion by \nstating ``the time has come to welcome Europe's new democracies into \nNATO. Only NATO expansion can guarantee another five decades of peace \non the continent.''\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree with our distinguished majority \nleader. It is time to take the countries of Central Europe off the \ntable once and for all. America's dawdling will continue to create \nuncertainty and generate instability in the heart of Europe. The United \nStates needs to take its rightful place as the world's leader and move \nquickly to expand the North Atlantic Alliance to the nations of Central \nEurope.\n  Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent \nit be printed in the Record and that Senator Santorum be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill will be received and appropriately referred.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, \n     purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any \n     nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as \n     full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe does not threaten any nation. America's \n     security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the \n     security of the countries of Europe.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic \n     transformation of Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can \n     and should play a critical role in addressing the security \n     challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the \n     stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political \n     and economic transformation.\n       (4) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (5) Congress has sought to facilitate the further \n     enlargement of NATO at an early date by enacting the NATO \n     Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22 \n     U.S.C. 1928 note) and the NATO Participation Act Amendments \n     of 1995 (section 585 of Public Law 104-107).\n       (6) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of \n     Alliance membership, the\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\n     costs of maintaining stability in Europe will be shared more \n     widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require \n     current members of NATO, and the United States in particular, \n     to demonstrate the political will needed to build on \n     successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and \n     the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources \n     necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are \n     themselves undertaking.\n       (7) New members will be full members of the Alliance, \n     enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under \n     the Washington Treaty.\n       (8) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving \n     emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have \n     expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic \n     Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint \n     Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping \n     Force, can make an important contribution to European peace \n     and security and international peacekeeping efforts, assist \n     those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of \n     possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive \n     appropriate support from the United States.\n       (9) The United States continues to regard the political \n     independence and territorial integrity of all emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to \n     European peace and security.\n       (10) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-\n     Atlantic region.\n       (11) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a \n     positive role in defusing tensions between members of the \n     Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred \n     between two Alliance member states since the inception of \n     NATO in 1949.\n       (12) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe that meet specific criteria for \n     NATO membership would contribute to international peace and \n     enhance the security of the region.\n       (13) A number of Eastern European countries have expressed \n     interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to \n     demonstrate this commitment; including their participation in \n     Partnership for Peace activities.\n       (14) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (15) The eventual membership of Austria, Finland, and \n     Sweden is fully expected and is not precluded by this Act.\n       (16) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance \n     should include those emerging democracies most ready for \n     closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other \n     countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move \n     forward toward eventual NATO membership.\n       (17) The Congress of the United States finds that Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made the most progress \n     toward achieving the stated criteria and should be eligible \n     for the additional assistance described in this bill.\n       (18) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be \n     based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria \n     for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's \n     security and the approval of all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central \n     and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries \n     may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative \n     political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO \n     and the Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote \n     economic stability and security in Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, \n     Moldova, and Ukraine--\n       (1) the United States should support the full and active \n     participation of these countries in activities appropriate \n     for qualifying for NATO membership;\n       (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic \n     means available to press the European Union to admit as soon \n     as possible any country which qualifies for membership; \n     and\n       (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization should support military exercises and \n     peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, \n     nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and \n     Russia.\n\n     SEC. 5.

TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 203(f) of the NATO Participation \n     Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 \n     note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(f) Termination of Eligibility.--(1) The eligibility of a \n     country designated under subsection (d) for the program \n     established in subsection (a) shall terminate 60 days after \n     the President makes a certification under paragraph (2) \n     unless, within the 60-day period, the Congress enacts a joint \n     resolution disapproving the termination of eligibility.\n       ``(2) Whenever the President determines that the government \n     of a country designated under subsection (d)--\n       ``(A) no longer meets the criteria set forth in subsection \n     (d)(2)(A);\n       ``(B) is hostile to the NATO Alliance; or\n       ``(C) poses a national security threat to the United \n     States.\n\n     then the President shall so certify to the appropriate \n     congressional committees.\n       ``(3) Nothing in this Act affects the eligibility of \n     countries to participate under other provisions of law in \n     programs described in this Act.''.\n       (b) Congressional Priority Procedures.--Section 203 of such \n     Act is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(g) Congressional Priority Procedures.--\n       ``(1) Applicable procedures.--A joint resolution described \n     in paragraph (2) which is\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\n     introduced in a House of Congress shall be considered in \n     accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (3) \n     through (7) of section 8066(c) of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 1985 (as contained in Public Law 98-473; \n     98 Stat. 1936), except that--\n       ``(A) references to the `resolution described in paragraph \n     (1)' shall be deemed to be references to the joint \n     resolution; and\n       ``(B) references to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the Senate shall be deemed to be references to the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate, respectively.\n       ``(2) Text of joint resolution.--A joint resolution under \n     this paragraph is a joint resolution the matter after the \n     resolving clause of which is as follows: `That the Congress \n     disapproves the certification submitted by the President on \n     ________ pursuant to section 203(f) of the NATO Participation \n     Act of 1994.'.''.\n\n     SEC. 10. AMENDMENTS TO THE NATO PARTICIPATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Conforming Amendment.--The NATO Participation Act of \n     1994 (title II of Public Law 193-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note) is \n     amended in sections 203(a), 203(d)(1), and 203(d)(2) by \n     striking ``countries emerging from communist domination'' \n     each place it appears and inserting ``emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe''.\n       (b) Definitions.--The NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title \n     II of Public Law 103-446; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 206. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       ``The term `emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n     Europe' includes, but is not limited to, Albania, Bulgaria, \n     the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.''.\n\n     SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Emerging democracies in central and eastern europe.--\n     The term ``emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n     Europe'' includes, but is not limited to, Albania, Bulgaria, \n     the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.\n       (2) NATO.--The term ``NATO'' means the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for his \ncontinued leadership on this and other issues. He and I just left a \npress availability conducted by the majority leader, Senator Dole, \nalong with the former President of Poland, Lech Walesa. I must say that \nformer President Walesa was both compelling and enlightening in his \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I support the bill introduced by the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Each year, the Senate debates the issue of NATO expansion and each \nyear the President reassures the American people and our new friends in \nEastern Europe that he has every intention of extending the NATO \numbrella. Once again, this year, on the eve of another historic Russian \nelection, we find ourselves debating the issue of NATO expansion, and \nstill, although the President will proclaim his support for expansion, \nNATO membership remains reserved to the states which comprised it \nbefore the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  A few circumstances have changed. President Yeltsin, whose fate our \nown President has made the centerpiece of United States policies toward \nthe former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is much less secure. With \nthe Russian elections only weeks away, Eastern Europe may again be \nfaced with a communist Russia--a Russia which proudly extols the \nvirtues of a failed philosophy. But even if President Yeltsin \nultimately prevails in the elections, he, himself, has given the West \nsufficient cause for concern. He has not always succeeded in ensuring \nRussian compliance with treaty obligations. And yielding to industry \npressures, he has apparently ignored American warnings in crucial areas \nof nonproliferation. Perhaps most alarming, until the most recent \nceasefire agreement, the brutal war in Chechnya persisted unabated \ndespite President Yeltsin's orders that it stop.\n  President Yeltsin has also made disturbing changes in the composition \nof his cabinet. He has displaced all the major economic reformers \nassociated with his government, and has replaced his widely respected \nforeign minister, Andrea Kozyrev, with Yevgeny Primakov, a figure with \nstrong ties to the not so distant Soviet past.\n  It is far too early to declare Russian economic and political reforms \nfailures. I have always supported assistance to the Newly Independent \nStates of the Soviet Union and I will continue to support Russian \nreform efforts. The situation we face in Russia today bears almost no \ncomparison to the situation the United States and its allies in Europe \nfaced in 1947. Just the same, however, in evaluating President Yeltsin \nlet us not forget that his is no longer the government of Gaidar, \nYavlinsky, Fedorov, and Kozyrev.\n  This is not to say that the United States has an interest in seeing \nPresident Yeltsin defeated in the upcoming election. On the contrary, \nif, despite what I hope is election year maneuvering, he remains \ncommitted to economic and political reform and the peaceful resolution \nof disputes with his neighbors, and if he demonstrates his commitment \nto international treaties, his reelection is very much in our interest.\n  The sponsors of this bill do not seek NATO expansion in response to \nthe policies and political agendas of any Russian leader. We seek NATO \nexpansion as a part of a larger European strategic order that will \nprovide the nations of Central and Eastern Europe with the sort of \npolitical and economic security that Western Europe enjoyed following \nWorld War II. We seek a European security structure which can endure \nchanges in national leadership and governing philosophies.\n  The United States and its NATO allies must depend for their security \non a stable balance of power, not character assessments of various \nnational leaders.\n  Expanding NATO and, as the bill calls for, defining a security \nrelationship between an enlarged NATO and Russia will also stabilize \nRussia's security situation. Like any peaceful democratic nation, it \nthrives on security and predictability. The perpetuation of the current \nsecurity vacuum in the middle of Europe is no more in its interest than \nin ours.\n  As in the past, the administration will respond to new calls for NATO \nenlargement by preaching caution. It will cite the upcoming elections \nas a particularly sensitive moment. After the elections, it will cite \nthe fragile nature of the Russian electorate and upcoming government. \nThen, no doubt, it will cite another critical NATO meeting where \nconsensus is to be sought on expansion.\n  In the meantime, we will have lost the window of opportunity that was \ncreated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's preoccupation \nwith its domestic concerns. Three and a half years have already been \nsquandered.\n  It is time now to begin NATO expansion. No more temporizing. No more \nexcuses. This is why I have joined with my colleagues, Senators Dole, \nBrown, Helms, and others in introducing the NATO Enlargement \nFacilitation Act of 1996.\n  The bill before us identifies Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \nas those countries first in line for NATO membership and proposes to \ngive them the assistance they need to rapidly become members. To date \nand to no avail, Congress has left it up to the President to determine \nwhether these countries were eligible for such assistance. Now we are \ntelling the President that vacation time is over. These three countries \nmeet the criteria. We should start preparing them to enter NATO. Under \nthis legislation, each country will be eligible to receive, as a part \nof the targeted program to assist its transition to full NATO \nmembership, transfers to excess defense articles, foreign military \nfinancing [FMF], economic assistance, IMET, and other assistance.\n  As for other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which \ndesire NATO membership, but do not yet meet its standards, the bill \nrequires the President to provide them the same assistance at such time \nas they meet a number of clear criteria, including progress toward the \nestablishment of democracy, free markets, and civilian control of the \nmilitary. There are a number of other requirements for aspiring new \nmembers, but they are reasonable, and they are explicit.\n\n  Equally important as mandating assistance to NATO aspirants, the bill \nauthorizes the necessary spending. Critics will no longer be able to \ncharge that proponents of a more comprehensive and strategically \nrelevant NATO are unwilling to pay the costs associated with expansion. \nThis bill authorizes a total of $60 million in fiscal year 1997 for the \nexplicit purpose of expanding NATO.\n  If there is any doubt of the necessity for Congress to take the \ninitiative\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\ntoday, consider the following statement made by President Clinton in \nPrague almost 3 years ago:\n\n       Let me be absolutely clear: the security of your states is \n     important to the security of the United States . . . the \n     question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members \n     but when and how.\n\n  How else can one explain the vast difference between the President's \nrhetoric and the lack of actual movement than that he lacks a clear \nidea of how to move from rhetoric to action? Not only has NATO not \nadmitted new members, the President has still not identified to former \nWarsaw Pact countries the when and how of expansion. The other \nexplanation is that the President has never intended to expand NATO and \nall his protests to the contrary are simply efforts to outmaneuver the \ncritics of his foreign policy. Granted the President has a record of \nthis sort of cleverness. But I trust that the President would not take \nthe security of Europe so lightly as to play politics with its future.\n  A more charitable explanation for the disconnect between the \nPresident's rhetoric and action is that the rationale for NATO \nexpansion is genuinely lost on him. He may truly believe in a European \nsecurity structure which, like the Partnership for Peace, stretches \nfrom the Atlantic to the borders of China. Perhaps he truly believes \nthat a security structure can be created which is so far flung as to \nhave no apparent strategic coherence.\n  Instead of going about the difficult diplomacy of creating a viable \nEuropean security structure, the administration has preoccupied itself \nwith the fears of drawing new lines. Perhaps the President and his \nchief adviser on Russia, Strobe Talbott, are real visionaries. They see \na world where there are no lines separating countries, alliances, or \neven countinents--a world where concepts such like security, strategic \nalliance, and geopolitics have no relevance.\n  In fairness to the President, I freely admit that the logic of this \nreasoning eludes me. I do not want to underestimate the lasting impact \nof the Russian democratic revolution. It was certainly monumental and \nit lifted the spirits of a world weary of superpower confrontation. But \nthe Russian revolution, as great as it was, did not presage a radical \nchange in the nature of man or the way in which the world guarantees \npeace.\n  I, for one, will forgo putting all my faith in visionary ideas of a \nnew Europe free of historical tensions. Twice in this century, Europe \nhas been convulsed by nationalism and militarism--this despite the \nefforts of far greater visionaries than President Clinton.\n  The sponsors of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act take their \nguidance from history. The cause of all recent European conflicts has \nbeen a security vacuum in the center of Europe. Today, although the \nborders of Western Europe are secured, it remains the advantage of a \nNATO security guarantee. On the other hand, Eastern Europe, which is in \na more precarious situation, remains without such guarantees. By all \naccounts, this amounts to a security vacuum, and unless we act to fill \nit, I fear history will repeat itself.\n  Lech Walesa, who knows better than most the history of Russia's \ninvolvement in Eastern Europe, has warned that a failure to expand NATO \nmay result in a major tragedy. A combination of economic and strategic \ninsecurity has already driven this hero of the cold war from power. All \nthe more reason to remember his words, ``We kept crying and shouting in \n1939, but they only believed us when the war reached Paris and London. \nThe situation is similar today.'' In that the political atmosphere in \nEurope is once again clouded with what President Vaclav Havel, has \ndescribed as ``a mentality marked by caution, hesitation, delayed \ndecision-making, and a tendency to look for the most convenient \nsolutions,'' the times do seem eerily similar.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Ford):\n  S. 1831. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999 for the National \nTransportation Safety Board, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n      The National Transportation Safety Board Amendments of 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nTransportation Safety Board Amendments of 1996. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senator Hollings, ranking member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Senator Lott, chairman of the Senate Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee, and Senator Ford, ranking member of the \nSenate Aviation Subcommittee. This is a bipartisan reauthorization bill \nand I urge its swift passage.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], an independent \nagency, is charged with determining the probable cause of \ntransportation accidents and promoting transportation safety. \nSpecifically, the NTSB investigates all forms of transportation \naccidents, conducts safety studies, and evaluates the effectiveness of \nother Government agencies' programs for preventing transportation \naccidents. It also reviews appeals of adverse certificate and civil \npenalty actions by the administrators of agencies of the Department of \nTransportation involving airman and seaman licenses. Sadly, its work is \nnever done.\n  Mr. President, the tireless work of the NTSB is too often overlooked. \nSince its inception in 1967, the NTSB has investigated more than \n100,000 aviation accidents and thousands of accidents in the other \nsurface modes--rail, highway, marine, and pipeline. NTSB investigators \nare on call 24 hours a day and work around the world investigating \nsignificant transportation accidents in order to obtain facts to enable \ndevelopment of solutions designed to prevent future accidents.\n  Indeed, the NTSB is considered the world's premier accident \ninvestigation agency. It has achieved that distinction through its \nthorough investigations and professional approach to meeting its \nstatutory responsibilities. In total, the NTSB has issued almost 10,000 \nsafety recommendations to improve the safety of the traveling public.\n  Sadly, during the past few months, the NTSB has been extremely busy. \nWe are all aware the NTSB is investigating the devastating crash of \nValuJet near Miami, FL. At the same time, major on-going investigations \ncontinue for the USAir accident near Pittsburgh, PA, the school bus/\ntrain collision in Fox River Grove, IL, and the MARC commuter train/\nAmtrak collision near Silver Spring, MD, to name just a few.\n  I want to point out the NTSB has no authority to regulate the \ntransportation industry. Therefore, its effectiveness depends on its \nreputation for timely and accurate determinations of accident causation \nand for issuing realistic and feasible safety recommendations.\n  The NTSB's reputation for impartiality and thoroughness has enabled \nit to achieve such success in shaping transportation safety \nimprovements that more than 80 percent of its recommendations have been \nimplemented. Examples of implemented recommendations include fire \nresistant materials and floor-level escape lighting in aircraft cabins, \nchild safety seats in automobiles, improved school bus construction \nstandards, Amtrak passenger car safety improvements, new recreational \nboating safety and commercial fishing vessel regulations, the \ndevelopment of one-call notification systems in all 50 States and \nimproved regulations for buried pipelines.\n\n  The NTSB's authorization expires at the end of fiscal year 1996. The \nbill we are introducing today provides a 3 year authorization for \nfiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999 at a level of 370 FTE's. Our \nobjective is to establish sufficient funding levels to enable the NTSB \nto carry out its immense workload. We can meet this goal while at the \nsame time, reducing the currently authorized levels. That is what this \nbill achieves.\n  The bill also includes a few statutory changes. First, the bill \nprovides for temporary deferral of Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] \nrequests regarding the release of foreign aviation accident or incident \ninformation for 2 years or until the foreign government leading the \ninvestigation approves release of information. This would apply to NTSB \nparticipation in foreign accident investigations only. This provision \nwould facilitate the NTSB's ability to effectively investigate and \nparticipate in foreign accidents without risk of the untimely release \nof information prior to a foreign governments'\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\napproval. However, the NTSB would not be restricted from utilizing \nforeign accident investigation information in making safety \nrecommendations.\n  Second, the bill would exempt from FOIA aviation data voluntarily \nsupplied to the NTSB. The aviation industry currently collects various \nkinds of information, but industry does not share it with the NTSB \nbecause of concerns that material would be released to the public. Some \ndata, if voluntarily supplied to the Government, is exempted from FOIA \nrequests. This exemption, however, is at the discretion of the agency. \nThe NTSB has requested the exemption be made permanent through statute \ninstead of discretionary, and believes a permanent exemption will \nencourage the aviation industry to freely share significant safety-\nrelated data.\n\n  Third, when the NTSB conducts training of its employees and others in \nsubjects necessary for the proper performance of accident \ninvestigations, the bill would allow the NTSB to charge non-NTSB \npersonnel attending for the costs associated with the course. These \nreimbursements would be credited to the NTSB as offsetting collections.\n  Mr. President, the NTSB carries out an enormous public service. While \nit is a small agency, its work product is critical. Seldom, if ever, is \nthis agency the target of criticism. That cannot be said about many \nFederal governmental agencies. Therefore, I want to commend the NTSB \nBoard members and its employees for their dedication to carrying out \nsuch an important public service.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure the NTSB \ncan continue its essential work in an efficient manner.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1832. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies, subject to a reduction of 50 \npercent if the recipient dies during the first 15 days of such month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is very important to me, very important to the constituents of \nMaryland and very important to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I wish to declare that I am introducing a bipartisan bill, with \nSenator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair policy of the Social Security \nSystem.\n  Senator Snowe and I want to introduce this bill because it deals with \nSocial Security, retirement security, and income security. We want the \nmiddle class in the United States of America to know that we are going \nto give help to those who practice self-help.\n  What is it I am talking about? We have found that Social Security \ndoes not pay for the last month of life. If someone dies May 18 or May \n28, when the Social Security check arrived on June 3, the surviving \nspouse or family members had to send back the Social Security check. I \nthink that is an outrage.\n  That individual worked for Social Security, earned Social Security, \nput money in the Social Security trust fund. We feel that it is up to \nthe Social Security system to allow the surviving spouse or the estate \nof the family to have that Social Security check for the last month of \nyour life.\n  This legislation has an urgency. People have called my office in \ntears. Very often it is a son or a daughter. They are at the desk \nclearing off the paperwork for their mom, and there is the Social \nSecurity check. And they say, ``Senator, the check says for the month \nof May. Mom died on May 28. Why do we have to send the Social Security \ncheck back? We have bills to pay. We have utility coverage that we need \nto wrap up, our rent, a mortgage, health bills. Why is Social Security \ntelling me, `Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?''\n  My gosh, with all the problems in the United States of America, we \nought to be going after drug dealers and tax dodgers, not those people \nwho have paid into Social Security and their surviving spouse or their \nfamily who has been left with the bills for the last month of their \nlife. I say they are absolutely right--absolutely right--because we \nbelieve that Social Security should be there for you, for the family, \nand for the surviving spouse.\n\n  I listened to my constituents. And what they say is this: ``Senator \nMikulski, we don't want anything free. But our family does want what \nour dad worked for. We do want what we feel we deserve and what has \nbeen paid for in the trust fund in our loved one's name. Please make \nsure that our family gets the Social Security check for the last month \nof our life.''\n  That is what we are going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I are \nintroducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. While we talk \nabout retirement security, the most important item in that is income \nsecurity. And the safety net for every American is Social Security.\n  We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security is \nsolvent. And we want to work to do that. We also know that we have an \nobligation to those who continue to get Social Security that they get \ntheir COLA so when the cost of living goes up, that Social Security is \nadjusted. But this reform of providing a Social Security check for the \nlast month of life is absolutely crucial.\n  How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward \nway of dealing with this. Our legislation says this: that if you die \nbefore the 15th of a month, you will get a check for those 15 days. If \nyou die after the 15th of the month, and between then and the 31st, \nyour surviving spouse or the family estate would get that last Social \nSecurity check.\n  We think it is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are old-\nfashioned in our belief in many values. We believe you honor your \nfather and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious \nprinciple, but it is good public policy.\n  The way to do that is to have a strong Social Security System and to \nmake sure that Social Security System is fair in every way. That is why \nwe support making sure that the surviving spouse or family has the \nSocial Security check for the last month of life. Mr. President, we \nhope to have the support of our colleagues. That is the essence of my \nstatement.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself and Mr. Pryor) (by request):\n  S. 1833. A bill to provide temporary authority for the use of \nvoluntary separation incentives by Federal agencies that are reducing \nemployment levels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n        the federal employment reduction assistance act of 1996\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, at the request of the \nadministration, I rise to introduce The Federal Employment Reduction \nAssistance Act of 1996. This legislative proposal is modeled after the \nFederal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which provided Federal \ncivilian agencies with authority to offer voluntary separation \nincentives for a 1-year period that ended March 31, 1995. I was the \nchief sponsor of the 1994 legislation. Approximately 115,100 Federal \nemployees voluntarily resigned or retired during the first buyout \nprogram. In addition, 40,000 more agreed to leave under a delayed \ndeparture program and will leave this year or next.\n  The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1996 contains the \nfollowing proposals:\n  The authority for separation incentives begins with enactment of the \nact and continues until September 30, 2000.\n  The amount of the buyout incentive would be the lesser of the amount \nthat the employee's severance pay would be or whichever of the \nfollowing amounts is applicable based on separation in accordance with \nthe agency plan:\n  $25,000 in fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n  $20,000 in fiscal year 1998.\n  $15,000 in fiscal year 1999.\n  $10,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n  Any employee who receives an incentive and then accepts any paid \nemployment with the Government within 5 years after separating would \nhave to repay the entire amount of the incentive payment to the agency \nthat paid the incentive. This provision could be waived only under \nstringent circumstances of agency need.\n  Agencies are required to pay an amount into the civil service \nretirement trust fund equal to 15 percent of the final basic pay of \neach employee who is accepting a buyout.\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\n  Agencies are required to reduce their full-time equivalent [FTE] \nemployment by one for each buyout.\n  OMB approval would be required for all agency buyout plans. The \nlegislation would only apply to civilian agencies. DOD would continue \nto operate its own buyout program.\n  In addition, the proposed legislation includes some softening \nprovisions for agencies that must institute reductions-in-force \n[RIF's]:\n  The bill would authorize agencies to allow employees to volunteer for \na separation during a RIF if this would prevent the involuntary \nseparation of another employee in a similar situation. Employees who \nvolunteered would receive severance pay. The DOD authorization bill \nalso contains this proposal.\n  Employees involuntarily separated under RIF's could continue their \nhealth insurance coverage for up to 18 months while continuing to pay \nonly the premium that would apply to current employees.\n  Mr. President, previous buyout legislation was preeminently \nsuccessful in helping to reduce the number of Federal employees but \naccomplished the downsizing in a fair and equitable manner.\n  Overall, including the buyout program, there are now some 208,000 \nfewer civil service employees than there were when this administration \ncame into office. That's a real success story. In fact, Federal \nemployment is now at its lowest point since John F. Kennedy.\n  This buyout legislation will help to continue that trend. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The first section provides a title for the bill, the \n     ``Federal Employment Reduction Assistance Act of 1996.''\n       Section 2 provides definitions of ``agency'' and \n     ``employee.'' Among the provisions, an employee who has \n     received any previous voluntary separation incentive from the \n     Federal Government and has not repaid the incentive is \n     excluded from any incentives under this Act.\n       Section 3 provides that, when an agency head determines \n     that employment in the agency must be reduced in order to \n     improve operating efficiency or meet anticipated budget \n     levels, the agency head may submit a plan to the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget for payment of voluntary \n     separation incentives to agency employees. The plan must \n     specify the manner in which the planned employment reductions \n     will improve efficiency or meet budget levels. The plan must \n     also include a proposed time period for payment of separation \n     incentives, and a proposed coverage for offers of incentives \n     to agency employees, which may be on the basis of any \n     component of the agency, any occupation or levels of an \n     occupation, any geographic location, or any appropriate \n     combination of these factors. The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall review and approve or disapprove \n     each plan submitted, and may modify the plan with respect to \n     the time period for incentives or the coverage of incentive \n     offers.\n       Section 4 provides that in order to receive a voluntary \n     separation incentive, an employee covered by an offer of \n     incentives must separate from service with the agency \n     (whether by retirement or resignation) within the time period \n     specified in the agency's plan as approved. An employee's \n     voluntary separation incentive is an amount equal to the \n     lesser of the amount that the employee's severance pay would \n     be if the employee were entitled to severance pay under \n     section 5595 of title 5, United States Code (without \n     adjustment for any previous severance pay), or whichever of \n     the following amounts is applicable based on the date of \n     separation: $25,000 during fiscal years 1996 and 1997; \n     $20,000 during fiscal year 1998; $15,000 during fiscal year \n     1999; or $10,000 during fiscal year 2000.\n       Section 5 provides that any employee who receives a \n     voluntary separation incentive under this Act and then \n     accepts any employment with the Government within 5 years \n     after separating must, prior to the first day of such \n     employment, repay the entire amount of the incentive to the \n     agency that paid the incentive. If the subsequent \n     employment is with the Executive branch, including the \n     United States Postal Service, the Director of the Office \n     of Personnel Management may waive the repayment at the \n     request of the agency head if the individual possesses \n     unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant \n     available for the position. For subsequent employment in \n     the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the \n     appointing official may waive repayment on the same basis. \n     If the subsequent employment is in the judicial branch, \n     the Director of the Administrative Office of the United \n     States Courts may waive repayment on the same criteria. \n     For the purpose of the repayment and waiver provisions, \n     employment includes employment under a personal services \n     contract, as defined by the Director of the Office of \n     Personnel Management.\n       Section 6 requires additional agency contributions to the \n     Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund in amounts equal \n     to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee of the \n     agency who is covered by the Civil Service Retirement System \n     or the Federal Employees Retirement System to whom a \n     voluntary separation incentive is paid under this Act.\n       Section 7 provides that full-time equivalent employment in \n     each agency will be reduced by one for each separation of an \n     employee who receives a voluntary separation incentive under \n     this Act, and directs the Office of Management and Budget to \n     take any action necessary to ensure compliance. Reductions \n     will be calculated by using the agency's actual full-time \n     equivalent employment levels. For example, if an agency's \n     actual FTE usage in FY 1996 is 1,050 FTEs, and 50 FTEs \n     separate during FY 1997 using voluntary separation incentive \n     payments provided under this Act, then the agency staffing \n     levels at the end of FY 1997 shall not exceed 1,000 FTEs.\n       Section 8 requires the Office of Personnel Management to \n     report by March 31st of each year to the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government \n     Reform and Oversight concerning agencies' use of voluntary \n     separation incentives in the previous fiscal year. The report \n     must show, for each agency which had approval to pay \n     incentives, the number of employees who received incentives, \n     the average amount of the incentives, and the average grade \n     or pay level of the employees who received incentives. The \n     report must also include the number of waivers made under the \n     provisions of section 5 in the repayment of incentives upon \n     subsequent employment with the Government, the reasons for \n     each waiver, and the title and grade or pay level of each \n     employee to whom the waiver applied. Section 8 also amends \n     the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law \n     103-226), which now requires that reports on voluntary \n     separation incentives under that Act provide data for each \n     employee who received an incentive, to instead require \n     reports on a summary basis for each agency which paid \n     incentives, as provided for the new authority.\n       Section 9 authorizes agency heads, under procedures \n     prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to allow an \n     employee to volunteer for separation in a reduction-in-force \n     when this will result in retaining an employee in a similar \n     position who would otherwise be released in the reduction-in-\n     force. A voluntary release under the provision would be \n     treated as an involuntary separation in the reduction-in-\n     force. The procedures prescribed by the Office will provide \n     that an offer of voluntary participation in a reduction-in-\n     force is made at the agency's discretion, and that no \n     employee may be coerced into accepting such offer. An \n     employee who is voluntarily released would not have \n     assignment (``bump'' and ``retreat'') rights in the \n     reduction-in-force.\n       Section 10 provides that employees in any agency who are \n     involuntarily separated in a reduction-in-force, or who \n     voluntarily separate from a surplus position that has been \n     specifically identified for elimination in the reduction-in-\n     force, can continue health benefits coverage for 18 months \n     and be required to pay only the employee's share of the \n     premium.\n       Section 11 provides that the Director of the Office of \n     Personnel Management may prescribe any regulations necessary \n     to administer the provisions of the Act.\n       Section 12 provides that the Act will take effect upon \n     enactment and that no voluntary separation incentive under \n     the Act may be paid based on the separation of an employee \n     after September 30, 2000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Office of\n\n\n                                         Personnel Management,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the President's Management \n     Council, the Office of Personnel Management submits herewith \n     an Administration legislative proposal entitled the ``Federal \n     Employment Reduction Assistance Act of 1996.'' We request \n     that it be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     and favorable consideration.\n       While total Federal employment is relatively stable at \n     present, the need for employment reductions may vary \n     significantly from one particular agency to another. In the \n     next several years, it is likely that many Federal agencies \n     will need to make significant cuts. The Administration \n     believes that separation incentives can be an appropriate \n     tool for those agencies that must reduce their employment \n     levels, when the use of incentives is properly related to the \n     specific cuts that are needed within the agency and thus will \n     help reshape the agency for the future. Further, it is vital \n     to provide for consistent administration of any incentive \n     programs that prove necessary for different agencies, and to \n     appropriately limit the time period for any incentive offers.\n       This initiative is based on the Executive Branch's \n     experience with voluntary separation incentives under the \n     Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. The \n     Restructuring Act provided Federal civilian agencies with \n     authority to offer voluntary separation incentives for a one-\n     year period that ended\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\n     March 31, 1995. We believe that agencies generally used these \n     incentives successfully to help avoid involuntary \n     separations, and that the Restructuring Act provided a useful \n     framework for consistent administration of incentive programs \n     in many different agencies.\n       This proposal would provide an overall system for the \n     limited use of voluntary separation incentives by Federal \n     civilian agencies. When an agency head determines that \n     employment in the agency must be reduced in order to improve \n     operating efficiency or meet anticipated budget levels, the \n     agency head may submit a plan to the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget for payment of voluntary separation \n     incentives to agency employees. The plan must specify how the \n     planned employment reductions will improve efficiency or meet \n     budget levels. The plan must also include a proposed time \n     period for payment of incentives, and a proposed coverage for \n     offers of incentives to agency employees on the needed \n     organizational, occupational, and geographic basis. The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget would approve \n     or disapprove each plan submitted, and would have authority \n     to modify the time period for incentives or coverage of \n     incentive offers. We believe that these provisions for plan \n     approval will ensure that any separation incentives are \n     appropriately targeted within the agency in view of the \n     specific cuts that are needed, and are offered on a timely \n     basis. An agency's full-time equivalent employment would be \n     reduced by one for each employee of the agency who receives \n     an incentive.\n       The authority for separation incentives would be in effect \n     for the period starting with the enactment of this Act and \n     ending September 30, 2000. The amount of an employee's \n     incentive would be the lesser of the amount that the \n     employee's severance pay would be, or whichever of the \n     following amounts is applicable based on separation in \n     accordance with the agency plan: $25,000 in fiscal years 1996 \n     and 1997; $20,000 in fiscal year 1998; $15,000 in fiscal year \n     1999; or $10,000 in fiscal year 2000. Any employee who \n     receives an incentive and then accepts any employment with \n     the Government within 5 years after separating must, prior to \n     the first day of employment, repay the entire amount of the \n     incentive to the agency that paid the incentive. The \n     repayment requirement could be waived only under very \n     stringent circumstances of agency need.\n       In order to further assist agencies in making needed cuts, \n     the bill would authorize agencies, under appropriate \n     conditions, to allow an employee to volunteer for separation \n     in a reduction-in-force when this will prevent the \n     involuntary separation of an employee in a similar position. \n     In addition, in order to minimize the impact of reduction-in-\n     force actions on employees, the bill provides that employees \n     who are involuntarily separated in reductions-in-force can \n     continue their health insurance coverage for 18 months while \n     continuing to pay only the premium that would apply to a \n     current employee.\n       The Administration believes that this proposal would \n     provide a very useful tool to assist agencies in making \n     needed cuts under appropriate controls and effective program \n     administration.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that the \n     enactment of this legislative proposal would be in accord \n     with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James B. King,\n                                                 Director.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Simon, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 1834. A bill to reauthorize the Indian Environmental General \nAssistance Program Act of 1992, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs\n\n\n   THE INDIAN ENVIRONMENTAL GENERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992. \nI am pleased to be joined by the vice chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, Senator Inouye, and my colleagues, Senator Simon and \nSenator Domenici as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Congress enacted the Indian Environmental General \nAssistance Program Act over 4 years ago to correct a serious deficiency \nin Federal efforts to ensure environmental protection on reservation \nlands. Environmental problems on Indian lands were virtually ignored \nuntil the mid-1980's when the Congress adopted amendments to the Clean \nWater Act, Superfund and the Safe Drinking Water Act to authorize \nIndian tribes to obtain regulatory primacy under these Federal \nstatutes. Despite these efforts to ensure that Indian lands enjoyed the \nsame level of environmental protection as the rest of the Nation, there \nremain many serious environmental threats to Indian lands.\n  Some of the most severe environmental problems in the United States \nthreaten our poorest communities. It has been reported that at least \n600 solid waste landfills exist on Indian lands that do not meet \nFederal standards. Contamination from unsanitary landfills pose a daily \nhazard to the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, which is located \nin one of the poorest counties in America. Mercury pollution on the \nSeminole Indian Reservation in Florida threatens fishing and the \ngathering of food. The Navajo Nation estimates that as many as 1,000 \nabandoned hazardous waste sites polluted with uranium mine waste \ncontaminate its reservation land in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. In a \n1994 inspector general report, the EPA estimated that at least 75 \npercent of the reported 530 leaking underground storage tanks on Indian \nlands have not been cleaned up and many more have not been identified. \nThese additional conditions are intolerable and deserve our immediate \naction.\n  The Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act authorizes \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to award multimedia grants to \nIndian tribal governments for the purpose of developing tribal capacity \nto establish environmental regulatory programs. Before the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, Indian tribes have testified regarding the need for a \ndiversified and flexible funding mechanism to allow for the development \nof tribal environmental programs across a wide range of media areas.\n  The General Assistance Program allows Indian tribes to tailor an \nenvironmental management approach that is flexible and allows for the \nallocation of limited resources pursuant to tribally identified \nenvironmental priorities. The minimum award for a general assistance \ngrant is $75,000 per year. The act authorizes $15 million per fiscal \nyear to be appropriated to the EPA to administer the General Assistance \nProgram.\n\n  Despite these advances in Federal Indian environmental policy, many \nIndian tribal programs are barely in the infant stages of development. \nThe General Assistance Program provides Indian tribal governments with \nthe necessary technical and financial assistance to enable them to \nbecome better environmental managers.\n  The bill I am introducing is a simple amendment to the act that would \nauthorize the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to implement \nthe Indian Environmental General Assistance Program. This modification \nwill provide greater flexibility to the Administrator of EPA to make \nawards to Indian tribes under the act and it will enable a greater \nnumber of Indian tribes to develop environmental programs.\n  In the 4 years since its enactment, less than one-fifth of the 557 \nIndian tribes and Alaska Native villages have been able to receive \ngrant awards under this program. This modification will ensure that \nmore tribal governments will be able to receive assistance to address \nthe many severe environmental problems affecting reservation lands. In \nmonetary terms, the funds that are needed to address these \nenvironmental problems are enormous and far exceed the scarce resources \nof most Indian tribes. Through this legislation, we will ensure that \nthe Federal Government will afford Indian lands the same protection to \na clean environment as the rest of the United States.\n  I am pleased to note that this legislation is strongly endorsed by \nIndian tribes and the EPA. The EPA has steadily increased its efforts \nover the past several years to support tribal authority to regulate \nenvironmental programs on reservation lands. EPA Administrator Browner \nexpressed her commitment to improving environmental protection on \nIndian lands by elevating the needs of Indian tribes as a funding \npriority for the Agency. This commitment is a long overdue, but much \nwelcome change for Indian country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation and \njoin me in this effort to assist Indian tribes to improve environmental \nquality on Indian lands.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1835. A bill to expand the definition of limited tax benefit for \npurposes of the line-item veto; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of \nAugust 4, 1977, that\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nif one committee reports the other have 30 days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n\n              the line-item veto act expansion act of 1996\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nexpand the Line-Item Veto Act to cover one of the largest and fastest \ngrowing areas of the Federal budget, tax expenditures.\n  I am especially proud to be joined in offering this legislation by \ntwo colleagues who have worked to ensure that tax expenditures receive \nthe scrutiny that other forms of spending receive, my good friends, the \nSenator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] and the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone].\n  In addition to our effort here in the Senate, I am pleased that my \ngood friend, Congressman Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, is spearheading this \nlegislation in the other body. Both bills expand the Line-Item Veto Act \nwhich was signed into law recently, and which will take effect next \nJanuary and remain in force for the next 8 years.\n  Mr. President, both Congressman Barrett and I supported the new Line-\nItem Veto Act that was signed into law a few weeks ago. Though it isn't \nthe whole answer to our deficit problem, I very much hope it will be \npart of the answer.\n  However, the new Line-Item Veto Act failed to address one of the \nlargest, and fastest growing areas of Federal spending--the program \nspending done through the Tax Code, often called tax expenditures.\n  Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that over the next 7 years, we \nwill spend $3.7 trillion on tax expenditures. In the coming fiscal \nyear, it is estimated that we will spend more on programs through the \nTax Code, nearly $480 billion, than we will on discretionary spending \nfor defense, agriculture, the Commerce Department programs, education, \nthe environment, health programs including medical research, housing \nprograms, the Justice Department, transportation, veterans affairs, the \nspace program, the entire Federal judiciary, and the entire legislative \nbranch.\n  Mr. President, despite making up a huge portion of the Federal \nbudget, tax expenditures are off the table with regard to the new \nPresidential authority which only extends to so-called limited tax \nbenefits, defined in part to be a tax expenditure that benefits 100 or \nfewer taxpayers. Thus, as long as the tax attorneys can find 101 \ntaxpayers--individuals, corporations, or both--who benefit from the \nproposed tax expenditure, it is beyond the reach of the new \nPresidential authority.\n  Mr. President, it may not even be necessary for the tax attorneys to \nfind that one 101st taxpayer. If a tax expenditure gives equal \ntreatment to all persons in the same industry or engaged in the same \ntype of activity, it is exempt from the new Presidential authority no \nmatter how few benefit from the special treatment.\n  Also, if all persons owning the same type of property, or issuing the \nsame type of investment, receive the same treatment from a tax \nexpenditure, that tax expenditure is beyond the reach of the \nPresident's new authority.\n  And, there are still more exceptions that make it even harder for a \nPresident to trim unnecessary spending done through the Tax Code. For \nexample, if any difference in the treatment of persons by a new tax \nexpenditure is based solely on the size or form of the business or \nassociation involved, or, in the case of individuals, general \ndemographic conditions, then the new spending cannot be touched by the \nPresident except as part of a veto of the entire piece of legislation \nwhich contains the new spending.\n  Mr. President, we find none of these elaborate restrictions on \nspending done through the appropriations process or through \nentitlements. The new Presidential authority is handcuffed only for \nspending done through the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, this raises several problems.\n  First, and foremost, it partitions off an enormous portion of the \nFederal budget from this new tool to cut wasteful and unnecessary \nspending. Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that we are spending over \n$450 billion through the Tax Code this year, nearly $480 billion next \nyear, and a whopping $3.7 trillion over the next 7 years. If the \nauthority established by the Line-Item Veto Act is to have meaning, it \ncannot be preempted from being used to scrutinize this much spending.\n  A second problem raised by the inability of the new Presidential \nauthority to address new tax expenditures is that it creates an \nenormous loophole through which questionable spending can escape. The \ncurrent Line-Item Veto Act power given the President formally covers \ndiscretionary spending and new entitlement authority. But a special \ninterest intent on enacting its pork-barrel spending could still do so \nby avoiding the discretionary or entitlement formats, and instead \ntransform their pork into a tax expenditure. As a tax expenditure, most \nspecial interest pork is beyond the reach of the Line-Item Veto Act.\n  Mr. President, this gaping hole is big enough to sink the entire \nship.\n  No matter how powerful this new authority is with regard to \ndiscretionary spending and entitlement authority, it is virtually \nuseless against tax expenditures, and thus invites special interests to \nuse this avenue to deliver pork.\n\n  Mr. President, a further problem with the lack of adequate \nPresidential review in this area is the very real potential for \ninequities in the implementation of the new Line-Item Veto Act \nauthority. These inequities arise in part from the progressive \nstructure of marginal tax rates--as income rises, higher tax rates are \napplied. In turn, this means that many tax expenditures are worth more \nto those in the higher income tax brackets than they are to families \nwith lower incomes.\n  In some instances, tax expenditures provide no benefit at all to \nindividuals with lower incomes.\n  This is not the case with entitlement and discretionary spending \nprograms--both areas covered by the Line-Item Veto Act. The benefits of \nthose programs often are targeted to those with lower income.\n  The net effect is that the scope of the current Line-Item Veto Act \ncovers programs that often benefit those with low and moderate income, \nwhile it is powerless with regard to programs that often benefit \nindividuals and corporations with higher incomes.\n  Mr. President, tax expenditures have another feature that makes it \nespecially important that we extend the new Line-Item Veto Act to cover \nthem, namely their status as a kind of superentitlement. Once enacted, \na tax expenditure continues to spend money without any additional \nauthorization or appropriation, and without any regular review. In \nfact, while even funding for entitlements like Medicare or Medicaid can \nbe suspended in rare instances such as a Government shutdown, funding \nfor a tax expenditure is never interrupted.\n  Tax expenditures enjoy a status that is far above any other kind of \ngovernment spending, and as such, it should receive special scrutiny. \nExtending the Line-Item Veto Act to cover them will provide some of \nthat needed review.\n  Mr. President, as I have noted, tax expenditures make up a huge \nportion of the budget. They will soon exceed the entire Federal \ndiscretionary budget. Citizens for Tax Justice reports that if all \ncurrent tax expenditures were suddenly repealed, the deficit could be \neliminated and income tax rates could be reduced across the board by \nabout 25 percent.\n  Clearly, tax expenditures have an enormous impact on the deficit, and \nwe need to pursue two tracks with regard to them. First, we must cut \nsome of the $455 billion in existing spending done through the Tax \nCode. Any balanced plan to eliminate the deficit over the next few \nyears must contain cuts to spending in this area.\n  And second, with so much of our budget already dedicated to this kind \nof spending, we must bring tax expenditures under the Line-Item Veto \nAct and give the President the authority to act on new spending in this \narea as he does in other areas.\n  Our legislation does just that by eliminating the highly restrictive \nlanguage with respect to tax expenditures.\n  Mr. President, as with the recently enacted Line-Item Veto Act \nitself, this bill to extend that new authority is not the whole answer \nto our deficit problems, but it can be part of the answer, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this effort to put teeth into the new \nPresidential authority with respect to the tax expenditure portion of \nthe Federal budget.\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1835\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a segment of the Clarion River, located \nin Pennsylvania, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n           NATIONAL WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS SYSTEM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure to \nadd 51.7 miles of Pennsylvania's Clarion River to the National Wild and \nScenic Rivers System. This bill, which Senator Specter has joined as an \noriginal cosponsor, is companion legislation to a measure being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today by Congressman Bill \nClinger.\n  Our bill designates segments of the main stem of the Clarion River \nfrom the Allegheny National Forest-State Game Lands No. 44 boundary to \nthe backwaters of Piney Dam as part of the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System. This designation will help to preserve and protect the \nsignificant scenic and recreational values of these segments of the \nClarion River.\n  This measure will conclude work begun by the late Senator John Heinz. \nIt was his legislation to add a portion of the Allegheny River to the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System that also authorized the study \nof the Clarion River to determine its eligibility. The study was \nconcluded earlier this year. And enactment of the bill that Senator \nSpecter and I are offering today will bring Senator Heinz's efforts \nfull circle.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof this bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1836\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE CLARION RIVER.\n\n       Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``( ) Clarion river,

Mr. President, the New York Times carried a story \nthe other day about people in Wisconsin from the pro-life and pro-\nchoice side of the abortion issues, to use the names each side uses, \nmeeting together to talk about what can be done in a constructive way \non the issue of abortion.\n  About 100 people met at this meeting.\n  I commend them for doing it.\n  This is a meeting that I or some other Member of the Senate should \nhave called a long time ago.\n  I remember when Cardinal Bernardin, the Roman Catholic prelate in the \nChicago area, said that people of sincerity on both sides ought to be \nmeeting and trying to work together on a common agenda.\n  For example, we know that girls and boys who drop out of high school \nare much more likely to be involved in teenage pregnancies. And a high \npercentage of those end in abortions.\n  If we have programs to encourage people to stay in high school, we \nare going to have fewer abortions.\n  That may not be as emotionally satisfying as carrying a picket sign \nor haranguing someone, but it does infinitely more constructive good \nand it is something that both sides could agree upon.\n  I applaud the leaders, Mary Jacksteit and Sister Adrienne Kaufmann, \nfor what they are doing.\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\n  I ask that the New York Times article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             A Weekend Without War Over the Abortion Issue\n\n       Madison, WI.--In workshops and seminars, 100 people from \n     both sides in the fight over abortion met here this weekend \n     to talk about their beliefs without proselytizing or \n     condemning each other.\n       At its first national conference, which ended today at the \n     University of Wisconsin, a group known as the Common Ground \n     Network for Life and Choice brought together community \n     organizers, members of the clergy, writers and academics in \n     an effort to defuse the rancor that often colors the abortion \n     debate.\n       ``Common Ground is trying to maintain a civil environment \n     in which people can discuss the issues,'' said Mary \n     Jacksteit, a former labor lawyer who co-founded the \n     organization in Washington in 1993. ``This is the place for \n     light instead of heat.''\n       The aim, Ms. Jacksteit said, is to ease the dispute over \n     abortion and find points of commonalty that can be put into \n     practice on a local level.\n       Critics say Common Ground members risk compromising their \n     beliefs by fraternizing with their opponents. But Ms. \n     Jacksteit said the group's focus was not necessarily on \n     abortion.\n       Rather than developing a middle position, the organization \n     favors exploring issues that can have a cause and effect \n     bearing on abortion--like teen-age pregnancy, birth control, \n     adoption and sexual responsibility.\n       Ms. Jacksteit and the group's other founder, Adrienne \n     Kaufmann, a Benedictine nun, refrain from labeling themselves \n     and decline to be pinned down on the beliefs.\n       ``Neither one of us have been either pro-life or pro-choice \n     activists,'' sister Kaufmann said. ``We do not have a hidden \n     agenda.''\n       Many participants in the conference identified their \n     position only by attaching colored stickers to their name \n     tags, a green dot indicating support of abortion rights, a \n     blue dot indicating opposition. One-third had blue dots, one-\n     third had green dots and one-third had no sticker.\n       In a Friday workshop, groups of participants sat knee to \n     knee in a circle of chairs, Planned Parenthood board members \n     beside Operation Rescue organizers, a Baptist minister who \n     supports abortion rights beside someone long active in social \n     issues who opposes abortion.\n       ``When President Clinton vetoed the late-term abortion \n     bill, I was pleased,'' said the Mel Taylor, a Baptist pastor \n     for Denver and a supporter of abortion rights. ``But I was \n     also very aware of how my friends on the other side were \n     grieving. What I can't do anymore is gloat.''\n       For the participants, a willingness to engage in dialogue \n     did not mean conceding their beliefs.\n       ``I don't feel like I have to give an inch at all,'' said \n     Loretto Wagner, a veteran abortion opponent who started the \n     Common Ground chapter in St. Louis. ``To learn to trust \n     people does not demand any kind of compromise. But I don't \n     have to stand on my principles with my chin thrust out in \n     confrontation. The whole concept of Common Ground involves \n     recognizing our similarities rather than our differences, and \n     not coercing or forcing our agenda on someone.''\n       With 1,500 members in 21 states, Common Ground has tried \n     such bridge-building in a number of communities, Ms. \n     Jacksteit said. In Buffalo, Common Ground works with schools \n     to combat teen-age pregnancy. In St. Louis, an abortion \n     clinic gives prenatal care to women who decide not to \n     terminate a pregnancy and refers them to a crisis pregnancy \n     center run by opponents of abortion. These services were \n     arranged by the directors of the clinic and the crisis \n     center, who are members of Common Ground.\n       In 1995, after the announcement that two abortion clinics \n     would be built in Davenport, Iowa, Common Ground members \n     talked about ways to reduce the potential for violence.\n       In another workshop on Friday, participants critiqued their \n     own sides in the abortion conflict.\n       ``I think it's possible to disagree with somebody without \n     calling them a baby killer or believing they are monsters of \n     fiends,'' said Frederica Mathewes-Green, the author of ``Real \n     Choices'' and an abortion opponent. The slogan ``It's a \n     baby,'' popularized by abortion opponents, only deadlocks the \n     debate, Ms. Mathewes-Green said. It perpetuates the misbelief \n     that women and babies are on opposite sides of the issues, \n     she added, and alienates women who face unplanned \n     pregnancies.\n       Conversely, the slogan ``It's a woman's choice'' \n     trivializes the death of the fetus, the author Naomi Wolf \n     told participants at the Friday workshop. The death of the \n     fetus has become ``the blind spot'' of the abortion-rights \n     movement, said Ms. Wolf, who supports abortion rights and who \n     last fall condemned the oratory of the abortion-rights \n     movement in an essay in The New Republic.\n       ``I think there is a great hunger in America for a \n     discussion on this issue,'' she added. Most Americans ``want \n     to preserve abortion as a legal right, but condemn it as a \n     moral iniquity.''\n       Many Common Ground members said they were viewed with \n     suspicion not by their adversaries but by their allies. They \n     said their willingness to sit down and listen to the enemy \n     was seen as a form of betrayal.\n       The apparent mistrust is not a surprise to Sister Kaufmann.\n       ``We live in an adversarial society,'' she said. ``To be in \n     a non-contentious conversation with someone is viewed as \n     strange behavior.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5774-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5775-S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REPORT ON THE DEFENSE INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE MEMORANDUM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for over a year I have served as \nthe Chairman of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \nSecrecy. Among the Commission's concerns is the often corrupting nature \nof secrets. Undocumented allegations, sweeping generalizations, \npersonal biases, and outright lies can all be wrapped in the protective \ncloak of secrecy and receive a level of credibility that they would \nquickly lose if their documentation and sources were subject to public \nscrutiny. In addition to the problem of formal classification, the \nCommission has witnessed examples of instances in which unclassified \ninformation gathered from open sources is given greater weight by \nrestricting the distribution of such information to those who hold \nsecurity clearances. We were recently witness to an example of this \nphenomenon.\n  In October, 1995, a counterintelligence profile by the Defense \nInvestigative Service of the Defense Department was sent to 250 leading \ndefense contractors warning of the danger posed by the State of Israel. \nIsrael, the reader was warned, is a ``nontraditional adversary'' with a \nproven history of aggressive espionage against the United States, \nutilizing the strong ethnic ties to Israel present in the United States \nand the skilled exploitation of selective employment opportunities to \ninfiltrate American industry.\n  These are serious allegations. They are substantiated with a reading \nlist of three leading daily newspapers and four recent best-selling \nbooks about Israeli espionage. No specific citations, no references to \npages, or even issues of the newspapers. No attempt to link the \nexplosive statements in the memorandum to the list of sources that \nfollow.\n  Before entering the Senate, I taught at both Syracuse and Harvard \nUniversities. Had I received a term paper from a college freshman with \nsuch inadequate documentation I would have returned it without \nbothering to read the material.\n  But add the magic words counterintelligence profile and send it out \non a computer from the Defense Investigative Service and for 3 long \nmonths these ugly allegations festered unchallenged. For 3 long months \nnone of the 250 defense contractors who had received this document \nraised a question in public. After all, who wanted to betray the \ncontents of a Defense Department counterintelligence profile, albeit \none adorned with a notation that the document did ``not necessarily \nrepresent the views of the Defense Investigative Service or the \nDepartment of Defense?'' Certainly not a defense contractor concerned \nthat such action might raise suspicions of involvement in the pro-\nIsrael cabal. Incidently, the very word ``cabal'' has its roots in the \nmedieval suggestion that Jewish sages--students of the Cabala--were \nplanning to subvert established European regimes.\n  The silence that greeted this outrageous memorandum is hardly the \nfirst time that people who knew better have been quiet in the face of \nsimilar ugly allegations.\n  A century ago the Czar's secret police crafted their own \ncounterintelligence profile in response to the world's outrage at the \ngovernment-sanctioned pogroms against Russian Jews. This document, the \ninfamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, purported to be proof of the \ninternational Jewish conspiracy bent on world dominance. After the \nFirst World War, the Protocols were translated into numerous languages \nand became popular in nativist and anti-Semitic circles in this \ncountry. Virtually everyone knew the Protocols were an ugly lie. But \nfor much too long almost no one had the courage to say so in a clear \nand unambiguous voice.\n  The damage done by the Defense Investigative Service memorandum was \nreal and the questions it raised could not be ignored. The loyalties \nand integrity of millions of American citizens\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\nhave been questioned in a report prepared at Government expense and \nreleased, in a manner which suggested it carried the authority of the \nDepartment of Defense, to a select group of corporations who were \nadvised to be cautious about employees with strong ethnic ties to \nIsrael.\n  When I learned of this memorandum in January, I spoke to Under \nSecretary of Defense John White to say that we need to have an \naffirmative statement of what the policy of the Department of Defense \nis. Which is to say that Israel is most assuredly not a nontraditional \nadversary and that defense contractors are in no way to consider ethnic \norigins in their employment practices. I subsequently met with Michael \nWaguespack, Director of the National Counterintelligence Center, and \nwith John F. Donnelly, then the Director of the Defense Investigative \nService. Both appreciated the implications and lessons of this \nincident. One hopes that no group of Americans, and no foreign country, \never has to endure similar allegations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5775-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SALUTE TO TENNESSEE'S BICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition and \ncelebration of Tennessee's 200th birthday. Two hundred years ago, when \nTennessee's statehood was in its infancy, pioneers and frontiersmen \nbanded together to forge a new future for the Southwest Territory. \nThough the road to statehood was filled with many obstacles, including \nland disputes with North Carolina and Presidential politics that held \nthe territory's petition hostage, the spirit of Tennessee's founding \nfathers prevailed, On July 1, 1796--months after our forefathers called \na convention and drafted a State constitution--President George \nWashington signed a bill into law and Tennessee became the 16th State \nin the Union.\n  With a chain of mountains separating them from their eastern \nneighbors and a vast wilderness to their west, Tennessee's new citizens \ncontinued to rely on their frontier skills. It was that pioneer \ndetermination that laid the rock-solid foundation for growth and \nprosperity in the State of Tennessee. It wasn't long before the \npopulation grew. Settlers from Virginia, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, and Pennsylvania quickly moved in--first to mountainous east \nTennessee and then went to the hills of middle Tennessee and on to the \nbanks of the Mississippi. Today, Tennessee's population is as rich and \ndiverse as our native soil and our three grand regional divisions.\n  In the last 200 years, Tennesseans have become President and Vice \nPresident of the United States; they have fought--sometimes brother \nagainst brother--in bloody battles in the War Between the States and \nhave given their lives on foreign soil in World Wars; they have toiled \nin hot fields and on hot city streets; they have founded some of the \nfinest colleges and universities around; they have built music and \nentertainment industries; and they have helped develop the technology \nthat will advance Tennessee into its third successful century. And Mr. \nPresident, they have all--in one way or another--contributed to the \nfortune of our State and Nation.\n  Mr. President, as Tennessee looks back proudly on the accomplishments \nof its first 200 years, let us also recognize the bright future that \nlies ahead for my home state. The volunteers of Tennessee are no longer \nliving on the frontier, but their pioneering minds and spirits continue \nto drive them toward success. So Mr. President, I rise today to \ncelebrate with my fellow Tennesseans as we all look forward to the \nprosperous growth and bountiful success that the next 200 years of \nTennessee history will behold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5776-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5776-S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE SILLY SEASON\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I felt like cheering as I read Tom \nFriedman's column in the New York Times on the gasoline tax, which I \nask to be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  Frankly, no tax cut makes any sense when we are still running a huge \ndeficit. Tax cuts are pandering at their worst.\n  But of all the tax cuts the one that makes the least sense is the \n4.3-cent-a-gallon cut in the gas tax.\n  Even our neighbors in Canada, who have much greater distances to \ncover with a sparser population, have a gasoline tax roughly double our \ngasoline tax.\n  No country outside Saudi Arabia has a gas tax lower than ours.\n  We illustrate over and over again the need for doing what Thomas \nJefferson first suggested--having a constitutional amendment to \nrestrict Government borrowing.\n  For most of the first two centuries of our country's existence that \nwas not a huge problem, but we are so motivated by polls and gimmicks \nthat we are doing a great disservice to our country.\n  If President Clinton had stood up and said this is wrong, he would \nhave picked up support both in conservative circles as well as \ngenerally.\n  It is interesting that after we had passed the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax \nincrease, I did not have a single person among the 12 million people in \nIllinois object to that tax increase.\n  I talked to a western Senator where you might expect greater \nsensitivity, and he told me he had the same experience.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                            The Silly Season\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Washington.--I have a confession to make: Even before the \n     old Bob Dole became the new Bob Dole, our family station \n     wagon wasn't exactly plastered with his bumper stickers. But \n     last week I returned from an overseas trip to find that Mr. \n     Dole was proposing to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline \n     tax, and I've changed my mind about the old guy. Yes, sir, \n     scrapping the gasoline tax. That's the sort of leadership \n     America needs; that's the sort of spirit of sacrifice the \n     country's been missing: a President who's ready to sacrifice \n     the budget, to sacrifice the environment, to sacrifice energy \n     conservation, to sacrifice oil reserves in order to save the \n     American people 4.3 cents a gallon. And when Mr. Dole's \n     sidekick Dick Armey, the House majority leader, suggested \n     that we consider cutting the education budget to make up for \n     the lost gas-tax revenue, well, then and there I knew I was a \n     Dole man. I mean, cutting education to save Americans a few \n     pennies a gallon at a time when their gas is already the \n     cheapest in the world--that's the kind of thinking that will \n     keep us the world's most competitive nation in the 21st \n     century. I sure hope the Japanese don't get that idea.\n       Are we out of our minds? Raising the gas tax has been one \n     of the few smart things we've done in recent years. It \n     promotes energy conservation, it helps protect the air, it \n     encourages development of alternative energies, it promotes \n     national security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil \n     supplies--and it reduces the budget deficit. That 4.3-cent-a-\n     gallon tax raises $5 billion a year. It is one of the reasons \n     the deficit has been cut in half since 1993.\n       Any proposal to repeal the gas tax should be hooted out of \n     Congress with scorn. Unfortunately, that's not what President \n     Clinton did. Instead he's trying to trade his support for \n     this idiotic gas-tax repeal for a Republican endorsement of \n     his proposal to raise the minimum wage--the worst sort of \n     election-year poker. Mr. Clinton is saying to Mr. Dole: ``I \n     see your foolishness and I raise you one.''\n       It is hard to believe that the Dole proposal for repeal of \n     the gas tax is effective even as political pandering. How \n     many people are really going to change their votes from \n     Clinton to Dole over 4.3 cents a gallon? Moreover, how can \n     Republicans argue that a balanced budget and deficit \n     reduction are the two most urgent priorities in American \n     politics and then, when gas prices go up a bit due to \n     seasonal factors, simply discard the gas tax without regard \n     for the long-term budget implications? ``It only makes sense \n     politically if it is part of a broader Dole strategy for \n     lowering taxes,'' says Bill Kristol, editor of the \n     conservative Weekly Standard. And then for Mr. Armey to \n     even hint that we might pay for this giveaway by cutting \n     education--that takes your breath away. For a cheap \n     political high with the shelf life of a dead fish, a House \n     Republican leader is ready to cut $5 billion a year from \n     education? How could such a thought even cross Mr. Armey's \n     mind? Forget about what a Dole Presidency would be like; \n     if this keeps up I'm not sure we can afford a Dole \n     candidacy.\n       The truth is we shouldn't be lowering our gas taxes. We \n     should be raising them. Gasoline is probably the best bargain \n     commodity in the U.S. marketplace. The latest blip aside, the \n     real price of gasoline in the U.S. has been falling for 15 \n     years (and if the Iraqi oil sanctions are eased by the U.N. \n     soon, gas prices in the U.S. will likely resume that downward \n     trend). In France and Italy, gas goes for $4.50 a gallon; in \n     Japan it costs $3.75. Most of the difference between their \n     prices and ours is taxes that those Governments use to \n     finance public services. We could put a 50-cent-a-gallon tax \n     on U.S. gasoline, get rid of the deficit and still have a \n     huge competitive edge over the Europeans and Japanese. ``This \n     is one of the easiest and most attractive ways of raising tax \n     revenue, and we're just giving it away,'' says the oil \n     economist Vahan Zanoyan, of the Petroleum Finance Company.\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\n       In his speech announcing his resignation from the Senate, \n     Mr. Dole insisted that: ``My campaign for the President is \n     not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental \n     things, consequential things, things that are real. My \n     campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is \n     right.''\n       If that's true, then I can't wait for the Dole campaign to \n     begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5776-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 L.W.

Higgins High School in Marrero, \nLA, winners of the Louisiana competition of the We the People . . . the \nCitizen and the Constitution Program. These exceptional young people \nwere participants in the national finals held in Washington, DC on \nApril 27, through April 29, 1996.\n  The distinguished members of the team are: Stephen Deffner, Khai T. \nDuong, Kim Evans, Mary Rose Hollywood, Liliane Thuy Huynh, Danielle S. \nJames, Ashley Huong Kha, Julie Larue, Christina Magenta Lindsay, Lauren \nElizabeth Mo, Cathy Thuy Nguyen, Michelle Thuy-Trang Nguyen, Traci Hong \nPham, Shaun Adrian Posey, Hoai X. Tran, Mary M. Tran, Euriah Marie \nWalters, and Donald Alexander Winchester, Jr.\n  I would also like to recognize Jamie Staub, their outstanding \nteacher, who can be credited with much of the team's success. The \ndistrict coordinator, Jane Wilson, and the State coordinator, Catherine \nSt. Amant, also devoted a great deal of time and were integral to the \nteam's achievement.\n  The We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution Program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate youth about the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights. The 3-day national competition simulates a congressional \nhearing in which students' oral presentations are judged on the ability \nto apply constitutional principles to both historical and contemporary \nissues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People \nProgram, now in its ninth academic year, has reached more than 70,400 \nteachers and 226,000 students nationwide. Members of Congress and their \nstaff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues \nwith students and teachers.\n  This outstanding program provides an excellent opportunity for \nstudents to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the \nU.S. Constitution and its place in history and in our lives. I am very \nproud of the students of L.W. Higgins High School and look forward to \ntheir continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5777-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON VOTES\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, a friend of mine, Robert Luken, sent \nme an article from the Catholic Times, the Springfield, IL, diocesan \nnewspaper with a story by John Thavis that was distributed by Catholic \nNews Service under the title ``Worldwide Gambling Boom Is Cause for \nConcern,'' which I ask to be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  It contains not only good moral advice but good common sense that we \nmust keep in mind as we approach a decision on whether or not to have a \nFederal commission to look at the huge growth of gambling in our \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the article.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Springfield Catholic Times, Apr. 21, 1996]\n\n              Worldwide Gambling Boom Is Cause for Concern\n\n                            (By John Travis)\n\n       Vatican City.--A worldwide boom in gambling--increasingly \n     sponsored by the state--is raising moral concerns among \n     Vatican officials, theologians and Catholic social \n     scientists.\n       Gambling is not a new issue for the church. Bingo has been \n     a parish mainstay for decades. Local churches have raised \n     money through raffles or other take-a-chance offerings.\n       But this small-scale ``social'' gambling has given way to a \n     more aggressive form that, according to church experts, has a \n     corrosive effect on individuals, families and the entire \n     social fabric. In the U.S., nearly $500 billion is wagered \n     legally every year.\n       ``Gambling is obviously reaching alarming proportions. I \n     think it represents a menace to the basic institution of the \n     family and to the community at large,'' said Jerzy Zubrzycki, \n     a member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, who \n     has spent years researching the effects of gambling.\n       Gambling ``is a search for a quick fix, like the drug \n     culture. It's escapism instead of facing one's problems and \n     trying to grow,'' said U.S. Jesuit Father John Navone, a \n     theologian at Rome's Gregorian University.\n       For Swiss Dominican Father Georges Cottier, Pope John Paul \n     II's in-house theologian, the spread of gambling is no less \n     than a sign of a ``social disease.'' The house never loses, \n     but the weak and their families often do, he said.\n       Yet, surprisingly to many, the church's official teaching \n     on gambling is quite tolerant. According to the ``Catechism \n     of the Catholic Church,'' games of chance and betting are not \n     in themselves evil or unjust.\n       They become morally unacceptable when they ``deprive \n     someone of what is necessary to provide for his needs and \n     those of others.'' The catechism also rejects unfair wagers \n     or cheating; but there's no explicit mention of the state's \n     role in promoting lotteries, casinos or ``scratch-and-win'' \n     tickets.\n       The Vatican has not examined the finer moral points of \n     state-sponsored gambling in any comprehensive way, and the \n     Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declined to answer \n     questions about the issue. Church officials are, however, \n     tracking recent statements against gambling by bishops in the \n     U.S., Canada and Australia.\n       ``The state, instead of being a brake or a guide on this \n     issue, is playing the game itself. Unfortunately, this is \n     part of the crisis of values in society,'' said Franciscan \n     Father Pier Giuseppe Pesce, a Rome theologian who advises the \n     Vatican.\n       Mary Ann Glendon, a U.S. lawyer and a member of the \n     Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, said state-sponsored \n     gambling often appears a painless way to produce much-needed \n     revenues. But really, it's a ``regressive tax'' that hits the \n     poor hardest.\n       What she especially finds objectionable is that the state \n     ``imitates the private operators of casinos, in trickling in \n     this little wins'' to keep people coming back. It's ``very \n     cynical and very exploitative,'' she said.\n       Father Cottier said he thought the Vatican should take a \n     closer look at the morality of all this. One way in which the \n     issue might be advanced, he said, is for a bishop to pose \n     formal questions for response by the doctrinal congregation.\n       But none of those interviewed was proposing a ban on \n     gambling. The question is more complex than that, they said.\n       As Glendon said, ``When we address the moral issue we have \n     to make sure that we are not trying to eliminate things that \n     make life pleasant and fun.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5778-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5778-S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 50 years ago this June, \nPresident Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch Act into law \ndeclaring ``Nothing is more important in our national life than the \nwelfare of our children, and proper nourishment comes first in \nattaining this welfare.'' This created the modern School Lunch Program \noperated through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  By the end of its first year about 7.1 million children were \nparticipating in the National School Lunch Program. Today, over 25 \nmillion children receive a nutritious lunch under the program.\n  The National School Lunch Program is administered by Food and \nConsumer Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At \nthe State and local levels, the program is usually administered by the \nState education agency in cooperation with local school districts.\n  Throughout my career, I have been a strong supporter of child \nnutrition programs. We in public service have no greater responsibility \nthan to ensure the health an well-being of our Nation's children. I \npledge my commitment to continue to support the tremendously successful \nSchool Lunch Program.\n  Studies confirm and teachers readily agree, that there is a clear \nlink between sound nutrition, learning ability, and the behavior of \nchildren. The best education programs we can devise will have little \neffect if children are simply too hungry to concentrate.\n  The School Lunch Program is a vital ingredient in the recipe to \nprovide nutritious meals for America's children. For many of our \nNation's children, the meals they receive through the various nutrition \nprograms, especially the School Lunch Program, are the only nutritious \nfoods they eat all day. Over 93,000 schools and residential child care \ninstitutions participate in the National School Lunch Program. The \nprogram is available in 95 percent of all public schools, representing \n97 percent of all public school children.\n  Today, we not only celebrate the 50th anniversary of the School Lunch \nProgram but also salute the women and men who contribute to the success \nof this program. I also want to thank the American School Food Service \nAssociation and their members for providing high-quality, low-cost \nmeals to children across the country.\n  The School Lunch Program is an investment in our kids, an investment \nin our Nation's future. Happy anniversary and congratulations on a job \nwell done.\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF IVAN FRANK KARDOS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Ivan \nFrank Kardos, an attorney, formerly of Washington, DC, who died in his \nhome in Grove, OK, April 2, 1996, with his family and friends in \nattendance, after a 2\\1/2\\-year battle with cancer. He was cremated and \nhis ashes were inurned in a ceremony on May 21, 1996, at Arlington \nNational Cemetery with full military honors.\n  Mr. Kardos, born August 2, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary, was the son of \nWilliam and Olga Kovacs Kardos, who preceded him in death. The family \nemigrated to New York City when Frank was 2 years old.\n  He graduated from New York University Law School in 1948. His bar \nadmissions included New York, Maryland, District of Columbia, Oklahoma, \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d, 10th, and District of Columbia \nCircuits, U.S. district courts for the Southern District of New York, \nNorthern, Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma, and for the \nDistrict of Columbia, U.S. Courts of Military Appeals, U.S. Court of \nClaims, and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  His legal career in the public sector included service with the \nUnited States Postal Service, United States Army Corps of Engineers in \nNew York and Washington, DC, and Karachi, Pakistan. He was the \nPrincipal Deputy to the General Counsel of the U.S. Postal Service, \nresponsible for writing and administering the Department's Code of \nEthical Conduct and Conflicts of Interest Programs.\n  He was liaison with the Department of Labor for the Service Contract \nAct of 1965 and other labor requirements under Federal contracts and \nwas also liaison with the Department of Justice concerning various \ncriminal matters and the Public Information Act, and with the then \nCivil Service Commission for Inter-Agency Committee for Procurement. He \nserved as a legal advisor concerning equal opportunity employment, and \nadministered on behalf of the general counsel the Release of \nInformation Program under the Freedom of Information Act.\n  Frank's Military service began in the ROTC in 1937. He was on active \nduty with the United States Army in the armored branch when Pearl \nHarbor was bombed and served 42 months in the Southwest Pacific \ntheater, including the Philippines and New Guinea. In 1980, he retired \nfrom the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  In addition to his successful professional career in public service, \nFrank also was generous with his time in the private sector. He \nstrongly believed in giving back to society by being actively involved \nwith such organizations as SCORE, the American Legion, Masonic Bodies, \nand Literacy Programs.\n  A man of great intellect who lived his life with integrity and \nhonesty, he will be sorely missed by his family and friends. He is \nsurvived by his wife, Bettie Crumpler Kardos of Grove, OK; sons \nChristopher and his wife Sherry and their son Jonathan of Cedar Rapids, \nIA; Michael and his wife Kay of Austin, TX, Gregory and his wife Brenda \nwith their daughter Kelly and son, Scott of Farmington, NM, and \ndaughter, Pamela Kardos-Gordon and her husband, Wayne Gordon, of Upper \nMarlboro, MD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5778-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REPUBLIC OF ITALY'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 1996 marks the 50th anniversary of \nthe establishment of the Republic of Italy. Fifty years ago, Italy \nescaped the dark hold of fascism and began the process of becoming the \nimportant democratic nation it is today. Modern Italy was created out \nof the tumultuous aftermath of World War II. The system of governing \nfor the new republic received its mandate from the people of Italy, and \nit has continued in that fashion for the past 50 years. On May 9, 1946, \nVictor Emmanuel III gave up his claim to the Italian throne. On June 2, \n1946, Italians officially replaced the monarchy with a republic when \nItaly held its first free elections in 20 years. The purpose of the \nConstituent Assembly that was elected was to prepare a new democratic \nconstitution to guide a free Italy in the future. The Assembly adopted \na new constitution 1 year later. As Italy's democratic tradition has \ngrown stronger and older over the years, the nation has continued to \nexert its leadership in world affairs. Today, Italy is a respected ally \nof much of the industrialized world and a leader in many of its \norganizations. I know that my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating \nthe great strides that the Republic of Italy has made over the past 50 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5779-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING STEVE STRICKER'S 1996 KEMPER OPEN VICTORY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nEdgerton, WI, resident, Steve Stricker, on winning the 1996 Kemper \nOpen. Known to many on the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) tour \nas the best player not to have won on tour, Stricker shed that \ndistinction with his commanding 3-stroke victory at the Tournament \nPlayers Club (TPC) at Avenel in nearby Potomac, MD.\n  Stricker demonstrated the skill and confidence of a champion \nthroughout the 72-hole tournament. Whether it was a 5-foot par putt to \nmaintain his lead, or the decision to attack the par 5 sixth hole \nrather than hold back, Steve's long hours of practice and overall \ncommitment to excellence paid off, literally.\n  Steve Stricker was not alone on the damp and drizzly 7,005 yard, par \n71 course, however. Stricker's caddie, Nicki, who also happens to be \nhis wife, was there every step of the way, encouraging him to be \naggressive, yet acting as a steadying presence over any anxious moments \nduring the tournament. A competitive golfer in her own right, Nicki's \nwise counsel and experience added to the victory, making it truly a \nteam effort.\n  Those of us who have followed his short career know that this is just \nthe tip of the iceberg for Steve Stricker. With his exceptional work \nethic and dedication to making himself the best, Steve's successes have \nonly just begun. With this in mind, I congratulate Steve Stricker on \nhis 1996 Kemper Open victory and look forward to more of the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5779-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5779-S5780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, it had been my hope tonight, on behalf of \nSenator Kassebaum, to pass Senate Concurrent Resolution 63. We were \ngoing to ask that the Committee on Agriculture be discharged from \nfurther consideration of that resolution and that the Senate then \nproceed to its immediate consideration. I understand there may be an \namendment on the other side of the aisle. As I understand, the person \nwho may have the amendment is not now available.\n  Let me indicate what the resolution will do. We have been promised \nthat maybe by tomorrow morning sometime we can resolve any problem. I \nhope that is the only reason. There may be another reason that sort of \ncrosses my mind as I stand here.\n  This resolution will express the sense of Congress that the Secretary \nof Agriculture should dispose of all remaining commodities in the \ndisaster reserve maintained under the Agricultural Act of 1970 to \nrelieve the distress of livestock producers whose ability to maintain \nlivestock is adversely affected by the prolonged drought conditions \nexisting in certain areas of the United States, and for other purposes. \nThe amendment indicates that, in light of the prolonged drought \nconditions existing in certain areas of the United States, the \nSecretary of Agriculture promptly dispose of all commodities in the \ndisaster reserve maintained under section 813 of the Agricultural Act \nof 1970, 7 USC 1427 (a) to relieve the distress of livestock producers \nwhose ability to maintain livestock is adversely affected by the \nprolonged drought. And that is true.\n  In some parts of America, including my home State of Kansas, we have \nhad a long drought. In fact, in Texas, I think it is the worst drought \nthey have had, in some parts of Texas, in over 50 years.\n  So I hope we can move on this quickly. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It may be that the administration has decided to move \nwithout passage of the resolution. That will probably be known later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nWashington, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/04/senate-section/article/S5780-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
