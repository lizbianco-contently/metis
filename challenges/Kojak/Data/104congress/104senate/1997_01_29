CUOMO OF NEW YORK TO BE SECRETARY OF HOUSING \n                         AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Andrew M. \nCuomo of New York to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Melody \nFennel and David Hardiman be permitted privileges of the floor during \nconsideration of the pending nomination.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support a native New \nYorker, a fellow New Yorker, Andrew Cuomo, to be Secretary of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. I am pleased that the \nSenate Banking Committee reported Mr. Cuomo's nomination yesterday by a \nunanimous vote. I am privileged to support the confirmation of a native \nNew Yorker, particularly one who has done so much in the area of \nhousing in such a relatively short period of time. I commend Mr. Cuomo \nfor his record of public service, first as an advocate for the \nhomeless, and second in terms of his stewardship as Assistant Secretary \nfor Community Planning and Development at HUD.\n  Since 1993, the Secretary has successfully presided over an annual \nbudget of nearly $10 billion, encompassing a wide diversity of housing, \ncommunity, and economic development programs. He has shown innovation, \ninsight, and tireless efforts to serve our cities, suburbs and rural \nareas. He has done so in a way that has avoided partisanship with an \neye toward giving to many of those who would otherwise not have the \nopportunity for good, safe, affordable housing. That is his record as \nit relates to the private sector in providing transitional housing for \nthe homeless.\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\n  It is not good enough, Mr. President, to simply say, ``Let's build a \nshelter, temporary, for the homeless,'' and bring them off the streets \nand leave them in a situation that during the day, or when the weather \nis not inclement, they go back out into the community and wander around \naimlessly. We cannot then think the community has met its obligation, \nits moral and ethical responsibilities to those people--when we take \nthem back in during inclement weather but again discharge them.\n  Mr. Cuomo, as a young man in 1986, founded and served as president of \nHousing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, known as HELP. HELP is a \nprovider of housing which uses a strategy to move homeless people from \nthe streets to transitional housing with supportive services to deal \nwith the number of problems that these families may have, like drug \naddiction and alcohol addiction. HELP was a model for his approach to \nhomelessness that he utilized at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. HELP is providing assistance for over 4,000 people each \nyear.\n  His grassroots background working in communities, not coming in \nopposition and thrusting a program upon the community, but working with \nthe community and the private sector, has helped provide him with the \ninsights that I think are so necessary in order for us not to have a \ndepartment that looks down upon the cities and the States and the \ncommunities, but instead works with them in partnership.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment needs a lot of work. It needs to be improved. There are \nsome very serious problems. Indeed, unless we address those problems we \ncould face a very difficult situation with hundreds of thousands of \npeople being in a position that they are unable to live in a decent \nplace. We are now approaching a situation that has built up over the \nyears. Our section 8 program's current renewal budget is something in \nthe area of $3.4 billion. That is what we are going to spend to help \npeople who live in this section 8 assisted housing pay for the \ndifferential in terms of what they can afford to pay and what the rent \nis established at. Mr. President, 38 percent are senior citizens. That \nbudget need will rise this October from $3.4 billion to over $10 \nbillion.\n  The total HUD budget is only $20 billion. And we have an increase of \napproximately $7 billion. Where will that money come from? Are we going \nto increase? Is the administration and the Congress going to increase \nby $7 billion the HUD budget? I do not think so.\n  This is going to take innovative leadership. It is going to take a \nhusbanding and directing of resources in the way they should be \ndirected to maximize our spending. I believe it will take a more \nenlightened approach by the administration and Congress to deal with \nthe insufficiency of resources that HUD presently has.\n  I do not think it is going to be an easy job to get additional \nresources given the fact that the inspector general has indicated that \nthere are some very severe problems that exist at HUD. There are \nserious problems ahead that the new Secretary and the Congress are \ngoing to have to deal with. HUD faces a fiscal crisis. Hard choices are \ngoing to have to be made.\n  This really calls upon all of us, including the Secretary under his \nleadership, to work together to ensure that our Nation's most needy, \nparticularly our senior citizens, are not going to be jeopardized as a \nresult of this fiscal crisis that we are facing. Again that crisis is \ngoing to be upon us sooner rather than later. It will be with us this \ncoming October.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I again say that after a very thorough \nnomination hearing, and Mr. Cuomo meeting with just about every Banking \nCommittee member, the committee unanimously voted for his confirmation. \nI look forward to a successful confirmation of Andrew Cuomo so that we \ncan begin to work toward our mutual goals of improving access to \nhousing in all of our Nation's communities.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this confirmation, and I \napplaud the President for choosing Andrew Cuomo and designating him to \nbe our next Secretary of HUD.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleague, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato of New York, in strong support of the \nnomination of Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  In my judgment, Mr. Cuomo is well qualified for this position. In \naddition to his background, experience, and record of significant \nachievement, Andrew Cuomo will provide the Department with stability \nand continuity since he has been an Assistant Secretary at the \nDepartment over the past 4 years.\n  As HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community and Planning Development, \nAndrew Cuomo played a significant role in this administration's efforts \nto revitalize America's distressed communities and a significant role \nin their efforts to restructure the Department itself. In that regard, \noutgoing HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros--who I think deserves the thanks \nof all of us for the very stellar service he has given to the Nation--\nmade significant progress in addressing the management difficulties \nthat confronted the Department at the beginning of his tenure. Andrew \nCuomo was part of that team, and his familiarity with the way the \nDepartment works and the reforms now underway will provide for a smooth \ntransition that will allow this progress to move forward.\n  Mr. Cuomo's activities in the realm of housing and urban development \nprior to his joining the Department at the beginning of the first \nClinton administration demonstrated the initiative and innovation that \nhe has brought with him to the Department. He created HELP, a homeless \nassistance organization that is now the Nation's largest provider of \ntransitional housing for the homeless. He also developed the \nalternative approaches to urban revitalization and community \ndevelopment that led to the founding of the Genesis project, a program \nthat has created partnerships between State and local governments and \nthe private sector to provide affordable housing.\n\n  Mr. Cuomo has put this past experience and the vision connected \ntherewith to work over the past 4 years as HUD Assistant Secretary for \nCommunity Planning and Development. His achievements during this period \nin that office were many. This morning, I want to underscore three \nachievements, in particular, that indicate his promise as he takes on \nthe larger challenge of stewardship of the entire Department of Housing \nand Urban Development.\n  First, I want to commend Mr. Cuomo's administration of the HOME \nInvestment Partnership Program. Chairman D'Amato and former housing \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Alan Cranston, were very much involved \nin establishing the HOME program. When the Clinton administration \narrived, the relatively new HOME program was moving slowly, seemingly \nmired in regulation. Mr. Cuomo took the initiative in eliminating those \nregulations that were obstructing the program's progress. He worked \nclosely with State and local governments and the private sector--both \nfor-profit and nonprofit--to identify the features of the HOME program \nthat needed to change in order to allow the program to function better. \nThe result of his hard work is the effective housing program that HOME \nhas become today. State and local governments, in conjunction with \nprivate for-profit and private not-for-profit partners, are producing \nsignificant results using HOME funds for activities ranging from \nhousing rehabilitation to home ownership assistance.\n  Mr. Cuomo has also earned praise for his tireless work on behalf of \nthe homeless. After 4 years as Assistant Secretary, he can take the \ncredit for changing the way that our Nation's homeless programs are \nadministered at the local level. Under his leadership communities have \nnow instituted a continuum of care approach. The continuum of care is a \nphrase that Andrew Cuomo coined for a comprehensive system of \nassistance that provides prevention, outreach and screening, emergency \nshelters, transitional and supportive housing, and permanent housing \nwith services to the homeless where needed. I have seen the \neffectiveness of the service delivery that comes\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\nwith the local planning and coordination that are at the core of the \ncontinuum of care approach. Andrew Cuomo has made these happen.\n  Third, Mr. Cuomo deserves recognition for his direction of the HUD \nprograms that assist local economic development. He has worked hard to \nmake the Community Development Block Grant Program a more effective \ntool for local communities pursuing new economic development \nopportunities. He has also expanded the section 108 loan guarantee \nprogram, greatly improving that program's use by local government. And, \nhe has served ably as the principal Federal official charged with the \nimplementation of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community \nPrograms. All of these activities will become increasingly important as \nthe Nation struggles with its commitment to move families from welfare \nto work.\n  Andrew Cuomo reiterated his commitment to his role as HUD Secretary \nin his statement before the Banking Committee last week, and I quote \nhim:\n\n       Our goal must be to create a future unlike any that has \n     come before--a future open to all--in which no person is left \n     behind and in which no community is forgotten. A future in \n     which everyone willing to do his or her part will be \n     empowered with the tools to reach as high as their talents \n     and hard work will take them.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear why President Clinton has selected Andrew \nCuomo as the next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nvery fine nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut whatever time \nhe may require.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Andrew Cuomo for the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  Those of us who have worked closely with Andrew Cuomo over the years, \nand have witnessed his remarkable range of skills, know that he will \nbecome an outstanding leader for the Department. He has a remarkable \nrecord of achievement in both the public and private sectors.\n  I commend President Clinton for selecting him to help our communities \nprepare for the next century.\n  For a number of years, Andrew Cuomo worked on the frontlines of \ncommunity development. Although he could have lived a comfortable life \nas a partner at an established law firm, he answered the call to public \nservice. In 1986, he started an organization called HELP, that worked \nto improve the lives of homeless people.\n  Under his leadership, HELP grew to 500 employees, and used its $30 \nmillion annual budget to build more than 120 million dollars worth of \nhousing and help thousands of homeless people move off the streets.\n  While developing HELP, Andrew Cuomo realized that it was not enough \nto simply build housing. Although shelter was a key part of the formula \nfor success, homeless people could not move to productive lives without \nadditional support. Consequently, HELP also provided opportunities \ndesigned to make the homeless self-sufficient, including substance \nabuse treatment, mental health care, job training, education, and child \ncare.\n  This experience at the local level, the hands-on effort to build \nhousing and transform lives, gave Andrew Cuomo invaluable experience. \nHe met a payroll. He dealt with Government bureaucracies. And he \nlearned that public-private partnerships will only work if everyone \nperforms efficiently.\n  Andrew Cuomo brought those lessons to HUD, when he was confirmed as \nAssistant Secretary of Community Planning and Development in 1993. His \nconsolidated planning effort merged 12 bureaucratic processes into a \nstreamlined system.\n  This system reduced paperwork and redtape. Now communities can use \nGovernment programs more effectively. We need more efforts like this--\nwhere the Federal Government is not the problem, but part of the \nsolution.\n  Additionally, Andrew Cuomo helped make HUD's homeless programs work \nbetter. With the knowledge gained from his experience at HELP, he \nimplemented a new continuum of care strategy. This strategy addresses \neach part of the homeless problem--from the emergency situation where \nsomeone is sleeping on the street, to the drug and alcohol problems \nthat must be treated when a person is in transitional housing, to the \nfinal job-training efforts that are necessary to help someone become a \nproductive and member of society.\n  This comprehensive approach to complex problems will be critical in \nthe years ahead. Welfare reform will have a dramatic effect on cities \nacross this country. We must all work to ensure that efforts to solve \none problem do not create new problems.\n  In the years ahead, we must do much more to rebuild our cities. Too \nmany families are trapped by poverty and despair. We have to free their \ntalents with better educational and job-training opportunities. And \nmost importantly, we must help people find work, because a good-paying \njob--and the respect and self-esteem that come with it--provides the \nfoundation for a better life.\n  Andrew Cuomo's dedicated efforts to expand economic opportunity will \nplay a critical role in helping to meet this challenge. At HUD, he \nhelped strengthen job creation tools, including the Economic \nDevelopment Initiative which provides low-interest loans to cities. \nWith these tools, communities have leveraged over $8 billion from \nprivate sources, and helped put thousands of Americans to work.\n  In short, Andrew Cuomo offers the talent, dedication, and leadership \nthat HUD needs to help communities meet the challenges of the next \ncentury.\n  During the Banking Committee hearing on his nomination, he \ndemonstrated a keen understanding of the problems facing HUD, including \nstaffing issues, expiring section 8 contracts, and the need to \nrevitalize our cities. I am confident he will be an outstanding \nSecretary, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Before closing, I would also like to commend the outgoing Secretary, \nHenry Cisneros, for his outstanding work. When he took the reins back \nin 1993, the future of HUD looked bleak. The Department was still \nstruggling to recover from years of corruption, mismanagement, and low \nmorale. The turnaround has been remarkable.\n  Under the leadership of Secretary Cisneros, HUD is now a stronger \npartner in the national effort to build better communities. With a \nsmaller work force, HUD is running more efficiently. Around the \ncountry, people are regaining confidence in the department.\n  The changes in public housing are a good example of the changes. \nEvery Member of this body knows how badly conditions had deteriorated \nin some public housing developments.\n  I have been through too many buildings that were covered with \ngraffiti, where the ceilings and walls were falling apart, and where \nfamilies were afraid to go out after dark because gangs controlled the \nneighborhood.\n  Secretary Cisneros saw this national disgrace, and took action. HUD \nis well on its way to tearing down 100,000 units of decayed and \ndangerous housing. Working with the resilient residents who want to \nbuild a better neighborhood, he has brought not only better living \nconditions, but a sense of hope to families across this Nation.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, these efforts are helping to \ntransform urban neighborhoods. At the Charter Oak Terrace development \nin Hartford, residents will soon have better housing, educational \nprograms, and job opportunities. In New Haven, the redevelopment of the \nElm Haven apartments will also help lift families out of poverty.\n  Working together, Henry Cisneros and Andrew Cuomo have already \naccomplished a great deal. With that experience, Andrew Cuomo will hit \nthe ground running and build upon that record of success. I look \nforward to working with him in the years ahead.\n  Let me say in summation for those of us who have worked with and \nknown Andrew Cuomo, this is going to be a\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nvery fine appointment. He understands the agency now, having been there \nfor 3 years in a major capacity. He knows the personnel. He has \ndemonstrated abilities, as I mentioned, in developing the kind of \nefficiencies in HUD that are absolutely critical.\n  My hope is that the housing issues and related subject matters will \nonce again become what they were initially, and that is a bipartisan \nsubject. When housing initiatives were identified and supported back in \nthe late 1940's, it was through the efforts of Republicans and \nDemocrats who said that decent, affordable shelter ought not to be \nsomething that divides people based on politics or party. I think it is \nvitally important we get back to that.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity, in my view, with the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator D'Amato, and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, \nwho understand these issues, and a very fine staff that wants to work \non them. The fact that Andrew Cuomo comes from New York, the home State \nof the chairman of the committee, can only strengthen the excellent \nrelationship between the Senate Banking Committee and HUD. I look \nforward to a new era of cooperation and bipartisanship in seeing to it \nthat decent, affordable shelter and economic development are given the \nattention they deserve.\n  With that in mind, I am delighted to join my colleague from New York \nand my colleague from Maryland and others in strongly endorsing the \nnomination of Andrew Cuomo to be the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to stress my unambiguous \nsupport for President Clinton's nomination of Andrew Cuomo to serve as \nthe next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  In my opinion, Mr. Cuomo has the potential to be one of the strongest \nHUD Secretaries in the agency's 30 years of existence. Not only does \nAndrew Cuomo bring strong and relevant skills to this job, but Mr. \nCuomo will inherit an agency that is moving in the right direction.\n  HUD is in much better shape than the agency was in when Henry \nCisneros arrived. HUD had suffered greatly during the 1980's from \nmismanagement and scandal. Secretary Cisneros applied his boundless \nenergy and unique vision to a very difficult task. Those who oppose \nHUD's important mission tried to use the management difficulties at HUD \nas an excuse for eliminating the agency. The success of Secretary \nCisneros' stewardship has deflated calls for HUD's elimination and has \ninstead changed the national conversation about HUD and housing policy.\n  In this new conversation on housing programs, we can talk about the \ntransformation of public housing. You can easily witness this \ntransformation at many sites across the country. In my state, you can \nsee public housing changing at the Orchard Park redevelopment site in \nBoston and at the Jackson Parkway HOPE VI site in Holyoke, MA. These \nHOPE VI sites have become the lifeblood for thousands of people and \nwhole communities.\n  We can also talk about HUD's positive role as a partner with our \nStates and cities: In Massachusetts, HUD is a partner with the State \nhousing agency in a property disposition demonstration. In the \nneighborhoods of Roxbury and Allston-Brighton, HUD is a partner with \nthe city and the nonprofit community development corporations using \nCDBG and HOME funds to revitalize distressed neighborhoods.\n  And, we are able to change the way we talk about cities: Violent \ncrimes in the Nation's 50 largest cities have declined by an average of \n13 percent, unemployment has been cut by 3.1 percent in the past 4 \nyears, and home ownership has expanded with nearly 700,000 central city \nresidents having become homeowners since 1990.\n  Andrew Cuomo has played an important role in these changes. He has \nhelped to change this agency and its role in America's communities. \nAnd, because he has been a major player at HUD over the last 4 years, \nhe will be able to capitalize on the progress that he and his \npredecessor have made.\n  We can be confident that Andrew Cuomo will be successful over the \nnext 4 years because he has been extremely successful over the last 4. \nMr. Cuomo has directed the empowerment zone and enterprise community \nprograms for the Federal Government, he has made major changes in the \nadministration of HUD's homeless assistance programs, he has nurtured \nand supported the highly successful YouthBuild Program, and he has \nexpanded and improved upon the role that HUD plays in assisting the \neconomic development of distressed communities. He has already made a \nmajor mark. He is well prepared to take over the reins at HUD.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate my strong support for \nthis nominee. Most importantly, he comes from one of the major urban \ncenters in the country and from a tradition of paying attention to and \nassisting our communities. Over the course of the next few years, HUD \ncould face some very tough choices and we need to understand what the \nconsequences of those choices will be. Andrew Cuomo is wholly qualified \nto meet the challenges that he will face. As the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee with primary responsibility for HUD and its programs, I \npledge to do all that I can to aid Mr. Cuomo in succeeding as HUD \nSecretary. I look forward to working with him over the next 4 years to \nrestore the agency, reinforce its mission, preserve affordable housing, \nand make significant progress in meeting the housing needs of our \npeople and in revitalizing our distressed communities.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I offer today my strong support for the \nconfirmation of Andrew Cuomo as the new Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  I want my colleagues to know that Mr. Cuomo is a proven leader in the \nhousing and community development field. For the past 4 years, he has \nserved as the assistant secretary for HUD's Office of Community \nPlanning and Development. While managing a $10 billion portfolio that \nhas doubled over the last 4 years, he helped reduce administrative \noverhead by 20 percent--helping us to get more bang for the taxpayers \nbuck. Mr. Cuomo's efforts in merging 12 bureaucratic processes into one \nstreamlined system known as consolidated planning won him the \nInnovations in American Government award for 1996 from Harvard \nUniversity's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His goal of \nstreamlining, decentralizing, and consolidating programs is one that I \nhave advocated for years as chairman and ranking member of the VA, HUD \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Many of Mr. \nCuomo's initiatives were based on the recommendations made by the \nNational Academy of Public Administration in a report that I \ncommissioned as chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. Cuomo has also overseen the implementation of the Empowerment \nZone and Enterprise Community Initiative, which has combined local \ncommunity planning with Federal dollars to help produce new jobs and \nhousing in 72 cities. He also created a new economic development \ninitiative which worked in conjunction with a loan guarantee program to \nprovide $1.85 billion in much needed low-interest loans for cities in \n1995, up from $229 million in 1993. Mr. Cuomo's work on implementing \nthe continuum of care strategy to help the homeless has led to 14 times \nas many homeless people being served with only twice the funding. In \naddition, his emphasis on coordination of services and resources has \ngenerated 30 times more private and nonprofit dollars since 1992. His \nfocus on real results instead of simplistic statistical compilations of \nprogram activity is one which I share and strongly commend.\n  Mr. Cuomo's service in the field dates back to his founding in 1986 \nof HELP--Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged, which grew to \nbecome the Nation's largest provider of transitional housing for the \nhomeless. Mr. Cuomo also founded the Genesis project--which develops \ncomprehensive approaches to linking community development with \naffordable housing. His experiences on the front lines of the battle \nagainst urban poverty and despair help him to make practical decisions \nthat work in the real world.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Mr. Cuomo on making the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development a more effective and \nefficient agency. There are major issues that the Department and the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nmust address this year. We must continue to work to find solutions to \nthe problem of the over-subsidized Section 8 assisted housing \ninventory. I will continue to insist that we don't create an additional \nburden for the taxpayers, and that we find a solution that does not \nlead to community destabilization.\n  Mr. President, we must also work with Mr. Cuomo to ensure that HUD \nmaintains proper oversight and standards for local public housing \nauthorities. HUD must stand sentry and ensure that local public housing \nauthorities are providing real opportunities--not hollow \nopportunities--and ensuring adequate housing for the poor citizens of \nour Nation. I want to work with Mr. Cuomo on ending what I call the zip \ncodes of pathology that have resulted from the programs of the past. We \nhave repealed--in our annual appropriations bills--the Federal \npreferences that concentrated the poorest of the poor in one area. I \nwill work with Mr. Cuomo and my colleagues on the Banking Committee to \nmake these repeals permanent, in addition to the repeal of such Federal \nrequirements as one-for-one replacement, take-one-take-all, and endless \nleases.\n  Mr. President, there is much work to be done at HUD. We must continue \nto streamline the agency, demolish the worst public housing, and \ndeliver programs that focus on personal and community empowerment. I \nwas pleased to see in Mr. Cuomo's testimony before the Senate Banking \nCommittee on January 22, 1997, he noted that ``the object of our \nefforts must be the development of self-sufficiency, not the \nperpetuation of government programs.'' Indeed, the days of a bloated \nbureaucracy with a focus only on bricks and mortar are gone. We must \ncombine local sweat equity and public-private partnerships with Federal \ndollars to help rebuild the social fabric of our deteriorating \ncommunities. I look forward to working with Mr. Cuomo to make HUD a \nmodel agency that makes a real difference in the lives of the people it \nserves. I will support his efforts to make HUD smarter, smaller and \nbetter. I am certain he is up to the task.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe Andrew M. Cuomo has the \npotential to be our Nation's finest Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I am impressed with his understanding of our Nation's \nbudget situation, and I am equally impressed with his commitment to \nmeeting the housing challenges of needy Americans.\n  Andrew Cuomo impressed the Senate Banking Committee with his \nunderstanding of the section 8 crisis that is upon us. Section 8 is the \nprogram by which HUD provides landlords with the necessary subsidies to \nallow them to rent their property to low-income Americans. A typical \nsection 8 HUD payment will make up the difference between the actual \nmarket rent and the ability of the renter to pay. Thus, landlords \ncontinue to provide private housing stock to needy Americans. Because \nmany of the 20-year contracts for section 8 housing are expiring, new \nFederal commitments of $16.4 billion are needed by the year 2002. \nContinuing this basic HUD program will require careful balancing to \navoid crowding out other needed housing and community development \nprograms.\n  I have personally worked with Mr. Cuomo in his valiant efforts to \nincrease funding for housing the homeless while streamlining the many \nHUD homeless programs. Together, and with the able guidance of the \nSenate Banking Committee chairman, Senator D'Amato, we have \nconsolidated them into fewer grants with greater and more reliable \nimpact on the very tough problems of homeless Americans.\n  A little known HUD section 811 program for the disabled has come a \nlong way under Mr. Cuomo's direction. HUD makes better housing \navailable for the mentally ill and mentally retarded at reasonable \ncosts, so that a handicapped person living on supplemental security \nincome and Medicaid can afford to try more independent living. More \ngroup homes have been started to give these disabled Americans a \nfighting chance at independent living. I am confident that Secretary \nCuomo will not abandon the mentally ill or the homeless when he makes \nhis hard budget choices in the next few critical years.\n  Andrew Cuomo is the founder of the largest provider of homeless \nservices in the Nation. He did this in his native State of New York. \nThere he learned first hand the true value of federal housing \nassistance as well as its limitations and frustrations. Now he will \nlead the nation's efforts to help others like himself do the best \npossible for those most in need of temporary and permanent housing.\n  Before he left his widely respected HELP nonprofit in New York, \nAndrew Cuomo had built an organization with 350 employees, a $25 \nmillion budget, and more then $120 million worth of needed and \naffordable housing. While serving as HUD Assistant Secretary for \nCommunity Planning and Development, Andrew Cuomo got the Empowerment \nZone and Enterprise Community Programs up and running after a stiff \nnational competition to select participating towns and cities in urban \nand rural America.\n  Under his leadership, the fledgling HOME affordable housing program \nincreased its achievements from less than 2,000 units of affordable \nhousing to over 110,000 units across America. Andrew Cuomo created the \nHUD Economic Development Initiative, now seen by mayors as their most \nflexible economic development tool for revitalizing poor communities \nthrough a unique combination of HUD resources.\n  As he said in his confirmation hearing, HUD can be a vital partner \nwith State and local government by being ``smarter, smaller, and \nbetter.'' He has a keen eye for the projects that can attract private \nsector support. He understands the support HUD can give these projects \nin revitalization efforts in our inner cities and in rural towns.\n  I was very impressed with his observation that ``the pride and \ndignity of having a job and earning one's own bread is the best social \nservices program that exists.''\n  Mr. President and Senate colleagues, I highly recommend Andrew M. \nCuomo for the important job of Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I urge you to vote in favor of his confirmation today. If \nyou vote to confirm Mr. Cuomo, you will be doing a great service to the \nmillions of Americans whose lives will be touched by his active and \ncreative leadership.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination \nof Assistant Secretary Andrew Cuomo to be the next Secretary of the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and I look forward to \nhis confirmation by the Senate today.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I had the pleasure of \nparticipating in Mr. Cuomo's confirmation hearing. I continue to be \nimpressed by Mr. Cuomo's commitment to expanding housing opportunities \nfor the people of this Nation and to cutting the bureaucracy which too \noften hinders such efforts.\n  When Congress passed the Public Housing Act of 1937, the findings \nstated, ``It is the policy of the United States to promote the general \nwelfare of the Nation by employing its funds and credit * * * to remedy \nthe unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of \ndecent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower income * * \n*'' In other words, it is in the Nation's best interest to invest in \nhousing for the American people.\n  In both word and deed, Andrew Cuomo has demonstrated that he believes \nin the goals of the 1937 act. From his work founding HELP, the Nation's \nlargest nonprofit provider of transitional housing for the homeless, to \nhis efforts as Assistant Secretary for the Office of Community Planning \nand Development at HUD, Secretary-designate Cuomo's commitment to \nexpanding housing opportunities for all Americans is clear.\n  His work was recognized by former New York City Mayor David Dinkins \nwho named Andrew Cuomo chairman of the New York City Commission on the \nHomeless. The commission's report, ``The Way Home: A New Direction in \nSocial Policy,'' suggested a continuum of care policy that was adopted \nby the mayor and has been recognized nationally as a model for ending \nhomelessness.\n  One of the reasons that I am particularly pleased to be supporting \nthis nominee today is that his approach to expanding housing \nopportunities is multifaceted. When we talk about housing, we are, in \nreality, talking about community. The home is the building block of the \ncommunity which in turn is the building block of the Nation.\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n  In order to build community, it is foolish to ignore the availability \nof capital, the presence or lack of jobs, the wealth or poverty of the \nresidents, or the ability of people to pay their own way, now or in the \nfuture.\n  Andrew Cuomo understands that people often need not only a home, but \na job to pay for that home. And he understands the fundamental role of \npublic/private partnerships in providing access to both.\n  Under his tenure as Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and \nDevelopment, there has been an increase in the amount of investment \navailable for job creation, business expansion, and capital access for \ncities, a more effective strategy for reducing homelessness, and the \nimplementation of the important empowerment zone/enterprise community \ninitiatives.\n  Any new Secretary of HUD will face enormous challenges, not the least \nof which will be how to effectively streamline and improve the HUD \nbureaucracy. Good ideas and sound efforts are often prevented from \nsucceeding because the costs of the bureaucracy are too great. \nEfficiency and economic savings must go hand-in-hand with vision and \nhard work. I am confident that Andrew Cuomo is the right person to \naddress this set of problems.\n  I look forward to the rapid confirmation of Andrew Cuomo to be the \nSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  I support his confirmation and look forward to working with him to \ntackle the challenges facing America's communities at the end of the \n20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to \ncast my vote today in support of the nomination of Andrew Cuomo for \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development. Given the opportunity to \nchoose a replacement for outgoing Secretary Henry Cisneros, I would be \nhard pressed to find a better candidate.\n  Andrew Cuomo has spent his life helping low-income families find \nanswers to housing problems. His work to combat homelessness in New \nYork and most recently at the Department has helped to take countless \nneedy people off of the streets and put them back on their feet. His \ninnovative continuum of care initiative provided the impetus for \nVermont and other States to bring together housing and service \nproviders and develop a comprehensive plan for dealing with \nhomelessness. This approach has ensured that the Department's \nhomelessness programs get the most bang-for-the-buck, and should serve \nas a model for other Federal programs.\n  That Yankee knack for cost cutting will serve him well in his new \nposition. When I look at the funding problems ahead for the section 8 \nhousing program and the uncertain impact of welfare reform on the cost \nof HUD rental assistance programs, I don't know whether to congratulate \nAndrew Cuomo on his promotion or offer my sympathies. However, I do \nknow that outgoing Secretary Cisneros is leaving the Department in good \nhands, and I look forward to working with Secretary Cuomo in the years \nahead to address these and other problems facing our Nation's housing \nprograms.\n  Andrew Cuomo had nationwide responsibilities which he exercised with \ngreat skill. In Vermont we look at the people who turned to him for \nhelp in my home city of Burlington. He listened. He helped. Today their \nlife is better because of him.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased about President \nClinton's nomination of Andrew Cuomo for Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, and am delighted to support this \nnomination.\n  Secretary-designate Cuomo's accomplishments in the private sector and \nas Assistant Secretary of HUD's Office of Community Planning and \nDevelopment are numerous. Housing assistance systems developed by \nAndrew Cuomo have served as model systems, achieving success all across \nthis Nation.\n  At his hearing last week, Secretary-designate Cuomo showed his \nknowledge, not only of the management problems within HUD, but of the \nsubstantive programs as well. Moreover, Secretary-designate Cuomo \nexpressed his vision for HUD with a refreshing realism. He understands \nHUD's mission, and the limited discretionary spending to achieve the \ngoals of providing housing assistance in this country.\n  The issues I am primarily concerned about working on were clearly \nunderstood by the Secretary-designate. California faces the brunt of \nthe burden with regard to section 8 renewals, preservation, and the \nimpact of welfare reform on housing. Another issue I will continue to \ntry and resolve with HUD and the Veterans' Administration is \nhomelessness among veterans who fought this country's wars.\n  I believe Andrew Cuomo is distinctly qualified to be Secretary of \nHUD. The Secretary-designate has been with HUD in a leadership capacity \nsince 1993. He worked closely with outgoing Secretary Henry Cisneros \nand understands the complex matrix that makes up HUD's existing \nprograms. From his background, experience, and responses at his \nnomination hearing last week, Mr. Cuomo has shown he understands what \nit will take to improve upon that matrix.\n  Americans all across this Nation, in both urban and rural areas, can \nexpect changes positively affecting housing assistance. Again, I fully \nsupport Mr. Cuomo's nomination as Secretary of HUD.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield back any time that we might have, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield back any time remaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Andrew M. Cuomo, to be Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development?

Mr. President, shortly before closing his office, our dear \nformer colleague, Howell Heflin, asked that I insert in the \nCongressional Record a speech made by Greg Reed, national commander of \nthe Disabled American Veterans, at a banquet held in Birmingham the day \nbefore Veterans Day.\n  I would agree with Senator Heflin that Mr. Reed's speech is an \nexcellent one, and I would ask for unanimous consent that his remarks \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      A Grateful Nation Remembers\n\n                         (Remarks by Greg Reed)\n\n       Each year Americans give pause on Veterans Day to remember \n     and honor the millions of men and women who have donned the \n     uniforms of our great Nation in defense of freedom and \n     democracy. It is a time set aside for our Nation to recognize \n     the vanguard of freedom--American's veterans.\n       Our national tradition of honoring American veterans on a \n     special day began one year after World War I ended.\n       On November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed \n     that each November 11 was to be commemorated as ``Armistice \n     Day,'' a day of remembrance to honor the 116,000 American \n     ``doughboys,'' who, in World War I, died on the battlefields \n     of Europe.\n       The Great War--that's what we called World War I. \n     Sometimes, in our idealism, we called it ``the war to end all \n     wars.'' Of course, we could not know that just two decades \n     later another war would engulf the world.\n       World War II would claim four times as many American lives \n     as World War I. When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, the \n     world entered a holocaust unparalleled in world history.\n       Never before had war been waged by so many people, over so \n     much of the globe, with such loss of life and destruction of \n     property.\n       Although, 90 million troops from both sides took part in \n     the war; 17 million of them--nearly one out of five--were \n     consumed by it.\n       Another 18 million--civilians--died as a direct result of \n     it. We'll never know the precise total of soldiers and \n     civilians wounded and missing.\n       America mustered more than 16 million troops to battle on \n     many fronts. When the war ended in 1945, more than 400,000 of \n     them had lost their lives.\n       Within five short years, our nation's men and women would \n     be summoned to answer the threat in a place deceptively known \n     as the ``Land of the Morning Calm.''\n       Before the Korean War came to a close with an uneasy truce \n     in 1953, nearly 35,000 Americans died, and more than 100,000 \n     were wounded.\n       In 1954, Armistice Day was redesignated ``Veterans Day.''\n       First conceived to recognize those veterans who had died in \n     World War I, the observance now was given a broader scope: to \n     honor all American veterans in whatever war or period of \n     peace they served.\n       For they were, and are, made of the same stuff. They were, \n     and are, equally passionate in their patriotism and love of \n     liberty.\n       We could not enjoy our freedom today were it not for the \n     courage of those who defended us when we needed defending.\n       In the time of Vietnam, we had heroes and didn't see them. \n     A million Americans soldiered there, and more than 58,000 of \n     them died, some bravely, some just unluckily, all in the \n     service of their country.\n       Neither the passage of time nor the vantage point of \n     historical perspective has provided this country with answers \n     about Vietnam or its veterans.\n       The sense of being alone may be the hallmark of the Vietnam \n     experience--and it is taking many years to heal the social \n     wounds inflicted by that war.\n       William Broyles, Jr., a former editor-in-chief of Newsweek \n     and a Marine infantry officer in Vietnam, once said.\n       ``The war in Vietnam divided America, most of all by \n     driving a wedge between those who went and those who didn't. \n     Vietnam divided us and troubles us still, not only in the \n     hearts and minds of veterans and their families, but in our \n     crippled self-confidence. It is a specter we have yet put to \n     rest, a wound in need of healing.''\n       For many of our fellow veterans the Vietnam war is still a \n     terrible burden. There are too many unanswered questions \n     about the delayed time bombs in their bodies and minds, too \n     many unfulfilled promises about their education and their \n     employment.\n       We owe them more than that. It is past time to remember the \n     extraordinary service of these ordinary Americans.\n       When their country called, they answered, and they fought \n     with all of the courage and valor of any army this nation \n     ever sent into battle.\n       The men and women who served in the Gulf War paid another \n     installment on a great debt that will never be erased so long \n     as there are blood-bent tyrants in the world.\n       And, like their predecessors at Gettysburg, Normandy, \n     Guadalcanal, Inchon or Khe Sanh, they paid in time . . . in \n     effort . . . and in blood.\n       Veterans Day commemorates the courage and patriotism of all \n     of America's veterans who have contributed so much to the \n     cause of world peace and the preservation of our way of life.\n       This is our day to honor those veterans sacrificed in those \n     struggles and pay our respects to those who survived their \n     fallen comrades.\n       It is a day to celebrate the bright victories that grew \n     from dark battles.\n       It is a day to review memories of past honor and sacrifice.\n       It is a day to dream of a brighter future.\n       It is a day to celebrate peace.\n       We can never say it too often: We are the children of your \n     sacrifice, and we are grateful.\n       General Douglas MacArthur spoke of the American soldier as \n     ``one of the world's noblest figures.''\n       Yet what sets apart the veterans we honor today? How do we \n     identify them?\n       In truth, our veterans are the very embodiment of America \n     itself. They reflect the diversity and strength that is the \n     core of our nation.\n       Veterans are white . . . and they are black; they are of \n     every race and ethnic heritage. They are men, and they are \n     women. They are Christians, they are Muslims, they are Jews.\n       They're your neighbor next door, the merchant at the mall, \n     and the police officer on the corner.\n       They are doctors and farmers, they are factory workers and \n     schoolteachers.\n       They are 26 million Americans living today who served in \n     the armed forces, and there are more than one million who \n     have died in America's wars.\n       Most of these veterans are unsung heroes, ordinary citizens \n     who did their duty. Their deeds have never been chronicled.\n       Those veterans who returned home after World War II, and \n     those who did not, were all part of a generation from which \n     we take inspiration.\n       They won the war, and then made sure we would not lose the \n     peace. Without their subordination of self to the common \n     good, our world would be radically different.\n       The tradition of the World War II veteran is the tradition \n     of all American veterans.\n       From Lexington to Concord, that tradition has sustained us \n     in every battle and every war, right up through Desert Storm.\n       It has marched with us and stood vigil in the frozen camps \n     of Valley Forge, the steaming jungles of the Pacific rim, the \n     bloody beaches of Normandy, the rice paddies of Korea and \n     Vietnam, and the scorching sands of the Persian Gulf.\n       In that tradition, young, inexperienced Americans become \n     tough, capable soldiers. They become veterans.\n       And they remind us all that this great nation was not \n     established by cowards, nor will cowards preserve it.\n       America will remain the land of the free only so long as it \n     is the home of the brave.\n       What we remember and honor on Veterans Day are those brave \n     men and women who believed so much in an idea, and were so \n     possessed by a sense of duty and honor, that they were \n     willing to risk death for it. And the idea, of course, is \n     liberty.\n       Liberty is America's core. It is central to our being, not \n     only because it is practical and beneficial, but because it \n     is morally just and right. But that liberty can be retained \n     only by the eternal vigilance that has always been its price.\n       Americans hate war and its destructiveness. Our history \n     reveals a passion to explore, to build, to renew, not to \n     destroy.\n       The American spirit is not driven toward the domination of \n     others.\n       Never has the American soldier been sent overseas to fight \n     in the cause of conquest.\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\n       Not once did they come home claiming a single square inch \n     of some other country as a trophy of war.\n       The only land abroad we occupy is beneath the graves where \n     our heroes rest.\n       The American spirit understands that free people who \n     respect the dignity of the individual do not wage war upon \n     their neighbors.\n       The American spirit has a warm heart that yearns for mutual \n     understanding and peace among nations of the world.\n       And as deeply as we cherish our beliefs, we do not seek to \n     compel others to share them.\n       It is one of the great attributes of this nation that we \n     have been willing to take up the mantle to fight for freedom \n     on behalf of others.\n       Even as I stand before you today, American forces are once \n     again in harm's way--standing watch in Bosnia as that nation \n     struggles toward peace.\n       And why are we there? Because the American spirit is \n     committed to protect and preserve our friends from \n     suppression in a turbulent world.\n       We have come to realize that we are, indeed, our brothers' \n     keepers.\n       Just in the last decade, our world has undergone a massive \n     realignment.\n       The Soviet empire has dissolved, and the major threat to \n     world peace removed.\n       We live in a moment of hope, in a nation at peace. For the \n     first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, no Russian \n     missiles are pointed at our children.\n       Our economy is sound. And because free markets and \n     democracy now are on the march throughout the world, more \n     people than ever before have the opportunity to reach their \n     God-given potential.\n       But our work is far from done. We must contain the world's \n     most deadly weapons, extend the reach of democracy, and unite \n     in opposing crimes against humanity.\n       We must keep our arms ready and our alliances strong \n     because challenges of the future won't be any easier than \n     those of the past.\n       As the American patriot Thomas Paine said:\n       ``Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must . \n     . . undergo the fatigue of supporting it . . . What we obtain \n     too cheap, we esteem too lightly.''\n       Let it never be said that we Americans esteem too lightly \n     our blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       America can never fully repay her veterans, and we will \n     never be able to express our feelings to our fallen soldiers. \n     If there is a crown in heaven, then they are the stars.\n       But we must never forget how blessed we are in the modern \n     world to live in a free society, nor forget the sacrifices of \n     our friends, relatives, neighbors and countrymen who served \n     us all when duty called.\n       Our veterans did not disappoint their nation when it needed \n     their service. They, in turn, should not be disappointed in \n     their times of need.\n       Our duty today is clear, for there are many who need us. \n     Yet, even as America remembers Veterans Day, there are \n     veterans who do seem forgotten.\n       Yes, some of the very ones who survived the atrocities of \n     Bataan; stormed the beaches at Guadalcanal and Normandy; and \n     fought in other campaigns of World War II.\n       Since then, their numbers have swelled from those who \n     fought in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, \n     Bosnia and in numerous other conflicts.\n       There are veterans who have lost family and friends, and \n     who face a lonely future. Many are homeless and in need of \n     medical care.\n       They struggle with war related disabilities.\n       They also struggle with bureaucratic red tape to get the \n     benefits and health care they need.\n       The belief that sustained our troops in combat was as great \n     as America herself.\n       Their heroism was prompted by faith in the fundamentals \n     that have guided this nation from its beginnings--the idea \n     that liberty must be protected, whatever the cost.\n       We must nurture and sustain those who distinguished their \n     lives in the defense of freedom. We must provide a dignity \n     befitting heroes . . . whatever the cost.\n       This Veterans Day we should remember our history as we \n     prepare for our future, pray for peace as the poets and \n     dreamers do, and on this day each year remember to be \n     vigilant against threats to democracy and, most importantly, \n     ratify our contract with American veterans.\n       We know that if the world is faced with the unfortunate \n     occurrence of war, American men and women will be there to \n     meet the challenges, defend our nation, and work toward \n     peace.\n       America can and will change, both today and in the future. \n     However, what must not change--not today, not tomorrow, not \n     ever--is our recognition of the debt we owe to America's \n     veterans for keeping the American way of life safe and free.\n       God bless America, and God bless those who love, guard and \n     defend our precious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S785-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S786-S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO EMBRY-RIDDLE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, time magazine once referred to Embry-Riddle \nAeronautical University as The Harvard of the Sky, a designation truly \nhonoring both institutions. I say this because unsurpassed standards, \nvalues and public contributions constantly are reflected in \nachievements by those representing both schools.\n  On this occasion, however, my remarks are about Embry-Riddle, for it \nabsolutely is one of our Nation's most intriguing centers of higher \nlearning.\n  Recently, the New York Times featured the selection of Embry-Riddle \nfor English and operational proficiency training of China's air traffic \ncontrollers.\n  ValuJet's crash in the Florida Everglades last May prompted the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to name ERU alumnus, Greg Feith, \nas investigator-in-charge. The university's aviation safety role, \nthrough an extensive curriculum, real-situation training laboratories, \nresearch and issue guidance is unparalleled. Air Force Capt. Scott \nO'Grady's amazing survival in Bosnia had as a postscript: ERU graduate. \nSo it is with White House Fellow, David A. Moore.\n  Although ERU graduates hold key positions throughout business and \ncommerce, we find this especially prevalent among airlines and the \naerospace and aircraft industry. Some are astronauts. NASA's Lt. Comdr. \nSusan Leigh Still, USN, who received her bachelor of science degree, is \nscheduled for a mission in space this spring.\n  The school is a major contributor of pilots to military and civilian \naviation for two reasons. One is the level of academics in engineering, \naerospace science, aviation and related disciplines. The other is due \nto ERU's own air fleet, its own flight instruction, its own meteorology \ntraining, and its own aircraft and engine student maintenance programs. \nUnder the critical eyes of certified instructors, undergraduates \nperform all engine and airframe maintenance. I understand there never \nhas been a safety incident attributable to their work.\n  By invitation of the U.S. Army in Europe, Embry-Riddle now offers \ncollege classes to our servicemen deployed north of Croatia in support \nof Operation Joint Endeavor. This newest service adds to the \nuniversity's extensive network of more than 100 education centers \nthroughout the United States and Europe.\n  A late December item from the Kiplinger Washington Letter refers to \nglobal companies relying on associates who work in team settings or \nsituations. Embry-Riddle student assignments routinely involve team \ninvolvement. They take it a step further--through distance learning.\n  For a particular assignment we might find one student in Daytona \nBeach serving with another located at the university's Prescott, AZ, \ncampus, while a third comes from an extended campus overseas. A \nsophisticated networking system allows students to connect \nelectronically with other institutions and class members around the \nworld. In addition, identical courses are taught concurrently by a \nsingle instructor from either the Daytona or Prescott campuses as \nstudents from both locations interact.\n\n  ERU is ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top 20 \nundergraduate engineering programs in our Nation. It has the largest \nengineering-physics program in America. Undergraduates last year won \nthe national design competition for general aviation, an intensely \nchallenging venture sponsored by NASA and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  Quite often we hear the term, ``student-athlete.'' At Embry-Riddle \nthat designation has a real, rather than shallow, meaning. No better \nexample is found than with this season's basketball team. Under the \nguidance of athletic director and coach Steve Ridder, a Kentucky \nnative, not only does the team consistently win on the court, it also \nwins in the classroom.\n  For example, 11 of the squad's 17 members have a 3-point or better \nGPA. Of the five seniors this year, one has a 3.6 and another a 3.4 in \naerospace engineering, one a 3.4 in engineering physics, one a 3.2 in \naviation business, while the school's all-time leading scorer also \ncarries a 3.2 in aviation business.\n  ERU President Steve Sliwa didn't arrive at the Daytona Beach, FL, \ncampus via a traditional academic path. He brought an eclectic \nbackground to the university: aerospace engineer, entrepreneur, NASA \ndivision level manager, founder of a software firm and astute business \nadministrator.\n  Those of us in Government should be particularly impressed with his \nmost\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\nrecent capital construction program, a $100 million, eight-project \nendeavor, on schedule and under budget.\n  Consider Dr. Sliwa's interests and experiences in computer and \nsoftware technology, which have propelled Embry-Riddle onto the very \napex of this science. Almost every facet of our life now depends on \nsoftware. Yet, software is immature compared to other engineering \ndisciplines. Official mandates for technological reliability and \nconsumer protection simply do not exist.\n  Think about the countless applications of software: worldwide \nfinancial transfers; systems to fly airplanes, to operate medical \nequipment, to help vehicles function, and for a myriad of other daily \ntasks. What happens when such technology fails? The question is \nreceiving increased attention at two universities. A consortium between \nEmbry-Riddle and Carnegie Mellon has been established to address the \nissue of standards and methodologies to prevent future disasters due to \nunreliable or flawed software. The Department of Defense is keenly \ninterested in their efforts.\n  ERU began in 1925 when a naive eastern Kentuckian, John Paul Riddle \nof Pikeville, and entrepreneur T. Higbee Embry of Cincinnati, OH, \nopened a school of aviation at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, OH. Now \nmoving into its eighth decade, the school gives new meaning to \n``cutting-edge'' education.\n  From hands-on investigation of aircraft accidents--thanks to a unique \noutdoor laboratory featuring crashed planes--to design of computer \nsystems and from leadership in national issues to redesign of roof \nflaps for NASCAR racing vehicles, ERU is indeed out in front.\n  Achievements as I have described don't happen without reasons. A most \ndistinguished and forward-thinking faculty, visionary leadership and \nrare discipline combined with resourcefulness have propelled Embry-\nRiddle into what I believe is ``tomorrow's institution of higher \neducation today.''\n  How fortunate for ERU students. How fortunate for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S786-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S787-S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GIVING PRIORITY TO OUR FOOD PRODUCERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, America's family farmers and ranchers \ndeserve a high priority in the legislative agenda of this new Congress. \nThe families who produce our daily food and help feed a hungry world, \nhave not been on the center stage here in the Nation's Capitol. They \ndeserve our attention and our concern.\n  The 7-year farm bill that was passed in the last session of Congress \nis an economic disaster in the making for rural America. All that needs \nto happen is for mother nature to bless us with abundant crops, and \nfarm prices will once again fall. Under that new farm law, there is no \nsafety net for our nation's farm and ranch families, who provide the \neconomic base of rural America.\n  That is why I could not support that legislation. That is why \nPresident Clinton was very reluctant about signing this bill into law. \nIf you remember, he only did so because further delay of the farm bill \nwould have created planning chaos for farmers as they prepared for and \nbegan their spring's work last year.\n  In the closing debates of the farm bill, I said that we would have to \ncome back to this issue when farm prices fall as they inevitably do. \nWell, the glow of high grain prices has faded and the reality of \nincreased production costs has come home to hundreds of thousands of \nfarm families.\n  It is time to consider what responsibility we as a nation have to \nthose who grow our daily food.\n  It was important that on the very first day for the introduction of \nlegislation in the 105th session, that we paid attention to \nagriculture. It is not only the key economic sector in rural America, \nbut also continues to be the single largest industry in our Nation.\n  I am pleased that the minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, \nintroduced two bills that day as part of his leadership package to deal \ndirectly with the problems facing our family farmers and ranchers. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor on both bills.\n\n\n                 CATTLE PRICES AND MARKET CONCENTRATION\n\n  One of the most immediate problems facing rural America is the \ncontinuing low prices that our cattle producers are facing. While these \nlow prices can be attributed to some extent to the periodic pricing \ncycle in cattle, we should not ignore some of the fundamental changes \nthat have occurred within our Nation's livestock marketing system in \nrecent times.\n  The Cattle Industry Improvement Act of 1997--S. 16--which I have \ncosponsored, begins addressing some of the underlying questions that \nface our farmers and ranchers as they market their livestock.\n  The bill will help bring the livestock pricing structure into the \nopen daylight. It requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \nprice-reporting system in which slaughtering firms would have to report \nthe prices paid and the terms of sale to the Department of Agriculture. \nSmaller slaughtering firms would be exempted, but would be encouraged \nto do voluntary reporting.\n  It also gives the Secretary of Agriculture additional rulemaking \nauthority to foster improved competition among packers in buying \ncattle. This would strengthen the ability of the Secretary to take the \nproactive actions needed to ensure a healthy competitive environment in \ntoday's cattle-marketing structures. It underscores the very purposes \nfor which the Packers and Stockyards Act was established.\n  Last year the USDA Advisory Committee on Market Concentration \nconcluded that the price reporting and price discovery system in the \ncattle market was a relic of days gone by. In fact, less than 2 percent \nof fed cattle go through terminal markets where prices for livestock \nare established through an open and competitive bidding process.\n  Essentially, cattle producers face a black hole when it comes to \nbeing able to accurately determine what is really happening in the \nmarketplace. We need to give the Department of Agriculture the \nnecessary tools to reach into this black hole and get accurate market \ninformation for our producers. Our price reporting system needs to be \nupdated with the changes in the marketplace.\n\n\n                FOUR FIRMS CONTROL 80 PERCENT OF MARKET\n\n  The lack of solid market information on livestock is compounded by \nthe concentration in the marketplace. Today, four firms control more \nthan 80 percent of steer and heifer slaughter. In fact, three firms by \nthemselves have over 80 percent of that slaughter. By any economic \nmeasure this is a very high level of concentration.\n  In contrast there are some 1.2 million farmers and ranchers across \nthe country that produce our Nation's cattle. In other words more than \n80 percent of the output of 1.2 million farmers and ranchers is \nfunneled through only 4 firms. This is an enormous economic bottleneck.\n  Since 1980, the top four slaughtering firms have more than doubled \ntheir share of the market. They have moved from a 36-percent market \nshare to an 82-percent market share.\n  When there is an underlying illness, symptoms of that illness often \ndo not appear until the system comes under serious stress. The same is \ntrue in economic situations. We have a serious underlying economic \ndisease in our livestock industry: a highly concentrated marketplace.\n\n  The symptoms have become more evident under the stress of the low end \nof the cattle price cycle. The lack of market power for our producers \nat the bottom rung should be self evident.\n  The USDA Advisory Committee on Concentration can best be summarized \nby a sentence from the minority report. The report stated:\n\n       The upper levels maintain profit margins of various sizes \n     within the production cycles, and the lowest, least \n     concentrated levels have become the primary shock absorbers \n     for fluctuations in the commodity cycle.\n\n  Coming from a State in which cattle producers are primarily cow-calf \noperators, I can certainly attest to this statement. Our cow-calf \noperators have seen their prices cut in half. They have been taking the \nbrunt of this pricing cycle.\n  A few weeks ago I received a copy of a newspaper article about Al and \nGene Urlacher of New England, ND. These two brothers brought a week-old \ndairy bull calf to the auction sales ring. Three years ago that calf \nwould have sold for $175. What did they get?\n  They got a $10 bid for this calf. It cost them $8.55 in auction fees, \nso they\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nsplit $1.45 between them. That means that each of them got 72 cents in \ntheir pocket, which did not even cover the cost of their gas to bring \nthe calf to market. Nor would it buy a Big Mac for lunch that day. Yet \nthese brothers thought they were lucky. Others who had brought calves \nto the sales ring that day didn't even get a bid.\n\n\n             FARMER'S SHARE OF RETAIL BEEF DOLLAR DECLINES\n\n  Let's look at the farmers' share of the retail beef dollar during the \nsame period of time when the top four slaughtering firms more than \ndoubled their market share.\n  In 1979, our Nation's farmers and ranchers received 64 percent of the \nretail price of beef. This past year, their share of the beef dollar \nwas down to 48 percent. The long-term trend line demonstrates what has \nbeen happening to the market power of our producers.\n  As cattle prices have dropped in the past 3 years, the drop in the \nfarm share of the retail beef dollar has been even more dramatic. It \nmoved from 56 percent in 1993 down to 48 percent this past year.\n  The bill before us today is a rather modest proposal. It requires \nprice disclosure so that everybody in the livestock business knows what \nis being paid and the terms of the sales. The base of this bill is to \nprovide more information to those that participate in the livestock \nmarket.\n  The bill would also give the Secretary the needed rulemaking \nauthority to more effectively carry out the provisions of the Packers \nand Stockyards Act. In addition, it would provide protection to \nlivestock producers who do some whistleblowing from retaliation by \ncattle buyers. These are important steps to bring some daylight into \nthe livestock pricing system.\n  Our bill would also establish a voluntary labeling system for meat \nproduced in the United States, and requests USDA to convene a public \nmeeting to consider the potential of allowing State-inspected meat and \nmeat products in interstate commerce.\n  It also calls upon Secretary of Agriculture to immediately work with \nthe Agriculture Minister of Canada to develop a meaningful cattle data \nexchange system so that United States producers have better information \non Canadian cattle production.\n  This legislation also addresses two trade concerns. First, it would \nrequire the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether the European \nUnion has violated its obligations under international law concerning \nthe certification of U.S. meat export facilities.\n  Second, it establishes an annual procedure by which the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative would identify priority countries that maintain barriers \nto U.S. livestock and meat exports, including sanitary standards.\n\n\n               REBUILDING A SAFETY NET FOR FARM FAMILIES\n\n  The second bill that I cosponsored with Senator Daschle on the first \nday of bill introduction was S. 16, the Agricultural Safety Net Act of \n1997. This legislation is a solid beginning to address the problems \nfaced by our grain producers as they face declining prices.\n  Over the years there has been great variability in the prices \nreceived by America's farmers. During the last decade we have seen our \nwheat prices shift from a low of $2.42 per bushel in 1986 to the \nunusually high price of $4.45 per bushel this past year.\n  In fact, had it not been for the unique pricing conditions in our \ngrain sector during the past 2 years, it is very unlikely that the \nfreedom-to-farm bill would have ever been enacted into law, because our \nnew farm eliminated the safety net to help our producers through low \nmarkets.\n  We have to be honest and admit that we do not have a level playing \nfield for our grain producers in this new global economy. Too \nfrequently our wheat producers are not competing against wheat \nproducers in other countries, but are competing against the national \ntreasuries of countries which continue to provide export subsidies to \nmove their surplus production into the world market.\n  The irony of this past year is that wheat prices received by farmers \nacross the Nation peaked just after our planting season. Our farmers \nresponded to the marketplace by planting more wheat. They did the very \nthing the market indicated and made the extra investments to get a good \ncrop. Now they are being rewarded for their good efforts with lower \nprices.\n  Wheat prices have been falling ever since this spring. In recent \nweeks, I have received many reports of wheat prices at below $3.50 per \nbushel at local elevators in my home State of North Dakota. The fact is \nthat these prices are well below the full economic costs of production \nof recent years.\n  Our producers need a working safety net. The farm law has established \nprice supports at 85 percent of the moving Olympic average of prices \nreceived by farmers during the past 5 years, dropping the high and low \nyears.\n  The marketing assistance loans are supposed to help farmers move \nthrough the fluctuations of the market, and give them a means by which \nto hold their grain off the market so that they could make the best of \ntheir marketing opportunities.\n  While the farm law has the promise of these marketing assistance \nloans, it reneges on that promise by establishing a cap on these \ncommodity loans at $2.58 per bushel on wheat and $1.89 per bushel on \ncorn.\n  That makes these loans almost meaningless, especially for our \nbeginning and other low-equity producers who have to sell their crops \nto pay their bills at harvest time. With the cap, these loan rates \naren't high enough to cover even their out-of-pocket expenses, without \nconsidering their machinery and land costs.\n  The Agricultural Safety Net Act of 1997 would eliminate these caps on \nthe marketing assistance loans. That would mean a commodity loan rate \nof about $3.72 for wheat and $2.64 on corn for this year's crops. That \nwould make a world of difference to our producers. It would provide \nthem some marketing flexibility and give them an opportunity to take \nadvantage of market advances when they occur.\n  Another key feature of this bill is that it gives the Secretary of \nAgriculture the authority to extend the marketing assistance loans for \nan additional 5 months. That would also give additional opportunity for \nour producers to ride out the market.\n\n\n                      EXPAND CROP REVENUE COVERAGE\n\n  Together with these improvements, the Agricultural Safety Net Act of \n1997 would require the Secretary of Agriculture to offer a nationwide \nprogram of crop revenue insurance through the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation of wheat, feed grains, and soybeans.\n  Federal Crop has been conducting pilot programs on revenue and income \ninsurance for producers. I am pleased that the crop revenue insurance \nprogram for wheat has been extended to many counties in North Dakota. I \nhad sought inclusion of the entire State in this pilot program.\n  The crop revenue coverage pilot program has been very successful and \nreceived high interest and participation of producers where it has been \navailable. This bill would move us out of the pilot program stage into \na national program that would help producers with the twin risks of \nweather and price.\n\n\n                         BUILDING FARMER CO-OPS\n\n  Another way that farmers have been able to meet the challenges of \ntoday's marketplace has been through the development of a new \ngeneration of value-added cooperatives. Back home in North Dakota this \nhas become known as co-op fever.\n  These co-ops are a way for farmers to extend their influence in the \nmarketplace. They not only add value to their production, but also they \nare moving these products further down the chain closer to the ultimate \nconsumer.\n  This legislation would require the Secretary of Agriculture to give a \nhigh priority to loan and grant applications under the Consolidated \nFarm and Rural Development Act to farmer-owned, value-added processing \nfacilities.\n  It would help make the development of farmer cooperative processing a \npriority in the rural development activities of this Nation.\n  These two bills which I cosponsored as part of the leadership package \nof priority bills are important steps to restoring opportunity for \nrural Americans. They represent a new beginning in our efforts to \nempower rural Americans and help them build a better society for \nthemselves and the entire Nation.\n  These bills will need to be expanded with other legislative efforts \nduring this session of Congress. They are simply the beginning \nfoundation of how we\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\ncan reshape Government so that we can provide rural Americans the tools \nthey need to meet the challenges of our global marketplace.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for his work in the development of these \nbills. The priority that he has given to agriculture in introducing \nthese bills as part of his leadership package is most welcome and most \nappropriate. I am proud to be part of his leadership team and a \ncosponsor of these two bills.\n  Both of these bills recognize that our Nation's family farmers and \nranchers are the economic lifeblood of rural America. When they do \nwell, rural America does well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S787-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAMILY PLANNING FUNDS\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

This vote will affect the lives of \nthousands of families worldwide.

I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Jan. 22, 1997]\n\n                     Needed: Family Planning Funds\n\n                           (By Werner Fornos)\n\n       By Feb. 1, President Clinton is expected to present to the \n     new Congress a finding that the current method of dispensing \n     international population assistance is harmful and \n     counterproductive to US program efforts, and unquestionably \n     it is.\n       In an outrageous attempt to watch United States family \n     planning efforts overseas die a slow death, Congress last \n     year approved $385 million for these vital humanitarian \n     programs in 1997. Congress further specified that the money \n     could not be dispensed until July of this year, and even then \n     at a rate of no more than 8 percent a month.\n       Since the 1997 fiscal year began on Oct. 1, 1996, and ends \n     on Sept. 30, 1997, it is obvious that the legislation was \n     calculated to undermine US efforts to assist developing \n     countries with their family planning needs. The measure is an \n     especially cruel hoax considering that some 500 million women \n     need and want to regulate their fertility but lack access to \n     contraceptives.\n       Moreover, 585,000 women die annually from causes related to \n     pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization \n     believes that the provision of family planning to those who \n     need and want it will reduce maternal mortality by one-fifth.\n       Sources at the Office of Population in the US Agency for \n     International Development (AID) say the funding restrictions \n     and delays are adding up to millions of dollars in \n     administrative costs. The result is that fewer family \n     planning services are being provided, the health of a great \n     number of women is jeopardized, and government funds are \n     wasted because of unwarranted micromanagement by Congress.\n       Meanwhile, other development programs--such as child \n     survival, championed by Rep. Chris Smith (R) of New Jersey, \n     Congress's leading opponent of international family planning \n     aid--will be adversely affected because their administrative \n     costs are derived from AID's overall operations budget.\n       Perhaps the most reprehensible element of the Byzantine \n     metering of international population funds is that it is \n     expected to increase abortions in the world's poorest \n     countries, though its principal architects, Congressman Smith \n     and House Appropriations chairman Bob Livingston (R) of \n     Louisiana, purport to be abortion opponents.\n       It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that \n     reducing family planning funds is a sure-fire way to increase \n     abortions. A 35 percent reduction of population spending last \n     year was estimated to have caused 1.6 million additional \n     abortions, and a nine-month moratorium plus metering may lead \n     to an even greater number.\n       If both the US Senate and House of Representatives concur \n     with Mr. Clinton's findings that the strange disbursement \n     schedule for international population funds is detrimental to \n     our family planning efforts overseas, the money can be \n     released starting as early as March 1, rather than July 1.\n       Though it still will be squeezed out at the rate of 8 \n     percent a month, at least the funds would be delayed five \n     months rather than nine. Neither the federal budget nor the \n     national deficit will be increased by the earlier release \n     date. Congress has already agreed to spend the $385 million \n     on family planning programs overseas. The question is when.\n       In a world where the population is climbing toward 5.9 \n     billion and increasing by nearly 90 million annually, with 95 \n     percent of the growth in the poorest countries, playing a \n     legislative shell game with human lives is unworthy of a \n     country that prides itself on its humanitarianism. Members of \n     this Congress should take the opportunity to at least \n     partially erase the shame perpetrated by the strident \n     congressional henchmen of the antichoice movement in the last \n     Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S789-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S789-S792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TUNA-DOLPHIN BILL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week, Senators Stevens and Breaux \nintroduced a bill S. 39, that would significantly weaken protections \nfor dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by rewriting--\ngutting--the ``dolphin safe'' tuna labeling law that Senator Biden and \nI wrote and urged into law in 1990.\n  Today, the $1 billion U.S. canned tuna market is a dolphin safe \nmarket. Consumers know that the dolphin safe label means that dolphins \nwere not chased, harassed, captured, or killed.\n  Our definition of dolphin safe became law for all the right reasons. \nThose reasons are still valid today:\n  First, for the consumers, who were opposed to the encirclement of \ndolphins with purse seine nets and wanted guarantees that the tuna they \nconsume did not result in harassment, capture, and killing of dolphins; \nsecond, for the U.S. tuna companies, who wanted a uniform definition \nthat would not undercut their voluntary efforts to remain dolphin-safe; \nthird, for the dolphins, to avoid harassment, injury and deaths by \nencirclement; and fourth, for truth in labeling.\n  Our law has been a huge success. Annual dolphin deaths have declined \nfrom 60,000 in 1990 to under 3,000 in 1995. Why mess with success?\n  The Stevens-Breaux bill would permit more dolphins to be killed than \nare killed now.\n  The bill promotes the chasing and encirclement of dolphins, a tuna \nfishing practice that is very dangerous to dolphins. It does so by \ngutting the meaning of dolphin safe, the label which must appear on all \ntuna sold in the United States. The ``dolphin safe'' label has worked: \nit doesn't need to be updated, as the bill's sponsors claim.\n  A number of arguments have been made in support of the Stevens-Breaux \nbill which I would like refute at this time.\n\n\n                        1. ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT\n\n  Bill supporters claim that it is supported by the environmental \ncommunity. In fact, only a few environmental groups support the \nStevens-Breaux bill, while over 85 environmental, consumer, animal \nprotection, labor, and trade groups oppose the Stevens-Breaux bill. I \nask unanimous consent to insert a list of these groups in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks. The fact is that the vast majority of \nenvironmental organizations in this country and around the world oppose \nthe Stevens-Breaux bill.\n\n\n                           2. EMBARGO ON TUNA\n\n  The bill's supporters say that it is unreasonable for the United \nStates to continue to impose a unilateral embargo on other fishing \nnations that wish to sell tuna in our country. I agree. It is time to \nlift the embargo. That is why Senator Biden and I, and a number of our \ncolleagues, introduced legislation in the last session of Congress that \nwould lift the country by country embargo against tuna that is caught \nby dolphin safe methods. Our bill would give all tuna fishermen the \nopportunity to export to the U.S. market as long as they use dolphin \nsafe practices. In other words, we would open the U.S. market and \ncomply with international trade agreements without gutting U.S. dolphin \nprotection laws.\n  We have offered repeatedly over the past year to sit down and \nnegotiate a compromise with the administration. We have stated \nrepeatedly that we agree it is appropriate to lift the embargo. We want \nto reach a compromise that is in the best interest of the American \nconsumer, dolphins, and our U.S. tuna processing industry.\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\n                               3. SCIENCE\n\n  Supporters of the Stevens-Breaux bill believe that we should return \nto chasing and setting nets on dolphins because bycatch of other marine \nspecies is minimized. I believe that in order to sustain our renewable \nmarine resources, we need to take a comprehensive ecosystem approach. I \nalso recognize that management of a single species does not always \nproduce benefits for the entire ecosystem. The bycatch of juvenile tuna \nand other marine species including endangered turtles, is an issue of \nconcern that must be addressed. However, the bycatch arguments used by \nsupporters of this bill are not based on solid science. We need more \nresearch before we can establish that bycatch is a problem.\n\n\n                         4. OBSERVERS ON BOATS\n\n  Under the scheme supported by this bill, tuna fishing boats would \ncontinue to have only one observer on each. Currently, that one \nobserver only has to observe whether or not a purse seine net was used \non dolphins. If a net was deployed, the tuna caught on that fishing \ntrip cannot be labeled ``dolphin safe''. Under the scheme in the \nStevens-Breaux bill, an observer would have to see whether there are \nany dead dolphins in the nets that are used to catch tuna. These nets \nare huge--1\\1/2\\ miles long. How can we expect one single observer to \nknow whether or not a dolphin died in a mile-and-a-half long net? This \nobserver scheme would be unworkable and unenforceable. It also ignores \nall injuries to dolphin during the chase and encirclement process which \ncan lead to eventual death.\n\n\n                      5. INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION\n\n  During the last session, the Panama Declaration was repeatedly \nreferred to as a tuna-dolphin treaty, and it was suggested that unless \nthe Senate passed the Stevens-Breaux bill, the United States was \nsomehow reneging on a binding international agreement. This is simply \nuntrue. It is a completely inaccurate characterization of the issue.\n  Mr. President, there is no tuna-dolphin treaty.\n  No treaty was signed by the United States or any other nation on the \nsubject of tuna fishing and the killing of dolphins in the eastern \ntropical Pacific.\n  No treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification, as required \nby the Case-Zablocki Act.\n  No treaty was referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  None of these things happened because there is no treaty.\n  The agreement that the Stevens-Breaux bill relates to is neither a \ntreaty nor an international agreement. The so-called Panama Declaration \nis only a political statement--an agreement to agree in the future on a \nbinding international agreement.\n  The declaration sets forth a series of principles which will \nultimately be contained in this yet-to-be-drafted international \nagreement. But these principles are so vague and largely hortatory that \nthey cannot possibly be read as imposing legal obligations.\n  If there were any doubt that the United States did not intend to be \nbound by this declaration, we need only turn to the statement issued by \nthe United States representative to the meeting in Panama.\n\n       The U.S. Administration supports this initiative which is \n     an important step on the road to a permanent, binding \n     instrument . . . The initiative . . . is contingent upon \n     changes in U.S. legislation . . . The U.S. Administration \n     needs to work with our Congress on this . . . We do not want \n     to mislead anyone here as to what the final outcome of that \n     process might be.\n\n  It is clear that the administration was not binding the United States \nto anything, other than to work with the Congress to enact this \nlegislation.\n  That is the commitment of the United States. It is nothing more. If \nwe don't pass the Stevens-Breaux bill, no binding agreement will have \nbeen broken, no international treaty obligation will have been \nviolated.\n  In summary, the arguments made by the supporters of the Stevens-\nBreaux legislation--arguments of fact as well as arguments of law--are \nunsupportable. The bill is not needed for any convincing scientific or \nenvironmental purpose, and is not needed to meet any binding obligation \nof the United States.\n  I remain committed to blocking this legislation in its current form. \nI also remain committed to reaching a compromise solution.\n  We have stated repeatedly that we agree it is appropriate to lift the \nembargo. We want to reach a compromise that is in the best interest of \nthe American consumer, dolphins, and our U.S. tuna processing industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following material be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my statement: First a letter to Senator \nBoxer from internationally renowned marine scientist Jacques-Yves \nCousteau opposing the Stevens-Breaux proposed change of the definition \nof dolphin safe; second, a set of opinion pieces and a letter to the \neditor from Time magazine, the Washington Post, and the Journal of \nCommerce, and third, the list of bill opponents referred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Opponents of the Stevens-Breaux Bill\n\n       Action for Animals, California; Americans for Democratic \n     Action, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to \n     Animals, American Oceans Campaign, American Humane \n     Association, Animal Protection Institute, Ark Trust, \n     Australians for Animals, Bellerive Foundation, Italy & \n     Switzerland; Born Free Foundation, Brigantine New Jersey \n     Marine Mammal Stranding Center, BREACH, UK; Cetacea Defense, \n     Chicago Animals Rights Coalition, Clean Water Action, \n     Coalition for No Whales in Captivity, Coalition Against the \n     United States Exporting Dolphins, Florida; Coalition for \n     Humane Legislation, Colorado Plateau Ecology Alliance, \n     Committee for Humane Legislation, Community Nutrition \n     Institute.\n       Defenders of Wildlife, Dolphin Project Interlock \n     International, Dolphin Connection, California; Dolphin \n     Freedom Foundation, Dolphin Defenders, Florida; Dolphin Data \n     Base, Dolphin Alliance, Inc.; Doris Day Animal League, Earth \n     Island Institute, EarthTrust, Education and Action for \n     Animals, Endangered Species Project, Inc.; European Network \n     for Dolphins, Federation for Industrial Retention and \n     Renewal, Fondation Brigitte Bardot, France; Friends of the \n     Earth, Friends of Animals, Friends for the Protection of \n     Marine Life, Friends of the Dolphins, California; Fund for \n     Animals, Fundacion Fauna Argentina, Hoosier Environmental \n     Council, Humane Society of Canada, Humane Society of the \n     Midlands, Humane Society International, Humane Society of the \n     United States.\n       In Defense of Animals, Institute for Agriculture and Trade \n     Policy, Interhemispheric Resource Center, International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Dolphin Project, \n     International Wildlife Coalition, International Union of \n     Electronic Workers, Irish Whale and Dolphin Society, \n     Lifeforce Foundation, Maine Green Party, Marine Mammal Fund, \n     Massachusetts Audubon Society, Midwest Center for Labor \n     Research, National Consumers League, National Family Farm \n     Coalition, Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International, \n     Pacific Orca Society, Canada; People for the Ethical \n     Treatment of Animals, Performing Animal Welfare Society, \n     Progressive Animal Welfare Society.\n       Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, Pure Food Campaign, \n     Reearth, Reseau-Cetaces, France; San Diego Animal Advocates, \n     Sierra Club, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, South \n     Carolina Association for Marine Mammal Protection, South \n     Carolina Humane Society of Columbia, The Free Corky Project, \n     UNITE, Vier Pfoten, Austria and Germany; Whale Tales Press, \n     Whale Rescue Team, Whale and Dolphin Welfare Committee of \n     Ireland, Whale and Dolphin Society of Canada, Working Group \n     for the Protection of Marine Mammals, Switzerland; Zoocheck, \n     Canada.\n\n\n                                         The Cousteau Society,\n\n                                    Chesapeake, VA, July 12, 1996.\n     Hon.

Here at The Cousteau Society/Equipe \n     Cousteau, my staff has been following the heated discussions \n     among environmental organizations about the Declaration and \n     pertinent legislation in the United States.\n       We agree with the proponents of the Panama Declaration that \n     it is time to move away from trade sanctions and toward \n     engaging all tuna-fishing nations in a commitment to \n     techniques that are truly dolphin-safe. At the same time, we \n     cannot accept a compromise that approves of catching tuna by \n     chasing and encircling dolphins. We have faith that the \n     nations involved can find a better solution.\n       Our best wishes to you in your work.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jacques-Yves Cousteau.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From the Monitor, Mar. 4, 1996]\n\nChicken of the Sea?--A ``Dolphin-Safe'' Tuna Flap Makes the U.S. Squirm\n\n                           (By Eugene Linden)\n\n       Call it the flipper flip-flop. A squabble over attempt to \n     amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act is forging some \n     strange alliances even as it opens up a bitter rift in the \n     environmental movement. In the end, it may be business \n     interests--once the villains in the\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\n     piece but now terrified of a boycott by dolphin-loving \n     consumers--that decide the matter.\n       At issue are amendments to the 1972 act, which forbade \n     imports of tuna caught using nets to encircle dolphins that \n     for unexplained reasons swim together with tuna in parts of \n     the Pacific. Before the act, this method suffocated as many \n     as 500,000 of the marine mammals each year. After 1972, \n     American fishermen drastically reduced their dolphin kill, \n     but in the 1980s the number of dolphins killed by foreign \n     boats rose dramatically.\n       Then in 1989, environmental activist Sam LaBudde galvanized \n     public opinion by releasing dramatic videos of drowning \n     dolphins. In 1990, StarKist, the world's largest tuna canner, \n     responding to consumer sentiment, announced that it would buy \n     only tuna caught by other methods. That same year, LaBudde's \n     group, Earth Island Institute, successfully sued the Bush \n     Administration to bar tuna imports from Mexico and other \n     Latin American countries that failed to protect dolphins. \n     European nations followed suit, which extended the embargo to \n     an estimated 80% of the canned-tuna consumer market.\n       Mexico promptly filed an international trade complaint. But \n     it also took steps to reduce dolphin deaths, and by 1995 the \n     number of dolphins killed by tuna fishermen annually had \n     dropped below 5,000 worldwide--demonstrating, Mexicans \n     assert, that fishing boats can encircle dolphins without \n     killing the animals. The U.S. and a coalition of green groups \n     met with Latin nations in Panama last October to hammer out \n     new guidelines for environmentally sound tuna fishing. Their \n     declaration permits encirclement so long as onboard observers \n     certify that no dolphin drowned during the netting operation, \n     and its provisions became the basis for a bill introduced by \n     Alaska Senator Ted Stevens that would, among other things, \n     lift the U.S. embargo. California Senator Barbara Boxer, a \n     Democrat, has introduced a competing bill that would also \n     lift the sanctions on the Latin nations but maintain them on \n     individual vessels that catch tuna by encirclement of \n     dolphins.\n       Proving once again that politics makes strange bedfellows, \n     the Clinton Administration has sided with Stevens--a leader \n     of Republican efforts to roll back environmental \n     regulations--as have the Environmental Defense Fund, the \n     World Wildlife Federation and the Center for Marine \n     Conservation. They argue that unless the Latin nations are \n     given credit for their efforts, they will simply resume their \n     bad old ways. Meanwhile, Earth Island Institute, the Sierra \n     Club, the Humane Society and Friends of the Earth vehemently \n     oppose the Stevens bill and support Boxer's charging that the \n     delegation in Panama sold out the dolphins to free trade.\n       Proponents of the Boxer bill say complicated enforcement \n     procedures and the potential for corruption under the Stevens \n     bill will mean that dolphin deaths will rise again. \n     Proponents of the Stevens bill argue that the alternatives to \n     encircling dolphins have proved destructive to both tuna \n     populations and other species, such as sea turtles and \n     sharks. All that leaves Anthony O'Reilly, chairman of H.J. \n     Heinz Co., which owns StarKist, loath to make any change that \n     might be misinterpreted by dolphin-loving consumers. ``I \n     believe the definition should not be changed in the absence \n     of consensus of scientists and public opinion,'' he says. And \n     he's the one who has to move the goods.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 1996]\n\n                  ``Dolphin-Safe'' Claim is in Danger\n\n                          (By Colman McCarthy)\n\n       On the label of every can of tuna sold in the United States \n     is the phrase ``dolphin safe.'' This means that tuna were not \n     caught by intentionally setting encircling nets on dolphins. \n     In the Eastern Pacific Ocean, fleets locate the deeper-\n     swimming tuna by tracking dolphins.\n       The story of how ``dolphin safe'' came to be imprinted on \n     labels is proof that environmentally harmful practices can be \n     turned around when enough well-organized citizens demand it. \n     Credit is shared by schoolchildren, their parents and \n     teachers who threatened to boycott tuna because dolphins were \n     also killed in the catch, and by such groups as the Humane \n     Society of the United States, which has been toiling on this \n     marine issue for more than 20 years.\n       Legislatively, the Dolphin Consumer Information Act was \n     passed in 1990. Then came the International Dolphin \n     Conservation Act, which bans the import and sale of tuna \n     caught in nets that encircle dolphins. Both laws represent \n     years of work by progressive politicians to ensure that \n     dolphins are nearly as safe as they were before tuna fleets \n     took to the high seas in 1959 with deadly mile-long purse \n     seine nets. Over three decades, more than 7 million died in \n     the nets. Under the laws, dolphin mortality has been reduced \n     by 96 percent.\n       In politics, success in one thing, defending it another.\n       The integrity of the legislation, as well as the safety of \n     dolphins, is at serious risk. The problem is not with the \n     domestic tuna fleet. California-based, it amounts to only a \n     half-dozen boats and with the owner eschewing settings nets \n     on dolphins. It is the fleets of a few foreign nations--\n     Mexico mainly, which has nearly 40 factory boats in the \n     eastern Pacific--that want to market dolphin-unsafe tuna in \n     the United States.\n       Mexico's fishers and their lobbyists in Washington are \n     taking comfort in legislation offered by Sens. Ted Stevens \n     (R-Alaska) and John Breaux (D-La.). Their bill, which \n     recently was approved by a Republican controlled committee, \n     would redefine ``dolphin safe'' to something like ``Well, \n     pretty safe.'' Dolphins would be fair game for nets, along \n     with the practice of helicopters and speedboats chasing the \n     traumatized creatures into them.\n       To ward off troublesome school kids who like dolphins and \n     might take to boycotting again, the Stevens-Breaux bill \n     requires the fishers to ``back down''--release dolphins from \n     the nets while still tightening them around tuna. If no \n     dolphins were ``observed'' dead in the nets, the dolphin-safe \n     claim could be made.\n       Now the waters murk up. Even if an independent-minded \n     observer can be found and be given the run of the factory \n     boat by the Mexican captain, how precisely can one person \n     monitor a mile's worth of nets in a waving sea? What about \n     when they are sleeping or down below eating? What if the \n     captain who isn't likely to be a dues-paying member of the \n     Humane Society, disputes the observer's count of dead \n     dolphins? Whose word is to be believed?\n       And then there is the effectiveness of enforcement. Jeffrey \n     Pike of the Dolphin Safe Fair Trade Campaign, a group opposed \n     to Stevens-Breaux, testified before Congress on the lack of \n     enforcement powers by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna \n     Commission, a regulatory group. When observers have cited the \n     deaths of dolphins, ``the reports are not acted on'' by the \n     commission. ``To date, despite the fact that hundreds of \n     violations have been reported, no monetary fines have been \n     collected or penalties assessed. . . . In 1994, during four \n     trips IATTC observers reported that they were prohibited by \n     the vessel captain from carrying out their duties, an offense \n     for which . . . a penalty of $50,000 each for the captain and \n     vessel owners [is recommended]. In no case was the penalty \n     collected.''\n       Congress and U.S. courts are powerless to regulate Mexican \n     and other Latin fleets in international waters. They do have \n     power--and are exerting it through legislation--to ban the \n     import and sale of dolphin-unsafe tuna. Legislation offered \n     by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) does not lower dolphin \n     protection standards. Stevens-Breaux supporters argue that if \n     U.S. laws aren't modified, Mexico will drop its economic \n     anchor in countries that lack dolphin-safe requirements.\n       This argument drowns in a deep sea of facts. The United \n     Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that 90 \n     percent of the world's consumers of tuna live in the United \n     States, Canada and Europe, which impose dolphin-safe \n     requirements. Mexico, like the U.S. tuna fleet before it, had \n     better face economic reality, even as it may find the \n     environmental kind unpalatable.\n       It comes down to language on labels. The public wants the \n     factual words ``dolphin safe'' on the cans. It doesn't want \n     dolphin deadly.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Jan. 2, 1997]\n\n                        Dolphins, Tuna and Trade\n\n                        (By Rodger Schlickeisen)\n\n       A Dec. 16 editorial endorsed the Stevens-Breaux bill as the \n     best approach for continuing the decline in dolphin \n     mortalities and implementing the Panama Agreement for an \n     enforceable fishery management policy in the eastern Pacific \n     Ocean. As members of Congress long involved with this issue, \n     we take exception to this statement of support.\n       Despite popular sentiment behind the current ``dolphin \n     safe'' label--which means what it says--the Stevens-Breaux \n     bill would allow tuna caught using deadly netting and \n     encirclement techniques to be sold as ``dolphin safe'' as \n     long as no one saw any dolphins die. Supporters of the \n     Stevens-Breaux bill argue that because an international \n     observer will be on each tuna boat in the eastern Pacific \n     Ocean, dolphin mortality will be easily monitored and \n     controlled. That argument just doesn't hold water. One \n     observer cannot possibly monitor the entire catch of a 100-\n     foot vessel or investigate the contents of a mile-long purse \n     seine net, particularly when the deadly dolphin chase is \n     being carried out by speedboats traveling ahead of the mother \n     ship with no observers on board.\n       Another assertion by the bill's proponents--that unless we \n     weaken our laws substantially, international fishing \n     operations will soon abandon the U.S. market and its dolphin-\n     safe fishing techniques in favor of the lucrative and \n     permissive Asian and Latin American markets--also lacks any \n     credibility. The fact is that the U.S. market remains the \n     world's largest, accounting for more than 60 percent of \n     global tuna sales. And the European Community, the second-\n     largest market, has dolphin-safe tuna practices that \n     practically mirror the Boxer-Biden bill. Together, the United \n     States and European Community dominate the world's tuna \n     market.\n       Ultimately, the victim of this extreme effort to gut \n     dolphin protection laws would be not only the dolphins, but \n     also American consumers. By changing the definition of \n     ``dolphin safe,'' as the Stevens-Breaux bill proposes, even \n     tuna caught by killing hundreds or thousands of dolphins \n     could conceivably receive this label.\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\n       There is a better way: The Boxer-Biden International \n     Dolphin Protection and Consumer Information Act of 1995. This \n     bill maintains every word of the current dolphin-safe \n     definition, while continuing the existing ban on selling all \n     other types of tuna. Our bill also makes the necessary \n     changes in current law to incorporate the Panama Agreement (a \n     broad management plan for the eastern Pacific Ocean recently \n     signed by the United States and 11 other countries).\n       Most significantly, our bill provides an important \n     incentive for foreign and domestic tuna fishermen to fish in \n     a dolphin-safe manner: access to the U.S. market. Under our \n     bill, the ban on all tuna imports from countries that don't \n     exclusively follow dolphin-safe practices will be amended to \n     allow fishermen who use these methods to sell that tuna in \n     the vast $1 billion U.S. market. This important modification \n     will reward those who have altered their fishing methods and \n     encourage the rest to follow suit.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Aug. 2, 1996]\n\n                        Dolphins, Tuna and Trade\n\n                        (By Rodger Schlickeisen)\n\n       The debate over tuna-dolphin legislation, which reached the \n     floor of the House of Representatives this week, has become \n     as tangled as an old fishing net. But it unravels to one \n     basic reality: The Clinton administration and a few \n     environmental groups are pushing legislation that would \n     weaken the ``dolphin-safe'' program and allow the slaughter \n     of thousands of dolphins annually. While this harmful \n     legislation passed the House this week, there is still time \n     to stop it when a companion bill reaches the Senate floor \n     after the August congressional recess.\n       Thanks to the efforts of millions of schoolchildren and a \n     coalition of conservation groups, since 1990 U.S. law has \n     provided labels on cans to let consumers know whether tuna \n     was caught by dolphin-safe methods.\n       Tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific tend to school beneath \n     dolphins, so historically fishermen set nets on the dolphins \n     to catch the tuna below, killing at least 7 million dolphins \n     since the 1950s. Dolphin mortality has dropped dramatically, \n     however, since the U.S. embargo of dolphin-unsafe tuna \n     imports.\n       After its string of environmental victories against a \n     hostile Congress, why would the administration seek to weaken \n     such a popular environmental program and hand opponents an \n     opportunity to regain ground on the environment? Considering \n     that the majority of environmental organizations support the \n     current dolphin-safe standard, why would a few support \n     regression to a discredited method of fishing?\n       The answer is that Flipper has become entangled in deadly \n     trade politics. Latin American countries are pressuring the \n     administration to lift the embargo, which Mexico has \n     challenged successfully before the World Trade Organization. \n     They not only want to settle this longstanding dispute, but \n     help boost the Mexican economy before the November election, \n     in which Nafta will be an issue. Some want to appease \n     Mexico's demands because they fear foreign tuna boat \n     operators otherwise will abandon any safeguards.\n       Mexican lobbyists have convinced the administration that \n     only changing the definition of dolphin-safe can ensure them \n     access to the U.S. market, despite the fact that roughly a \n     dozen Mexican tuna boats already fish dolphin-safe. The bill \n     promoted by the administration would change the current \n     definition to allow a dolphin-safe label on tuna caught by \n     encircling, harassing and chasing dolphins--as long as no \n     ``observed'' dolphin deaths occurred.\n       The assumptions of bill proponents are based on misleading \n     industry information. For example, although they say 10 \n     million dolphins exist in the eastern tropical Pacific, the \n     tuna mostly follow two imperilled populations--spotted and \n     spinner dolphins--which represent only a tiny fraction of the \n     claimed millions. Although these two populations were \n     recently listed as ``depleted'' under the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act, the administration proposal would allow \n     setting nets on them.\n       Bill proponents claim that dolphin-safe fishing methods \n     cause by-catch of other marine life such as sea turtles and \n     sharks. They also claim that ``new'' techniques have been \n     developed that make netting dolphins safer.\n       Marine biologist and tuna boat owner John Hall scoffs at \n     those claims. He says the method of releasing dolphins from \n     nets was developed by U.S. fishermen three decades ago and \n     their recent adoption by some foreign fishermen has brought \n     about no measurable protection for spotted and spinner \n     dolphins. Moreover, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture \n     Organization states that this fishery's by-catch under the \n     present dolphin-safe definition is among the lowest in the \n     world.\n       Furthermore, ``observed'' dolphin deaths under the new \n     definition would not account for all deaths, according to \n     Albert Myrick, who has coordinated U.S. research on dolphin \n     stress. Current data strongly suggest that dolphins \n     experience physiological damage and death after release from \n     nets.\n       We lack viable means of ensuring that dolphins will not be \n     killed when fishing nets are set on them. This year Mexican \n     fishermen are known to have thrown observers off their boats. \n     Many involved in the fishery are unconvinced that the present \n     observer system can handle the intensive monitoring that \n     enforcement of the new definition would require.\n       A grass-roots coalition of more than 80 environmental, \n     consumer and animal welfare groups oppose weakening the \n     present dolphin-safe standard.\n       U.S. tuna canneries, which six years ago went dolphin-safe \n     in the face of unprecedented public pressure, also are \n     concerned.\n       They rightly fear that they not only could lose their hard-\n     won competitive advantage over foreign dolphin-unsafe \n     canneries, but also again face boycotts over the misleading \n     new label.\n       Ironically, if the president would abandon his attempt to \n     change the definition of dolphin-safe, improvements could be \n     made.\n       All agree that the present practice of embargoing all tuna \n     from a country like Mexico for the behavior of a few bad \n     fishermen is counterproductive.\n       We could allow the dolphin-safe tuna from Mexican fishermen \n     to gain access immediately to the U.S. market.\n       This politically smart move also would be the right one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S789-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S792-S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  KEEP THE CURRENT DOLPHIN-SAFE LABEL\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I join with my longtime colleague in \nthis endeavor, Senator Boxer, to restate our continuing opposition to \nlegislation changing the current dolphin-safe standard. As usual, she \nhas explained the issue much better than I could, so my remarks will be \nbrief.\n  Throughout the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, hundreds of thousands of \ndolphins were senselessly killed every year because of the use of \ngigantic purse seine fishing nets. Our efforts to require that each \nnation wishing to export tuna to the United States document that it \npossessed a dolphin protection program and a dolphin mortality rate \ncomparable to ours largely failed, resulting in unilateral embargoes \nagainst noncomplying nations.\n  The senseless slaughter of dolphin justifiably outraged many \nAmericans. Literally tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone \ncalls poured into tuna companies' offices and Capitol Hill. The message \nheard was loud and clear: Don't allow this needless massacre to \ncontinue.\n  Then, in 1990, something remarkable happened. American tuna \ncompanies, environmentalists, and consumers came together and \nrevolutionized an entire industry. That April, Starkist, and shortly \nafter that Chicken of the Sea, and Bumblebee--which combined sold more \nthan 80 percent of the tuna in America--announced voluntary purchasing \nbans against all tuna caught in association with dolphins.\n  On the heels of this campaign, then-Congresswoman Boxer and I wrote \nand shepherded into law the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information \nAct--a landmark statute that set one very simple, uniform standard: No \ntuna caught by purse seine net fishing, or by a boat capable of purse \nseine net fishing, can be labeled as dolphin-safe.\n  Our labeling law immediately transformed the decades-long \ncontroversy. Dolphin mortalities caused by both American and foreign \ntuna boats plummeted from more than 52,000 in 1990, to just under 3,000 \nin 1995. A tremendous decrease.\n  Millions of consumers now purchase tuna with a clear conscience, \nknowing that the deadly purse seine net method was not used.\n  Simply put, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act remains a \nremarkable success story. It does not mandate anything. It does not \nrequire thousands of bureaucrats. It merely requires accurate, truthful \nlabeling.\n  From the nutritional information printed on boxes of cereal, to salt \ncontent listings on low-sodium crackers, honesty in labeling is a well-\nestablished principle of law.\n  This does not necessarily mean that all types of a given product must \nconform to the requirements of a particular labeling law. All milk is \nnot required to contain 2 percent milkfat, for example. But, if a dairy \ncompany wishes to label its product as 2 percent milkfat, it must meet \nthat standard. In essence that is the concept underlying the current \ndolphin safe standard.\n  Unfortunately, legislation (S. 39) introduced recently by Senator \nStevens and Senator Breaux changes the criteria for the current label, \nthereby eliminating the protection and honesty now provided. While the \nproposed no-mortalities requirement sounds good on its face, it is for \nall practical purposes unworkable and unenforceable. One observer, \nequipped with a pair of\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nbinoculars, can hardly keep accurate watch over the entire contents of \na 1 to 2 mile long, half-mile wide net, submerged hundreds of feet \nbelow water.\n  I recognize the potential significance and power of the October 1995 \nPanama Declaration, and I agree that our unilateral embargoes deserve a \nserious reexamination. In fact, legislation I and Senator Boxer \nintroduced during the 104th Congress would have implemented key parts \nof the declaration by repealing the current comparability embargoes and \nopening our market--literally the most lucrative in the world--to all \ntuna caught in compliance with the current dolphin-safe standard.\n  But market access issues, questions of whether to allow dolphin-safe \nand other tuna into our market, are separate from the reasoning behind \nthe current label.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and in the administration to lock-in the progress we have made. \nAnd I commend Senator Boxer for her diligent efforts to protect our \nenvironment while preserving our principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S792-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO ENCOURAGE LABOR UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, each morning for more years than anyone \ncan remember, millions of Americans have religiously opened their \nnewspapers and consulted their horoscope, checking their astrological \nsign for an idea of what good or bad fortune their day might hold. \nWhether these people did this out of a true belief that the stars could \npredict their fate, or just out of a sense of fun, it was the work of a \nprominent Washingtonian, Jeane Dixon, whose column more often than not \nthey were reading. Sadly, her fans will no longer be able to gaze into \nthe future over a cup of coffee and an English muffin, as Mrs. Dixon \npassed away this past Saturday at the age of 79.\n  Mrs. Dixon gained notoriety as an astrologer and psychic when she \nmade some eerily accurate predictions concerning the tragic fate of the \nlate President Kennedy, the election of Richard Nixon to the \nPresidency, that China would become Communist, and the eventual \nelection of Ronald Reagan as Chief Executive. Whether she truly had the \nability to see into the future will forever be a mystery, but she \ncertainly made enough accurate forecasts about events that she earned a \ndegree of credibility. From what I understand, she was often consulted \nby individuals inside and outside of Government, and she was certainly \na favorite in Washington social circles, which is how I came to know \nMrs. Dixon many years ago.\n  Those who only knew the Jeane Dixon whose name graced horoscope \ncolumns were not familiar with the generous and concerned nature of \nthis woman who worked very hard to help build a better world through \nphilanthropy. A devout Catholic, Mrs. Dixon gave freely to the church, \nsupporting many worthy charities and relief projects designed to help \nthe less fortunate and those in need. Additionally, Mrs. Dixon \nestablished the Jeane Dixon's Children to Children Foundation, an \norganization that has undertaken many fine efforts to help some of \nAmerica's most vulnerable citizens, its children.\n  I am proud to have been able to count Jeane Dixon among my friends. \nShe was the godmother to my youngest son, Paul, and the two would visit \nwhenever possible. Unfortunately in later years, Paul's schedule as a \ntennis player and college student, and Jeane's busy traveling and \nbusiness schedule did not permit as many get togethers as either would \nlike. Still, they were good friends and did enjoy being able to see \neach other several times a year. As Jeane lived in town, I would see \nher frequently, and always enjoyed being able to host her and her \nfriends for lunch in the Senate dining room. Without question, she was \na kind and warm-hearted woman who was always interested in politics and \nthe events of the day. She was a witty conversationalist and it was \nalways amusing and intriguing to hear what she believed was in store \nfor the Nation and prominent figures in Government and entertainment.\n  Mr. President, Jeane Dixon led a full and unique life. She was known, \nadmired, and liked by countless people and we shall all miss her. My \ncondolences go out to her sister, Evelyn P. Brier; her brother, Dr. \nWarren E. Pinckert; and her nieces and nephews, all of whom survive \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S793-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today because of strong concerns I \nhave related to the Air Force's evaluation of the events surrounding \nthe tragic Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. The Air Force has not \nyet released its official report on these events, but it has been \nwidely reported that the Air Force will recommend no disciplinary \naction against any officer in relation to this incident. Mr. President, \nI do not understand this recommendation.\n  As you will recall, shortly before 10 p.m. on the evening of Tuesday, \nJune 25, 1996, a fuel truck pulled up to the perimeter of a Khobar \nTowers' complex in Dharan, Saudi Arabia. This complex housed almost \n3,000 airmen of the 4404th Wing, as well as military personnel from the \nUnited Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia. Air Force guards spotted the \ntruck and immediately began an effort to evacuate the building. \nUnfortunately, before they could succeed, a large explosion occurred \nthat destroyed the face of Building 131, killing 19 American \nservicemembers and seriously injuring hundreds more.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the explosion the members of our Armed \nForces acted heroically, restoring order and providing aid to those who \nhad been injured. In less than 3 days the 4404th Air Wing had recovered \nand was once again flying its mission over the skies of southern Iraq.\n  This bombing and a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bombing in November 1995 \nthat killed five Americans, raised a number of fundamental questions \nregarding the threat of terrorism to United States\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nforces deployed overseas and the priority of force security among those \nmilitary commanders charged with responsibility for providing that \nsecurity. Secretary of Defense Perry took an important step in \naddressing these questions by establishing an independent task force to \nexamine the facts and circumstances surrounding the bombing. This task \nforce was led by Gen. Wayne A. Downing, a highly respected and \ndistinguished retired four-star general.\n  The findings of the Downing report were significant and wide ranging. \nThey covered force security standards and policies, intelligence, \nthreat assessments, and United States-Saudi cooperation. Secretary \nPerry took these findings seriously and as a result has announced major \nchanges in our approach to force protection. Unfortunately, in a number \nof areas it appears the Air Force has chosen to disregard the Downing \ntask force findings.\n  The contrast between the Downing report and the Air Force's apparent \nfindings, and I use the term ``apparent findings'' because at this \npoint, Mr. President, the official report has not yet been released, \nfinding 19 of the Downing report states ``The chain of command did not \nprovide adequate guidance and support to the Commander, 4404th Wing.'' \nFinding 20 states ``The Commander, 4404th Wing did not adequately \nprotect his forces from terrorist attack.'' Did not adequately protect \nhis forces from terrorist attack. Yet the Air Force has apparently \nconcluded that every person in the chain of command met standards of \nperformance and acted with due care and reasonably. Furthermore, the \nDowning report details the information available on the terrorist \nthreat against our forces in the Khobar Towers. The Downing report \nstates that the Khobar Towers had been described as a soft target, \ncritical target and a specific site of concern. In addition, the \nDowning report notes that there was a series of 10 suspicious incidents \nin the preceding 90 days surrounding this complex that indicated the \npossibility of a terrorist threat. In contrast, the Air Force has \nreportedly found that the chain of command considered the threats, in \nview of the information known at the time, and acted with due care and \nprudently. This judgment by the Air Force, in my opinion, is \ninexplicable.\n\n  Mr. President, the wing commander of the 4404th Wing, General \nSchwalier, has been scheduled for a promotion from brigadier general to \ntwo-star rank of major general. Now, I understand that hindsight is 20/\n20, yet I cannot ignore the findings of the Downing task force. For \nthis reason, I have written a letter to the Secretary of the Air Force \nexpressing strong concerns regarding this appointment. The Downing task \nforce makes clear that General Schwalier did have command \nresponsibility and authority for force protection of his personnel in \nthe 4404th Wing while he could not have been expected to know the \nprecise nature of the terrorist attack, the Downing report does raise a \nnumber of concerns regarding the priority of force protection under \nGeneral Schwalier.\n  For example, in light of the terrorist threat, a number of additional \nmeasures could have substantially reduced the threat from a terrorist \nattack. The windows facing out from the complex, Building 131, could \nhave been coated with a shatterproof substance known as Mylar. Airmen \nwith outside rooms could have been moved into the interior of the \ncomplex. That was the area that was most exposed, Mr. President. \nFinally, a higher priority could have been placed at moving the \nperimeter fence farther away from housing quarters. When difficulties \nwith the Saudi Government halted plans to move the fence, the matter \nshould have been taken up and reported up the chain of command.\n  According to the Downing report, these steps were not taken. General \nSchwalier concentrated solely on the threat of a penetrating bomb \nattack and failed to address other kinds of terrorist attack. He failed \nto correct vulnerabilities he could have corrected, and for those \nvulnerabilities he could not correct by himself General Schwalier \nfailed to raise the issues up the chain of command or coordinate with \nthe host nation.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the Downing report was \nunreasonable or looking for scapegoats.\n  This task force took an independent, forthright, and tough look at \nthe threat of terrorism and how we can respond to that threat in the \nfuture. I have no doubt this tough assessment will save U.S. lives in \nthe future. In the same way, the Air Force must also take a tough look \nat its responsibilities to protect its forces from this new threat. And \nin this instance, Mr. President, I am afraid the Air Force has failed \nto do so. I urge the Secretary of the Air Force to reconsider the Air \nForce's conclusions regarding this horrible and tragic incident.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                   DOE Property and Asset Management\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Today I am releasing a report, prepared at my direction by \nthe minority staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, on property \nand asset management at the Department of Energy. The report, aptly \ntitled ``Lost and Still Missing,'' discusses at some length the chronic \npersonal property management problems at the Department, problems that \nhave resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of taxpayer-\npurchased equipment. Recently, DOE has made some progress in tackling \nthis problem, but much more needs to be done.\n  For many years, missing property and equipment and poor inventory \ncontrols have been a major problem at the Department of Energy. \nEstimates by the IG and GAO of the value of lost and unaccounted for \nequipment have ranged from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars. Missing equipment includes computers, furniture, \nmachine tools, electric pumps, and cameras, plus more exotic items like \nsemi- and flatbed trailers, electronic switchgear, nuclear fuel \nreprocessing equipment and technology, diesel engines, cranes and \narmored personnel carriers.\n  So we are not talking about a few missing pencils and paper clips. \nThese are costly items. And all too often it appears that this material \njust flies out of DOE inventory and disappears into thin air.\n  Furthermore, equipment in working order and usable supplies have been \nsold as surplus for a small fraction of their market value. Other \nequipment has been left outdoors to be ruined by the elements.\n  Finally, many of the missing items are national security sensitive \nand did not go through proper demilitarization and declassification \nprocedures.\n  Our review also found that the problem of missing property and poor \ninventory controls is not unique to any one DOE site, but is prevalent \nat numerous sites, including, among others, the Portsmouth Gas \nCentrifuge Enrichment Plant, the Rocky Flats Plant, the Idaho National \nEngineering Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory, the Fernald Environmental Restoration Corporation, \nand Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The specific problems at each site \nare discussed at length in the report. Some go back a couple of years, \nothers are more recent. Let me give you a few examples.\n  Rocky Flats, CO--GAO identified $29 million in missing equipment. \nMissing items included: a semi-trailer, a boat, forklifts, furnaces, \nover 1,800 pieces of computer equipment, and 8 armored personnel \ncarriers. The armored personnel carriers are a story in their own \nright. DOE initially donated the 8 carriers to a military museum, but \ndid not demilitarize them. The museum gave one of the carriers away, \nwhich was subsequently resold twice before winding up in the hands of a \nman who supplies props to Hollywood movie studios. Since then, DOE has \nrepossessed the vehicles.\n  Idaho National Engineering Laboratory--DOE sold as surplus national \nsecurity sensitive nuclear fuel reprocessing equipment to a scrap \ndealer for $154,000 who then tried to sell it to a\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\nBritish company. Once the Department discovered its mistake, it bought \nback the equipment for $475,000. A separate sale to the same individual \nincluded between 25 and 50 personal computers whose hard drives were \nnot sanitized in accordance with Department and GSA regulations. \nUnfortunately because INEL's records were so poor, it was not possible \nto determine exactly how many computers were sold, or, more \nimportantly, whether they contained national security sensitive or \nrestricted data.\n  Sandia, NM--An on-site inspection by the inspector general revealed \nthat computers, machine tools, furniture, and rolls of cable were left \noutside for long periods of time. When Sandia officials tried to reuse \nthe equipment, they discovered that it had been ruined by the elements. \nOther equipment had been improperly mixed with radiologically-\ncontaminated items.\n  Portsmouth, OH--Equipment valued at $35 million was sold for less \nthan $2 million. DOE's own documents indicate that some of this \nequipment may be nuclear proliferation sensitive. This includes \ntechnology used in the enrichment of uranium.\n  Why do these problems exist? It is a simple two-word answer. Poor \nmanagement.\n  In some cases, the Department failed to provide effective policy, or \nnegotiated management and operating contracts that did not meet its own \nregulations on property management; in others, the field offices failed \nto provide adequate oversight, especially in the development and review \nof property management systems. These failures have been compounded by \nantiquated property tracking systems with poor records, lack of proper \ntraining for employees charged with property management, wide \nvariations in local policies that implement Department regulations, \nand, for one site at least--Rocky Flats--a failure, both in the field \nand at headquarters, to follow up on cases where there was reason to \nsuspect theft.\n  The main reason for the Department's pervasive and decades-long \nproblems with property management likely lies in its perception of the \nimportance of its national security mission. This perception has \nresulted in the downgrading in importance of more routine \nresponsibilities, such as proper accounting, custodianship, and \ndisposal of equipment and other personal property. As one high-ranking \nDepartment official was quoted in the Washington Post: ``When it's the \nlife and death of civilization, people start being sloppy about some \nother things.'' That statement is grandiloquent excess at best, and \nutter nonsense as an excuse for poor management. In any case, the \nDepartment must finally recognize that its cold war mission is over. \nNow more than ever, the taxpayers are demanding cost-effective \nGovernment.\n  In and of themselves the personal property problems discussed in the \nreport are significant and deserve management attention. The importance \nof addressing these problems is further compounded because DOE is just \nbeginning to address long-term downsizing issues associated with the \nchanges from its cold war mission. For example, within the next 10 \nyears, DOE's installed capacity to produce and test nuclear weapons \nwill be reduced to 10 percent of its cold war level. As a result DOE \nwill need to dispose of thousands of fixed assets--including buildings, \nreal property, vehicles, equipment, precious metals, fuel, et cetera. \nTo manage this asset disposition process efficiently, DOE will need to \ncarefully take to heart the lessons learned from the personal property \nmanagement problems discussed in this report.\n\n  Recently the Department has taken encouraging and good faith efforts \nto correct some of these deficiencies, including the renegotiation of \nthe personal property requirements in both new and existing M and O \ncontracts, and implementing guidance and regulations on the handling of \nproliferation sensitive property. However, these efforts must be \ncontinued and expanded.\n  The report contains a number of recommendations on ways to improve \npersonal property management. Our principal recommendation is that the \nDepartment establish a centralized Office of Property and Asset \nManagement that would report directly to the Secretary. Currently, \npersonal property, real property, and asset management responsibilities \nare spread across too many offices, both at headquarters and in the \nfield, and that is one reason why the Department has such a problem. No \none is accountable.\n  I will be taking this and the other recommendations up with \nSecretary-designee Pena as he goes through the confirmation process. I \nam sending letters today to both Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member \nBumpers of the Energy Committee in the hope that they will address the \nmatter during confirmation hearings. This issue needs to be addressed \nat the highest level, not relegated to the bureaucratic backwaters as \nall too often has happened in the past.\n  In closing, our review is based on reports from the General \nAccounting Office and the DOE inspector general, documents obtained \nfrom the Department, interviews with Department officials, committee \nhearing records, press accounts and official DOE responses to questions \nthat both the staff and I addressed to the Department. We have copies \nof the full report for those who would like it, and they could request \nit from my office.\n  I ask unanimous consent the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      Lost and Still Missing . . .\n\n\n  Managing Property, Equipment and Assets at the Department of Energy\n\n  (A report by the Minority Staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n                               Committee)\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       For many years, the Department of Energy has had serious \n     problems managing property and equipment at its different \n     sites. These problems have been the subject of numerous GAO \n     and IG reports as well as hearings by the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee. Estimates of the value of missing and \n     unaccounted for equipment have ranged from tens to hundreds \n     of millions of taxpayer dollars. Missing equipment includes \n     computers, furniture, machine tools, electric pumps and \n     cameras, plus more exotic items like semi and flatbed \n     trailers, electronic switchgear, diesel engines, nuclear fuel \n     reprocessing equipment, cranes and armored personnel \n     carriers. Equipment in working order and usable supplies have \n     been lost, stolen, sold as surplus for a small fraction of \n     their market value, left outside to be ruined by the \n     elements, and mixed with radiologically contaminated items.\n       At the direction of Senator John Glenn, Ranking Member of \n     the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Minority Staff of the \n     Committee conducted a review of property management at the \n     Department of Energy. Our review is based on reports from the \n     General Accounting Office and the DOE Inspector General, \n     documents from the Department, interviews with Department \n     officials, hearings records, press accounts and official DOE \n     responses to questions that the staff and Sen. Glenn \n     addressed to the Department and Secretary Hazel O'Leary.\n       Our review found that the problem of missing property and \n     poor inventory controls is not unique to any one DOE site, \n     but has been found at numerous sites, including, among \n     others, the Portsmouth, Ohio Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant, \n     the Rocky Flats Plant, the Idaho National Engineering \n     Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory, the Fernald Environmental Restoration \n     Corporation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These site-\n     specific problems are examined at length later in this \n     report. The report will also summarize steps taken by the \n     Department to correct its problems as well as suggest further \n     steps that we believe could help prevent these problems from \n     recurring in future years.\n       The lessons learned from past personal property management \n     problems are doubly important because the Department is \n     currently embarking on a large scale asset disposition \n     program. This program is necessary in order to meet budget \n     reduction targets and to dispose of unneeded property, \n     equipment and inventory. Quite simply, the needs of the \n     Department and nation have changed since the end of the Cold \n     War. For example, current DOE plans will result in a nuclear \n     weapons complex that has one-tenth the installed capacity \n     that existed just a few years ago. As a result, the \n     Department will need to dispose of thousands of fixed assets, \n     including real property, buldings, equipment, vehicles, \n     precious metals, fuel, etc. Some legislative authority will \n     likely be necessary to accomplish the Department's goals for \n     this program. While this program is a logical and potentially \n     cost saving one for the Department to undertake, our report \n     strongly recommends that DOE's ailing property management \n     system be reformed and overhauled so as to prevent past \n     property management abuses from happening again in the \n     future. To that end, the report makes a number of specific \n     recommendations on property mangement reforms.\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\n        Contributing Factors to DOE Property Management Problems\n\n       Many deficiencies in the management practices of the \n     Department of Energy have led to missing and unaccounted for \n     property. But all together it's a product of bad management. \n     In some instances, the Department failed to provide effective \n     policy, or signed management and operating contracts that did \n     not meet the Department's own regulations on property \n     management. In others, the Field Offices failed to provide \n     adequate oversight, especially (but not only) in the \n     development and review of site-based property management \n     systems. These failures have been compounded by inadequate \n     guidance on how to implement policies, inadequate funding for \n     property management, antiquated property tracking systems, \n     poor property records, lack of proper training for employees \n     charged with property management, wide variations in local \n     policies that implement Department regulations, and, for one \n     site at least (Rocky Flats), a failure, both in the field and \n     at Headquarters, to follow up on cases where there was reason \n     to suspect theft.\n       Perhaps the root reason for the Department's pervasive and \n     decades-long problem with property management lies in its \n     perception of the overwhelming importance of its national \n     security mission. This perception led to downgrading the \n     importance of proper accounting, custodianship, and \n     disposal of equipment and other personal property. As a \n     highly placed Department executive said to the Washington \n     Post: ``When it's the life and death of civilization, \n     people start being sloppy about some other things.'' But \n     if that reason ever had merit, it does not now. Nor do we \n     think that it was ever an adequate reason for such abuses \n     as selling off no longer needed equipment for a small \n     fraction of its market value.\n\n                 Recent DOE Actions to Correct Problems\n\n       Recently the Department has taken encouraging and good \n     faith efforts to correct some of these deficiencies. Property \n     management has been given greater emphasis during the \n     renegotiation of some DOE contracts. For example, the current \n     contract at Rocky Flats contain provisions that assign \n     personal responsibility to employees and establish corporate \n     liability for property under their control. The Department \n     has completed wall-to-wall inventories at some sites, \n     including Los Alamos, Hanford, and INEL. However, there \n     appears to be little consistency between each site's \n     inventory practices.\n       Further, in November, 1994, DOE issued new interim \n     guidelines both for the control of high risk personal \n     property and on export control and nonproliferation. The high \n     risk property guidelines have been refined several times \n     since then, most recently in March, 1996. These regulations \n     require controls be developed to safeguard against the \n     inadvertent transfer or disposal of equipment or information \n     that represents a high risk because of nuclear proliferation \n     or national security concerns or because of environmental, \n     health or safety hazards. (These regulations were revisited \n     following a particularly embarrassing property incident at \n     the INEL, discussed below.)\n       The Department is also taking steps to deal with training \n     needs at the sites and field offices and the pressing need \n     for good, consistent information, two themes that recur in \n     the many GAO and IG reports on DOE property management \n     problems. In January 1996, the Department established a \n     Process Improvement Team to review training needs at the \n     field offices and among its contractors; the Team will make \n     recommendations on standardized courses. Also in January \n     1996, the field offices formed a team to review a new \n     property management system (PRISM (Enhanced)) that could be \n     used Department-wide, bringing a much-needed consistency to \n     property management efforts.\n       Finally, a promising (if long-overdue) step is the approval \n     of a number of property management systems in the past two \n     and a half years. Approval of a property management system \n     involves headquarters review to determine whether a \n     contractor's property management system complies with \n     applicable regulations. Whereas in January 1994, only seven \n     of the 20 major contractors involved in defense related \n     activities had property management systems approved by DOE, \n     our latest information is that all but one system has been \n     approved.\n       However, unaccounted for property and equipment remains a \n     serious problem at numerous DOE sites. Furthermore, as \n     mentioned above, the Department recently announced an asset \n     disposition and sale program aimed at realizing $110,000,000 \n     by September 30, 2003. As the Department downsizes over the \n     next few years, there is a danger that taxpayer dollars will \n     be further wasted, unless vigorous property management \n     becomes not only a policy at Department Headquarters, but an \n     ethic and a practice at all sites, among all employees and \n     contractors. This is much easier said than done. The \n     Department itself remarked, in response to the 1996 Inspector \n     General's audit of DOE's arms and military-type equipment: \n     ``. . ..while Department regulations are adequate, compliance \n     is an issue.'' Secretary O'Leary has offered her own \n     assessment that ``. . .correcting deficiencies of the past is \n     a continuous and long-term effort.''\n\n          Additional Factors Affecting DOE Property Management\n\n       On-going efforts by the Department and the Congress to \n     privatize DOE operations such as the Elk Hills Naval \n     Petroleum Reserve (recently put on hold) and a number of the \n     Power Marketing Administrations will place increase pressure \n     on DOE's existing property management systems. Congress has \n     also set criteria in law for DOE to transfer excess equipment \n     to assist educational institutions and non-profit \n     organizations, as well as the local economic development \n     efforts of communities negatively impacted by downsizing. For \n     these privatization and technology transfer efforts to \n     succeed without substantial waste, we believe that the \n     Department must focus increased attention on asset and \n     property management.\n       The technology transfer and economic development assistance \n     efforts of the Department require more than accurate \n     inventories. They require that the field offices and the site \n     contractors understand the procedures under the three acts \n     governing such transfers, especially how to balance the \n     interests of the Department against those of eligible \n     potential recipients outside the Department. The Department \n     has set up programs under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \n     Innovation Act of 1980, as amended, and the Department of \n     Energy Science Education Act. These programs also include the \n     Used Energy-Related Laboratory Equipment Grant Program and \n     the Math and Science Equipment Gift Program. Furthermore, \n     under the FY1994 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 103-160), \n     the Department has authority to transfer or lease excess \n     Department-owned personal property to private businesses in \n     order to support economic development initiatives that could \n     mitigate the effects of closing or restructuring Departmental \n     facilities. Here, there continue to be misunderstandings and \n     conflicts between the claims of the Department and the claims \n     of local development proponents. Policy and practice need to \n     be clarified at both the field and headquarters levels to \n     ensure that equipment transfers comply with the law and \n     contribute to economic and technological development while \n     also protecting the taxpayer's interest in what is often very \n     valuable equipment. Such guidance will be crucial as the \n     Department continues its downsizing efforts.\n\n            Management Attention Must Include Accountability\n\n       Notwithstanding the steps the Department has already taken, \n     we believe that further actions are necessary to raise the \n     priority of effective property management and assure \n     taxpayers that loss and mismanagement of valuable property \n     will not occur. Approved property management systems are a \n     necessary first step, but they must be implemented by well-\n     trained people who are working with modern systems in an \n     environment that supports their efforts both actively and \n     tacitly. Taxpayers expect a common-sense approach to managing \n     property that goes beyond regulations, procedures and the \n     latest technology. Although they certainly help, policies, \n     procedures and technologies in and of themselves cannot \n     ensure that abuses will not take place. The committment and \n     knowledge of individuals do count.\n       More appropriately, the DOE should hold its staff and \n     contractors accountable for the property they use. At the \n     contractor level, the quality of property management should \n     factor heavily into contractor renewal decisions; poor \n     property management should result in fines or penalties or \n     delay or reduction of award fees. At the individual level, \n     poor property management should be grounds for disciplinary \n     action, demotion, or even dismissal. This applies to both \n     supervisory and working-level personnel, both in the field \n     and at headquarters. Conversely, exemplary property \n     management should be rewarded. And responsibility should lie \n     not only with the field offices and the sites, but with \n     individual DOE program managers.\n       An analysis of property management problems at various of \n     DOE sites follows.\n\n      Discussion of Past DOE Property Management Problems by Site\n\n           Portsmouth, Ohio--Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant\n\n       A January 1995 DOE Inspector General audit (Case \n     No.I93CN015) \\1\\ prepared at the request of Sen. Glenn \n     revealed that property DOE originally spent $177 million to \n     acquire, and which the IG estimates had a market value of $35 \n     million, was given away for a total of $2 million. This \n     property and equipment came from the Gas Centrifuge \n     Enrichment Plant (GCEP) facility which had been closed by \n     DOE. The IG's report points out that poor inventory controls \n     contributed to this outrageous waste of taxpayer dollars. How \n     this situation developed is a complicated story that took \n     place over a number of years. Still, the outcome shows that \n     the Department made a number of mistakes and errors that have \n     left it vulnerable to a loss of a significant dollar amount \n     of equipment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See list of references, at the end of the report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In 1985, DOE terminated the GCEP Program at Portsmouth. \n     Many of the assets of that program subsequently became \n     surplus. DOE began to inventory the surplus equipment and \n     establish a database. An official in charge of the inventory \n     effort and subsequently interviewed by the IG labeled the \n     database a ``best-guess effort'' to identify one million \n     pieces of equipment spread over 25 acres. DOE then searched \n     for interested parties who might wish to make use of the \n     equipment. On November 20, 1987, DOE entered into an \n     agreement with AlChemIE, Inc. to transfer equipment and \n     technology to the\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\n     company for the purpose of using it to enrich non-fissile \n     isotopes for medical, industrial, and research applications. \n     The agreement stipulated that AlChemIE: remove the equipment \n     at its sole expense; pay the Department a 2 percent annual \n     royalty over 20 years on gross sales generated by the isotope \n     production facility; and, deposit $2 million in an escrow \n     account. AlChemIE and DOE also agreed on an inventory list of \n     equipment to be transferred, a list that later proved to be \n     incomplete and inaccurate. Prior to entering the agreement, \n     DOE received an opinion from the Department of Justice that \n     the agreement did not violate anti-trust law.\n       However, AlChemie needed a license from the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission (NRC) authorizing it to possess gas \n     centrifuge equipment--equipment with national security \n     implications given its potential application in the \n     development of nuclear weapons--before it could construct the \n     facility. But the NRC did not approve the license. On June \n     20, 1989, AlChemIE filed for bankruptcy and became insolvent \n     by August 14, 1990. At that time, the IG estimated that \n     equipment with an acquisition value of $46 million had been \n     transferred to AlChemIE.\n       AlChemIE had secured $2.25 million in escrow monies through \n     five personal loans from the Anderson County Bank in \n     Tennessee to five individuals representing the company. With \n     AlChemIE now bankrupt, Anderson County Bank assumed title for \n     the remaining equipment secured through the escrow account. \n     On November 28, 1990, the bank sold title to the equipment to \n     John Smelser, a former executive with AlChemIE and now \n     president of JHS, Inc., an equipment scrap and salvage \n     company.\n       This escrow account raised questions among state banking \n     authorities. As reported by the Oakridger and the Knoxville \n     Journal on February 6, 1991, the U.S. Attorney indicted \n     former bank president William Arowood, attorney Elbert \n     Cooper, and John Smelser for conspiring to defraud Anderson \n     County Bank of $150,000 from the escrow account. \n     Subsequently, Mr. Arowood and Mr. Cooper were found to be \n     guilty of bank fraud while Mr. Smelser was found to be \n     innocent.\n       In the interim, Mr. Smelser had pursued litigation against \n     the Department for access to equipment he claimed was owed \n     him from the agreement with AlChemie. After 14 months they \n     settled, signing a January 23, 1992 agreement giving Mr. \n     Smelser further access to the equipment as had been listed \n     previously in the AlChemIE agreement. Still, a number of \n     items of equipment remained in dispute and Mr. Smelser \n     claimed that he had been wrongfully denied those items. An \n     internal DOE memo noted that many of the items on the list \n     had either been: 1) lost; 2) transferred to GSA; 3) were \n     classified or contaminated; 4) had two ID numbers; or 5) \n     otherwise were not available. The memo concluded ``that \n     DOE's position, should the dispute be litigated, was \n     weak.'' So DOE entered into another agreement with Mr. \n     Smelser on June 10, 1993. However, this agreement widened \n     the scope of available equipment and appeared to give Mr. \n     Smelser carte blanche to take any surplus equipment he \n     wanted. The agreement gave him access to surplus equipment \n     property yards at Paducah, Kentucky and Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee in addition to Portsmouth. According to the IG, \n     the agreement's wording was vague and non-specific, for \n     example, granting Mr. Smelser ``all unclassified, \n     uncontaminated loose items on third floor storage area'' \n     and ``all unclassified, uncontaminated items that are not \n     required to support building operations.'' The agreement \n     also waived the first $100,000 in disposal costs incurred \n     by DOE in removing the equipment, with Mr. Smelser to \n     reimburse the Department for costs that exceeded that \n     figure.\n       Sen. Glenn wrote the Department in 1995, asking them a \n     number of questions about the missing equipment and their \n     agreement with Mr. Smelser (Sen. Glenn's letter and the \n     Department's response can be made available upon request). \n     The response from Donald Pearman, Associate Deputy Secretary \n     for Field Management, noted that the final agreement with Mr. \n     Smelser expired on June 10, 1994. However, the letter also \n     points out that Mr. Smelser owes DOE $487,228 for fees \n     associated with removing equipment from the site, and that \n     Mr. Smelser claims DOE did not provide all the equipment he \n     was entitled to remove. As a result, there is pending \n     litigation, still in the discovery process as of December of \n     1996, between DOE and Mr. Smelser. Mr. Smelser has filed a \n     claim for $503,266,375 (i.e., more than a half billion \n     dollars), and the Department has filed a counterclaim for \n     $492,208 plus interest for removal services it rendered to \n     Mr. Smelser.\n       Not only are inventory controls necessary for prudent \n     fiscal management, they are also critical for environment, \n     safety and health purposes, as well as for enforcing our \n     nonproliferation policies, which ensure appropriate controls \n     over equipment and technology that could be applied to the \n     production of nuclear weapons. Department documents and \n     correspondence with Mr. Smelser show that access to, and \n     disposal of, contaminated or classified equipment were on-\n     going issues in the relationship. Moreover, there appears to \n     be some confusion as to the impact of the disposition of the \n     GCEP property from a non-proliferation perspective. The IG's \n     report (page 7) states:\n       ``the OIG has not identified, nor has any reason to \n     believe, that any contaminated or classified equipment was \n     released to AlChemIE or Mr.Smelser. It appears that the \n     Department is complying with these procedures with respect to \n     Mr. Smelser. The classified Program material never left the \n     site at Portsmouth; therefore, U.S. Export Control Rules \n     governing export of sensitive nuclear technology/equipment \n     did not apply.''\n       However, a report from DOE's Deputy Assistant Secretary for \n     Security Evaluations to the Under Secretary entitled, \n     ``Release of Nuclear-Related Property and Associated \n     Documentation by the Department of Energy since 1989,'' (page \n     12) dated December, 1994 is much less comforting:\n       ``The only identified release of possibly nuclear-related, \n     export-controlled property via technology transfer came about \n     through an out-of-court settlement. . . This case involved \n     the release of a large number of equipment items to a single \n     individual by Oak Ridge and Portsmouth. . . during the period \n     1989 through June 1993. As a result of the out-of-court \n     settlement, and in addition to the gas centrifuge equipment, \n     all excess property from Oak Ridge and Portsmouth from June \n     1993 and June 1994 was released to this same individual. None \n     of the approximately 325,000 line items released between 1989 \n     and June 1994 were reviewed for export control. Therefore, it \n     is possible that export-controlled items were part of this \n     release. Although neither classified equipment nor critical \n     process information was released, the large number of items \n     associated with the gas centrifuge enrichment process, \n     together with the excess property items (June 1993 through \n     June 1994), makes this release potentially sensitive from a \n     nonproliferation perspective.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       When Sen. Glenn asked the Department in his April 25, 1995 \n     letter to comment on the apparent discrepancy between the \n     IG's report and the December 1994 report to the Under \n     Secretary, the Department responded that there appears to be \n     no discrepancy. In response to a further inquiry, the \n     Department responded in May, 1996 that all equipment declared \n     surplus from the GCEP facility was reviewed prior to release \n     to assure that the equipment was unclassified equipment, and \n     that unclassified equipment is not subject to export \n     control regulations.\n       We note that this response cannot be reconciled with \n     earlier statements from the Department. The issue is not only \n     whether the equipment was classified or unclassified. Nor is \n     the issue confined to just this site. As Secretary O'Leary \n     pointed out in an internal memorandum of August 3, 1994 about \n     the sale of surplus equipment at the Idaho National \n     Engineering Laboratory:\n       ``Apparently, the decisions. . ..were based on whether or \n     not the equipment and related documentation was unclassified. \n     This is an inadequate form of control because a great deal of \n     nuclear production processes have been unclassified for \n     several years. A more appropriate form of control would \n     utilize information regarding the proliferation sensitivity \n     of the equipment, materials and related documentation.''\n       Thus, we recommend that DOE be asked to review, for export \n     control purposes, the equipment it does know was deemed \n     surplus from the GCEP facility. Specifically, would any of \n     the items released to Mr. Smelser, if exported, require \n     either: (a) a validated license from the Department of \n     Commerce; or (b) an authorization from the DOE; or (c) an \n     export license from the NRC?\n       The GCEP saga is only one in a long list of DOE sites with \n     chronically-ill personal property management systems. Other \n     problem sites include Rocky Flats, the Idaho National \n     Engineering Laboratory, Los Alamos, Sandia, the Central \n     Training Academy, Fernald and Oak Ridge.\n\n                         Rocky Flats, Colorado\n\n       The DOE site at Rocky Flats has had persistent problems \n     managing personal property. In 1993, the Inspector General \n     reported (DOE/IG-0329) that a 1991 inventory conducted by the \n     site contractor found 5,900 pieces of government equipment \n     with an acquisition cost of over $33 million unaccounted for \n     or missing from the site, presumably either lost or stolen. A \n     subsequent GAO report (GAO/RCED-94-77) summarized the 1991 \n     inventory, and stated that the missing or unaccounted for \n     equipment included about 1,400 items of computer equipment, \n     plus lathes, drill presses, hoists, furnaces, laboratory \n     equipment, forklifts, a photo-copier and a boat. The IG also \n     criticized management at Rocky Flats for storing sensitive \n     items such as computer equipment outdoors in the open air, \n     and commingling equipment potentially contaminated with \n     radioactivity with uncontaminated items. In its 1994 report \n     (GAO/RCED-94-77), GAO noted that a follow-up inventory, \n     completed in 1993, found $12.8 million in equipment missing \n     from the site and another $16.5 million that could not be \n     physically located, for a total of $29.3 million. Missing \n     items included: a semi-trailer, forklifts, cameras, desks, \n     radios, typewriters, a wide variety of laboratory and shop \n     equipment such as balances and lathes, and over 1,800 pieces \n     of computer equipment such as monitors and keyboards. As of \n     October, 1995, DOE considered that only $4.5 million of \n     property was missing or could not be physically located. \n     However, in a December 1995 report (GAO/RCED-96-39), GAO \n     notes that DOE has written off $20.8 million in missing or \n     unlocated property. This equipment presumably is lost \n     forever.\n       A July 1995 GAO report (GAO/OSI-95-4) examined the \n     likelihood that theft contributed to the inability of DOE and \n     the site contractor to account for the millions of dollars of \n     missing equipment at Rocky Flats. GAO concluded that the \n     extent to which theft has\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n     been a factor is unknown, because of poor property management \n     practices and inadequate records. GAO also concluded that \n     poor management practices, such as characterizing possibly \n     stolen equipment as missing without undertaking an \n     investigation, contributed to an environment that allowed \n     theft. GAO further noted that Rocky Flats did not always \n     report suspected theft to DOE, and that DOE did not always \n     report suspected thefts to the DOE Inspector General or to \n     the FBI, as regulations require. GAO cited the Motor Vehicle \n     Maintenance Shop as a place where automotive parts and \n     supplies were easily stolen. DOE reports that physical \n     security of property has been upgraded at Rocky Flats and \n     that cases of possible theft are receiving better review.\n       The December 1995 GAO report notes that DOE has made \n     improvements in management of personal property at Rocky \n     Flats. For example, DOE has incorporated specific performance \n     measures into its new site management contract that address \n     many of the identified problems with property management. DOE \n     has also established a computerized tracking system and \n     allocated 2 FTEs and 2 support contractors to operate it. \n     Because a large percentage of the data in the tracking system \n     is inaccurate, DOE has made updating and correcting these \n     records a priority task for FY96. Still, it seems unlikely \n     that Rocky Flats will ever recover many of these missing \n     items.\n       On May 15, 1995 the Associated Press reported the story of \n     how David Wang, a collector of military vehicles who leases \n     them as props to Hollywood movie studios, obtained an armored \n     personnel carrier surplused from the site. (The story built \n     on a May 5 news release from DOE reporting the recovery of \n     the vehicle and seven others.) The carrier bought by Mr. Wang \n     was one of eight previously donated by Rocky Flats to a \n     military museum in Anderson, Indiana to be displayed for \n     historical purposes. Rocky Flats officials were supposed to \n     de-militarize the vehicles in accordance with DOE \n     regulations, but they did not. The museum owner gave this \n     vehicle away and it was subsequently resold twice before \n     winding up in Mr. Wang's hands. One of the middlemen in the \n     transaction, John Ferrie, when asked about the paperwork and \n     procedures for obtaining the carrier, was quoted as saying, \n     ``It's kind of a handshake business.''\n       As noted above, DOE seized back the vehicles. An \n     investigation is currently underway to determine any criminal \n     wrongdoing. A June 1996 follow up GAO report (GAO RCED-96-\n     149R) found that physical controls and accounting procedures \n     for firearms, ammunition, and other military equipment at \n     Rocky Flats had improved.\n\n     Management of Arms and Military Equipment at Several DOE Sites\n\n       In a February 1996 report (DOE/IG-0385), the IG concluded \n     that DOE has more weapons (handguns, shotguns, rifles, \n     submachine guns, light anti-tank guns, howitzers, armored \n     cars, and tanks) than are necessary for security purposes. \n     The IG also found that weapons are not accurately accounted \n     for, inventory documentation is not always correct, and \n     property management regulations were violated in the lending \n     of weapons to other organizations. Further, the report shows \n     that problems with armored vehicles are not isolated to Rocky \n     Flats, but occur at other sites as well. Highlights of the \n     report follow.\n       ``Oak Ridge: Site officials could account for only seven \n     out of ten armored vehicles. After IG review, DOE discovered \n     documentation showing the location of two of the three \n     missing vehicles. About 66 weapons were unaccounted for: 50 \n     had dropped off the inventory, and 16 had been transferred \n     off-site, but officials were unable to say where. All 66 were \n     eventually located. Three M-16s and six M-14s were loaned to \n     local police five years ago without proper approval. (DOE \n     regulations allow loans for one year, or longer if the head \n     of the field organization approves.)\n       ``INEL: One out of two armored vehicles were missing with \n     no knowledge of its whereabouts. The IG found no \n     documentation to support disposal or transfer.\n       ``Los Alamos: The IG discovered several faulty entries on \n     the inventory database. Six items listed as guns were radar, \n     spray paint, or gas guns. An item labeled a vehicle tanker \n     was an M-60 tank; another item labeled as a rifle was an 8-\n     inch naval gun. The IG found a 20 mm machine gun that was not \n     listed on the database. Two TOW launchers and one Russian \n     rocket launcher were found in a bunker; none of the three \n     were listed on the database.\n       ``Hanford: Eight light armored personnel carriers were \n     donated to a military museum. No documentation was found to \n     show whether the vehicles had been demilitarized. Site \n     officials loaned 24 rifles and shotguns to a local law \n     enforcement department nine years ago. Information on the \n     status of the loan agreement could not at first be found, but \n     Richland eventually determined that a subsequent 1992 \n     contract covered the firearms.\n       ``Savannah River: Several years ago, 4,000 rounds of \n     ammunition were lost and not recovered. Savannah River was \n     unable to provide documentation that showed the \n     demilitarization codes for four armored personnel carriers \n     transferred as excess property to a Federal agency and a \n     local law enforcement department.\n       ``Sandia: The site averaged nearly 6 weapons per security \n     officer. The IG observed 29 tanks, 4 howitzers, and 1 armored \n     personnel carrier on site, all transferred from DOD. None of \n     the items were on the inventory, and none had documents \n     justifying their need or use.''\n       In the February 1996 report, the IG made a number of \n     specific recommendations for corrective action, including \n     that DOE's Office of Nonproliferation and National Security \n     conduct a ``needs study'' to 1) determine what arms and \n     weapons are necessary and 2) identify unneeded arms for \n     excess or destruction. In addition, the IG recommended that \n     wall-to-wall inventories of arms be conducted at the sites; \n     that reconciliation of inventory be updated; and that a \n     formal process be established through a Memorandum of \n     Understanding to transfer unneeded arms to an approved \n     disposal site. In their comments on the IG report, DOE \n     management concurred with the IG's recommendations and \n     stated that they have either taken action, or are planning \n     to take action, to resolve the issues raised in the \n     report.\n       On March 1, 1996 Sen. Glenn wrote the Department asking for \n     their response to the specific recommendations in the IG \n     report. On April 26, 1996 the Secretary replied, agreeing \n     that the Department had more military equipment than needed, \n     and gave the recent changes in the Department's missions as \n     the cause. Secretary O'Leary stated that the Department is \n     working with the Department of Justice to arrange for the \n     transfer of much of DOE's excess weapons and protective force \n     equipment to local law enforcement agencies. The Secretary \n     cited a number of actions the Department is taking in \n     response to the IG report, including requiring designated \n     personnel to attend the Defense Demilitarization Program \n     conducted by the U.S. Army Logistics Management College. The \n     Secretary acknowledged that further improvements are needed, \n     particularly in inventory control and records management.\n\n                 Idaho National Engineering Laboratory\n\n            (A) Fuel processing restoration project property\n\n       A situation eerily reminiscent of the sale of equipment \n     from the Portsmouth GCEP facility occurred in 1993 at DOE's \n     INEL facility. In April 1992, because of a diminished need \n     for reprocessed uranium, the Secretary of Energy terminated \n     the Fuel Processing Restoration (FPR) program at INEL. The \n     termination left DOE and the M contractor with nearly $54 \n     million in property to be either used in other ways or \n     disposed. The equipment included, among other things: \n     specially designed vessels for nuclear fuel reprocessing, \n     sheet metal, reinforcing steel, pipe fittings, computers, \n     power tools, portable welders, flat bed trailers, heavy duty \n     shop equipment, and office equipment.\n       A 1995 IG audit (WR-B-96-04) of $21.2 million of this \n     property found that at least $4.2 million was not accurately \n     accounted for and excessing procedures were not followed. The \n     IG found that Westinghouse was responsible for $3.58 million \n     of this equipment, while MK-Ferguson was responsible for \n     $655,000. In addition, the Department procured at least \n     $43,000 worth of property and equipment which duplicated that \n     which was already available from the unneeded FPR property \n     inventory.\n       The IG also found that only a small percentage (44 of \n     1,490) of items excessed outside the Lab were ever entered \n     into the Department's system for excess property. According \n     to the IG, Westinghouse project management would send lists \n     of available property to contact points at other DOE \n     facilities on an ad hoc basis, instead of using the \n     established, Department-wide disposal system. As a result of \n     using this informal system, property was not made available \n     to all elements of the Department nor to other Federal \n     agencies. Potential customers did not know that unneeded \n     property was available and a lot of that property has gone \n     unclaimed. Further the IG identified 2,700 stock items which \n     had neither been identified for redistribution nor as excess. \n     The IG concludes that: ``Although we were able to physically \n     locate most of the property, the lack of property \n     accountability rendered the property readily susceptible to \n     undetected theft or loss.''\n       One subset of the FPR property has become notorious. The \n     case first became public when the Wall Street Journal \n     reported it in August 1994. In April 1993, after \n     approximately $22 million of the FPR property was distributed \n     within the DOE community through Westinghouse's and MK-\n     Ferguson's informal process, and another $13 million or so \n     retained by INEL, most of the remaining property (with an \n     acquisition cost of about $18 million) was transferred to \n     INEL's managing contractor, EG, for disposal outside the \n     Department. EG advertised the equipment for sale in June \n     1993 in the Commerce Business Daily. On July 12, 1993, much \n     of the equipment was purchased by Mr. Tom Johansen, of \n     Frontier Car Corral/Frontier Salvage in Pocatello, Idaho. Mr. \n     Johansen paid $154,000 for equipment originally purchased by \n     DOE for $10 million.\n       The equipment Mr. Johansen purchased consisted of 57 large \n     components to the fuel reprocessing system, including slab \n     tanks, annular tanks, decanters, separation columns, and \n     evaporators with external tube sheet heat exchangers. A \n     subsequent DOE investigation found that, for countries that \n     wish to reprocess nuclear fuel for use in a weapons program, \n     acquiring this equipment could shorten the time necessary to \n     develop and implement a reprocessing operation. For countries \n     without advanced metal manufacturing industries, acquiring \n     this equipment\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\n     could lead to a significant time savings, according to the \n     DOE report.\n       Soon after purchasing the equipment, Mr. Johansen received \n     copies of architectural engineering design drawings \n     associated with the facility through a FOIA request. On \n     August 24, 1993 the DOE was informed by the State Department \n     that Mr. Johansen was seeking to market his equipment to \n     British Nuclear Fuels, a private, foreign company. The State \n     Department also contacted the NRC who on August 25, 1993 \n     advised Mr. Johansen that he would require an NRC license to \n     export the equipment. By September 1993 DOE advised their own \n     employees to be aware of nuclear proliferation concerns \n     involving surplus property. The September notification \n     notwithstanding, in January 1994 Mr. Johansen obtained from \n     DOE's INEL office additional technical documents associated \n     with the equipment, including radiographs and blueprints, and \n     a world-wide directory of nuclear facilities.\n       During the next 12 months, as DOE began to fully realize \n     the implications of this sale, the Department began \n     negotiating with Mr. Johansen to obtain the equipment and the \n     documents that had been sold or given to him. Eventually the \n     Department paid Mr. Johansen $475,000 and took steps to \n     ensure that the equipment would not be used for nuclear \n     purposes. Most of the equipment was turned into scrap and \n     sold, though some of it has been turned into art by an Idaho \n     artist.\n       Following the Journal's articles in August 1994 and \n     subsequent Congressional inquiries, the Department initiated \n     an internal review of the matter. That report entitled ``The \n     Sale of Reprocessing Equipment at the Idaho National \n     Engineering Laboratory'' dated September 2, 1994 found that \n     there existed within the Department:\n       ``. . .[an] apparent lack of vigilance at all levels for \n     the potential impacts of releasing sensitive, nuclear fuel \n     reprocessing equipment and information to the public. Another \n     disturbing development was that the sale was facilitated by a \n     number of DOE and DOE contractor employees located in Idaho \n     and at DOE Headquarters, whose activities, though possibly \n     well meaning, were contrary to the best interests of the \n     Department. The Department's failure to provide effective \n     policy in this area is of particular concern in light of \n     Congressional pressure to implement legislation on export \n     controls and the fact that a draft order on export controlled \n     information has existed since 1988.''\n       The report goes on to conclude: ``Although actual damage in \n     this case may be limited, the incident resulted in an \n     appearance of ineptitude on the part of Departmental \n     elements. More importantly, system breakdowns of this type \n     could have more severe consequences in other similar \n     situation where the equipment and documents involved may be \n     extremely sensitive or even classified.''\n       As a result of the Idaho sale, the Department reviewed all \n     sales and releases to the public of nuclear-related property \n     and information since 1989, issued new guidelines both on \n     export control and nonproliferation and on the control of \n     high-risk personal property and ordered the Operations and \n     Field Offices to put a moratorium on release of equipment or \n     materials until they certified in writing that procedures \n     were in place to implement the new policies.\n\n                         (B) Computer equipment\n\n       During the Governmental Affairs Committee's review of the \n     INEL/Johansen affair, we discovered that in addition to \n     buying surplus nuclear reprocessing equipment, Mr.Johansen \n     also obtained more mundane, but potentially as disturbing, \n     surplus equipment from INEL. It was alleged to the Committee \n     that Johansen had obtained a number of surplus computers, and \n     that some of these computers contained national security \n     sensitive or restricted data. Sen. Glenn asked the General \n     Accounting Office to investigate this allegation, and their \n     report, ``Department of Energy Procedures Lacking to Protect \n     Computerized Data'' (GAO/AIMD-95-118), was delivered to him \n     in June 1995.\n       GAO discovered that INEL had sold at least 25, and possibly \n     as many as 50, surplus personal computers to Mr Johansen. \n     Unfortunately because INEL's records were so poor, it was not \n     possible to determine exactly how many computers were sold, \n     or, more importantly, whether they contained national \n     security sensitive or restricted data. GAO reported that a \n     review by the DOE Idaho Operations Chief Information Office \n     concluded that some of the computers sold to the salvage \n     dealer may have contained sensitive data, but did not \n     determine how many. The review reached this conclusion \n     primarily because DOE's contractors involved in excessing \n     computers with sensitive data possibly stored on the hard \n     drives did not have written procedures explaining how to \n     properly remove such data.\n       Of the 25 computers which Mr. Johansen was confirmed to \n     have purchased, GAO was only able to receive positive \n     assurance that 11 of them were not used to process classified \n     or sensitive data. GAO examined 4 computers directly and \n     found that they contained numerous data files related to \n     DOE's spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management \n     program, but these files were not found to be sensitive.\n       The General Services Administration has issued a \n     government-wide regulation (entitled FIRMR Bulletin C-22) \n     which applies to DOE and directs agencies to develop internal \n     procedures to ensure the proper disposition of sensitive \n     automated equipment, including personal computers. This \n     regulation applies to contractors acting on behalf of the \n     government as well. While DOE circulated FIRMR Bulletin C-22 \n     to its field and operations offices, it has not ensured that \n     these procedures are being fully implemented. And, as noted \n     above, DOE contractors do not have procedures that instruct \n     them on how to properly dispose of excess ADP equipment; thus \n     DOE cannot ensure that all excess computers are properly \n     ``sanitized''. This has been a common theme at INEL, as well \n     as at other sites. While DOE's formal policies and rules \n     exist on paper and are often sufficient as policies, they are \n     not being implemented at the working or ground level.\n       This incident points to a potential gap throughout the DOE \n     system regarding surplus computers. The Department should \n     take immediate steps to implement procedures to ensure that \n     surplus computers are properly sanitized of classified, \n     restricted or sensitive data. In the absence of a more formal \n     policy, the default policy of the DOE should be to sanitize \n     all computers before they are surplused, thus ensuring that \n     the inadvertant release of sensitive data will occur.\n       In response to the GAO report, DOE issued two memoranda to \n     its operations and field offices asking them to ensure \n     implementation of procedures to sanitize surplus computers at \n     all sites, to review their procedures for sanitizing surplus \n     computers and to make necessary changes to bring them into \n     conformity with the appropriate regulations. In addition, \n     during FY96, DOE committed to provide guidance to its sites \n     on Bulletin C-22 and to issue the new Information Systems \n     Protection Program Manual and Guidelines.\n\n                   Sandia and Los Alamos, New Mexico\n\n       In a 1994 report (DOE/IG-0343), the IG reported equipment \n     with a value of $389,000 missing at Sandia. The IG testified \n     at a March 17, 1994 hearing held by the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee that computer equipment, machine tools, \n     furniture and rolls of cable were left outside in the open \n     for extended periods of time. When Sandia officials tried to \n     re-use some of this equipment, they discovered that it was \n     useless, ruined from over-exposure to the elements. Other \n     equipment was improperly mixed with radiologically-\n     contaminated items.\n       Furthermore, the IG found that a number of excess property \n     items, reported as being in good working order by their \n     property custodians, were listed as salvage or scrap after \n     being declared excess. Some were computers, which their \n     property custodian had thought were to be sent to the \n     University of New Mexico. Instead, the equipment went to the \n     outdoor lay down yards, marked ``salvage'' or ``scrap.''\n       The new Sandia Management and Operating Contract between \n     DOE and the new contractor follows DOE property regulations \n     more closely than did the old contract. The DOE Albuquerque \n     Operations Office took a number of steps to remedy the flaws \n     identified by the IG's investigation, including the review of \n     Sandia's property management system, which DOE initially \n     disapproved in August, 1994. Sandia then revised its property \n     management system, which was conditionally approved in \n     December, 1995, with the next review scheduled for April, \n     1997.\n       At Los Alamos, a 1993 IG report (DOE/IG-0338) estimated \n     that the lab could not account for as much as $100 million in \n     personal property, including computers, x-ray machines, and \n     oscilloscopes. The IG estimated that another $207 million \n     might be inaccurately inventoried, and that $62 million could \n     not be inventoried. The IG identified four reasons for such \n     poor property management: (1) Los Alamos users did not follow \n     required procedures when moving property; (2) Los Alamos did \n     not hold employees financially liable and personally \n     accountable for missing, damaged or destroyed property; (3) \n     Los Alamos's database did not maintain accurate information; \n     and (4) Los Alamos did not ensure that loans of personal \n     property to employees and others were adequately justified. \n     In addition, the Albuquerque Operations Office failed to \n     monitor Los Alamos's handling of personal property in \n     accordance with Department regulations.\n       The Department disagreed with the $100 million estimate of \n     unaccounted-for property, but acknowledged that Los Alamos's \n     data base was so inaccurate that it could not validate the \n     estimate from the database. During the audit, Los Alamos \n     conducted a wall-to-wall inventory of personal property. \n     Following the reconciliation of the wall-to-wall inventory, \n     Los Alamos requested, and DOE approved, a write-off of nearly \n     $10 million in acquisition value of equipment.\n       The Albuquerque Operations Office and Los Alamos have taken \n     a number of corrective actions to respond directly to the \n     four deficiencies noted above. In addition, Los Alamos's \n     property management system, in a status of ``Disapproved'' in \n     January, 1994, has since been approved. Finally, DOE reports \n     that Los Alamos's inventory trends have substantially \n     improved.\n\n               Central Training Academy (CTA), New Mexico\n\n       In a August 1, 1991 hearing held by the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs, we learned that the Department and its \n     site contractor may have been using wiretaps and surveillance \n     equipment to covertly monitor whistleblowers at Hanford. \n     Subsequently, on August 13, 1991, the Undersecretary of \n     Energy ordered that all surveillance\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\n     equipment stored at the various DOE sites be transferred to \n     CTA (a DOE training facility for security and other \n     activities) until such time as legal and logistical \n     arrangements could be made to transfer this property to \n     Federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies. Items \n     containing either secret audio or visual (or both) recorders \n     included sprinkler heads, radios, speakers, a notebook \n     binder, a pencil sharpener, an envelope, and a baseball cap, \n     among others. Further, DOE's Director of the Office of \n     Intelligence and National Security issued a memorandum on \n     November 9, 1993 affirming Department policy prohibiting \n     ``the conduct of surveillance activities and the possession \n     and/or use of surveillance equipment for any purpose.'' \n     Exceptions could only be made for ``law enforcement agencies/\n     elements operating under . . . court order.'' In sum, DOE was \n     to be getting out of the surveillance business.\n       Over three years after the Undersecretary's directive \n     sending surveillance equipment to the CTA for temporary \n     storage, a December 1994 IG report (DOE/IG-0365) stated that \n     none of the equipment had been transferred to Federal, state, \n     or local law enforcement, nor were there any arrangements to \n     make such transfers as had been ordered by the \n     Undersecretary. Further, the CTA's inventory records were \n     incomplete. There were no records or receipts for more than \n     100 pieces of surveillance equipment stored at CTA. Finally, \n     the IG noted a April 20, 1994 memo from the Director, Office \n     of Safeguards and Security to its field personnel. The memo \n     stated the Department might be able to achieve an agreement \n     to obtain ``a telephonic court order'' to use the equipment \n     in a ``security emergency condition'', in which case the CTA \n     ``will be requested to return to you specific Special \n     Response Team equipment currently in storage.'' This memo \n     seemingly contradicts both the 1991 and 1993 directive.\n       In April, 1995, the Department responded to the IG report, \n     stating that the CTA technical surveillance equipment (TSE) \n     had been inventoried and then transferred to the FBI and the \n     National Park Service and that no TSE remained at the CTA. \n     The Department position further stated: ``The Director, \n     Office of Nonproliferation and National Security will not \n     authorize the general, unrestricted use of covert \n     surveillance operations and equipment.'' We note the \n     Department's renunciation of ``general, unrestricted use'' of \n     covert surveillance, but we strongly recommend that DOE be \n     asked to clearly and precisely explain the circumstances \n     under which it thinks it would be entitled to engage in \n     covert surveillance.\n\n                             Fernald, Ohio\n\n       A February 1993 IG report (DOE/IG-0320) found that the \n     outgoing Fernald contractor did not dispose of excess \n     government equipment properly. Public sales of surplus \n     equipment were not advertised, minimum prices were not \n     established, and cash collection was not adequately \n     controlled. The contractor also mixed radiologically \n     contaminated equipment with uncontaminated equipment, which \n     meant that the commingled equipment had to be classified as \n     low level waste and sent to the Nevada Test Site for \n     disposal. The net result of these improper practices, \n     according to the IG, was that DOE incurred unnecessary costs \n     and lost revenues of over $117,000 and equipment with a net \n     book value of over $245,000 was improperly disposed of. Upon \n     review, the DOE contracting officer allowed these costs. The \n     bigger concern was that DOE would be vulnerable to larger \n     losses as Fernald disposed of $27.8 million in excess \n     equipment during site cleanup. Accordingly, the Fernald Field \n     Office suspended sales of excess equipment until DOE approved \n     proper sales procedures. Fernald submitted a property control \n     system encompassing sales of property, which was approved in \n     July, 1995. Fernald has resumed sales of excess property.\n       Other problems, as well as some progress, were found at \n     Fernald. In 1993, Fernald, in its first complete physical \n     inventory since the 1950s, identified $2.3 million in missing \n     equipment, and in 1994, identified and declared more than $5 \n     million of personal property as excess. These were good \n     steps. However, a November 1994 IG report (ER-B-95-02) found \n     that Fernald, under a new contractor, had incurred costs of \n     $642,000 for purchase and storage of furniture in excess of \n     needs. Further costs were incurred because of damage from \n     mishandling. Moreover, storage practices placed supply items \n     at risk of radiological contamination and inventory records \n     were inaccurate. The IG also found that Fernald employees \n     lacked the training to properly account for Government \n     property. Fernald and the Ohio Field Office committed to a \n     number of steps to respond to these problems.\n\n                          Oak Ridge, Tennessee\n\n       A 1994 GAO analysis (GAO/RCED-94-249R) of property \n     management activities at Oak Ridge found that the site prime \n     contractor, Martin Marietta, had no system to monitor \n     subcontractor use and possession of government-owned \n     equipment. As a result, neither DOE and nor the prime \n     contractor know which subcontractors have government \n     property, what property they have, and how much its value is. \n     Further, the prime contractor has not moved to implement a \n     system that tracks and accounts for property held by its \n     subcontractors, even though this problem has been \n     consistently raised in DOE reviews since at least 1988. DOE \n     concurred with the GAO findings, and directed the Oak Ridge \n     Operations Office to develop a corrective action plan, which \n     DOE Headquarters would review. The problem of inadequate \n     oversight of subcontractors by the prime contractor is likely \n     to occur at sites other than Oak Ridge.\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       Given the findings of this report, the history of property \n     mismanagement at DOE, continued downsizing, existing legal \n     requirements and directives, and the planned asset \n     disposition program, the staff recommends that the Department \n     take the following steps to improve its property management \n     program.\n\n     (1) Create an Office of Property and Asset Management (OPAM).\n\n       This is our principal recommendation. We urge the \n     establishment of a policy-level office based in Washington \n     with authority to oversee field activity. As has been noted \n     throughout this report, fragmented and poorly coordinated \n     property management policies and practices have lead to many \n     abuses in the field. If done properly, centralization of this \n     responsibility should help prevent future abuses. The Office \n     would report directly to the Secretary.\n       The mission and responsibilities of this policy-level \n     office would be to:\n       (1) coordinate the implementation of the various internal \n     property management initiatives;\n       (2) coordinate policy response to the legal property \n     management directives (i.e. Stevenson-Wydler, Federal \n     Property Act, Defense Authorization Act requirements, and any \n     future asset disposition legislation);\n       (3) track and provide top-level management for asset sales;\n       (4) develop consistent, department-wide inventory practices \n     and procedures that includes review and feedback procedures \n     on current property management systems;\n       (5) consolidate existing personal property, real property, \n     and asset management programs into one HQ office;\n       (6) develop long term (5, 10 year) property and asset \n     management plans;\n       (7) conduct property and asset management oversight of \n     field and program offices;\n       (8) establish property management perfomance standards as \n     part of personnel evaluations for appropriate personnel;\n       (9) develop and recommend changes to accounting systems to \n     better track and manage property and assets;\n       (10) search for and evaluate new technologies that may be \n     used to better inventory and track personal property; and\n       (11) establish training courses and programs on sound \n     property management policies and procedures;\n       The Office should also work closely with the DOE offices in \n     charge of nonproliferation, national security and export \n     controls to ensure that property with national security \n     implications are disposed of properly. The Office should also \n     consult and coordinate with the DOE environmental management \n     programs to ensure that contaminated property is \n     appropriately controlled. Furthermore, the Office should \n     establish appropriate procedures to meet the requirements and \n     further the missions of economic development and technology \n     transfer, in cooperation with the Office of Worker and \n     Community Transition and the Office of Technology \n     Utilization.\n\n   (2) Review existing property management rules, orders and guidance\n\n       Through the OPAM, the Department should review existing \n     rules, orders and guidance concerning the control of personal \n     property, and issue new rules, or strengthen or clarify \n     existing rules, as appropriate, pertaining to the following: \n     Demilitarization procedures for appropriate equipment; \n     sanitization of data contained on computers; export controls \n     over nonproliferation or national security sensitive items; \n     decontamination and disposal procedures for environmentally-\n     contaminated property; reporting and investigative procedures \n     when theft is a possibility; and priorities and procedures \n     governing release of equipment for economic development, \n     educational and other non-Departmental purposes. The Office \n     should report annually to Congress on the results of this \n     review.\n\n   (3) Improve and coordinate property management oversight with the \n                     General Services Agency (GSA)\n\n       DOE and GSA should jointly develop a plan to exercise more \n     rigorous oversight over DOE's disposal of property in \n     accordance with the Federal Property Act and, within one \n     year, report to the Governmental Affairs Committee on its \n     plan and the results of the plan.\n\n (4) Incorporate strong property management principles in DOE contracts\n\n       DOE should continue to incorporate performance-based \n     standards in personal property management as new M & O \n     contracts are awarded, and extend those standards to \n     subcontractor management of equipment. DOE should evaluate \n     how well each principal management and operating contractor \n     oversees its subcontractors who maintain and operate \n     government equipment. It should explore contractual methods \n     of linking M's performance (and payment) to their \n     subcontractors property management performance.\n\n    (5) Hold contractor and civil service personnel accountable for \n                       property management abuses\n\n       DOE should take appropriate disciplinary action against DOE \n     and field personnel responsible for the most egregious abuses \n     in\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\n     disposal of personal property. It should modify DOE personnel \n     procedures and practices to hold DOE field and line personnel \n     accountable for future implementation of effective personal \n     property systems as well as develop incentive system to \n     reward and encourage innovative property management \n     successes.\n\n       (6) Allocate additional resources for property management\n\n       Where cost effective, DOE and Congress should dedicate more \n     resources and FTEs to personal property management at both \n     headquarters and in the field.\n\n                         (7) Report to Congress\n\n       We recognize that DOE is taking several of the steps we are \n     recommending, and we wish both to commend DOE for its \n     initiative, and to reinforce the importance of those actions. \n     We recommend that DOE report back in writing in one year to \n     the Congress, and in particluar to the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, on the consideration given to, and the \n     implementation of, the recommendations contained in this \n     report. DOE's report to Congress should emphasize observed \n     and measurable improvements in property management resulting \n     from these efforts.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The Department has made encouraging efforts to correct the \n     problems and abuses detailed in this report. Still, we \n     believe the Department can and must do more. That's why this \n     report includes specific recommendations--including the \n     creation of an Office of Property and Asset Management--for \n     corrective measures DOE should take as part of a \n     comprehensive plan to remedy its chronic property management \n     problems. These measures do not need legislation to be \n     implemented, but, if the Department ignores them, we may \n     recommend that they be incorporated into legislation.\n       The proposed Office of Property and Asset Management will \n     force the Department to address the issue of personal \n     property disposal as it downsizes, and to ensure such \n     disposal is done in the best interest of the taxpayer. The \n     Department has announced that it plans to save $14 billion \n     over 5 years from downsizing and budget reductions and that \n     sales of surplus assets are expected to generate at least \n     $110 million by September 30, 2003. However, without further \n     improvements in personal property management, and without the \n     sustained higher priority for property management that the \n     Office proposed in this report will provide, it is likely \n     that we will continue to see abuses take place as the \n     Department implements its downsizing plan.\n\n\n                               REFERENCES\n\n           Portsmouth, Ohio--Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant\n\n       Case No.I93CN015 Administrative Report to Management, \n     Office of Inspector General; (January 3, 1995).\n       (No number) Release of Nuclear-Related Property and \n     Associated Documentation by the Department of Energy since \n     1989; (Deputy Assistant Secretary For Security Evaluations, \n     DOE; December 1994).\n\n                         Rocky Flats, Colorado\n\n       DOE/IG-0329, Inspection of Management of Excess Personal \n     Property at Rocky Flats; (May 1993).\n       GAO/RCED-94-77, The Property Management System at the Rocky \n     Flats Plant in Inadequate; (March 1994).\n       GAO/OSI-95-4, Poor Property Management Allowed \n     Vulnerability to Theft at Rocky Flats; (July 1995).\n       GAO/RCED-96-39, Property Management Has Improved at DOE's \n     Rocky Flats Site; (December 1995).\n       GAO/RCED-96-149R, Military Equipment at Rocky Flats; (June \n     1996).\n\n               Management of Arms and Military Equipment\n\n       DOE/IG-0385, Special Audit Report on the Department of \n     Energy's Arms and Military-Type Equipment (February 1996).\n\n                  Idaho National Engineering Laboratory\n\n       (No number) The Sale of Reprocessing Equipment at the Idaho \n     National Engineering Laboratory; (Deputy Assistant Secretary/\n     Security Evaluation, DOE; September 2, 1994).\n       GAO/AIMD-95-118, Department of Energy Procedures Lacking \n     to Protect Computerized Data; (June 1995).\n       WR-B-96-04, Audit of Fuel Processing Restoration Property \n     (October 1995).\n\n                   Sandia and Los Alamos, New Mexico\n\n       DOE/IG-0338, Audit of Personal Property Management at Los \n     Alamos National Laboratory (December 1993).\n       DOE/IG-0343, The Inspection of the Management of Excess \n     Personal Property at Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, \n     New Mexico (March 1994).\n\n               Central Training Academy (CTA), New Mexico\n\n       DOE/IG-0365, Report on the Inspection of the Status of the \n     Disposal of Technical Surveillance Equipment at the Central \n     Training Academy Albuquerque, New Mexico; (December 1994).\n\n                             Fernald, Ohio\n\n       DOE/IG-0320, Disposal of Excess Capital Equipment at the \n     Fernald Environmental Management Project--Fernald, Ohio; \n     (February 1993).\n       ER-B-95-02, Report on Audit of Property Management at \n     Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corporation; \n     (November 1994).\n\n                          Oak Ridge, Tennessee\n\n       GAO/RCED-94-249R, Department of Energy's Property \n     Management (July 1994).\n\n                      Background on Several Sites\n\n       DOE/IG-0344, Summary Report on the Department of Energy's \n     Management of Personal Property; (March 1994).\n       GAO/RCED-94-154FS, Status of DOE's Property Management \n     Program (April 1994).\n\n  Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to place \nin the Record the remarks of a great American statesman who I and many \nof us had the privilege to watch being recognized in the White House on \nJanuary 17. I speak to Senator Bob Dole and his leadership in our \nNation, his statesmanship, his patriotism, and especially the comments \nhe made in receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom on January 17.\n  I think we were all captivated in the evening news by the great humor \nof Bob Dole--after this very prestigious ceremony in the East Room of \nthe White House with the President offering up one of these most \ncoveted recognitions in our Nation for the leader, Bob Dole, former \nPresidential candidate--when he stepped forward and in humor began to \nrecite his oath of office.\n  That statement overshadowed the statement that was to follow, and \nthat was the statement by Bob Dole as to his feelings and his emotions \nthat are a part of the person that you, Mr. President, and I have grown \nto know and respect over the years as it relates to his Americanism, \nhis leadership, and his patriotism.\n  So it is with that in mind that I insert into the Record this \nafternoon the statement that Senator Dole made that afternoon, this \nJanuary 17, at the White House as he received the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. It was a beautiful statement. It was an emotional statement. \nAnd for all of us who were there, it was the statement of a man who we \nhad grown to know and who we knew as a Senator from Kansas, who we knew \nas a Presidential candidate, but most importantly a man who we knew as \na leader of the U.S. Senate, a great American, a great American \nstatesman, and a great American patriot.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Bob \nDole as he received his Presidential Medal of Freedom award be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks of Senator Bob Dole on Receipt of the Presidential Medal of \n                       Freedom; January 17, 1997\n\n       Mr. President, no one can claim to be equal to this honor. \n     But I will cherish it as long as I live, because this \n     occasion allows me to honor some others who are more \n     entitled. At every stage of my life, I have been a witness to \n     the greatness of this country.\n       I have seen American soldiers bring hope and leave graves \n     in every corner of the world. I have seen this Nation \n     overcome Depression and segregation and Communism, turning \n     back mortal threats to human freedom. And I have stood in awe \n     of American courage and decency--virtues so rare in history, \n     and so common in this precious place.\n       I can vividly remember the first time I walked into the \n     Capitol as a Member of Congress. It was an honor beyond the \n     dreams of a small town. I felt part of something great and \n     noble. Even playing a small role seemed like a high calling. \n     Because America was the hope of history.\n       I have never questioned that faith in victory or in honest \n     defeat. And the day I left office, it was undiminished. I \n     know there are some who doubt these ideals. And I suspect \n     there are young men and women who have not been adequately \n     taught them. So let me leave a message to the future.\n       I have found honor in the profession of politics. I have \n     found vitality in the American experiment. Our challenge is \n     not to question American ideals, or replace them, but to act \n     worthy of them.\n       I have been in Government at moments when politics was \n     elevated by courage into history--when the Civil Rights Act \n     was\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\n     passed--when the Americans With Disabilities Act became law. \n     No one who took part in those honorable causes can doubt that \n     public service, at its best, is noble.\n       The moral challenges of our time can seem less clear. But \n     they still demand conviction and courage and character. They \n     still require young men and women with faith in our process. \n     They still demand idealists, captured by the honor and \n     adventure of service. They still demand citizens who accept \n     responsibility and who defy cynicism, affirming the American \n     faith, and renewing her hope.

May God bless you, and each inhabitant of this House, \n     and may God bless America.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, very much, Mr. President, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I ask for some unanimous-consent \nagreements and do the close, I want to commend, also, the remarks of \nSenator Dole that were just printed in the Record by the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho. I attended the ceremony where Senator Dole received \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom. I must say, it was one of the most \ninspiring events I have ever attended.\n  First of all, I think the President deserves credit for presenting \nthis very deserving leader of our country the Medal of Freedom.\n  Second, I think I have probably never been to an event where there \nwas more of a combination of a feeling of good will, appreciation for \nour veterans, patriotism and humility and humor, all wrapped in one \nevent. It was really an inspiration.\n  Bob Dole's remarks, which are in the Record, are typical of Bob. He \nsaid almost nothing about the fact that he was receiving this honor, \nother than the fact that he would cherish it. He, instead, chose to \ntalk about American soldiers and the service they gave and the American \nexperiment, Government, history--magnificent remarks. Also, he had that \nspecial moment of history where I thought for a moment he was going to \nbe sworn in to be President of the United States instead of being given \nthe Medal of Freedom.\n  It was a tremendous occasion. I am very proud that Bob Dole received \nthis recognition, and I am delighted we put his statement in the Record \nfor all Americans to read it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S801-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-930.

This House calls upon the President of the United States \n     and the Congress of the United States to undertake all \n     appropriate actions to encourage the government of \n     Switzerland to establish a fund consisting of the monies in \n     any unclaimed accounts in Swiss banks belonging to victims of \n     the Holocaust and to make those monies available to Holocaust \n     survivors throughout the world who are indigent and in need \n     of financial assistance.\n       2.

A bill to establish a locally oriented commission to assist \nthe city of Berlin, NH, in identifying and studying its region's \nhistorical and cultural assets, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 THE BERLIN, NH, COMMISSION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of Berlin, NH, and to introduce legislation that will \nassist Berlin in preserving this history.\n  While the city of Berlin is 100 years old this year, its history goes \nback further. The first settlers came to Berlin for no apparent reason. \nThey were farmers and the land there did not promise to be any more \nfruitful than the land they left just down the Androscoggin River; but, \nthey were restless and independent so they came across the mountains to \nstart a new community in this isolated area.\n  The Plantation of Maynesborough, as Berlin was called, was named \nafter the most illustrious of the English gentlemen to whom it was \ngranted by the Crown in 1771. Although the land was rugged and it was a \nhard place to live, food was plentiful. The woods consisting of \nseemingly endless stands of timber were filled with deer and game; the \nbrooks and river were loaded with trout.\n  Those first farmers who made the move from down the river found good \nfarmland upstream from the falls. In 1824, William Sessions cleared 5 \nacres of land on the east side of the river and came back in 1825 with \nhis nephew to plant crops and build a log house. William Sessions did \nnot stay around long enough to see Maynesborough become officially \nincorporated as the city of Berlin 1897, but his nephew Cyrus Wheeler \ndid.\n  Nearly half a century before, however, the character of Berlin began \nits change from farms to industry. In 1851, J.B. Brown and three other \nbusinessmen from Portland, ME, formed a partnership under the name of \nH. Winslow & Co. and purchased the land on top of the falls. They \nstarted a successful lumber business in the thick forest and used the \nnatural water power of the river to power their mill. The J.B. Brown \nCo., saw the railroad coming to Berlin, thus, opening a direct line of \ntransportation to Portland and market centers for the first time.\n  In the 1920's, Berlin, NH, was the capital of the papermaking world \nand was becoming known as the city that trees built. The Brown family's \nBerlin Mills Co., controlled 3 million acres in New England and Quebec \nand was world renowned for cutting-edge forestry, research, and \npapermaking. The mills along the Androscoggin River made not only pulp \nand an array of paper products but also lumber, wood flour, conduit \npipes, and furniture. Brown's staff of 4,000 to 5,000 swelled Berlin to \na population of 20,000.\n  The growth of Berlin reflects the diversity of people who came to \nstay: French Canadians, Yankees from northern New England farms, \nNorwegians, Italians, Irish, and Russians. They sought a chance to make \na better living and found it in the mills, blacksmith shops, machine \nshops, farms,\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nstores, railroad yards, and in the winter logging camps. Berlin \ndeserves recognition for many other reasons as well. For example \ntupperware and the Feron Rap and Rule, the first retractable ruler, \nwere invented in Berlin. But one aspect of the city calls for special \nattention: Its heritage as a leader in introducing skiing to America.\n  Scandinavian immigrants were highly sought after by mill recruiters \nnot only for their expertise in logging, but also because they were \nacquainted with long, severe winters similar to those of the North \nCountry. They chose to develop their individual neighborhoods in \nclusters as did most of the immigrants. As a whole, the entire \nScandinavian neighborhood was commonly known as Norwegian Village. \nBecause of their love for winter, they, more than any other groups, \nforged the way for winter sports in Berlin. Both cross-country ski \nracing and competition ski jumping were introduced to the region by the \nScandinavian community. These events were featured at many of the \nwinter carnivals that Berlin hosted.\n  Other than its socioeconomic forest-based heritage, Berlin is \nprobably best known for its major contribution to the development of \nskiing in the country. The use of skis by newly arriving Scandinavians \nwas at first utilitarian, winter travel around the community. In time, \ncross-country ski racing became popular and Berlin became known as the \nCradle of Nordic Skiing in America. The Nansen Ski Club, which is named \nin honor of arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen, was founded in 1872 as the \nSkii Klubbin. Today, it remains the oldest continuously organized ski \nclub in the United States. Starting in the 1890's, skiers used a small \nhill in Norwegian Village to practice and perform their jumps.\n  Then, in 1936, a new jump was constructed here at this site thanks to \na cooperative effort between the city of Berlin and the Nansen Ski \nClub. This 80-meter jump has a 171.5-foot tower, a 225-foot vertical \ndrop, and a descent angle of approximately 37.5 degrees. For almost 50 \nyears, this was the largest ski jump in the Eastern United States and \nthe foremost jump in the country. Also, this was the site of all major \nchampionship ski jumping competitions, as well as many Olympic tryouts. \nSeveral famous ski jumpers were competitors here including a host of \nBerlinites who went on to compete in the Olympics.\n  Mr. President, I have only touched on a few of the historical aspects \nthat make Berlin, NH, unique. The legislation that I am introducing, \nthe Androscoggin River Valley Heritage Area Act, will establish a \nlocally oriented commission to assist the city of Berlin in identifying \nand studying its region's historical and cultural assets of the past \n100 years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Abraham, and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 228. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \ncontinuing appropriations in the absence of regular appropriations; to \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n\n\n                 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Senators Stevens, Hutchison, \nAbraham, Ashcroft, and I are introducing the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act. This bill creates a statutory continuing resolution \n[CR]--a safety net CR which would trigger only if the appropriations \nacts do not become law or if there is no governing CR in place. This \nlegislation ensures that the Government will not shutdown and that \nGovernment shutdowns cannot be used for political gains.\n  This safety net CR would set spending at the lowest of the following \nspending levels:\n  First, the previous year's appropriated levels;\n  Second, the House-passed appropriations bill;\n  Third, the Senate-passed appropriations bill;\n  Fourth, the President's budget request; or\n  Fifth, any levels established by an independent CR passed by the \nCongress subsequent to the passage of this act.\n  By setting the spending level for the safety net CR at the lowest \npossible level, there is new incentive to actually pass the \nappropriations bills on time. In addition, it restores the bias in \nappropriations negotiations toward saving the taxpayers money instead \nof spending it. We cannot afford another replay of last year's \nsuccessful effort by the administration that forced Congress to spend \nbillions more just to avoid a third Government shutdown. Passage of \nthis legislation will guarantee that we are not faced with a choice \nbetween a Government shutdown and spending taxpayer dollars \nirresponsibly.\n  We all saw the effects of gridlock last year. No one wins when the \nGovernment shuts down. Shutdowns only confirm the American people's \nsuspicions that we are more interested in political gain than doing the \nNation's business. The American people are tired of gridlock. They want \nthe Government to work for them--not against them.\n  The budget process in the last Congress was a fiasco. Our Founding \nFathers would have been ashamed by our inability to execute the power \nof the purse in a responsible fashion. I am sure they would have been \nquite shocked by the 27 days the Government was shut down, 13 \ncontinuing resolutions and almost $6 billion in blackmail money given \nto the administration to ensure that the Government did not shut down a \nthird time.\n  Although Republicans shouldered the blame for the Government \nshutdown, President Clinton and his Democrat colleagues were equally at \nfault for using it for their political gain. Republicans were outfoxed \nby President Clinton because we were not prepared for him to use the \nbudget process for his own political gains. We thought that by doing \nthe right thing--passing the first balanced budget in a generation and \nfiscally sound appropriations bills--we would eventually prevail. What \nwe did not realize was that President Clinton was more interested in \nplaying politics with the budget than actually balancing it. This year, \nwe have to be prepared for these games and launch a preemptive strike \nto ensure that basic Government operations will not be put at risk \nduring the next budget battle.\n  This legislation does not erode the power of the appropriators and \ngives them ample opportunity to do their job. It is only if the \nappropriations process is not completed by the beginning of the fiscal \nyear, as was the case in the last Congress that this safety net CR will \ngo into effect. In addition, I want to emphasize that entitlements are \nfully protected in the legislation. The bill specifically states that \nentitlements such as Social Security--as obligated by law--will be paid \nregardless of what appropriations bills are passed.\n  Mr. President, according to President Clinton the combined cost of \nlast year's Government shutdowns was $1.5 billion. However, this figure \ndoes not begin to account for the millions of dollars that were lost by \nsmall businesses who depend on the Government being open. In my State \nof Arizona, during the Government shutdown the Grand Canyon was closed \nfor the first time in 76 years. I heard from people who work close to \nthe Grand Canyon. These were not Government employees. They were \nindependent small businessmen and women. They told me that the shutdown \ncost them thousands of dollars because people couldn't go to the park. \nAccording to a CRS report, local communities near national parks lost \nan estimated $14.2 million per day in tourism revenues as a direct \nresult of the Government shutdown--for a total of nearly $400 million \nover the course of the shutdown.\n  The cost of the Government shutdown cannot be measured in just \ndollars and cents. During the shutdown millions of Americans could not \nget crucial social services. For example: 10,000 new Medicare \napplications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual \noffice visits, and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and \nassistance were turned away each day. There were even more delays in \nservices for some of the most vulnerable in our society including 13 \nmillion recipients of AFDC, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 \nchildren receiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head \nStart children. Not to mention the new patients that were not accepted \ninto clinical research centers, the 7 million visitors who could not \nattend national parks or the 2 million visitors turned away at museums \nand monuments. And the list could go on and on.\n  In addition our Federal employees were left in fear wondering whether\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nthey would be paid, would they have to go to work or would they be able \nto pay their bills on time. In my State of Arizona for example, of the \n40,383 Federal employees over 15,000 of them were furloughed in the \nlast Government shutdown. I do not want to put these workers at risk \never again.\n  A 1991 GAP report confirmed that permanent funding lapse legislation \nas necessary. In their report they stated, ``shutting down the \nGovernment during temporary funding gaps is an inappropriate way to \nencourage compromise on the budget.''\n  Mr. President, neither party can afford another break of faith with \nthe American people. Our constituents are tired of constantly being \ndisappointed by the actions of Congress and the President. They are \ntired of us not being prepared for what appears to be the inevitable. \nThis is why this legislation is so important. We want the American \npeople to know that there are some of us in Congress who are thinking \nahead and who do not want a replay of the last Congress.\n  I want to especially note the support of my good friend Senator \nStevens, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. His support of this bill is crucial and I \nthank him for it. I wish him well in overseeing the appropriations \nprocess. While I am sure we will have our differences, I am confident \nthat he will do his best to ensure that the Senate enacts the \nappropriations bills in an efficient and expeditious manner.\n  Let us show the American people that we learned our lessons from the \nlast Congress. Passing this preventive measure will go a long way to \nrestore American's faith that politics or stalled negotiations will not \nstop government operations. It will prove to our constituents that we \nwill never again allow a Government shutdown, or the threat of a \nGovernment shutdown, to be used for political gain. I hope the Senate \nwill act quickly on this important matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 229. A bill to provide for a voluntary system of public financing \nof Federal elections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN CAMPAIGNS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nthe Public Confidence in Campaigns Act of 1997 for Senator Murray and \nmyself. We chose that title because the purpose of the bill is to \nestablish public finance of political campaigns in this country.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill, of course, is the topic right now. That is \nthe one that the press talks about. That is the one that everybody in \nthe Senate is looking at. I am for the McCain-Feingold bill--and I have \nthe utmost respect for the authors of the bill--but I can tell you that \nthe McCain-Feingold bill is only a small step in the right direction, \nif the people of this body are really interested in reversing the \npervasive cynicism about the political process that is abroad in our \ncountry.\n  Everybody knows that the money game is out of control in politics. \nContributions during the last 2 years--that is, soft money and hard \nmoney combined--was up 73 percent from 1993 and 1994. You think about \nit. A 73-percent increase. I have no reason to believe that the \nincrease will not be another 50 to 100 percent in the 2-year cycle \nprior to the year 2000. Why wouldn't the American people be cynical? \nThe average Senate race today costs $4 million. I have never spent more \nthan $1.5 million, not because of choice but because I am a lousy \nfundraiser. I never had it. But the average Senate race is $4 million. \nIn California, $20 to $25 million is now typical for each of the \ncandidates.\n  More and more millionaires are running for Congress because it is \nobvious that money dictates the outcome. Ninety percent of the people \nwho are elected to Congress spent more money than their opponents. That \nmeans if you are a millionaire, or if you have the ability to raise \nmore money than your opponent, you have a 90-percent chance of being \nelected. That is what the statistics show. The Congress is supposed to \nbe a microcosm of America. There are at least 25 to 35 millionaires in \nthe U.S. Senate. There are hardly 25 percent of the American people who \nare millionaires.\n  In 1995 and 1996, 400 corporations, labor unions, and individuals--\n400--gave the two major parties $100,000 or more in soft money. I \nrepeat: Soft and hard money to the political parties is up 73 percent \nin 2 years. Even the stock market has not gone up that fast. And \nrightly or wrongly the cynicism of the American people about our \npolitical system is reflected in the small number of people in this \ncountry who contribute to campaigns. Why? Because ``Joe Lunch Bucket'' \nout there has this nagging suspicion that $100,000 contributions, \n$500,000 contributions, or even $5,000 individual contributions, are \ncompletely out of his league. He knows that his $10 or $15 is going \nnowhere. That is the one of the reasons he does not bother to vote. He \nhas no confidence in his own ability to participate and make a \ndifference, the very foundation of a democracy. And ``Joe Lunch \nBucket'' knows that people who give $100,000 are not giving money out \nof patriotism and altruism.\n  For the whole process of Federal election in the last 2 years the \nparties and the individual candidates spent $2 billion. That is a \nstaggering sum of money. Campaign spending 20 years ago when we started \nreforming the system was a mere fraction of $2 billion.\n  This morning, yesterday morning, every morning you pick up the \nWashington Post and the New York Times, and you'll see a story in there \nabout the influence of money. It isn't just soft money given by \nIndonesians or aliens. The Times last week had a story showing that \nMembers who vote right on particular issues get five times as much \nmoney later on from the people who benefit from that right vote than \nthey had gotten in the past.\n  As long as we finance campaigns the way we are financing them now, \nthe Post and the Times will continue to have a field day, and the \nMembers of Congress will be like gladiators in the arena for the \namusement and enjoyment of people who like to watch the battle. I am \nnot being critical of the press for reporting these stories. All I am \nsaying is that democracy is threatened by cynicism.\n  The formula for voluntary limits in the McCain-Feingold bill is a \nstep in the right direction. It's the same formula we have in our bill: \n$400,000 plus 30 cents for the first 4 million eligible voters in your \nState; 25 cents for every eligible voter over 4 million with a minimum \nof $950,000 and maximum of $5.5 million. My State of Arkansas would get \nthe minimum, $950,000, in a Senate race, and a maximum of $5.5 million \nwould apply in California. And the figure of $5.5 million as a maximum \nis not an inducement for a Senate candidate in California to accept \npublic funding and comply with that kind of a maximum when they are \nspending $20 to $25 million each in California. But let us admit it: \nEven $5.5 million is an obscene amount of money. That is what you get \nif you voluntarily limit the amount of money you are going to spend. If \nyou agree, if you are from Arkansas, to accept $950,000, in the general \nelection you will get full funding from the U.S. Treasury. And I will \ncome back to where the money comes from in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, there is a fundamental question being asked in this \ncountry. And, if it isn't being asked, it ought to be; that is, how \nlong can a democracy survive when the laws we pass and the people we \nelect depend on how much special interest money is put into a campaign? \nAnd consider the fact that the candidate with the most money wins 90 \npercent of the time. That speaks volumes. When you consider the fact \nthat if you vote right on a bill that benefits somebody, and you get \nfive times as much money from that somebody as you got in the past, \nthat speaks volumes. Of course, our democracy is threatened when we \ncontinue this money game.\n  There is a study by the Library of Congress--and anybody who is \ninterested in it, if they will drop me a line or call me, I will send \nthem a copy of it--of campaign finance in 19 nations. And other than \nthe United States only 1 of the 19 nations, Malaysia, finances \ncampaigns with private contributions. We are the only Western nation \nthat finances campaigns with private contributions in this way.\n\n  Mr. President, we may not pass this bill, but until a public finance \nbill\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\npasses, the media will continue to have a field day, and you can expect \na story, not because you did anything illegal or unethical, but you can \ndepend on a story anytime you vote on a major piece of legislation if \nanybody who benefited from that gave you money in the last election in \nany significant amount. And the people will harbor those same \nsuspicions.\n  Why would the people of this body and the House of Representatives \nnot want to get rid of such a system? They are the ones who are most \nvulnerable, to say nothing of the destruction of our democracy. Even \nunder the McCain-Feingold bill, which I will support, you still are \ngoing to have special interest money, and it is not going to eliminate \nthe basic problem, which is cynicism about what that money buys.\n  So, Mr. President, it is an interesting thing that the people of this \nbody--and I have talked to a number trying to recruit cosponsors, \nRepublicans and Democrats--almost without exception say, ``I know \npublic financing is where we are going, but not yet. Later.''\n  Why later? McCain-Feingold has gotten all the attention, and perhaps \nMcCain-Feingold is the most we can hope for this year, but it is time \nto start the debate on the public finance legislation that everybody in \nthis body knows is absolutely essential to our future. It is going to \npass. I may not be here when it passes, but I can promise you it is \ngoing to pass.\n  Everybody is playing the stock market today. The market has been on a \nroll, up about 30 percent in 1996. You cannot lose. Just put it on \nanything, they say. You cannot lose. I will tell you of a better \ninvestment than putting your money in the stock market, and that is to \nput your money into this Congressional Election Campaign Fund we are \nproposing and take special interest money out of the political process. \nYou talk about a return on your investment. That will be the biggest \nreturn America ever got on every dollar it puts in.\n  People in the coffee shops of America do not do as they used to. One \ntime about 2 years ago, I was in my hometown in the coffee shop where I \nused to drink coffee in this little town of 1,500, 2,000 people, and \nthe subject came up with some of my old coffee-drinking buddies about \npublic financing. The first thing I heard was, ``I don't want my tax \nmoney going to politicians to finance campaigns.'' And I gave that \nfriend of mine a lesson in 103-A civics and 103-A economics. No. 1, he \nhas a civic duty to participate, which he does not do. He is not giving \nany of his private money, which is his right, and he does not want his \ntax money to be used, which is an abdication of his responsibility and \nan abdication of everything he believes about campaign finance because \nhe is willing to let the rich people and wealthy organizations of the \ncountry give the money and yet it causes the very cynicism he \nexemplifies and that we are trying to remedy.\n  Why would the people of this body say ``later'' to public finance? \nAdmittedly, 10 years ago, only 27 percent of the people believed public \nfinancing of campaigns was a good idea. But it has worked beautifully \nsince 1976 for the Presidential campaign, and it will work for us. Why \nwould it not? And why would Senators in 1997 be afraid to vote for \npublic financing of campaigns when 68 percent of the people in a Mark \nMellman Poll this fall said they favor the law in Maine, the only State \nin the Nation which has passed a full public funding campaign bill. And \n68 percent of the people, when you explain the Maine bill, say, ``I \nfavor it.'' And 65 percent of the people in this country in a Gallup \nPoll said they favored banning all private contributions and believed \nin 100 percent public financing of campaigns.\n  Let me describe the details of the bill very quickly and then I will \nintroduce the bill.\n  First of all, it establishes a Congressional Election Campaign Fund. \nAnd here is the way it works. When you file your tax returns today, \nthere is a provision there which says that if you would like to direct \n$3 of your tax payment to the Presidential campaign fund, check here. \nIt does not cost you a thing. You think about that. It does not cost \nyou a thing; it is deducted from your taxes, and yet people are \ndeclining all the time to check the $3 contribution box even though \ntheir taxes are reduced by $3. It is really Federal funds. And yet we \nhave to constantly prop people up and tell them it is their patriotic \nduty to contribute to that.\n\n  I found it very healthy in the last campaign to know that Senator \nDole and President Clinton were using money in equal amounts. They were \nnot out asking for private contributions. Each one of them said, ``I \nwill participate,'' and each one of them received about $60 million, \nand they got along just fine.\n  Under our bill, you can give $10, if you want, $3 to the Presidential \ncampaign, $7 to the congressional campaign. As I said, that $10 \ncontribution will pay you bigger dividends by far than any investment \nyou ever made in your life. You will not have to worry why somebody \nvoted for or against a bill; at least you will know they did not do it \nbecause somebody gave them money in the last campaign or has promised \nto give them money in a future campaign. And, in addition to the $10, \nwe allow Americans to add on to their tax payment a contribution to the \nCongressional Election Campaign Fund. Wealthy people--and there are \nabout 5 times as many millionaires right now as there were 10 years \nago--would be allowed to give up to $5,000 to this campaign fund just \nbecause they are patriots. Up to $100 of this add-on is tax deductible. \nAnd if their spouses join in it, they have a $200 tax deduction. It is \nnot much, a small incentive. But wouldn't it be wonderful if all the \npeople worth $1 million, $5 million, $10 million in this country, or \neven those of ordinary means, would contribute $5,000 to that fund just \nbecause they love the country, believe in democracy and want to see it \nthrive?\n\n  We also have a provision that, if the fund runs dry, Congress will \nappropriate the deficiency. If Congress refuses to appropriate the \ndeficiency, then everybody will be reduced on a pro rata basis.\n  Let me repeat. You do not qualify for this money unless you agree to \nlimit your spending according to the formula that is set out in the \nbill. How do you get to the general election for full funding, since we \nhave primaries before the general? Well, we will participate in that, \ntoo. And here is the way we do that. You can spend 60 percent of what \nyou can spend in a general.\n  Back to my home State of Arkansas, let us assume we are eligible for \n$1 million. We can spend 60 percent of that in the primary, or \n$600,000, and, of the $600,000, you must raise 50 percent of that, or \n$300,000. So, to that extent, you still have to go out with your tin \ncup and raise $300,000. Contributions are still limited to $1,000, just \nas they are under existing law. But before you can even qualify for \nprimary money, you have to raise $25,000 in $100 contributions from \nwithin your State. That is not harsh. Anybody in the State of Arkansas, \nor any other State, that cannot get 250 people to give $100 does not \nhave any business running. He is not credible. But, once you raise \n$25,000, then you become eligible for 50 percent Federal funding in the \nprimary.\n  We eliminate totally soft money. Soft money is what the investigation \nof contributions to the DNC is all about. When you consider the fact \nthat soft money contributions and hard money contributions to the \nparties is up 73 percent--get rid of it. Who needs this investigation \nwe are getting ready to launch here in the Congress? You think about \nall the people's business that we need to be conducting, and what are \nwe doing? Holding an investigation about all the Indonesian money and \nalien money. Not only do we eliminate soft money, we say that no \nillegal alien, or even a legal alien, can contribute, unless they are \neligible to vote. Nobody--nobody can contribute in these campaigns \nunless they are eligible to vote. I think that is about as good a test \nas you can find.\n  Let us assume, in the next election, I say, ``OK, I am going to limit \nmy spending to $1 million.'' That is the limit under my bill for this \nState. And I agree I will limit my spending to $1 million. My opponent, \nwho happens to be worth $100 million says, ``You have to be kidding. I \nam planning to buy this election. I have $100 million to do it with.'' \nThen, for every dollar he spends above $1 million, we will match up to \n100 percent, which would be $2 million.\n  If you are running against a man or a woman who is willing to spend \n$10\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nmillion of his or her own money, I think you could win. I can tell you \na story of a Governor's race in Arkansas in 1970. There was a young, \ngood looking, dynamic man running for Governor down there who spent \n$300,000 dollars and beat somebody who spent $3.5 million.\n  You can shame people. You can shame people for spending too much \nmoney of their own. Sometimes shame is not enough because, as I have \nalready pointed out, 90 percent of the time the candidate who spends \nthe most money wins. So maybe our bill is not perfect on that score, \nbut it will exact a political price from those who seek to buy an \nelection by outspending a candidate who accepts these limits.\n  And, on independent expenditures, the bane of the Nation, these \nunnamed, unseen people who run television ads calling you every \nscurrilous name under the shining Sun, they don't mention the name of \nthe guy running against you, they just tell the voters what a terrible \nguy you are--using whatever is a hot issue at the time, ``He voted to \nburn American flags''--they never mention the opponent. Under our bill, \nif you have an independent expenditure of $1,000 or more, you have to \nreport it within 24 hours, and if you spend more than $10,000 on \nindependent expenditures, we will match that for the poor guy who has \nvolunteered to limit his spending. The only difference between our bill \nand McCain-Feingold on PAC's is that we allow a $2,000 PAC \ncontribution, and McCain-Feingold only allows $1,000. The current level \nis $5,000.\n  Let me elaborate just a moment on that. I am not a person who thinks \nPAC's are inherently evil. I think any time a group of people who get \ntogether and contribute to a fund because they would like to have some \ninfluence, rather than just giving $10, $20, $50, $100 apiece, they \nought to be allowed to do that.\n  As I have already said, we only allow people who can vote in this \ncountry in Federal elections to contribute. And, if you agree to accept \nFederal funding, $10,000 is the maximum amount of your own money you \ncan spend. And our bill takes effect in all elections after December \n31, 1998.\n  Mr. President, while my bill is not perfect, we have been working on \nit for 4 months. We have met through staff conferences. I have talked \nto other Senators. I can tell you, the time has come to deal with \npublic finance. I guess the best way to close--I think about a movie, \none of my three or four all-time favorite movies, ``To Kill A \nMockingbird.'' Gregory Peck was a country lawyer, and I guess I relate \nto it because I was a country lawyer. You remember, he was defending a \nblack man charged with rape, who was totally innocent, in a small \nSouthern town. The case was charged with racism.\n  He made the most eloquent speech to the jury in his closing argument, \nand he finished by saying, ``For God's sake, do your duty.'' I cannot \nthink of a better way to end this statement to my colleagues. The time \nhas come to do our duty to salvage, to save our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 1951 of title 18, United States \nCode--commonly known as the Hobbs Act--and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 hobbs anti-racketeering act amendments\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \namend the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court \ndecision in United States versus Enmons, and to address a serious, long \nterm, festering problem under our Nation's labor laws. I am pleased to \nhave Senator Hatch, chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, join me \nin introducing this bill. The United States regulates labor relations \non a national basis and our labor management policies are national \npolicies. These policies and regulations are enforced by laws such as \nthe National Labor Relations Act that Congress designed to preempt \ncomparable State laws.\n  I believe it is time for the Government to act and respond to what \nthe Supreme Court did when it rendered its decision in the case of \nUnited States versus Enmons in 1973. Although labor violence continues \nto be a widespread problem in labor management relations today, the \nFederal Government has not moved in a meaningful way to address this \nissue. It is this decision's unfortunate result which this bill is \nintended to rectify.\n  The Enmons decision involved the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act which is \nintended to prohibit extortion by labor unions. It provides that: \n``Whoever in any way * * * obstructs, delays, or affects commerce in \nthe movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or \nextortion or attempts or conspires to do so or commits or threatens \nphysical violence to any person or property  * * *'' commits a criminal \nact. This language clearly outlaws extortion by labor unions. It \noutlaws violence by labor unions.\n  Although this language is very clear, the Supreme Court in Enmons \ncreated an exemption to the law which says that as long as a labor \nunion commits extortion and violence in furtherance of legitimate \ncollective-bargaining objectives, no violation of the act will be \nfound. Simply put, the Court held that if the ends are permissible, the \nmeans to that end, no matter how horrible or reprehensible, will not \nresult in a violation of the act.\n  The Enmons decision is wrong. This bill will make it clear that the \nHobbs Act is intended to punish the actual or threatened use of force \nor violence, or fear thereof, to obtain property irrespective of the \nlegitimacy of the extortionist's claim to such property and \nirrespective of the existence of a labor management dispute.\n  Let me discuss the Enmons case. In that case, the defendants were \nindicted for firing high-powered rifles at property, causing extensive \ndamage to the property owned by a utility company--all done in an \neffort to obtain higher wages and other benefits from the company for \nstriking employees. The indictment was, however, dismissed by the \ndistrict court on the theory that the Hobbs Act did not prohibit the \nuse of violence in obtaining legitimate union objectives. On appeal, \nthe Supreme Court affirmed.\n  The Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe violence \ncommitted during a lawful strike for the purpose of achieving \nlegitimate collective-bargaining objectives, like higher wages. By its \nfocus upon the motives and objectives of the property claimant who uses \nviolence or force to achieve his or her goals, the Enmons decision has \nhad several unfortunate results. It has deprived the Federal Government \nof the ability to punish significant acts of extortionate violence when \nthey occur in a labor management context. Although other Federal \nstatutes prohibit the use of specific devices or the use of channels of \ncommerce in accomplishing the underlying act of extortionate violence, \nonly the Hobbs Act proscribes a localized act of extortionate violence \nwhose economic effect is to disrupt the channels of commerce. Other \nFederal statutes are not adequate to address the full effect of the \nEnmons decision.\n\n  The Enmons decision affords parties to labor-management disputes an \nexemption from the statute's broad proscription against violence which \nis not available to any other group in society. This bill would make it \nclear that the Hobbs Act punishes the actual or threatened use of force \nand violence which is calculated to obtain property without regard to \nwhether the extortionist has a colorable claim to such property, and \nwithout regard to his or her status as a labor representative, \nbusinessman, or private citizen.\n  Mr. President, attempts to rectify the injustice of the Enmons \ndecision have been before the Senate on several occasions. Shortly \nafter the decision was handed down, a bill was introduced which was \nintended to repudiate the decision. Over the next several years, \nattempts were made to come up with language which was acceptable to \norganized labor and at the same time restored the original intent of \nthe Hobbs Act.\n  Although bills achieving the same goals as the bill I am introducing \ntoday have made progress and one even passed the Senate, none has been \nenacted. It is time for the Senate to re-examine this issue and to \nrestate its opposition to violence in labor disputes. Encouraged by \ntheir special exemption from prosecution for acts of violence committed \nin pursuit of legitimate union objectives, union officials who are \ncorrupt routinely use terror tactics to achieve their goals.\n  From January 1975 to June 1996, the National Institute for Labor \nRelations Research has documented more than 8,700 reported cases of \nunion violence. This chilling statistic gives clear testimony to the \nexistence of a pervasive national problem.\n  Mr. President, violence has no place in our society, regardless of \nthe setting. Our national labor policy has always been directed toward \nthe peaceful resolution of labor disputes. It is ironic that the Hobbs \nAct, which was enacted in large part to accomplish this worthy goal, \nhas been virtually emasculated. The time has come to change that. I \nthink that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share a common \nconcern that violence in labor disputes, whatever the source, should be \neliminated. Government has been unwilling to deal with this problem for \ntoo long. It is time for this Congress to act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the National Cave and Karst Research \nInstitute in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       The National Cave and Karst Research Institute Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ncreate a National Cave and Karst Research Institute in Carlsbad, NM. \nThis bill will continue the efforts started by Congress in 1988 to \ndevelop the information needed to effectively manage and preserve the \nNation's cave and karst resources.\n  In 1988, Congress directed the Secretaries of the Interior and \nAgriculture to provide an inventory of caves on Federal lands and to \nprovide for the management and dissemination of information about the \ncaves. The results of that effort have increased our awareness that \ncave and karst land forms are a resource we must learn how to manage \nfor our future welfare. For example, in America, the majority of the \nNation's fresh water is groundwater--25 percent of which is located in \ncave and karst regions. As we look to the 21st century, the protection \nof our groundwater resources is of critical importance, especially in \nthe arid West. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that caves \ncontain valuable information related to global climate change, waste \ndisposal, groundwater supply and contamination, petroleum recovery, and \nbiomedical investigations. Caves also often have historical or cultural \nsignificance. Many have religious significance for native Americans. \nYet, academic programs on these systems are virtually nonexistent; most \nresearch is conducted with little or no funding and the resulting data \nis scattered and often hard to locate.\n  To begin addressing this problem, in 1990 Congress directed the \nNational Park Service to establish a cave research program and to study \nthe feasibility of a centralized cave and karst research institute. In \nDecember 1994, the National Park Service submitted to Congress the \nNational Cave and Karst Research Institute Study. As directed by Public \nLaw 101-578, the report studied the feasibility of creating a National \nResearch Institute in the vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. \nThe report not only supported the establishment of the National Cave \nand Karst Research Institute, but also concluded that now is the ideal \ntime to consider it.\n  The report to Congress lists several serious threats to our cave \nresources from continued uninformed management paractices. These \nthreats include alterations in the surface waterflow patterns in karst \nregions, alternations in or pollution of water recharge zones, \ninappropriately placed toxic waste repositories, and poorly managed or \ndesigned sewage systems and landfills. The findings of the report \nconclude that it is only through a better understanding of cave \nresources that we can prevent detrimental impacts to America's natural \nresources and cave and karst systems.\n  The goals of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute, as \noutlined in the report, would be to develop and centralize scientific \nknowledge of cave resources, foster interdisciplinary cooperation in \ncave and karst research programs, and to promote environmentally sound, \nsustainable resource management practices. The National Cave and Karst \nResearch Institute would be jointly administered by the National Park \nService and another public or private agency, organization, or \ninstitution as determined by the Secretary.\n  Mr. President, the Park Service report to Congress also notes that \nthe vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park is ideal particularly in \nlight of the incredibly diverse cave and karst resources found \nthroughout the region and the community support which already exists \nfor the establishment of the institute. Numerous varieties of world \nclass caves are located nearby. Furthermore, the Carlsbad Department of \nDevelopment, after reviewing the National Cave and Karst Research \nInstitute study report, has developed proposals to obtain financial \nsupport from available and supportive organizational resources--\nincluding personnel, facilities, equipment, and volunteers. The \nDepartment of Development also believes that it can obtain serious \nfinancial support from the private sector and would seek a matching \ngrant from the State of New Mexico equal to the available Federal \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, my legislation will help provide the necessary tools \nto help discover the wealth of knowledge contained in these important, \nbut largely unexplored landforms. Carlsbad, NM already has in place \nmany of the needed cooperative institutions, facilities, and volunteers \nthat will work toward the success of this project. It is imperative \nthat we take advantage of these conditions and establish the National \nCave and Karst Research Institute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Inouye, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 232. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\n                        the fair pay act of 1997\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is perhaps no other form of \ndiscrimination that has as direct an impact on the day-to-day lives of \nworkers as wage discrimination. When women aren't paid what they are \nworth, we all get cheated.\n  The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits sex-based discrimination in \ncompensation for doing the same job. However, this statute fails to \naddress other components of the pay equity problem such as job \nsegregation. Current law has not reached far enough to combat wage \ndiscrimination when employers routinely pay lower wages to jobs that \nare dominated by women. More than 30 years after the passage of the \nEqual Pay Act, women's wages still lag behind their male counterparts' \nwages. This important issue demands our attention.\n  In the last Congress, I introduced the Fair Pay Act so we could close \nthe wage gap once and for all. I am reintroducing this legislation in \nthe 105th Congress so we can continue to fight for fairness on behalf \nof working families.\n  The Fair Pay Act is designed to pick up where the Equal Pay Act left \noff. The heart of the bill seeks to eliminate wage discrimination based \nupon sex, race, or national origin. This important legislation would \namend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require employers to \nprovide equal pay for work in jobs that are comparable in skill, \neffort, responsibility, and working conditions. The Fair Pay Act would \napply to each company individually and would prohibit companies from \nreducing employees' wages to achieve pay equity.\n  Wage gaps can result from differences in education, experience, or \ntime in the work force and the Fair Pay Act does not interfere with \nthat. But just as there is a glass ceiling in the American workplace, \nthere is also what I call a glass wall--where women are on the exact \nsame level as their male coworkers. They have the same skills, they \nhave the same responsibilities, but they are still obstructed from \nreceiving the same pay. It's a hidden barrier, but a barrier all the \nsame. The Fair Pay Act is about knocking down the glass wall. It's a \nfundamental issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of equal \nvalue to an employer.\n  Fair pay is a commonsense business issue. Women make up almost half \nof the work force and fair pay is essential to attract and keep good \nworkers.\n  Fair pay is an economic issue. Working women, after all, don't get \nspecial discounts when they buy food and clothing for their families. \nThey don't pay less for a ticket to the movies or gasoline for their \ncars.\n  And fair pay is a family issue. When women aren't paid what they are \nworth, families get cheated too. Over a lifetime the average woman \nloses $420,000 due to unequal pay practices. Such gaps in income are \nlife changing for women and their families. The income gap can mean the \ndifference between welfare and self-sufficiency, owning a home or \nrenting, sending kids to college or to a minimum wage job, or having a \nsecure retirement tomorrow instead of scrimping to survive today.\n  The Fair Pay Act has already been endorsed by a wide variety of \ngroups and organizations. In addition, polling data consistently shows \nthat over 70 percent of the American people support a law requiring the \nsame pay for men and women in jobs requiring skills and \nresponsibilities. The American people want fair pay legislation. Their \nelected representatives ought to want it too.\n  I would ask my colleagues to review this important legislation and \ncome to me or my staff with any questions you may have. I welcome your \ncomments and suggestions and urge your support. It's a simple issue of \nfairness for women to earn equal pay for work of equal value to an \nemployer.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am privileged to join Senator Tom \nHarkin to introduce the Fair Pay Act.\n  Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will \noutnumber men in the U.S. workplace. In 1965, women held 35 percent of \nall jobs. That has grown to more than 46 percent today. And in a few \nyears, women will make up a majority of the work force.\n  Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for \nworking women today than 30 years ago. Unlike 1965, Federal, State, and \nprivate sector programs now offer women many opportunities to choose \ntheir own future. Working women also have opportunities to gain the \nknowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security.\n  But despite these gains, working women still face a unique \nchallenge--achieving pay equity. Women currently earn, on average, 28 \npercent less than men. That means for every dollar a man earns, a woman \nearns only 72 cents. Over a lifetime, the average woman will earn \n$420,000 less than the average man based solely on her sex. This is \nunacceptable.\n  We must correct this gross inequity, and we must correct it now.\n  How is this possible with our Federal laws prohibiting \ndiscrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to \nprotect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid \nfairly for an honest day's work.\n  Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women, \nwhich continues to fester like a cancer in workplaces across the \ncountry. The Fair Pay Act of 1997 would close this legal loophole by \nprohibiting discrimination based on wages.\n  I do not pretend that this act will solve all the problems that women \nface in the workplace. But it is an essential piece of the puzzle.\n  Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult \nto combat. And it does not stand alone as an issue that women face in \nthe workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the problem of unequal \nopportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if we fail to provide \nthe opportunity for women, regardless of their merit, to reach higher \npaying positions.\n  The Government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and \nperceptions of individuals or private businesses in hiring and \nadvancing women, but it can set an example. Certainly, President \nClinton has shown great leadership by appointing an unprecedented \nnumber of women to his administration. Just last week, Madeleine \nAlbright became the first woman Secretary of State for the United \nStates of America. I am confident she will do a great job, and I look \nforward to the day when a woman reaching this high an office is not \nnews simply because of her gender. We are moving toward that day, but \nwe are not there yet.\n  The private sector also has a long way to go to provide equal \nopportunity. The report released recently by the Glass Ceiling \nCommission found that 95 percent of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 \nindustrial and Fortune 500 companies are white males. The Glass Ceiling \nCommission also found that when there are women in high places, their \ncompensation is lower than white males in similar positions. This wage \ninequality is the issue we seek to address today.\n  For the first time in our country's long history, this bill outlaws \ndiscrimination in wages paid to employees in equivalent jobs solely on \nthe basis of a worker's sex. I say it is about time. I commend Senator \nHarkin for introducing the Fair Pay Act, and I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of it.\n  The Fair Pay Act would remedy gender wage gaps under a balanced \napproach that takes advantage of the employment expertise of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], while providing flexibility \nto small employers . In addition, it would safeguard legitimate wage \ndifferences caused by a seniority or merit pay system. And the \nlegislation directs the EEOC to provide educational materials and \ntechnical assistance to help employers design fair pay policies.\n  A few months ago, I was privileged to help organize the first annual \nVermont Women's Economic Security Conference in Burlington, VT. At this \nconference, I heard about the daily triumph of Vermont women succeeding \nin the workplace, even though many of them are paid below their male \ncounterparts. These woman did not complain. No, they are proud to be \nearning a living. But they want to be paid fairly, and they should be \npaid fairly.\n  It is a basic issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of \nequal value. The Fair Pay Act makes it possible for women to finally \nachieve this fundamental fairness. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 233. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\ndeduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE SMALL BUSINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation designed to \nhelp America's small business. This legislation will assist small \nbusinesses by increasing the tax deduction for health care coverage, \nrequiring an estimate of the cost of a bill on small businesses before \nCongress enacts the legislation, and creating an assistant U.S. Trade \nRepresentative for Small Business.\n  Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and in order \nto create jobs--both in my home State of Maine and across the Nation--\nwe must encourage small businesses expansion. Businesses with fewer \nthan 10 employees make up 77 percent of Maine's jobs, and nationally, \nsmall businesses employ 53 percent of the private work force. In 1995, \nsmall businesses created an estimated 75 percent of the 2.5 million new \njobs. Small businesses truly are the backbone of our economy.\n  Small businesses are the most successful tool we have for job \ncreation. They provide about 67 percent of the initial job \nopportunities in this country, and are the original--and finest--job \ntraining program. Unfortunately, as much as small businesses help our \nown economy--and the Federal Government--by creating jobs and building \neconomic growth, government often gets in the way. Instead of assisting \nsmall business, government too often frustrates small business efforts.\n  Federal regulations create more than 1 billion hours of paperwork for \nsmall businesses each year, according to the Small Business \nAdministration. Moreover, because of the size of some of the largest \nAmerican corporations, U.S. commerce officials too often devote a \ndisproportionate amount of time to the needs and jobs in corporate \nAmerica rather than in small businesses.\n  My legislation will address three problems facing our Nation's small \nbusinesses, and I hope it will both encourage small business expansion \nand fuel job creation.\n  First, this legislation will allow self-employed small business men \nand women to fully deduct their health care costs for income tax \npurposes. This provision builds on legislation enacted during the 104th \nCongress, the Health Insurance Reform Act, which increased the health \ninsurance deduction for the self-employed from 30 to 35 percent this \nyear and will gradually increase it to 80 percent by the year 2006.\n  My bill will allow the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their \ninsurance today. It will place small entrepreneurs on equal footing \nwith larger companies by immediately increasing a provision in current \nlaw that limits deductions to 35 percent of the overall cost. At a time \nwhen America is facing challenges to its health care system, and the \nFederal Government is seeking remedies to the problem of uninsured \ncitizens, this provision will help self-employed business people to \nafford health insurance without imposing a costly and unnecessary \nmandate.\n  From inventors to startup businesses, self-employed workers make up \nan important and vibrant part of the small business sector--and too \noften they are forgotten in providing benefits and assistance. Indeed, \n9 percent of uninsured workers in America are self-employed. By \nextending tax credits for health insurance to these small businesses, \nwe will help to provide health care coverage to millions of Americans.\n  My bill will also require a cost analysis of legislative proposals \nbefore new requirements are passed on to small businesses. Too often, \nCongress approves well-intended legislation that shift the costs of \nprograms to small businesses. This proposal will ensure that these \nunintended consequences are not passed along to small businesses. \nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small business \nowners spend at least 1 billion hours a year filling out government \npaperwork, at an annual cost that exceeds $100 billion. Before we place \nyet another obstacle in the path of small business job creation, we \nshould understand the costs our proposals will impose on small \nbusinesses.\n  This bill will require the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice to prepare for each committee an analysis of the costs to small \nbusinesses that would be incurred in carrying out provisions contained \nin new legislation. This cost analysis will include an estimate of \ncosts incurred in carrying out the bill or resolution for a 4-year \nperiod, as well as an estimate of the portion of these costs that would \nbe borne by small businesses. This provision will allow us to fully \nconsider the impact of our actions on small businesses--and through \ncareful planning, we will succeed in avoiding unintended costs.\n  Finally, this legislation will direct the U.S. Trade Representative \nto establish a position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nSmall Business. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is \noverburdened, and too often overlooks the needs of small business. The \nnew Assistant U.S. Trade Representative will promote exports by small \nbusinesses and work to remove foreign impediments to these exports.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that this legislation will truly assist \nsmall businesses, resulting not only in additional entrepreneurial \nopportunities but also in new jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 234. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer \nadministrative jurisdiction over certain land to the Secretary of the \nArmy to facilitate construction of a jetty and sand transfer system, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                THE OREGON INLET PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in offering today the Oregon Inlet \nProtection Act of 1997, I must emphasize that this legislation is vital \nto thousands of North Carolinians, especially citizens who work along \nthe northeastern coast of North Carolina known as the Outer Banks, \nwhere commercial and recreational fishermen risk their lives every day \ntrying to navigate the hazardous waters of Oregon Inlet.\n  These fishermen have been pleading for this legislation for decades \nbecause it is a matter of life or death for them. At last count, 20 \nfishermen have lost their lives in Oregon Inlet during the past 30 \nyears, the latest tragedy having occurred on December 30, 1992, when a \n31-foot commercial fishing vessel sank in Oregon Inlet. This was the \n20th vessel to be lost in those waters since 1961. Fortunately, both \ncrewmen were rescued, but the Coast Guard never found the wreckage.\n  Mr. President, this legislation proposes neither the appropriation of \nmoney nor the authorization of new expenditures and projects; it merely \nrequires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer two small parcels of \nInterior Department land to the Department of the Army so that the \nCorps of Engineers may begin work on a too-long-delayed project \nauthorized by Congress in 1970--25 years ago. In doing so, 100 acres of \nland, adjacent to Oregon Inlet in Dare County, will be transferred to \nthe Department of the Army.\n  Reviewing the legislative history involving this project, in October \n1992, then Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan issued conditional permits \nfor the Corps of Engineers to begin the construction process; the \nClinton administration unwisely revoked those permits. Therefore, the \nbill I'm offering today serves notice to the self-proclaimed \nenvironmentalists who have for so long stalled this project that I will \ncontinue to do everything I can to protect the lives and livelihoods of \nthe countless commercial and recreational fishermen who have been \ndenied greater economic opportunities because of the failure of the \nFederal Government to do what it should have done more than a quarter \nof a century ago.\n  Consider this bit of history, Mr. President: In 1970, Congress \nauthorized the stabilization of a 400-foot wide, 20 foot deep channel \nthrough Oregon Inlet and the installation of a system of jetties with a \nsand-bypass system designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But \never since 1970, this project has been repeatedly and deliberately \nstalled by bureaucratic roadblocks contrived by the fringe elements of \nthe environmental movement.\n  As a result, many lives and livelihoods have been lost. North \nCarolina's once thriving fishing industry has deteriorated, and access \nto the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and the Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore has been\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\nthreatened. Since 1970, critics of this project have repeatedly claimed \nthat more studies and time were needed. This was nothing more than \nstalling tactics, pure and simple, Mr. President, while men died \nunnecessarily and livelihoods were destroyed.\n  Mr. President, surely a quarter of a century devoted to deliberate \ndelay is enough. The proposed Oregon Inlet project is bound to be the \nmost over-studied project in the history of the Corps of Engineers and \nthe Department of the Interior. Note this, Mr. President: Since 1969, \nthe Federal Government has conducted 97--count them--97 major studies \nand three full-blown environmental impact statements; but, always \nenvironmentalists have demanded more and more delay.\n  As for the cost-benefit factor, the Office of Management and Budget--\nas recently as March 14, 1991--found the project to be economically \njustified. Then, in December 1991, a joint committee of the Corps of \nEngineers and the Department of the Interior recommended to then-\nInterior Secretary Lujan and subsequent to that, to Assistant Secretary \nof the Army for Civil Works Page that the jetties be built. The people \nof the Outer Banks have waited in vain. And they still wait, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Congress must act soon. Too many lives have been lost; the continued \nexistence of the Outer Banks is now in question because nothing has \nbeen allowed to be done to manage the flow of sand from one end of the \ncoastal islands to the other. If much more time is wasted, the self-\nappointed environmentalists won't have to worry about turtles or birds \non Cape Hatteras, because a few short years hence, Oregon Inlet will \nhave disappeared.\n  To understand why this project has become one of the Interior \nDepartment's most studied and controversial projects, the October 1992 \nedition of The Smithsonian magazine is highly instructive. In an \narticle titled, ``This Beach Boy Sings a Song Developers Don't Want to \nHear,'' the magazine chronicles the adventures of a professor at a \nmajor North Carolina university who has made his living organizing \nopposition to all coastal engineering projects on the Outer Banks--\nOregon Inlet in particular. The article further relates the \nconfrontation between the professor and an angry Oregon Inlet \nfisherman, a man whose livelihood has been made more hazardous by the \nbureaucratic failure to keep open a safe channel at Oregon Inlet. When \nquestioned about his motives and actions this university professor \nretorted that he and his radical friends boasted that they would not be \nsatisfied until all the houses are taken off the shore to leave it the \nway it was before.\n  Mr. President, this is the response from a professor whose home \noccupies a large plot of land 200 miles west in the middle of North \nCarolina, a professor who is all too ready to deprive other North \nCarolinians of their rights to live and prosper.\n  That is not environmental activism. It is environmental hypocrisy.\n  Mr. President, the issue is clear. The time for delay is over. This \nlegislation will mark the beginning of the end of the jetty debate on \nthe Outer Banks, and will address the long-neglected concerns of North \nCarolina's coastal residents. Congress should not delay further in \ndoing what it should have done a quarter of a century ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S804-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 7\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Montana [Mr. \nBurns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 7, a bill to establish a United \nStates policy for the deployment of a national missile defense system, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of S. 25, a bill to \nreform the financing of Federal elections.\n\n\n                                 S. 104\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 104, a bill to amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n\n\n                                 S. 181\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. Kyl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 181, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that installment sales of \ncertain farmers not be treated as a preference item for purposes of the \nalternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the names of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] and the Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 194, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto make permanent the section 170(e)(5) rules pertaining to gifts of \npublicly-traded stock to certain private foundations and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S818-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 33--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n            EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Appropriations, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom New York, Senator D'Amato, along with Senators Feinstein and \nHollings, in introducing the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of \n1997. This bill provides key protections to women facing breast cancer, \nand to all Americans confronting a possible diagnosis of cancer.\n  Breast cancer is currently one of the major public health crises \nfacing this Nation. In 1997, 180,000 new cases of breast cancer will be \ndiagnosed in this country, and more than 44,000 women will die from the \ndisease. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second \nleading cause of cancer deaths among American women. In my home State \nof Maine, 900 to 1,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this \nyear.\n  Consider for a moment what it must be like to face a cancer \ndiagnosis. Then imagine what a woman with breast cancer goes through \nwhen she loses a breast to this disease. A mastectomy patient may \nendure great pain resulting from the surgery, and has a large wound \nwith drainage tubes which must be properly cared for. She must also \nface the emotional pain of losing part or all of a breast, and may \nstruggle with her fear of cancer and what lies ahead. Then try to \nimagine if she is released from the hospital within hours of surgery.\n  That is what some health plans are doing today. Yes--some health care \nplans have issued guidelines requiring mastectomies to be performed on \nan outpatient basis. The New York Times recently reported that \napproximately 7 to 8 percent of all mastectomies are performed on an \noutpatient basis. Doctors may feel pressured by their health care plan \nto release patients before it is medically appropriate, as health care \nplans push doctors harder and harder to cut costs. Women who are \nreleased from the hospital too early following a mastectomy, \nlumpectomy, or lymph node dissection do not have time to recover from \nthe surgery in a supervised setting, or have an adequate opportunity to \nlearn how to properly care for their wound, much less begin to deal \nwith their emotional and physical pain. And some problems or \ncomplications from the surgery may not arise within the first hours \nfollowing the surgery.\n  The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997 will help ensure \nthat women with breast cancer obtain medically appropriate care. This \nbill says that women who undergo a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or lymph \nnode dissection can stay in the hospital as long as a doctor deems \nmedically appropriate, in consultation with the patient. The bill does \nnot mandate how long a patient should stay in the hospital, or \nprescribe an arbitrary time period. Instead, it encourages the highest \nstandard of medical care by allowing a doctor to exercise his best \nmedical judgment in determining how long a patient should remain in the \nhospital. The bill contains strong protections for doctors to ensure \nthat they are not penalized by insurance companies for prescribing a \ngiven length of stay. The procedures could still be performed on an \noutpatient basis if deemed medically appropriate by the doctor, and \nagreed to by the patient.\n\n  Second, the bill requires insurance companies to cover breast \nreconstruction following cancer surgery, as well as reconstructive \nsurgery to make breasts symmetrical following cancer surgery. I am \nextremely pleased that this provision is based on the law in my own \nState of Maine. Currently, insurance companies treat reconstructive \nsurgery following breast cancer differently than other types of \nreconstructive surgery. In fact, a recent survey found that 43 percent \nof the respondents had been denied coverage for follow-up \nreconstructive symmetry procedures. The availability of reconstructive \nsurgery is important not only for those women who believe it is \nnecessary to return their lives to normal following cancer surgery, but \nbecause studies show that the fear of losing a breast is a leading \nreason why women do not participate in early breast cancer detection \nprograms. If women understand that breast reconstruction is widely \navailable, more might participate in detection programs.\n  Finally, this bill requires insurance companies to pay full coverage \nfor secondary consultations whenever any cancer has been diagnosed by \nthe patient's primary physician. It also requires a health plan to \ncover a second opinion even when the specialist finds the patient does \nnot have cancer, and allows the patient to go outside an HMO for \nconsultation by a specialist.

They are our inspiration for today and our \npromise for tomorrow.\n  I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen \nButler.

They are:\n  Mr. Darwin Davis, originally from Flint, has been named one of \nAmerica's 25 most important and powerful black executives by Black \nEnterprise magazine. His promotion to senior vice president of The \nEquitable in 1987 was merely the latest in a series of impressive steps \nwithin that company.

Under the \nleadership of Director Sheila Miller-Graham and tap dance instructor \nAlfred Bruce Bradley, Creative Expressions has competed at the local \nand national levels every year since its inception. The first \nprofessional dance troupe from Flint, Creative Expressions entered its \nfirst dance competition during its very first year of existence, making \nan impressive showing by winning two of the nine trophies for the \nJunior Division in that region. Creative Expressions continues to \nrepresent Flint, and to help its citizens develop their talents, \nskills, and confidence levels.\n\n  Mr. Mario J. Daniels is the founding director of Mario J.

Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness to \ncommemorate the life of an outstanding individual from our State of \nWashington. Leslianne Shedd, a member of the United States Foreign \nService Corps and a 1990 graduate of the Henry M. Jackson School of \nInternational Studies at the University of Washington, was killed when \nan Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in the Indian Ocean last November.\n  A resident of Washington State since the age of two, Leslianne \ngraduated with honor from Puyallup High School in 1986. According to \nfamily and friends, Leslianne's lifelong dream was to tour the world. \nTo achieve this goal, she learned four languages, traveled in Europe, \nAfrica, North America, and Thailand, and pursued a career in Foreign \nService.\n  Leslianne was traveling from her post at the United States Embassy in \nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia to Nairobi, Kenya to celebrate Thanksgiving with \nfriends when her plane was hijacked and then crashed. A commercial \nofficer in the foreign service, she provided assistance to American \ncompanies doing business in the region. Before working in Ethiopia, she \nspent 2 years in the Ivory Coast in West Africa as a United States vice \nconsul there.\n  It is no surprise that a young woman who touched so many lives around \nthe globe has been described by her junior high English teacher as ``a \nlittle ray of light.'' Her life provides inspiration to all of us by \nserving as an example of a forward-looking, intellectually curious, and \nselfless individual.\n  My thoughts are with Leslianne's parents Bob and Mickey Shedd, her \nbrother Darin and sister Corinne, her friends, and all those touched by \nher warmth and kindness. Her work and accomplishments remind us all of \nthe importance of public service, international awareness, and \ngenerosity. Our Nation and our world are better places because of her. \nI am certain Leslianne Shedd's legacy of service will be remembered for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S821-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE DEATH OF PANAMANIAN STATESMAN GABRIEL LEWIS GALINDO\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to \nthe recent death of Garbriel Lewis Galindo, a noted statesman from \nPanama and friend of the United States of America.\n  Gabriel Lewis is perhaps best known for his efforts to conclude the \nPanama Canal Treaty. As Panama's envoy to the United States on this \nissue he worked closely with the Carter administration to this end. In \nthe process he gained the respect of many people in our Government.\n  Mr. Lewis continually sought to restore democratic principles to \nPanama and used the Panamanian-United States negotiations regarding the \ncanal to press Panama's dictator, Omar Torrijos, to move in a more \ndemocratic direction. Mr. Lewis' hard work was rewarded as Omar \nTorrijos eventually granted more freedom to the media and political \nparties in Panama.\n  When Gen. Manuel Noriega rose to power in Panama 2 years after the \ndeath of Omar Torrijos, he undertook measures to reverse those \ndemocratic gains which had been achieved. Gabriel Lewis became an \noutspoken opponent of Manuel Noriega, a strategy which eventually \nforced him to leave Panama after he unsuccessfully sought Noriega's \nremoval from power.\n  Gabriel Lewis was both pragmatic and visionary. He understood the \nneed for a close and productive relationship between the United States \nand Panama based on respect, dignity, and shared ideals of democracy. \nMr. Lewis fought to make this happen. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/29/senate-section/article/S821-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF WILLIAM DALEY\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Following that \nrollcall, there will be no further rollcall votes this week.\n  We are moving forward with the nominations of the President to his \nCabinet. This will be the fourth one that has been confirmed. Of \ncourse, committees are meeting and acting on other confirmation \nhearings and other issues. Those will begin to come to the floor of the \nSenate next week.\n  Next week will certainly be a busy period because we will have the \nPresident's State of the Union, we will begin debate on the \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget, and on Thursday we \nreceive the President's budget for the year. So we will have his \ninformation on that then, and we can really begin to proceed with \nbusiness that needs to be acted on this year.\n  There will be a period of morning business tomorrow for Members to \nmake statements, and the Senate may consider other legislative or \nexecutive matters that can be cleared.
