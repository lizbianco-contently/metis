Mr. President, I would like to use our time this morning \nas a followup on the freshman focus that we have been carrying on for \nseveral weeks and attempt to continue. Some of my colleagues will join \nlater in the morning and then again on Thursday.\n  As you know, the freshman class has made an effort to talk about the \nissues that are before the American people, that are before this \nCongress, and to focus on solving these problems, to focus on the \nnotion that we need to find solutions--solutions that will help us to \ndeliver services more efficiently, will help us to reduce the cost of \nGovernment, and will help us to be more effective in dealing with the \nproblems of this country and, at the same time, reduce the size of \nGovernment.\n  So we are interested in exercising the first opportunity that we have \nhad for a number of years to really analyze programs that have been in \neffect, in many cases, for 30 to 40 years. Frankly, the effort that has \nbeen made during that time was simply to add more money to the same \nprogram. I think most now would agree that it is time to analyze the \neffect, the impact, and the product of those programs. And we have, for \nthe first time, a chance to do that.\n  We have a chance to change some of the efforts that have not \nsucceeded--and there are some--so they are done in a different way. We \nhope our efforts will help us move forward in the Senate and in the \nCongress, to solving problems rather than to obstruct or just set down \npolitical issues for elections.\n  Today we want to talk about two issues that are very compelling which \nare before us and, frankly, issues that we have no alternative other \nthan to solve. One is the budget; the other is Medicare.\n  Our purpose this week is to talk largely about Medicare. It is \nclearly related to the budget and, as a result, the two must be talked \nabout together.\n   [[Page S6292]] Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson said, ``The art of \ngovernment is the art of being honest.'' I think that is what we are \nfaced with. This matter of Medicare and the budget is not a problem of \nthe Congress, not a problem of those who are trustees; it is a problem \nfor all of us who are citizens of this country, not only for the \nbenefits that it provides, but each of us who must also pay. We need to \nbe honest with one another as to where we are. The idea of covering up \nproblems because it is politically expedient, or the idea that you can \nshift problems to somebody else because it is an uncomfortable \npolitical position simply does not hold. We have to be honest, face the \nproblems, and talk about them. There are clearly some problems in this \narea of finance.\n  Let me talk just a minute about the chart. We are into charts around \nhere and it is not a bad idea. It does demonstrate where we are. This \nparticular chart talks about the Medicare hospital insurance trust \nfund. It talks about the fact that if we do nothing, it will be \nbankrupt in 7 years. The chart shows the end-of-year trust fund \nbalances up to 1995, and then projects the balances for the years up to \n2004. This is not just a chart that is put together for these kinds of \npurposes. This is a chart that is a result of the Social Security and \nMedicare Board of Trustee report that was released just a couple of \nweeks ago. The trustees being at least three or four members from the \nCabinet and some public members. They have indicated this fund will be \nbankrupt in the year 2002 unless we do something. The balance in the \nhealth care insurance trust fund was $133 billion in 1994 and will rise \nto $136 billion in 1995.\n  In 1996, however, the annual deficits starts to erode the balance of \n$136 billion and will be broke in 2002. So that is the problem. It is a \nsolvable problem. But it is not one that we can brush under the door, \none that we can ignore, or one to make political issues of. It is one \nthat we must indeed solve.\n  The next chart shows the impact this spending has on the gross \ndomestic product. The blue being Medicare part A; and the yellow part \nis Medicare part B. Part A is the hospital portion that is funded by \npayroll taxes. Part B is that portion that is funded by general funds \nand beneficiary premiums. You can see how it grows. Here is 1970 and, \nmore currently, in 1995; here we are in the year 2020, as a percentage \nof gross domestic product. This current period is just below 3 percent, \ndoubling in this period of time.\n  So we clearly have an issue we have to deal with. The alternative is \nfor the program to go broke. The alternative is not to have the \nservices and that, of course, is not acceptable. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent administration's position is to ignore the problem. It is to \nsay, gee, it is up to the majority to do something about that. I think \nthat is too bad. I think it is going to have to be something that we do \ncollectively, but we can do something about it.\n  Why are we where we are? Because this program has grown at a rate of \nabout 10 percent per year, and it continues to do so, as opposed to the \nprivate sector health care which has been growing at a more moderate \nrate of about 5 percent a year. This year, it was 4.4 percent and it is \non its way down. Yet the Medicare Program continues to go up. Now, some \nsay--and I go back to the political thing--``You Republicans simply \nwant to cut Medicare so you can give tax cuts.'' That is not true. That \nis not where we are. The issue is to fix Medicare so that we can \ncontinue to have it over a period of time. There simply is not enough \nmoney to leave it as it is and just simply fund it without changing it. \nThat is not an alternative. All the money that we have would be in this \nprogram.\n  So the alternative is to find some ways to reduce this growth. What \nwe are talking about doing--and I think you will see generally in the \nbudget, which is not out yet--you will see an effort to reduce it from \nthe 10.5 percent growth to a growth of maybe 7 percent. We will see in \nthe newspapers that they slashed Medicare, cut Medicare. But what we \nhave done is sought to reduce the growth of Medicare, and then we will \nfind some ways to do it more efficiently. There are ways to do that, to \ngive some options. For example, for those elderly who choose to \ncontinue as is, that will be an option. For those who would like to \nmove toward some kind of medical savings account, perhaps that will be \nan option and that would be a choice, and it will be a reduction in the \ncost of delivering the same medicine.\n  The point is that we need to be honest with ourselves in terms of \nwhat we are doing. This is not a political kind of football or struggle \nto see who gets political advantage. The real issue is how do you \ncontinue to provide services to people who need services and do it in a \nway that you can, over time, pay for it. That is the issue. Of course, \nit is part of the budget, because the budget is how much money we can \nput out to run Government and what kind of benefits we can have.\n  As for Medicare part B, I suspect there will be an effort to maintain \nthe contributions that are now there--approximately 31 percent instead \nof 25 percent of the premium that is required to finance it. We have \nbeen moving up at 31 percent. We can go back, but if we hold it at 31 \npercent, the program will continue to be preserved. So there are \nalternatives. They are not draconian.\n  This is where we are on Medicare. I think it is an excellent example \nof our opportunity in this Congress to find some solutions to share \nwith Americans--all of us--the responsibility of making collective \ndecisions, to meet the responsibility of continuing to have programs \nwhere there is need, and to do it in a responsible financial way.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can go forward with the bona fide \ndiscussion of Medicare and a bona fide discussion of balancing the \nbudget. I do not think anybody will suggest that it is going to be \npainless. It is not painless in your family when you find you have to \ncut back on the growth of expenditures. It is not painless in your \nbusiness when you discover that it is necessary to make some changes in \norder to make it work. But it is very possible. It is very possible.\n  It can be done by continuing to provide those essential services, \ndoing them in a more efficient way, and we can collectively do that.\n  I am pleased that my associates from the freshman class will be on \nthe floor, talking about this issue and other issues, urging Members to \ntake advantage of the opportunity and, indeed, the request, if not \ndemand, from voters for change. There has been a demand for change. \nThere will be change. This is our opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6291-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6292-S6294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMPROMISE NEAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wish the President a good morning. I want to comment \nbriefly on the series of votes that we will be taking this morning. As \nthe distinguished acting majority leader indicated, there will be a \ncloture vote this morning.\n  I think in that regard it is important for people to understand the \ncurrent circumstances. Senator Dole has offered an amendment. Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Gorton have also offered an amendment, a \nsubstitute. We will have the opportunity at some point to vote on \nthose.\n  I would hope people will vote against cloture again this morning \nsimply to preserve the options that we think are going to be very \nimportant, if indeed we reach a compromise here. I think we are getting \ncloser now in the last 48 hours to meaningful compromise.\n  In that regard, let me specifically single out the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his remarkable efforts to bring people \ntogether, to attempt to find a way to resolve the outstanding \ndifferences. He and the distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator \nGorton, have done an extraordinary job in the last couple of days in \naddressing many of the concerns that people have raised. I think we are \nnow beginning to come together in a way that will accommodate some of \nthe concerns that have been raised during the last couple of weeks.\n  I know that others, as well, have concluded that a compromise is \nwithin reach. My distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux, has also been working on ways to accommodate some of these \nconcerns and bring all sides together.\n   [[Page S6293]] Senator Breaux and others have in the last couple of \ndays talked with people on both sides of the aisle in an effort to try \nto reach a compromise on punitive damages, on joint and several \nliability, on the statute of repose. I think we are at a point now \nwhere we may be able to resolve these outstanding issues in a way that \nwill facilitate a compromise and ultimately bring Members to a \nresolution on this issue.\n  In order to allow the Senator time to discuss this particular \ncompromise, I would like to yield the balance of my leader time to \nSenator Breaux. Again, I commend Senator Breaux for his effort in this \nregard. I believe that he may have found a way with which to bridge the \ndifferences and provide Members with an opportunity to resolve the many \noutstanding issues that still exist. With that, Mr. President, I yield \nthe balance of my time to Senator Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n                      Standard of Fairness Desired\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his \ncomments and his effort in trying to bring about a compromise that \nmakes sense. A lot of people have been working very diligently on this \nissue of product liability. The Senate and the Congress has worked on \nit for a number of years. We have all struggled with it.\n  I think the standard that we are all trying to reach is a standard of \nfairness, to give neither people who are injured by faulty products an \nadvantage or people who manufacture those products an unfair advantage. \nThe key I think is a level playing field. The key is fairness to \neveryone. That is something that has been very difficult.\n  I want to particularly commend the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, which I serve, Senator Hollings, for the great work that he \nhas done in trying to make sure that fairness is the standard by which \nwe operate.\n  Also, Senator Heflin, I think, has made a great contribution to \nensuring that we do not act in haste, but do this very, very carefully.\n  There have been a number of Members on the Republican side--the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate this morning--has also been very involved in trying to create a \npackage that is fair and creates that level playing field that we are \nall striving for.\n  There are a number of other Senators I have not mentioned that have \nbeen involved in trying to bring all Members together in doing \nsomething that makes sense. My own preference is that this is something \nthat the States ought to do. I am a States righter when it comes to \npersonal injury and the tort system, and how the States can handle this \ncan best be decided by the States.\n  I think, Mr. President, in trying to reach an agreement here today I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote no on the first cloture motion this \nmorning in order to allow Members to present to the Senate what I think \nis a fair and reasonable compromise, and tries to balance those who \nthink that nothing should be done on the Federal level and those that \nthink that everything should be done by the Federal Government here in \nWashington.\n  I think that the pending amendment that is out there that has been \ntalked about, as a proposed compromise, the so-called Gorton-\nRockefeller, their second proposal, is defective in a number of ways, \nand can be improved in order to reach a fair settlement of this issue, \nand put it to rest once and for all.\n  I think Gorton-Rockefeller is effective in a couple of ways. My \nsubstitute, which I will offer after cloture is not invoked, will be an \namendment to the Dole-Coverdell substitute, which will still be \npending, tries to address those defects in the Gorton-Rockefeller in \nthe following ways: No. 1, on punitive damages. This has always been \nsomething that has been very controversial, but there is a reason for \npunitive damages. It says to a manufacturer of defective products, ``Do \nnot do it again.''\n  The damages that are awarded have to be in relation to the ability of \nthe defendant to pay. Obviously, a multibillion-dollar corporation is \nnot going to really be affected by a small fine of $100,000. They will \njust say it is the cost of doing business, and continue to manufacture \nthe defective product.\n  So punitive damages serve a purpose. It says to the manufacturers of \nproducts that harm people in this country, ``Do not do it anymore.'' It \nhas been very effective. There are products today that are not on the \nmarket because of punitive damages. Companies have said ``We can't \nafford to do this anymore and we are not going to do it anymore.'' \nThere are a number of products that are no longer manufactured--Dalkon \nshield, asbestos products, products dealing with breast implants. Some \nautomobile manufacturers are no longer producing types of cars, because \nthey know that if they do they will cause problems and they will be \npenalized doing it. So they make a very practical decision: ``We are \nnot doing it anymore.''\n  The problem with the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute is that, I think, \nit is fatally flawed. They try and solve this problem by saying that \nsmall businesses will not be liable for punitive damages if they have \n25 or fewer employees. They make a separate category for small \nbusinesses of 25 or fewer employees.\n  That is an interesting way of approaching it. What would happen is \nthat many companies would just structure their operations with 25 or \nfewer employees. A trucking company, each truck could be a separate \ncompany. A cab company, each cab could be a separate company. A boat \ncompany, each one could be a separate company. What do we do in \ncompanies that have 23 employees at the time of the injury, or 25 \nemployees later on during a year?\n  It is very complicated and it really, I think, calls for companies to \nstructure themselves so they can avoid ever having to pay for any \npunitive damages for products that would cause problems to individual \npeople.\n  In addition, they say that, well, if the judge thinks that punitive \ndamages should be awarded more than this cap, then the judge can do it; \nbut if the defendant does not like what the judge does, he can ask for \nanother trial. Why do we have to be so complicated? That provision just \ncalls for additional litigation, more cost, more expense, additional \ntrials, by directing a very, very, complicated situation I think is not \nnecessary.\n  What my amendment will do is to take from the suggestions of other \nMembers who have suggested ideas that address this problem in a fair \nway. Our colleague, Senator Dodd from Connecticut, has suggested \nsomething that I think makes sense and is the essence of my amendment. \nIt says that when a jury finds that punitive damages are warranted \nbecause of conscious and flagrant violations by the manufacturer of a \nproduct, then the decision on how much the punitive damages should be \nwill be decided by the judge. He does it by looking at that particular \ndefendant, determining their ability to pay, determining how successful \neconomically that company is, looking at their intent, how they handle \neverything, how long the violations continued, and then the judge will \nmake a decision on the amount of the punitive damages that are \nnecessary to prevent this from happening again in the future.\n  Mr. President, and my colleagues, I think that is a fair way of \nresolving this problem. A very complicated structure that says 25 or \nless has one standard, and then the judge can overrule the jury if he \nwants to, but if the defendant does not like it they can ask for \nanother trial, is too complicated, too time consuming, encourages too \nmany additional trials, and is not the way to do it.\n  I prefer the suggestion of Senator Dodd, which is in my amendment, \nwhich simply says if the jury finds the defendant was so negligent in a \nfashion that deserves punitive damages to be awarded, then the judge \nwill decide what is an effective and correct amount to be awarded.\n  Second, on the statute of repose, I think the Gorton-Rockefeller \namendment is defective again. Remember this uniformity argument we \ntalked about? They kept saying we need to pass this bill because we \nwant to make it uniform throughout the United States. Their bill is \ndefective because it says the statute of repose will be 25 years unless \nthe State wants to make it less. That is not uniform. It says we \n [[Page S6294]] can have 50 different States with 50 different statutes \nof repose and 50 different standards for a person who is injured to \nhave to worry about. That is not uniformity at all.\n  The statute of repose, of course, says that after a product has been \nin place for a period of time you can no longer bring a cause of action \nagainst that product because it is defective. My amendment says let us \nmake it uniform, 25 years across the country, nationwide; it is the \nsame in every State. That brings about uniformity both for the person \nwho manufactured the product and uniformity for the person who may be \ninjured by a defective product. I think that makes sense and is the \nright way to go.\n  The third area I think they are defective in, in their suggestion, is \non the question of joint and several liability. What they are trying to \ndo is address the problem of a manufacturer or defendant that is just a \nlittle bit responsible, just a little bit negligent. Their argument is \nif someone is only responsible for 3 percent of the injury he or she \nshould not be liable for 100 percent of the damages for noneconomic \ndamages, that is the pain and suffering type of injuries that a person \nwould receive from a defective product. But the way they have tried to \nhandle this problem is say you are not going to have any joint \nliability for noneconomic damages and that will take care of the \nproblem. Yes, that takes care of the problem. It wipes out the \npossibility of an injured person, perhaps, from getting any recovery at \nall.\n  What I am going to suggest in my amendment is simply this--and this \nis the language, again, that has been suggested by Senator Specter, who \nhas come up with I think a very good idea to solve this problem. I \npicked some from Democratic colleagues, Senator Dodd, some from our \nRepublican colleagues, Senator Specter, and tried to put them together \nbecause that is what we have been talking about for the last several \ndays. Senator Specter's suggestion, which I have included in my \nsuggestion, is simply to say there is a de minimis standard. If a \ndefendant is responsible for less than 15 percent of the injuries that \nwere caused, they cannot be held jointly liable, they can only be held \nliable for that percentage of the damages that it has been determined \nthey are at fault for, that they caused. If it is 3 percent they can \nonly be responsible for 3 percent. But after that threshold, if they \nare 20 to 30 to 40 percent responsible, then they can be held jointly \nliable. I think that takes care of the so-called de minimis problem, \nwhereby we should not hold someone responsible for the whole amount of \ndamages if they only caused a very small, de minimis, portion of those \ndamages. But after a certain point, joint liability should prevail.\n  We picked up Senator Specter's suggestion, which I think is a very \ngood one, that says if a person is 15 percent or more responsible for \nthese losses, then they can be held jointly liable for noneconomic \nlosses that they caused. That defendant, of course, has a cause of \naction for anybody else who is liable for the other portion of the \ndamages. That is what normally occurs. The defendant then brings in the \nother party and they can be held responsible--to the defendant who has \npaid the entire amount--for their portion. So the system works very \nwell. But my suggestion, I think, takes care of the de minimis concern \nthat has been expressed by many of our colleagues.\n  I will offer this amendment and will be able to offer it if the \ncloture motion is voted down. I think it would be a big mistake, when \nwe are so close to coming up with a compromise agreement, to at this \ntime invoke cloture and prevent the opportunity to offer this amendment \nwith a chance of it becoming law. This is really an attempt to try to \nreach a legitimate compromise. We can debate this for a long time. We \ncould continue to prevent cloture from being invoked.\n  I think it is time the Senate bring this measure to a close. What I \nhave tried to do is pick some of the best ideas from my colleagues. I \ncontinue to emphasize that many of the things I have in my legislation \nare the product of the suggestions of some of my colleagues--Senator \nSpecter in particular with this de minimis standard, my colleague \nSenator Dodd with the concept of punitive damages being set by the \njudge after a trial has occurred that determines that punitive damages \nwould be justified. I think that makes good sense, to try to \nincorporate Republican ideas and Democratic ideas, to put together a \npackage which is truly a compromise.\n  One of the things the advocates of this so-called tort reform \nlegislation have advocated is a national standard when it talks to \npunitive damages. I have incorporated their ideas on the national \nstandard being in fact that the plaintiff must show a conscious and \nflagrant indifference to safety concerns, and the plaintiff must do it \nand show it by clear and convincing evidence. That will be a national \nstandard now for punitive damages in product liability cases. I have \nincorporated that suggestion. That is the same as in the Gorton-\nRockefeller legislation.\n  In fact, much of what this substitute that I will offer really \nincorporates is the better features from the Gorton-Rockefeller \nlanguage. But it also tries to address the three major areas in which I \nthink they were defective, and those are how punitive damages are set, \nhow they deal with joint and several liability, and how they deal with \nthe statute of repose.\n  So I hope when we come to the floor to vote on cloture this morning, \nwhich has already been set, our colleagues will know there is an effort \namong many of us who have been involved to some extent in this \nlegislation to try to put together a package of amendments that is \ntruly a genuine compromise, that tries to treat people who are injured \nby defective products on the same level playing field that we are \ntrying to treat defendants who in fact have manufactured defective \nproducts.\n  It is improper for this body to try to give advantage to one group \nover the other group. If we conclude there should be some national \nstandards, then the national standards should apply both to those who \nare injured as well as to those who make the product that has caused \ninjury, in the same way. It would be unfair and improper to say one \nside is going to get more fair treatment than the other. I am concerned \nthe provisions that are pending in the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute in \nfact are not fair; in fact they do allow for more loopholes to be \ncreated with the 25-employee limitation, they do create some other \nproblems with regard to the establishment of punitive damages, they \nencourage more trials, and they encourage, I think, abuse of how \npunitive damages would be set.\n  We have tried to offer something that addresses all these problems in \na fashion that truly represents a fair and just compromise. But we do \nneed to ask our colleagues--who may be trying to figure out the \nsituation as to where we are--ask them to vote against the cloture \nmotion and allow us to come in with a compromise that I think for once \nand for all will settle this very, very difficult, very emotional set \nof issues that we have struggled with for so many days.\n  The alternative I will offer, and hope to be joined by a number of \nour colleagues, will be something that will give everybody an \nopportunity to say we made some reforms but we did it ultimately and \nfinally in a fashion that is fair to everyone involved. With that, Mr. \nPresident, is there any time left on the leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will just reserve that 30 seconds in case the leader \nneeds it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6292-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6294-S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NRA'S FUNDRAISING LETTER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, recently, the National Rifle Association \nissued a widely circulated fundraising letter over the signature of \nExecutive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and that letter is full of \nquestionable overheated language. I wish to focus on one paragraph in \nparticular. The letter states, and I am quoting exactly:\n\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the Government's go-ahead \n      [[Page S6295]]  to harass, intimidate, and even murder law-\n     abiding citizens.\n\n  Now, as if the force of the words ``even murder'' as applied here \nwere not repugnant enough, the letter underlines the words ``even \nmurder.''\n  This assertion that the U.S. law enforcement personnel have been \nauthorized by President Clinton ``to harass, intimidate, even murder \nlaw-abiding citizens'' is without foundation, and it is an offensive \noutrage that should be condemned by members of the NRA and all other \ndecent Americans.\n  On April 28, I wrote a letter to the president of the NRA, Mr. Tom \nWashington, asking that the statement be retracted. The statement is \ninflammatory; it is inappropriate. I do not think there is a single \nMember of this body who would stand in the Chamber of the Senate and \nspeak such words, asserting that our President has authorized law \nenforcement personnel to murder law-abiding citizens. I do not believe \nthe overwhelming majority of NRA members would countenance such \nlanguage.\n  My letter to Mr. Washington asked, ``Can you honestly justify your \norganization's characterization of law enforcement officials with such \nlanguage, describing them as on a mission sanctioned by the Government \nto murder law-abiding citizens?''\n  Madam President, on May 3, I received a reply from Mr. Washington, \nand his letter says:\n\n       While I concede that some of the language in the NRA \n     fundraising letter might have been rhetorically impassioned--\n     as is most political direct mail--that in no way disparages \n     the NRA, nor diminishes the seriousness of the alleged \n     federal law enforcement abuses to which the letter refers.\n\n  The letter goes on to relate the history of the NRA's interest in the \ninvestigation of Federal law enforcement abuse. The letter concludes \nwith the statement that ``blaming the rhetoric, whether in a \nfundraising letter or anywhere else in political discourse, serves only \nto silence dissent and aggravate that distrust.''\n  Well, Madam President, I have no interest in silencing dissent. I \nnever have. There is nothing more American than the conscientious \nexpression of dissent. There is no more sacred right guaranteed by our \nConstitution to all Americans than freedom of speech, and I will defend \nthe NRA's right to say what it said. The point is that the reply that I \nhave received from Mr. Washington did not answer the question that I \nasked. I asked Mr. Washington, ``Can you honestly justify your \norganization's characterization of law enforcement officials with such \nlanguage, describing them as on a mission sanctioned by the Government \nto murder law-abiding citizens?'' The question was not answered.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, that the NRA letter written \nby Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and my letter of April 28 to \nMr. Washington and Mr. Washington's letter of May 3 to me be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1995.\n     Mr. Tom Washington,\n     President, National Rifle Association,\n     Lansing, MI.\n       Dear Tom: Over the years we have agreed on some things, \n     like protecting our Great Lakes, and disagreed on others, \n     like the ban on assault weapons. But no matter what positions \n     we have on assault weapons, I hope you will agree that the \n     language of the NRA's recent fundraising letter over the \n     signature of Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre is \n     highly inflammatory and totally inappropriate.\n       In one passage, Mr. LaPierre writes, ``In Clinton's \n     administration, if you have a badge, you have the \n     government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder law-\n     abiding citizens.'' Can you honestly justify your \n     organization's characterization of law enforcement officials \n     with such language, describing them as on mission sanctioned \n     by the government to ``murder law-abiding citizens''?\n       This is but one example of the inflammatory, hateful \n     rhetoric in this letter. I will defend Mr. LaPierre's right \n     to free speech, but the public also has a right to expect the \n     NRA to retract hateful and inflammatory statements issued in \n     its name. I urge the NRA to retract the LaPierre letter.\n       Thank you for giving this request your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       National Rifle Association.\n       Dear Fellow American: I've worn out a lot of shoe leather \n     walking the halls of Congress. I've met key leaders, I've \n     talked with old allies, I've met with the new Congressmen and \n     many staff members.\n       What I'm hearing and seeing concerns me.\n       Many of our new Congressmen are ignoring America's 80 \n     million gun owners. Some have forgotten what we did to elect \n     them. Others say our demands to restore our Constitutional \n     freedoms are politically out of line.\n       Don't get me wrong, not all of them are like this. Senator \n     Phil Gramm, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Congressmen Bill \n     McCollum, Bill Brewster and Harold Volkmer are all coming to \n     our aid. But too many others are not.\n       And without a major show of force by America's 80 million \n     gun owners, America will resume its long march down the road \n     to gun bans, destruction of the Constitution and loss of \n     every sacred freedom.\n       I want you to know I'm not looking for a fight.\n       But when you consider the facts of our current situation, \n     you too, will see we have no other choice.\n       FACT #1: The Congress' leading anti-gunners, Senators \n     Dianne Feinstein, Ted Kennedy and Congressmen Charles Schumer \n     and Major Owens all survived their last elections.\n       They've pledged to fight to the bitter end for Brady II and \n     its ammo taxes, licensing and registration schemes, gun \n     rationing, bureaucrats with the power to determine if you \n     ``need'' a gun and yes, the repeal of the Second Amendment.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law is a failure.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law has become one \n     more tool that government agents are using to deny the \n     Constitutional rights of law abiding citizens.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives \n     jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our \n     Constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, \n     destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.\n       Schumer, Feinstein, Kennedy, Owens and the rest of the \n     anti-gunners want more and more gun control.\n       It can be something small and subtle like a regulation \n     expanding the disqualification criteria for the Brady Law. \n     They're fighting for anything that makes it harder for you to \n     own a gun.\n       The gun banners simply don't like you. They don't trust \n     you. They don't want you to own a gun. And they'll stop at \n     nothing until they've forced you to turn over your guns to \n     the government.\n       Fact No. 2: If the anti-gunners fail to achieve their goals \n     in Congress, they have a fall-back position in Bill Clinton, \n     the most anti-gun President in American history.\n       In two short years, Bill Clinton launched two successful \n     attacks on the Constitution. He signed two gun control bills \n     into law. He has sworn to veto any repeal of the semi-auto \n     ban and any restoration of our Constitutional rights.\n       His Interior and Agriculture Departments have set their \n     sights on closing hunting lands.\n       And his Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to \n     take jurisdiction over existing uses of lead. This, of \n     course, includes gun ranges and spent shot.\n       What's more, gun owners aren't the only ones Clinton's EPA \n     has set its sights on. They're after fishermen, too. They \n     want to BAN the use of small lead fishing sinkers and, of \n     gravest concern, they want to stop the home casting of these \n     sinkers.\n       If fishing sinkers are on the Clinton bureaucrat's list, \n     you know what's next: lead shot, lead bullets, bullet casting \n     and reloading.\n       Clinton's State Department is also adding to the attacks on \n     gun owners and our Constitutional freedoms. In December, he \n     signed the Summit of the America's agreements which pledges \n     that the U.S. Government will push for additional gun \n     control.\n       Over in the Justice Department, Clinton's Attorney General \n     Janet Reno has signaled her intent to ``squash'' the states' \n     rights movement an deny states their Constitutional power.\n       And worst of all,\n       Fact No. 3: President Clinton's army of anti-gun government \n     agents continues to intimidate and harass law-abiding \n     citizens.\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder \n     law-abiding citizens.\n       Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge . . . Waco and the Branch \n     Davidians . . . Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for \n     Federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm \n     trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.\n       Not today, not with Clinton.\n       Our calls to investigate these outrageous assaults on our \n     Constitutional freedoms are routinely silenced by the anti-\n     gun media. But that's no surprise.\n       Fact No. 4: They've launched a new wave of brainwashing \n     propaganda. . .\n       CBS, ABC, NBC, USA Today, Time, Newsweek and The New York \n     Times have launched another round of phony polls and slanted \n     stories to help the anti-gunners achieve their goals.\n       Their latest phony poll shows 70% of America support the \n     ``semi-auto'' assault weapon ban.\n        [[Page S6296]] That's simply not true. When it's explained \n     that ``semi-autos'' are used in less than a fraction of one \n     percent of crimes; that the ban only affects the law-abiding; \n     and, that the ban is only one more way to deny Constitutional \n     rights to the law-abiding, support for the ban drops to 30%.\n       But the media still uses this 70% statistic to trumpet the \n     call for gun control.\n       What scares me the most about this 70% number is that the \n     media has brainwashed 70% of Americans into believing that \n     the government--and not each individual--is responsible for \n     their personal protection.\n       Even worse, this 70% number means that there are enough \n     people who can be brainwashed by the media to vote for a \n     repeal of the Second Amendment if it were put to a vote.\n       The media, Clinton, the anti-gunners in Congress ... This \n     combination is a powder key that could blow at any moment and \n     it's set squarely underneath the Constitution.\n       And what this means is:\n       FACT #5: Congress must be forced to restore the \n     Constitution, repeal the gun bans, investigate abuse by \n     government agents and focus the public debate on criminal \n     control, not gun control ...\n       ... Or what we're seeing now will only be a momentary patch \n     of sunshine on the road to doom for the Second Amendment and \n     our Constitution.\n       There is hope, though. Despite the current situation, I'm \n     encouraged by you and your fellow NRA members.\n       Everywhere I go, to every gun show, every NRA-ILA \n     grassroots operation, every Friends of NRA Dinner, even in \n     cabs and airports around the country, I run into NRA members \n     who understand the stakes and stand ready to fight.\n       The question I hear from almost every one of these NRA \n     members is the same: ``What can I do next?''\n       If you're one of those members, I want to thank you for \n     your courage, your conviction and your spirit. You keep me \n     going. You keep me on the road. You give me strength to lead \n     the battle.\n       And if you want to join me in taking the next step, I need \n     you to do these two things today.\n       First, I need you to sign the enclosed Petitions to the \n     United States Congress.\n       These petitions are addressed to the leaders of the U.S. \n     Congress, Senator Robert Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich, and \n     your U.S. Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Alfonse M. \n     D'Amato and Congresswoman Sue Kelly.\n       Please be sure to sign all five petitions, then fold them \n     and place them in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope \n     addressed to me at NRA Headquarters.\n       These petitions spell out, in black and white, our agenda \n     of repeal, reform, investigate and limit government power.\n       In the first amendment of the Bill of Rights, we are \n     guaranteed the right to ``petition our Government for a \n     redress of grievances.''\n       And that's exactly what we're going to do: redress our \n     grievances in the biggest and most powerful display of \n     political clout and commitment to the Constitution.\n       I want to personally deliver your five petitions, and the \n     petitions of all 3.5 million of your fellow NRA members--17.5 \n     million petitions in all--to Congress.\n       And I want to show the leadership in Congress, and your \n     Senators and Congressmen from New York, that the number one \n     priority in their Contract with America must be defending and \n     restoring our Constitutional freedoms.\n       17.5 million Petitions to Congress is the largest ``redress \n     of grievances'' since the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     were written.\n       So I KNOW Congress will get the message. And I know they'll \n     act on our agenda of Repeal, Reform and Investigate if only \n     you and I speak out.\n       Your Petitions to Congress also sends another message--a \n     message not spelled out on the Petitions themselves.\n       Each Congressman, on the average, will receive 8,000 \n     Petitions from NRA members demanding action. 8,000 messages \n     from angry voters sounds an alarm in every Congressman's \n     head.\n       You see, most Congressional elections were won or lost by \n     5,000 votes or less. So, they'll realize that failing to \n     defend the Second Amendment and failing to retake the \n     Constitutional freedoms lost to the anti-gunners, could \n     result in big losses at the next election!\n       That's why it's critical you take a few minutes to sign \n     your Petitions to Congress and return them to me as soon as \n     possible.\n       These petitions are our D-Day.\n       Armed with these petitions and our First Amendment rights, \n     we are going to storm Congress, knock out anti-gunner \n     strongholds and recapture every bit of ground we lost since \n     Bill Clinton took office.\n       And if we're successful, these petitions will be the \n     turning point in the history of the Constitution . . . A day \n     when our sacred right to keep and bear arms will be secure \n     for the next generation of law-abiding Americans.\n       Second, when you return your signed Petitions to Congress, \n     I need you to make a special contribution to the NRA of $15, \n     $20, $25, $35, $50 or the most generous amount you can \n     afford.\n       Most Americans don't realize that our freedoms are slowly \n     slipping away.\n       They don't understand that politicians and bureaucrats are \n     chipping away at the American way of life.\n       They're destroying business, destroying our economy, \n     destroying property rights, destroying our moral foundation, \n     destroying our schools, destroying our culture . . .\n      Destroying our Constitution.\n       And the attack, either through legislation or regulation, \n     on the Second Amendment is only the first in a long campaign \n     to destroy the freedoms at the core of American life.\n       You can see it in the gun bans, certainly. But you can also \n     see it in closed ranges, closed hunting lands, confiscated \n     collectors' firearms, banned magazines and ammunition taxes.\n       You can see it when jack-booted government thugs, wearing \n     black, armed to the teeth, break down a door, open fire with \n     an automatic weapon, and kill or maim law-abiding citizens.\n       America's gun owners will only be the first to lose their \n     freedoms.\n       If we lose the right to keep and bear arms, then the right \n     to free speech, free practice of religion, and every other \n     freedom in the Bill of Rights are sure to follow.\n       I am one American who is not going to sit on the sidelines \n     and watch this happen.\n       And if you want to help me stop this destruction of the \n     Constitution, then I hope you can make that special \n     contribution of $15, $20, $25, $35 or $50 to the NRA today.\n       With your special contribution, I'll have the financial \n     ammo I need to keep Congress focused on the mission we've \n     assigned them.\n       First, with your help, I will expand out petition campaign \n     to involve as many of America's 80 million gun owners as \n     possible.\n       If we can double the number of Petitions flooding Congress, \n     we'll double the speed Congress deals with our demands to \n     repeal, reform and investigate. And with double the show of \n     clout, we'll wipe out anti-gunner opposition.\n       Second, with your special contribution, I can increase the \n     NRA's public exposure on talk shows, at rallies and shows, in \n     radio and T.V. advertising and through broadcasts like the \n     NRA's Town Meeting that first sounded our alarm in 16 million \n     households, last summer.\n       Part of our problem is that far too few Americans \n     understand what's at stake in these battles.\n       My ultimate goal is to educate the American people that \n     this issue is not just about guns, not just about hunting, \n     not just about personal protection; this issue is about \n     freedom--your freedom.\n       I want to use the power of T.V. and radio to show the \n     American people that, if the NRA fails to restore our Second \n     Amendment freedoms, the attacks will begin on freedom of \n     religion, freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search \n     and seizure. . .\n       And that unless we take action today, the long slide down \n     the slippery slope will only continue until there's no \n     freedom left in America at all.\n       I know you see it. The elbow room you have to hunt, shoot \n     and live life the way you see fit is slowly disappearing.\n       And the truth is, NRA members have been hardened by \n     legislative battles. And only NRA members have the courage, \n     the conviction to draw the line in the sand.\n       That's why I'm hoping you can take a few moments to sign \n     and date the enclosed petitions and return them to me with \n     your special contribution of $15, $20, $25, $35, $50 or more \n     in the enclosed postage-paid envelope today. Or, you can \n     charge by phone by calling 800-547-4NRA today.\n       You know, besides going shooting, I love to go to football \n     games. And every time I go, I always hear my fellow fans talk \n     about the impact of ``the 12th man.''\n       The 11 players calling the plays and doing the hitting get \n     a lot of their motivation from the 12th man in the stands. \n     I'm talking about the crowd who cheers wildly when our team \n     is on offense, and drowns out the signals of the opposing \n     team when they're on the defense.\n       I need you to be that 12th man.\n       I need you to sign your petitions to Congress and return \n     them to me today. That simple act will give our allies the \n     political courage to do what's right, to push ahead with our \n     agenda of Repeal, Reform, and Investigate.\n       Likewise, your signed petitions to Congress will confuse \n     and demoralize the anti-gun team and their agenda of bans, \n     taxes, intimidation, harassment and destruction of the \n     Constitution.\n       I know I've said what I'm about to say before. But this is \n     a message that resonates with NRA members across the land. \n     It's something I hope you, too, will say whenever you have \n     the occasion to defend our Constitutional freedoms.\n       This, the battle we're fighting today, is a battle to \n     retake the most precious, most sacred ground on earth. This \n     is a battle for freedom.\n       Please tell me you're ready to take the next step by \n     returning your signed petitions to Congress and special gift \n     to me in the enclosed postage-paid envelope today.\n       Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Yours in Freedom,\n                                                   Wayne LaPierre,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n       P.S. As a special thank you for making a special \n     contribution of $25 or more, I'd like to send you a copy of \n     my national best-selling book, Guns, Crime, and Freedom. \n     Guns, Crime, and Freedom is 263 pages of truth \n      [[Page S6297]]  about guns, gun control, gun owners, the \n     anti-gun media and what's happening to our freedoms.\n       I hope you'll read it and use it in your own personal \n     campaign in New York to defend the Constitution. Use Guns, \n     Crime, and Freedom to help you keep the pressure on Congress, \n     write letters to the editor and teach other Americans about \n     the battle we're fighting today. Thanks again for your \n     support and friendship.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    National Rifle\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                         Fairfax, VA, May 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: While I concede that some of the \n     language in the NRA fundraising letter you refer to might \n     have been rhetorically impassioned--as is most political \n     direct mail--that in no way disparages the NRA, nor \n     diminishes the seriousness of the alleged federal law \n     enforcement abuses to which the letter refers. And it is \n     certainly in no way related to the terrorist bombing in \n     Oklahoma City.\n       You asked if we can ``honestly justify'' rhetoric decrying \n     such abuses of federal power. That's what we want to find \n     out. In January 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union, the \n     National Rifle Association and others wrote to President \n     Clinton, petitioning him to appoint a commission to \n     investigate 25 documented cases of alleged federal law \n     enforcement abuse. Our request was ignored. So again in \n     January 1995, the ACLU, NRA and others petitioned the \n     President. All we ask is a full, fair and open examination \n     the facts--a request that, so far, has been denied.\n       This isn't just some petty gripe against the enforcement of \n     anti-gun laws by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \n     On the contrary, the inquiry we requested was to focus on all \n     53 federal law enforcement agencies, and on charges ranging \n     from the denial of basic civil rights, to the confiscation \n     and destruction of property, to the improper use of deadly \n     force against unarmed civilians.\n       I agree, senator, that the partisan posturing and political \n     exploitation of the Oklahoma City tragedy is reprehensible \n     and should stop. But before you condemn NRA's criticism of \n     federal law enforcement abuses as ``totally inappropriate,'' \n     I urge you to help us find out if it really is.\n       Let's get all the facts out on the table regarding these \n     cases. If the accusations against federal law enforcement are \n     baseless, let's expose them as such and vindicate the \n     officers accused. If, on the other hand, particular officers \n     are operating outside the rule of law, let's find them, \n     remove them and prosecute them for the good of the whole. \n     Whatever the case, let's put the grievances to rest once and \n     for all.\n       Doing so, I believe, could help reverse the public's \n     documented and growing distrust of federal power. Blaming the \n     rhetoric--whether in a fundraising letter or anywhere else in \n     political discourse--serves only to silence dissent and \n     aggravate that distrust.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                         Thomas L. Washington,\n\n                                                        President,\n                            National Rifle Association of America.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will defend LaPierre's, Mr. \nWashington's, and the NRA's right to free speech, but I continue to \nhope that the membership of the NRA and the American public will demand \nthat this patently false statement that the President has authorized \nthe murder of law-abiding citizens be retracted. There is a crucial \ndifference between what someone has a right to say and what it is right \nto say. This statement in the NRA letter is wrong. It deserves to be \ncondemned, and it should be withdrawn.\n  Madam President, I believe I have an allotted amount of morning \nbusiness time, and if so I would yield 3 minutes to my friend from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Michigan for giving me a few minutes.\n  Madam President, I believe the tactics used by Mr. LaPierre in his \nrecent fundraising letter for the National Rifle Association are just \nplain wrong. This letter does not contribute to any informed debate. \nInstead, it is inaccurate and irrational. It borders on the hysterical. \nAnd this kind of hysteria only encourages paranoia, which we certainly \ndo not need at this time in our Nation.\n  Madam President, I know that the Senator from Michigan has touched on \nsome of the quotes from the letter, but I would just like to mention a \nfew that stand out. Here is one paragraph from the letter:\n\n       It doesn't matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives \n     jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our \n     Constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, \n     destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.\n\n  This is another paragraph:\n\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder \n     law-abiding citizens. Not too long ago, it was unthinkable \n     for Federal agents wearing nazi bucket helmets and black \n     storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.\n\n  And another:\n\n       They've launched a new wave of brainwashing propaganda \n     aimed at further destroying our Constitutional freedoms.\n\n  And on it goes, Madam President.\n  Now, Madam President, the apocalypse described in this fundraising \nletter is not familiar to me. The Government described in these pages \nis not familiar to me. This is not a description of reality. It is a \ndescription of terror designed for one purpose: to provoke a visceral \nreaction against the U.S. Government--and at the end of the day, to \nraise money.\n  There are many powerful and ugly words used in this letter. They are \ninsulting to American law enforcement and to American citizens. Why \ndoes Mr. LaPierre use them? I suppose in order to tap into the rage \nthat some feel against the U.S. Government, to feed that rage, and to \nuse that rage to gain donations.\n  In various interviews, Mr. LaPierre has acknowledged the NRA letter \nwent too far. I believe it behooves him and the leadership of the NRA \nto apologize to the men and women in Federal law enforcement and to the \nAmerican people for this letter's rhetoric, and to refrain from this \nkind of inflammatory prose in the future.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for giving me a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his comments on \nthis letter.\n  Madam President, on another matter, we have a bill pending before us \nwhich I would like to briefly address as part of my time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6294-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6297-S6299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE PRODUCT LIABILITY FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the bill that we will be voting on later \nthis morning is called the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995. One \nof the arguments for it is that we need uniformity in a tort system. As \na matter of fact, Madam President, the bill is carefully structured to \nauthorize States to diverge from these standards in order to provide \nmore favorable treatment to defendants than the bill provides, but the \nbill prohibits States from providing more favorable treatment to \nplaintiffs.\n  In other words, this bill does not provide us with uniformity. When \nwe look down the provisions in the bill, we will see in a moment that \nthe bill does not assure that there will be a uniform application of \nthese provisions to all plaintiffs and all defendants. The bill \nprohibits a State law attempting to provide more favorable treatment to \nthose who have been injured, but it allows State laws that are more \nfavorable to those who allegedly cause the injury.\n  Now there is a reasonable argument for uniformity in product \nliability law, since many products are sold across State lines. But, \nthis bill does not provide that uniformity. States can be more \nrestrictive than the so-called national standards in the bill. A \npatchwork of State laws is still permitted, provided that the \ndivergences are in the direction of greater restriction on the injured \nparty.\n  For instance, the bill contains a so-called statute of repose barring \nany product liability action against a manufacturer of a product that \nis more than 20 years old. This provision prohibits States from \nproviding a longer period for those who are injured. But the bill \nexpressly authorizes States to adopt a shorter and more restrictive \nperiod in order to benefit defendants.\n  Similarly, the bill contains standards for the imposition of punitive \ndamages, but the provision by its own terms only applies to the extent \nthat punitive damages are permitted by State law. The committee report \nstates that:\n\n       It is not the committee's intention that this act preempt \n     State legislation or any other rule of State law that \n     provides for defenses or places limitations on the amount of \n     damages that may be recovered.\n\n  In other words, if a State has more lenient standards for the award \nof punitive damages, the bill overrides those \n [[Page S6298]]  standards--States cannot do that--but if a State has \nmore restrictive standards, lower caps, additional limitations, or even \nbars punitive damages altogether, that is allowed by this bill.\n  While I am on the topic of punitive damages, I would like to point \nout that the so-called fix adopted by the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute \nis, in fact, no fix at all. Punitive damages would be capped under the \nsubstitute as they are capped by the underlying bill. The substitute \nlimits the punitive damages that maybe awarded by a jury at two times \ncompensatory damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater. The substitute \nthen purports to authorize judges to increase punitive damages in cases \nwhere a jury award is ``insufficient to punish the egregious conduct of \nthe defendant.''\n  But, Madam President, the authority under this substitute we will be \nvoting on, which is given to the judge, is an illusion. Because if the \ndefendant objects to the increased damages, he or she is entitled to a \nnew trial on the subject of punitive damages. Judgment is not entered \non liability or damages until the completion of the new trial. So the \nplaintiff cannot get a dime until after the new trial is completed.\n  Nothing in the substitute indicates that the judge's decision to \nincrease the punitive damages award may be considered at this new \ntrial. Nothing in the substitute indicates that the caps on punitive \ndamages would be waived at the new trial. So it even appears that the \nsame old caps may apply.\n  Under these circumstances, what defendant would not insist on a new \ntrial on punitive damages? And what plaintiff would be willing to \nforego all compensatory damages while awaiting a new trial on the \nsubject of punitive damages?\n  Those of my colleagues who favor punitive damage caps should feel \nvery comfortable indeed voting for cloture on this substitute. But \nthose who oppose caps should be forewarned. The caps in this substitute \nare every bit as real as the caps in the underlying bill.\n  Back to the uniformity issue. These are one-way limits.\n  This chart shows which State laws would be prohibited and which would \nbe allowed. Categories of State laws that would be prohibited are shown \nin red. Categories of State laws that would be allowed are shown in \ngreen. In the left-hand column, we see that every single type of State \nlaw that would be more favorable to the injured party is prohibited. \nEvery State law that would vary from the so-called standard in order to \nbenefit a plaintiff in any of the areas covered by this bill is \nprohibited by the bill; it is preempted. But in the right-hand column, \nwe see that, with one exception, State law provisions that are more \nfavorable to defendants are allowed.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the need for national standards for \nproduct liability. But what this chart shows is that where the bill \nprovides true national standards, it is only where plaintiffs are \nprohibited from gaining the benefit of any State law that varies from \nthe so-called standard. But with one exception, State laws are allowed \nto vary from the so-called standard and to have more restrictive rules \nthat benefit the defendant.\n  These are not national standards. These are one-way rules that limit \nonly plaintiffs, and if defendants are able to get more restrictive \nlaws passed by the States, they will not restrict defendants.\n  Let us look at one example of how this one-way preemption provision \nwould work. The bill would override State laws that provide joint and \nseveral liability for noneconomic damages. Joint and several liability \nis the doctrine under which any one defendant may be held responsible \nfor 100 percent of the damages in a case, even if other wrongdoers also \ncontributed to the injury.\n  The sponsors of this bill, and this amendment, have pointed out that \nthere are problems with joint and several liability. In some cases, a \ndefendant who has only a marginal role in causing the damage ends up \nholding the bag for all of the damages. That does not seem fair.\n  On the other hand, there are good reasons for the doctrine of joint \nand several liability. Cause and effect often cannot be assigned on a \npercentage basis with accuracy. There may be many causes of an event, \nthe absence of any one of which would have prevented the event from \noccurring. Because the injury would not have occurred without each of \nthese so-called but-for causes, each is, in a very real sense, 100 \npercent responsible for the resulting injury.\n  This bill, however, does not recognize that in the real world, \nmultiple wrongdoers may each be a cause of the same injury. It insists \nthat responsibility be portioned out, with damages divided up into \npieces, and the liability of each defendant limited to a single piece. \nUnder this approach, the more causes the event can be attributed to, \nthe less each defendant will have to pay.\n  Unless the person who has been injured can successfully sue all \nparties who contributed to the injury, he or she will not be \ncompensated for his entire loss. The real world result is that\n most plaintiffs will not be made whole, even if they manage to \novercome the burdens of our legal system and prevail in court. Would it \nnot be more fair to say that the wrongdoers, each of whom caused the \ninjury, should bear the risk that one or more of them might not be able \nto pay its share than it is for the injured party to be only partially \ncompensated for his or her loss?\n\n  The bill before us completely ignores the complexity of this issue \nwith its one-way approach to Federal preemption. States which are more \nfavorable to defendants are allowed to retain their laws. But State \nlaws that try to reach a balanced approach between plaintiffs and \ndefendants would be preempted.\n  Roughly half the States choose to protect the injured party through \nthe doctrine of joint and several liability. Another half dozen States \nhave adopted creative approaches to joint and several liability, \nseeking to balance the rights of plaintiffs and defendants.\n  Let me give you a few examples.\n  Louisiana law provides joint and several liability only to the extent \nnecessary for the plaintiff to recover 50 percent of damages; there is \nno joint and several liability at all in cases where the plaintiff's \ncontributory fault was greater than the defendant's fault.\n  Mississippi law provides joint and several liability only to the \nextent necessary for the plaintiff to recover 50 percent of damages, \nand for any defendant who actively took part in the wrongdoing.\n  New Jersey law provides joint and several liability in the case of \ndefendants who are 60 percent or more responsible for the harm; joint \nand several liability for economic loss only in the case of defendants \nwho are 20 to 60 percent responsible; and no joint and several \nliability at all for defendants who are less than 20 percent \nresponsible.\n  New York law provides joint and several liability for defendants who \nare more than 50 percent responsible for the harm; joint and several \nliability is limited to economic loss in the case of defendants who are \nless than 50 percent responsible.\n  South Dakota law provides that a defendant that is less than 50 \npercent responsible for the harm caused to the claimant may not be \nliable for more than twice the percentage of fault assigned to it.\n  Texas law provides joint and several liability only for defendants \nwho are more than 20 percent responsible for the harm caused to the \nclaimant.\n  All of these State laws are efforts to address a complex problem in a \nbalanced manner, with full recognition of factors unique to the State. \nBecause they are all more favorable to the injured party than the \napproach adopted in this bill, however, they would all be prohibited.\n  Perhaps this is one reason why the National Conference of State \nLegislatures opposes this bill. As the NCSL explains:\n\n       Tort law traditionally has been a state responsibility, and \n     the imposition of federal products standards into the complex \n     context of state tort law would create confusion in state \n     courts. Without imposing one-size-fits-all federal standards, \n     states may act on their own initiative to reform product \n     liability law in ways that are tailored to meet their \n     particular needs and that fit into the context of existing \n     state law.\n       The proponents of S. 565 want Washington to dictate the \n     legal standards and evidentiary rules that fifty state court \n     systems use to adjudicate injury disputes involving\n      allegedly defective products. There is no precedent for such \n     congressional imposition of federal rules by which state \n     courts will be forced to decide civil disputes.\n        [[Page S6299]] For NCSL, the question is not which tort \n     reforms are appropriate, but who makes that decision. The \n     issue is who has responsibility for state civil justice. This \n     is a federalism issue of major consequence. It should not be \n     ignored.\n\n  Madam President, what kind of national standard is it that prohibits \nState laws only when they are more favorable to plaintiffs than Federal \nlaw and not when they vary from Federal law to favor defendants? What \nkind of fairness bill is it that contains such a blatant double \nstandard?\n  Madam President, the bill before us is called the Product Liability \nFairness Act of 1995. If you read the title, it sounds pretty good. Who \ncould be against bringing greater fairness to our product liability \nsystem, or to our legal system in general?\n  There is a list of problems in our legal system that we could all go \nthrough. Going to court takes too much time and it costs too much \nmoney. There are many stories of plaintiffs winning what seem like \nabsurdly high verdicts or, on the other hand, being denied a day in \ncourt by defendants with deep pockets who engage in such hard-ball \ntactics as investigations into the private lives of plaintiffs, \ngrueling depositions, unreasonable requests for medical and \npsychological histories of plaintiffs, and multiple motions to dismiss.\n  As Senator Gorton, one of the lead authors of the bill before us, \nexplained at the outset of this debate:\n\n       [T]he victims of this system are very often the claimants, \n     the plaintiffs themselves, who suffer by the actual \n     negligence of a product manufacturer, and frequently are \n     unable to afford to undertake the high cost of legal fees \n     over an extended period of time. Frequently, they are forced \n     into settlements that are inadequate because they lack \n     resources to pay for their immediate needs, their medical and \n     rehabilitation expenses, their actual out-of-pocket costs.\n        In 1989, a General Accounting Office study found that on \n     average, cases take 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years to be resolved, and \n     even longer when there is an appeal. One case studied by the \n     GAO took 9\\1/2\\ years to move through our court system. In \n     one of many hearings held on this issue over the years, \n     University of Virginia law professor Jeffrey O'Connell \n     explained, and I quote him: ``If you are badly injured in our \n     society by a product and you go to the highly skilled lawyer, \n     in all honesty the lawyer cannot tell you what you will be \n     paid, when you will be paid or, indeed, if you will be \n     paid.''\n\n  Senator Gorton concluded his thought as follows:\n\n       Uncertainty in the present system is a reason for change. \n     Plaintiffs, those injured by faulty products, need quicker, \n     more certain recovery--recovery that fully compensates them \n     for their genuine losses. Defendants, those who produced the \n     products, need greater certainty as to the scope of their \n     liability.\n\n  I agree with Senator Gorton that there is unfairness in our current \nlegal system. There is unfairness to defendants in some cases, and \nthere is unfairness to plaintiffs. However, this bill does not address \nthe problems faced by plaintiffs at all. There is virtually nothing in \nthis bill to assist those who have been hurt by defective products and \nface the difficult burdens of trying to recover damages through our \nlegal system.\n  For instance, this bill does nothing to address the hardball \nlitigation tactics used by some defendants in product liability cases, \nsuch as excessive investigations, depositions, and motions practice \nthat often mars such litigation. It does nothing to help bring to \npublic light documents revealing defendants' knowledge of product \ndefects, or to shorten the time required to litigate these cases and \nobtain relief.\n  Instead this bill would limit the money that can be recovered by \nplaintiffs who manage to navigate the hazards of our legal system and \nprovide in court that they were hurt by defective products. The bill \ncontains any number of provisions addressing compensation to plaintiffs \nwhich is too high, but not a single provision addressing the cases in \nwhich, as the sponsors themselves acknowledge, compensation is too low.\n  This bill is not balanced, it is not uniform, and I cannot support \nit.\n  Madam President, if I have any additional time remaining, I will be \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I only want to speak briefly right now \nrelative to this matter. I think the Senator from Michigan has covered \nthe issue on additur very adequately.\n  In the case of Dimick versus Schiedt, a 1935 Supreme Court case, the \nHigh Court ruled that the district court lacked the power to deny a \nplaintiff a new trial, sought on the ground that the jury award of \ndamages was too low, when the trial court judge proposed to increase \nthe damages and the defendant had consented in order to avoid a new \ntrial. The Supreme Court held that the power to increase a damage \naward, known as an additur, was a violation of the right of trial by \njury. According to the Court, the amount of damages must be determined \nby juries, not judges, in the Federal court, subject to the right of \ncourts to set aside jury awards that are clearly excessive. Some State \ncourts have held that additur violates their State's constitution as \nwell.\n  That is the major point that I want to make on this issue. Senator \nLevin mentioned this matter pertaining to the lack of uniformity.\n  I want to also point out that all State courts under the bill and the \nsubstitute--any of the substitutes--are to accept as binding precedents \nin the construing act, the decision of a Federal court of appeals \ncovering this mandate.\n  This mandate, in my judgment, is clearly unconstitutional and \ncontrary to article III of section 1 of the Constitution, which \nprovides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested \nin one Supreme Court, which has always been construed to mean that \nState courts must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court and not the \nlower Federal courts.\n  With the addition of the punitive damage additur provision in the \nsubstitute, there is an expansion by Congress of an extraordinary \nnature to encroach on the power of the State courts. Rules concerning \nthe use of additur and remittitur have always been left to the State \ncourts, as have also every other State rule of civil procedure.\n  I just wanted to mention that. I think there are others who are \ndesiring to speak. I yield the floor at this time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized to speak up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Parliamentary inquiry. Is there a 5-minute limit on \nspeeches this morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania has been allocated 10 minutes to speak, after which there \nis a 10:30 a.m. vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6297-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6299-S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STOP THE DEMAGOGING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor yielding a portion of his time. I do not think I will take the 5 \nminutes.\n  After the trauma and the tragedy that we have gone through in \nOklahoma, it has diverted our attention from many of the other \nsignificant things that are taking place in this body. I think the most \nsignificant thing, second only to that tragedy in Oklahoma, is the \ntragedy, the revelation that was recently discovered of what is going \nto happen to Medicare in America and the demagoging that is taking \nplace in this and other bodies concerning that trauma.\n  Specifically, a report was released by the Medicare trustees that has \ncome to the incontrovertible conclusion that our Medicare system, in \nabsence of change, is going to go broke in the year 2002, approximately \n6\\1/2\\ years from now.\n  I think it is important to look and see who was it who looked at the \ndata, who studied the actuarial reports and came to that conclusion.\n  There are six members of the Board of Trustees of Medicare. They are \nRobert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was appointed by \nPresident Clinton; Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor, appointed by \nPresident Clinton; Donna Shalala, Secretary of HHS, appointed by \nPresident Clinton; Shirley Carter, Commissioner of Social Security, \nappointed by President Clinton; and Stanford Ross and David Walker.\n  Four of the six members are appointments and work in the Clinton \nadministration, and they have come up with the conclusion that Medicare \nwill, in \n [[Page S6300]]  fact, go broke in the year 2002. I think we know the \nreasons for it, and I will not get into that.\n  Quoting from the report, it says, Medicare is ``severely out of \nfinancial balance and the trustees believe that Congress must take \ntimely action to establish long-term financial stability for the \nprogram. The trustees believe that prompt, effective and decisive \naction is necessary.''\n  Madam President, these are the trustees that were appointed by \nPresident Clinton, and what has happened since that time? Absolutely \nnothing. We have not heard one word out of the Clinton administration. \nWe hear a lot of people criticizing Republicans because we want to do \nsomething to save a system, and they come up and say, ``The Republicans \nare suggesting that they are going to cut Medicare in order to pass a \ntax reduction.'' Nothing could be further from the truth, and that \ncertainly is not true. But for the President to do nothing in facing \nthis crisis is something that cannot be tolerated.\n  The proposal that has been discussed by the Budget Committee \nchairman, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, has suggested that we put \ncaps on the system, somewhere around 7 to 7.5 percent growth caps. In \nother words, the Republican budget is suggesting not that we have cuts \nin Medicare, but that we have increases in Medicare, but those \nincreases will be capped somewhere between 7 and 7.5 percent, at an \namount that has been actuarially determined that we will now have \nMedicare and it will not go bankrupt in the year 2002.\n  Right now, Madam President, we have some 36 million people on \nMedicare. It is projected by the time 2002 comes, we will have \nsomething like 50 million Americans, 20 percent of all Americans, \nincluding myself, will be eligible for Medicare at that time.\n  So I only say, it is time to stop the demagoging. We have a very \nserious problem on our hands. I believe the Republicans have a solution \nto that problem, but we should be getting some leadership from the \nWhite House at this time. This is not something with which we should be \nplaying politics.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6299-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A CRISIS IN MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis comments. I wholeheartedly agree with him. I think this is a \nquestion of leadership, what kind of leadership we are going to see not \nonly out of the White House but out of the U.S. Senate.\n  I think the rhetoric to date has not served this institution well. \nThere is, indeed, a crisis in Medicare. I know there are a lot of folks \non the other side of the aisle who are saying we knew about this \ncrisis, you folks denied there was a health care crisis. We are not \ntalking about a health care crisis, we are talking about a Medicare \ncrisis. We are talking about a trust fund problem that says there is \nnot enough money in the trust fund to be able to fund Medicare past a \n7-year window. That is immediate, that is real, and that is something \nthat we have to deal with, and I believe we will only deal with if we \ndo so in a bipartisan way.\n  If this becomes a partisan issue where one seeks to take political \ngain at the expense of doing something that is responsible action, we \nwill not succeed and the trust fund will continue to go further and \nfurther to the brink of insolvency, and we will be left with not a lot \nof options but very dramatic choices that are going to affect a lot of \ntaxpayers and a lot of seniors and the availability of Medicare \nbenefits into the future.\n  The other comment I keep hearing is, ``Well, this crisis has been \naround a long time and we have known. This is not the first trustees \nreport that has been published that says Medicare is in trouble and \nwill go bankrupt in a few years.''\n  That is true. In fact, over the last 10, 15 years, the average \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund has been about 12 years. Now it is \nat 7, which is I think a low. That is the shortest timeframe that we \nhave seen recently where Medicare is in trouble and scheduled to go \nbankrupt. So it is important, but we are usually running around 12, 14 \nyears as the average.\n  So why the big hullabaloo now? The reason for that is, once we get \nthrough the next 12 years or so, to the year 2010, we can do that \npretty well by doing a fix. Senator Domenici's budget calls for roughly \n$250 billion in reductions in the growth rate of Medicare over the next \n7 years. That will fix Medicare, again, to make it solvent for about 12 \nyears from now, which will be about average of where the fund has been.\n  The problem with that is not the 12 years, it is what happens in the \n13th, 14th, 15th year and beyond, because after 12 years from now or 13 \nyears from now that is when the baby boomers begin to retire and that \nis when Medicare really takes off.\n  Spending in Medicare just goes up astronomically once the baby \nboomers and that big chunk of the population starts getting into this \nprogram. So when we look at Medicare funding now, we have to look at it \nwith a whole new ball game in mind. We have to preserve the long-term \nfunding and solvency of this program through a period where we are \ngoing to see a rapid escalation, not in the cost of Medicare and \ninflation, but in the number of people in the program.\n  So when we look at Medicare now, and I hope we will have this \ninformed discussion, that we will look at it over the long term \nrecognizing that Medicare costs, just by demographic reasons, are going \nto escalate beyond what we have ever seen before in the history of the \nMedicare program.\n  So I am hoping we can have this kind of constructive dialog and we \nwill not use brinkmanship for political gain, that we will have a good, \nbipartisan solution to the problem that faces this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6300-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6300-S6301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to take some time today to \nbelatedly honor the North Dakota State University women's basketball \nteam. Outside of North Dakota, most people probably don't know that \nthis team won the NCAA division II national championship. Not only did \nthey win it this year, but the Bison women have won this honor for 3 \nstraight years. I think they deserve some national recognition.\n  The NDSU women had the additional honor of being the first ever \ndivision II women's team to make it through a season undefeated. This \nremarkable team ended its season 32-0, and they did it by focusing on \none game at a time.\n  I think we can all learn some important lessons about life by \nwatching these champions--about perseverance, about working together \nand helping each other, about being a good sport.\n  I want to congratulate each of these women for the year of hard work \nthat culminated in their ultimate victory: seniors Linda Davis and \nLynette Mund who provided experience and leadership, juniors LaShalle \nBoehm, Jessica DeRemer, Jenni Rademacher, and Lori Roufs; sophomore \nKasey Morlock, who was the most valuable player of the tournament, and \nher fellow sophomores Rhoda Birch and Andrea Kelly; and freshmen Tanya \nFischer, Erica Lyseng, Amy Ornell, and Rachael Otto.\n  These women are even more special because they will not be making \nmillions of dollars playing in the NBA when they graduate. They are \nplaying basketball because they love the game, and in the process they \nare serving as good role models for many young girls who need active, \nsuccessful young women to look up to.\n  A lot of the credit for the success of the NDSU program rests with \nHead Coach Amy Ruley. She has led the Bison to four championships in \nthe last five seasons. In fact, she is doing such a good job that the \nUniversity of Illinois and Long Beach State--two division I schools--\nboth wanted her for their programs, but I was glad to hear recently \nthat she has decided to stay with us in North Dakota.\n  We also can not overlook the assistant coaches, Kelli Layman and \nKathy Wall; student assistant Darci Steere; volunteer assistant Robin \nKelly; student trainer Nikki Germann; and student manager Mary \nSchueller. Their work behind the scenes plays an important role in the \nteam's success.\n   [[Page S6301]] We in North Dakota have a lot to look forward to from \nthe NDSU women's program in the future. All but the two seniors will be \nreturning, and this team knows what it feels like to win. For now, \nthough, we can just savor the feeling of having national champions in \nour midst.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6300-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncaptain and crew of Young America, which as many of my colleagues know, \nis the yacht that came very close to winning the Defenders' series of \nthe America's Cup competition on April 26.\n  Young America, owned by the Maine-based PACT '95 syndicate and \noriginating out of my hometown of Bangor, was very strong in the \ncompetition but was beaten in the finals by America's Cup veterans and \npast victor, Dennis Conner and his boat, Stars & Stripes.\n  While Young America's captain, Kevin Mahaney, did not have Dennis \nConner's experience, he sailed boldly and impressively and displayed \nthe kind of leadership and perseverance for which Mainers are renowned. \nKevin had captured the silver medal in sailing at the 1992 Olympics, \nbut it was his first America's Cup competition. He and his crew sailed \nwith excellence throughout the competition.\n  Last summer, before Kevin even had a boat to compete in, he started \nto assemble a crew with John Marshall, head of the PACT '95 syndicate. \nMarshall was an experienced sailor and former crew mate of Dennis \nConner in past America's Cup bids. Even so, many people on the sailing \ncircuit did not assign much credibility to their efforts and saw little \nthreat from their entry. However, Mahaney and Marshall and the crew \nthey assembled soon made yachting enthusiasts begin to take notice of \nthe boat from Bangor.\n  This is not to say that Young America encountered smooth waters \nduring its assent to the top ranks of yachting. Mahaney had to rely \nheavily on the tenacious crew that he assembled to overcome obstacles \nand make it as far as they did.\n  Young America's bid for the cup was threatened last January when a \ntornado ripped through the compound where it was stored, causing \nextensive damage to the boat. In March, bad luck struck again when \nYoung America suffered significant structural damage while being towed \nthrough heavy waves. This damage was particularly ill-timed, and the \ncrew had to rush to make repairs in the final days before the Defender \nsemifinals. John Marshall saw the silver lining in these clouds and \ncommented that the times of hardship were when the crew really came \ntogether as a team.\n  Ironically, the crew that worked so hard to bring Young America to \nthe forefront of the yachting world had the bittersweet experience of \nnow seeing their boat compete against New Zealand in the America's Cup \nfinals without them aboard. Shortly after his victory, Dennis Conner, \nfull of admiration for Mahaney's triumphs, asked John Marshall if he \nand his crew could sail Young America in the final competition. \nDiplomatic to the last, Marshall honored his request. He said that both \nthe crews from Stars & Stripes and Young America will emerge as victors \nif the Americans beat New Zealand.\n  The quiet but determined efforts of Kevin Mahaney and his crew \njustifiably make Mainers proud. While they are not manning the boat \nthat is competing against the New Zealand vessel this week, everyone's \nmind will be on the come-from-behind boat known as Young America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6301-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING BILLINGS, MT, POSTAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Madam President, yesterday before the Senate Finance \nCommittee I spoke about the importance of the Medicare Program to \nMontanans. I would like to take this opportunity to share those \ncomments with the entire Senate.\n  There being no objection, the comments were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, here in Washington, people often lose the \n     forest for the trees. I'm afraid we may be doing just that on \n     Medicare. So I hope we can begin by remembering what life was \n     like for older Americans before Medicare.\n       The fact is, before we created Medicare, our senior \n     citizens lived in fear.\n       Everyone over sixty knew that private insurance was shaky \n     and expensive at best, and would cost them more every year.\n       And a serious illness--or even a common ailment that \n     required treatment but did not threaten life--was not only a \n     health problem, but something that could reduce a whole \n     family to poverty.\n       Today, Medicare has removed that fear from our lives. Those \n     of us with short memories have forgotten it ever existed. But \n     let me tell you about some people who don't.\n       Two weeks ago I spent some time at the Seniors Center in \n     Great Falls, Montana. The people at the center know exactly \n     what Medicare and Social Security mean to their lives.\n       It means a little financial security. Some faith that \n     illnesses will be treated and that families won't be wiped \n     out by the cost. A hundred and twenty-five thousand Montanans \n     are eligible for Medicare, and each one of them knows exactly \n     what Medicare means.\n       Listen to Margaret and Frank Jackson of Billings, who wrote \n     me last week:\n       ``Social Security and Medicare are not only necessary, they \n     are absolutely essential to our survival in Montana. Higher \n     costs such as higher property tax, increase in school levies, \n     fuel in a cold climate, and medicine take a toll. There is \n     just too much month at the end of our money. Needless to say, \n     additional cuts would put a burden on us.''\n       Or Joyce Hert, also from Billings:\n       ``I am 58 years old and for the past 18 years have had \n     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, emphysema, \n     Renaud's Disease, degenerative arthritis and a disease of the \n     connective tissue. . . . My medication costs approximately \n     $677\n      a month* * *. Please don't turn your back on those of us who \n     need Social Security and Medicare.''\n       The leadership now proposes something like $250 billion in \n     Medicare cuts. It is staggering. It is a reduction of nearly \n     a quarter in Medicare services by the year 2002. And to add \n     insult to injury, the House would do it in part to pay for \n     tax cuts for Americans who are already very wealthy. Some in \n     the Senate want to do the same.\n       What would it mean if this happens?\n       Montana Medicare beneficiaries would pay up to $800 more a \n     year out of their own savings. These are people who live on \n     fixed incomes, and eight hundred bucks is an awfully big \n     bite.\n       We would see thousands of operations and hospital stays put \n     off.\n       Thousands of people would decide to go without home health \n     care.\n       And, as the federal government cut reimbursement, more \n     rural hospitals would be pushed to the edge, forced to choose \n     between serving their patients and remaining solvent. Some \n     Montana hospitals get 60% of their \n      [[Page S6302]]  revenue from Medicare. This plan would hit \n     them like a wrecking ball.\n       Now, it may well be that we need to make changes in the \n     Medicare program. We must be realistic.\n       The answer is not, however, to simply approach Medicare \n     reform as a budget cutting exercise. Because we are talking \n     about preserving essential health services for 125,000 senior \n     citizens in Montana and thirty million seniors across \n     America.\n       We are talking about good, middle class Americans like the \n     Jacksons.\n       And above all, we must not use Medicare as a piggy bank. \n     Don't take money that buys health care for senior citizens \n     and use it for a tax break for rich individuals and big \n     corporations. That is disgraceful.\n       Perhaps some changes lie ahead. But if they do, they should \n     be made for the single purpose of keeping Medicare services \n     for senior citizens and people with disabilities. It is an \n     issue of good faith on the part of the government, and basic, \n     essential health services for Americans.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6301-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF GEORGE K.

Arthur, after four decades of public service. Mr. Arthur, who has \nbeen Common Council President since 1983, is a distinguished public \nservant who has given much to the people of Buffalo. I know I speak for \nthe people of Buffalo in offering George Arthur great thanks and \ncongratulations. He will indeed be missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article \nfrom the Buffalo News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                  [From the Buffalo News, May 8, 1995]\n\n           Political Leaders Praise Arthur's Enduring Legacy\n\n                         (By Anthony Cardinale)\n\n       Geroge K. Arthur will leave a legacy of lasting achievement \n     as Common Council president when he steps down on Dec. 31, \n     several political observers said Sunday.\n       Never mind the decade of Common Council friction with then-\n     Mayor James D. Griffin, who reserved his most stinging \n     invective for the Council president and took particular \n     delight in defeating Arthur's challenge for the mayor's \n     office 10 years ago.\n       Arthur's proudest hour as a politician was when he beat the \n     Democratic incumbent for the Democratic Party's endorsement \n     in 1985, these observers agreed. And he would have ousted \n     Griffin from City Hall, they added, if it weren't for the \n     votes siphoned off by Nicholas Costantino as an independent \n     candidate.\n       Arthur, 62, who announced over the weekend that he won't \n     seek re-election, was first elected to the former Erie County \n     Board of Supervisors in 1963. He was elected Ellicott \n     District Council member in 1969, then Council member at \n     large, and he has been Council president since 1983.\n       ``I believe it's probably the longest political career of \n     anybody in our area,'' said Vincent J. Sorrentino, Erie \n     County Democratic chairman.\n       ``He was part of the emergence of the black community into \n     the mainstream of the political process in our community--he \n     and (Council President) Delmar Mitchell a little before \n     him,'' said Joseph F. Crangel, Sorrentino's predecessor at \n     the party helm.\n       ``His leadership was instrumental in helping much of the \n     rebirth of Buffalo,'' said Arthur O. Eve, deputy Assembly \n     speaker, who pointed to measures to improve Buffalo's housing \n     stock and quality of life.\n       Accolades for Arthur even came from Council Member Alfred \n     T. Coppola of the Delaware District, who has often clashed \n     with him--and who now wants to succeed him as Council \n     president.\n       ``We've disagreed on various projects, but we've also \n     agreed on some,'' said Coppola, who has asked Sorrentino for \n     his backing.\n       ``George has always been a unique person,'' Coppola went \n     on. ``He's always been a gentleman. There were times when \n     George pulled us together. He'd say, `Let's sit around a \n     breakfast table and let it all hang out on a Saturday \n     morning.' Those were terrific meetings.''\n       Arthur's ability to bring together dissenting parties was \n     the common theme Sunday of those who have worked with him \n     over the years.\n       ``George did an excellent job in helping to forge together \n     a very diverse group of men and women into a fairly cohesive \n     body,'' Eve said. ``That takes a lot of talent, patience and \n     compassion,.''\n       Eve said he will work to help Council Majority Leader James \n     W. Pitts become the next Council president.\n       ``We certainly will miss (Arthur) as the Council \n     president,'' Eve said, ``but I'm in hopes that Jim Pitts will \n     emerge as his replacement and the tradition that George \n     Arthur started will continue and hopefully will grow.''\n       Sorrentino, who reportedly supports Pitts, also credited \n     Arthur as a consensus builder.\n       ``He had a great quality of being able to bring consensus \n     into very hostile situations --especially during the Griffin \n     years,'' he said. ``His leadership will be missed at these \n     difficult times.''\n       Sorrentino said he recently had breakfast with Arthur and \n     learned then that he had all but decided to retire after this \n     year.\n       ``And I said, `if you do, we certainly expect you to play a \n     role in the campaign.' While he'd be retiring as president of \n     the Common Council, he's not retiring from politics.''\n       All four observers rejected the notion that Arthur had \n     slowed down in recent years, no longer the civil rights \n     firebrand who once joined the plaintiffs in the school \n     desegregation suit and supported two other discrimination \n     suits against the city's fire and police force.\n       ``Very often with age comes wisdom-- you're more prudent \n     how you express things,'' said Crangle. ``You put things in \n     more perspective and focus than you did when you first \n     started out.''\n       Crangle said he greatly admires Arthur for standing up \n     against Griffin.\n       ``He was one of the towering strengths of the Democratic \n     Party in City Hall,'' he said. ``He did not get intimidated; \n     he didn't in any way yield. And many times it was very \n     lonely.''\n       Coppola said that was when Arthur's ``professionalism'' \n     shined brightest.\n       ``There were moments when George was the acting mayor in \n     some of the tougher years when Jimmy Griffin was really \n     playing hardball,'' Coppola said. ``And George never took \n     advantage of the situation, especially when the mayor was out \n     of town.''\n       The former mayor was asked Sunday for his comment on \n     Arthur's decision to retire.\n       ``I wish him luck,'' Griffin said. ``I wish him and his \n     family the best.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6302-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6302-S6303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           THE MOSCOW SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, today President Clinton is joining \nPresident Mitterrand, Prime Minister Major, Chancellor Kohl, and \nPresident Yeltsin in Moscow to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \nend of World War II. That is as it should be. Together, after all, the \nUnited States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union rid the world of \nthe Nazi menace.\n  The anniversary of Allied triumph over the Nazis carries great \nsignificance for us all. For the Russian people, who lost more than 20 \nmillion of their fellow citizens during the war, this commemoration is \nparticularly meaningful.\n  Now that the cold war is over, the allies have the opportunity to \nstand together again--this time to build a new Europe--democratic, \nwhole, and free. The gathering of the five leaders in Moscow today \nshould be seen as a commitment to that goal.\n  We have an enormous stake in Russia. United States engagement with \nRussia since the breakup of the Soviet Union has yielded significant \nresults--particularly with regard to the reduction of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Europe. It is in \nthe U.S. national interest to see that this process proceeds. Russian \nreformers offer the best prospect for continued progress on the issues \nthat really count for the United States. Accordingly, we should be \ndoing what we can to bolster Russia's democrats.\n  President Clinton has come under fire for going to Moscow at a time \nwhen Russia is pursuing some policies to which the United States is \nopposed. I believe this criticism is short-sighted and for the most \npart, politically motivated. Some of the same people who are \ncriticizing the President for going to Moscow are also demanding that \nthe administration deliver a tough message to Moscow about its behavior \nin Chechnya, its proposed sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran, and its \nviews about NATO expansion. What better way to deliver the message than \nto go to Moscow and do it personally?\n  By going to Moscow, President Clinton is demonstrating to Russian \nleaders the benefits of continued engagement with the West. If he had \ndecided to cancel his trip, President Clinton would be missing an \nopportunity to tell President Yeltsin and other Russian leaders--face \nto face--where he believes Russian policy is on the wrong track.\n  That being said, we should not have any illusions about our ability \nto change Russian policy overnight. We must be realistic. Russian \nleaders, like their counterparts worldwide are political creatures. \nWith parliamentary elections looming at the end of this year, and \nPresidential elections scheduled for 1996, few Russian politicians want \nto be perceived as buckling to Western pressure. Russian nationalists, \nwhose influence is regrettably on the \n [[Page S6303]]  rise, would be quick to brand them traitors.\n  It is therefore highly unlikely that President Clinton will return to \nWashington with a long list of Russian concessions. Those who are \ndemanding--or even predicting--that he will do so are setting up the \nadministration for failure. We can and should expect, however, \nPresident Clinton to discuss our differences candidly and \nconstructively, and to lay the ground work for United States-Russian \naccommodation on key issues like arms control, the Iran nuclear deal, \nChechnya, and European security.\n  The hallmark of a successful summit is not to solve all of the \nworld's problems or even to resolve all of the bilateral issues between \ntwo countries. President Clinton's trip to Moscow is part of an ongoing \nprocess between Russia and the United States. We should be realistic \nabout our expectations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6302-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO DR. WAYNE TEAGUE, FORMER ALABAMA SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, Dr. Wayne Teague served as Alabama's \nSuperintendent of Education for almost 20 years, from October 1975 \nthrough March 31 of this year. During his tenure as Alabama's top \neducator, public education in Alabama has prospered. His many years of \npublic service are a hallmark of exceptional commitment and dedication \nto public education and to the children of Alabama.\n  There has been a great deal of progress in Alabama education since \nWayne Teague took over as superintendent in 1975. His many \ncontributions have made tremendous improvements in the State's public \nschool system. His many successes and vast knowledge were once \nrecognized by the British Council of Great Britain, when he was one of \nonly three chief State school officers invited to participate in the \nAmerican Education Policy-Makers' Study Trip to Northern Ireland in \n1990.\n  Of Dr. Teauge's many wonderful personal attributes, the one that \nprobably served him best while he was superintendent was his unique \nleadership style. He was able to master the art of cooperation with a \nmyriad of groups for the benefit of the public schools. Government \nofficials, parents, teachers, students, administrators, and business, \ncivic, and educational leaders all gained admiration and respect for \nhim over the course of his career as they observed his many \naccomplishments for Alabama's school children and for education \noverall.\n  Wayne Teague received his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees \nall from Auburn University. Prior to becoming State superintendent, he \nwas a local superintendent, college professor, principal, and teacher. \nSince then, he has become widely known throughout the State and country \nnot only as a superb superintendent, but also as an authority on State \nand Federal legislative relations, a civic and community activist, a \npublic speaker, and author. He has participated in several \ninternational activities and received numerous honors and awards for \nhis service in education.\n  Dr. Wayne Teague certainly emerged as one of the giants of education \nwhile he was superintendent. He possesses all the skills, experience, \nand professional attitudes that make an outstanding leader. As much as \nhe will be missed, I salute and congratulate him for a job well done, \nand offer my best wishes for his long, healthy, and fulfilling \nretirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6303-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                  AID\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise this morning as a member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the content of a recent \ninteroffice electronic memo from Sally Shelton, the Assistant \nAdministrator for the Bureau of Global Programs, Bill Support and \nResearch at the Agency for International Development [AID] regarding \ncongressional plans to merge AID into the State Department and to cut \nthe somewhat bloated foreign assistance budget. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues who may not have seen the memo, dated May 3, let me quote it \nhere:\n\n       The Administrator spoke to InterAction yesterday * * *. The \n     Administrator would prefer that InterAction stay out of the \n     merger issue and there is indeed no consensus on their Board \n     as to what position to take. But some want to be involved--\n     the Administrator reminded us of Dean Acheson's comment \n     ``Don't just do something, sit there!''\n       Tony Lake is addressing InterAction tomorrow--he is pushing \n     the phrase ``backdoor isolationist'' to tar the anti-150 \n     account Congressmen with * * *. Shalikashvili and Wm. Perry \n     had a good mtg with the Speaker on the 150 account * * * \n     though the news from the Senate is not so good * * * Sen. \n     Domenici is pushing for bigger cuts than had been anticipated \n     earlier.\n       Jill Buckly reports that the Senate For. Rels. Comm. staff \n     was relatively uncooperative in discussions yesterday and \n     somewhat surprisingly the HIRC [House International Relations \n     Committee] staff was cooperative. The strategy is ``delay, \n     postpone, obfuscate, derail''--if we derail, we can kill the \n     merger. Larry Byrne met with Sen. Robb and got his support on \n     the merger though Robb is not committed, yet, to defend the \n     150 account budget levels. Official word is we don't care if \n     there is a State authorization bill this year.\n       Larry B. announces that we are 62 percent through this \n     fiscal year and we have 38 percent of the dollar volume of \n     procurement actions completed; we need to do $1.9 billion in \n     the next 5 months * * *. There are large pockets of money in \n     the field and about $570 million in Global and ENI each. So \n     let's get moving * * *. Jim Bond called Larry Byrne * * * \n     then yelled at him about our obligation rate, said it \n     imperils our ability to argue we need more money * * *.\n\n  Madam President, I am incensed by this memo and by the mind-set it \nmanifests at AID. It seems clear to me that instead of looking for ways \nto work with Members of Congress to streamline its operations, cut \nwaste and bloating, and accept the same kind of downsizing that the \nAmerican people expect of every other agency of the Federal Government, \nAID has taken on as its first priority saving its own skin.\n  There is nothing back-door isolationist about a desire to down-size \nAID and get rid of functions it carries out which are duplicative of \nthose carried out by other agencies; it's a move that Secretary of \nState Christopher himself supported until recently overruled by the \nVice President. At a time when we don't have enough money to take care \nof our own citizens and are consequently forced to rethink the funding \nlevels in our domestic budget, to argue that we can't make similarly \ndifficult cuts in our foreign aid budget is both disingenuous and \nunrealistic.\n  While I am certainly not in favor of a full-scale gutting of foreign \naid, there is no bureaucracy in this Government that in my estimation \ncouldn't stand a healthy cut in its budget--AID among them. For those \nwho might doubt that assertion, the following information is \ninstructive. AID has requested $16 million in aid to Jordan so that it \ncould ``attract more tourists to come to Jordan, enjoy their \nexperience, and recommend Jordan to others.'' AID wants to pay $528,000 \nto Vietnamese contractors who were not paid as a result of the Vietnam \nWar, while at the same time hundreds of American contractors remain \nunpaid. AID has proposed giving the AFL-CIO $5 million to make home \nimprovement loans to Sandanista labor union members in Nicaragua. AID \nhas proposed giving $900,000 to the lobbying firm TransAfrica to \ndevelop linkages with South Africa. The grant would enable TransAfrica \nto buy a TV, VCR, camcorder and computers for its Washington, DC, \nlobbying office. These proposals are just some of the highly \nquestionable ways in which AID allocates its funds.\n  While speaking about funding, let me note that I am outraged by the \nsuggestion in the memo that as the fiscal year draws to a close and AID \nhas only ``38 percent of the dollar volume of procurement actions \ncompleted,'' that employees would be encouraged to get out there and \nspend, spend, spend so that their ability to argue we need more money \nis not imperiled. Statements such as that are a perfect example of \nbureaucratic thinking run amok, and illustrate to me precisely why \ntheir budget is in need of some substantial trimming.\n  Madam President, policy statements coming from AID which note that \nthey intend to work to delay and derail the legitimate work of this \nCongress for their own selfish needs strike me--and, I am sure, other \nMembers--as blatantly improper. As a result of this memo, you can be \nsure that I will view anything AID has to say on reorganization or \nbudget matters in the next few weeks with a very jaundiced eye, to put \nit very mildly.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6303-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEUTCH, OF MASSACHUSETTS, TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE \n                      CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session to consider the nomination of John Deutch to be \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       John M. Deutch, of Massachusetts, to be Director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency.\n    nomination of john deutch to be director of central intelligence\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it is with enthusiasm that I will vote \ntoday to confirm the President's nomination of John Deutch to one of \nour country's most important and difficult jobs, Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have worked \nclosely with John Deutch in both his present position as Deputy \nSecretary of Defense and in his prior capacity as Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition and Technology. I have had the opportunity to \nadmire his competence as a manager and his broad knowledge on and \naccomplishments in national security matters.\n  Secretary Deutch has firsthand experience in improving our national \nsecurity institutions. He successfully led the Pentagon's effort to \nreform its acquisition process, a long overdue and badly needed \ninitiative. He also took the lead on the controversial C-17 aircraft \nnegotiations and produced a good solution. In short, he has taken some \nof the thorniest problems in our largest national security institution \nand produced positive and cost-effective results.\n  The U.S. intelligence community is at a critical crossroads as it \nresponds to a host of new and demanding challenges. With the end of the \ncold war, the need for reliable intelligence for the President and the \nNation's decisionmakers has not vanished, but it has changed. We have \nseen a dramatic shift in the nature of the threats to U.S. national \nsecurity. We have seen a sharp rise in the number and intensity of \nregional conflicts including the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Somalia, and \nHaiti. We have also seen the need to broaden the cope of our \nintelligence efforts to include work on emerging challenges in \ninterdiction of the international drug trade, anti-terrorism, \nnonproliferation and in support of government decisionmaking in \neconomics and trade.\n  At the same time, the intelligence community faces a number of \ninternal challenges. The community should not, has not, and will not be \nspared the budget cuts and downsizing facing all of the Federal \nGovernment. And, the intelligence community must work very hard to \nrecover from the shocks of the Ames case and the current controversy \nover events in Guatemala.\n  The President could have named no more qualified nominee to grapple \nwith these challenges. John Deutch's vast knowledge and experience, his \ntrack record in government, will assure that he will do so with the \nfull confidence of those who work in within the intelligence community \nand those in the Congress responsible for oversight. While I have not \nagreed with him on every issue, I admire and respect his considerable \nabilities and the forthright manner in which he engages debate.\n  I am very pleased today to join in what I hope and expect will be the \nunanimous confirmation of the nomination of John Deutch to be the next \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I \nsupport John Deutch's nomination to serve as the Director of Central \nIntelligence. During Dr. Deutch's service at the Department of Defense, \nincluding his service as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Deutch \nhas been a thoughtful, decisive, and professional public servant.\n  Over the last 2 years, I have worked with John Deutch on a number of \nimportant, complicated, and diverse issues. In every instance, Dr. \nDeutch was extremely knowledgeable about the issue, he demonstrated \ndiligent followup, and he never deviated from his commitment to serve \nthe national interest. I have appreciated working with John Deutch and \nhe will be missed at the Department of Defense.\n  John Deutch will be an excellent Director of Central Intelligence. \nThis is a crucial time for the U.S. intelligence community as it tries \nto adapt to the post-cold-war era. I have every confidence that John \nDeutch will lead the Central Intelligence Agency forward in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Madam President, I look forward to casting my vote in support of John \nDeutch's nomination to serve as the next Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I am proud to support President \nClinton's nominee, John M. Deutch, as Director of Central Intelligence. \nThis is a difficult time for the CIA, but John Deutch brings \nconsiderable skills and experience to the position, and I have every \nconfidence that he will make a difference at the CIA.\n  Mr. Deutch has an impressive academic background. He has been a \ndistinguished professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nHe was chair of the department of chemistry there. As a teacher and a \nscientist, Mr. Deutch understands the technical details of the newest \nemerging intelligence technology, and he also has the remarkable \nability to explain this technology in plain English, so that \nnonscientists understand.\n  Mr. Deutch has also served with distinction in Government. He worked \nat the Department of Energy, as Under Secretary of Energy Technology. \nIn recognition of his contributions in that position, he was honored \nwith the Secretary's Distinguished Service Medal and the Department's \nDistinguished Service Medal. More recently, he served at the Department \nof Defense as Under Secretary of Acquisition and Technology. And he \nleaves DOD as the distinguished Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. Deutch will have to draw from this extraordinary experience to \naddress a number of concerns at the Central Intelligence Agency. His \nresponsibility is great. The CIA has been faced with a number of \nscandals of its own making. The Aldrich Ames spy case compromised U.S. \nintelligence gathering overseas. For years, the CIA was unable to \ndetect his treachery, and more recently, the CIA appeared unwilling to \nappropriately discipline his superiors. This is unacceptable. I am \nconfident that Mr. Deutch will address the flaws in the internal \nadministration of the CIA which allowed Ames to flourish in the system \nundetected. He has pledged that in the future, anyone in a position of \nsupervision over an agent who is spying on the United States, and does \nnot take forceful action, will be fired.\n  Mr. Deutch's nomination also comes at a time when very serious \nquestions have been raised about CIA operations in Guatemala. It has \nbecome clear through public hearings in recent weeks that a paid CIA \ninformant in the Guatemalan military was involved in horrendous human \nrights abuses against Guatemalan people, and participated in the \ntorture and death of an American citizen, and a Guatemalan who was \nmarried to an American citizen. Further, when this information became \nknown to CIA officials, it was not properly reported to the House or \nSenate Intelligence Committees. The United States must stand for \ndemocracy and the protection of human rights abroad. I am deeply \noffended, as are many Americans, to learn of a relationship between the \nCIA and this Guatemalan colonel.\n  These and other scandals have plagued the CIA. Morale is low. John \nDeutch is clearly needed at this time to revitalize the CIA. With the \nend of the cold war, America's intelligence needs have changed. But \nthey have not diminished. Our intelligence community is staffed with \nbrave men and women who take risks every day to assist our policymakers \nby providing the best intelligence in the world. We must restore the \nconfidence of the American people in these men and women, and in our \nintelligence gathering capabilities. John Deutch is a man of real \nquality. He is fully capable of meeting the challenges that lie before \nhim.\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of John Deutch to serve as Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Secretary Deutch since 1993 \nin his various capacities in the Department of Defense, first as Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, and most recently \nas Deputy Secretary of Defense. 3\n  Secretary Deutch has served his Nation well in these assignments, and \nI am pleased that he will be bringing his considerable expertise to the \nNation's intelligence community.\n  This is a time of great challenge for the various elements of the \nintelligence community and, in particular, for the Central Intelligence \nAgency. As it continues the process of adapting to the intelligence \nchallenges of the post-cold-war world, the CIA has been rocked recently \nby a number of problems--from the Aldrich Ames spy scandal to the \nrecent revelations of possible problems with CIA activities in \nGuatemala. I am concerned about the well-being of this agency, and the \nmorale of the fine intelligence professionals who serve our country--at \ngreat personal risk--at the CIA. The work of the CIA, and the many \nother agencies of the intelligence community, remains vital to the \nsecurity of our great Nation. We should not lose sight of this basic \nfact as we contemplate reforms.\n  I am pleased that Secretary Deutch will be taking over stewardship of \nthe intelligence community at this critical time. I was encouraged by \nSecretary Deutch's testimony at his confirmation hearing regarding the \nchanges that he believes should be made at the CIA. I wish him well as \nhe undertakes a difficult task which is so important to the future \nwell-being of this Nation.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of Deputy \nSecretary of Defense John Deutch to be the Director of Central \nIntelligence. I have had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Deutch \non a number of occasions to discuss defense and intelligence issues and \nam impressed with his ability in both of these critical areas.\n  As the President's new senior advisor on intelligence, John Deutch \nwill have the responsibility of placing before the Congress a vision \nfor the intelligence profession that embodies the lessons learned from \nthe cold war and lessons from recent unfortunate mistakes within the \nagency. He will also be required to steadfastly guard against the \npoliticization of the intelligence mission by government officials who \nwould use intelligence resources for other ends, at the expense of the \ncore programs. My impression of John Deutch is that he is well prepared \nto meet these challenges.\n  I believe John Deutch will be someone who is prepared to think \nseriously about the place and purpose of intelligence in a democracy, \nboth as he fulfills his responsibilities as a senior Government \nofficial and as he lays the President's plans and programs before the \nCongress. In short, Madam President, I believe John Deutch will be a \nfine Director of Central Intelligence and have every confidence in his \nability to lead the intelligence community into the 21st century. I \nwholeheartedly support his nomination.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I stated at the outset of \ndebate on this bill, I believe it makes sense to have some basic, \nnational product liability standards that apply across the board. In \n1995, products manufactured in Illinois are no longer shipped down the \nstreet; instead, they are shipped throughout the 50 States, and beyond. \nThe Constitution of the United States, in article 1, section 8, grants \nCongress the power to regulate interstate commerce. Where our product \nliability system acts as a disincentive to the manufacture and sale of \ngoods in interstate commerce, Congress has not only a right, but a \nduty, to reform that system. I believe the Product Liability Fairness \nAct, while not perfect, is a good step in the reform process, and I am \nproud to cast my vote in favor of this bill.\n  I would like to add how pleased I am that, during the past weeks, the \nSenate very carefully considered and debated each and every amendment \nthat was offered to this bill. I am particularly pleased by the \ncompromise amendment that will soon be offered as a substitute \namendment. I believe that the amendment significantly improves the \ncommittee reported bill, and I know that it would not have been \npossible without the vigorous debate that surrounded this legislation.\n  I strongly support the changes being made to the punitive damages \nsection of the bill Rockefeller-Gorton substitute. While the original \nbill linked the calculation of punitive awards to economic damages, the \namended bill instead links punitives to compensatory damages, a \nstandard that is \n [[Page S6306]]  much fairer to low-income workers, women who don't \nwork outside the home, children and the elderly, who may not have a \ngreat deal of economic damages. I have no objection to making punitive \ndamages proportionate to the harm caused by the product, the goal that \nthe punitive damage limitation is intended to accomplish. That harm \nshould not, however, be limited to out of pocket costs or lost wages. \nNon-economic damages can often be difficult to calculate, but that does \nnot make them any less real.\n  Indeed, these compensate individuals for the things that they value \nmost--the ability to have children, the ability to have your spouse or \nchild alive to share in your life, the ability to look in the mirror \nwithout seeing a permanently disfigured face. As a notion of \nfundamental fairness, any congressional attempts to create a punitive \ndamage standard should include both economic and noneconomic damages in \nits formula, as the Rockefeller-Gorton substitute now does.\n  In addition, the amended bill contains a provision that will allow a \njudge to increase the amount of a punitive damage award, if an \nincreased award is necessary to either adequately punish a defendant \nfor its past conduct, or to adequately deter a defendant from engaging \nin such conduct in the future. I know there have been concerns raised \nduring the course of this debate that, in some cases, punitive damages \nawarded pursuant to the formula will not be sufficient to either punish \nor deter. I believe this judge additur provision addresses these \nconcerns, and I want to thank Senators Rockefeller and Gorton for their \nwillingness to add this provision to their legislation. In my opinion, \nit makes a good bill even better, and it demonstrates their willingness \nto respond to the concerns of those of us ``in the middle.''\n  Madam President, last year I stood on the Senate floor, after the \nSenate failed to invoke cloture on the Product Liability Fairness Act, \nand stated my desire not to filibuster this bill again. What I wanted \nto do was debate what alterations the Federal Government should make in \nthe area of product liability law, and to act on a narrow, moderate \nproduct liability bill. I am pleased to have a chance to act on such a \nbill today.\n  But reporting a bill out of the Senate is only half of the battle; I \nalso want to see this legislation enacted in to law. I believe that can \nhappen, as long as a House-Senate conference committee keeps the bill \nlimited to the subject of product liability, and rejects the draconian, \nanti-consumer provisions included in legislation which passed the House \nof Representatives. The votes in the Senate during the past 2 weeks \nshould send a strong signal to the House that the U.S. Senate does not \nintend to restrict the ability of ordinary citizens to access the \ncourts, under the guise of civil justice reform.\n  If our colleagues in the House of Representatives truly want a \nproduct liability reform bill, I have no doubt that we can obtain one. \nOur votes in the Senate spell out very clearly what will and will not \nbe acceptable to this body, and I urge my House colleagues to consider \nthose votes very carefully. For despite my desire to enact a product \nliability reform bill, nothing has changed about my underlying \ncommitment to equal justice under law. I remain just as opposed to \nloser-pays provisions, caps on noneconomic damages, or changes that \nwould restrict the right of individuals to bring suit for civil rights \nviolations, employment discrimination, and sexual harassment, among \nother issues, as I have been in the past, and I will be compelled to \noppose any legislation that returns from a conference including these \nprovisions.\n  Madam President, in closing, I would like to commend Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton for all of their hard work to enact a product \nliability reform bill, not only this year, but in past Congresses as \nwell. They are to be commended for championing an issue that needs to \nbe addressed, and for doing so in a way that is balanced and fair. \nDuring the past 3 weeks, they have demonstrated a willingness to listen \nand resolve the concerns raised by myself and other Senators, and have \ntaken steps to improve this legislation. I commend them for their \nleadership, and I am pleased to vote with them today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6305-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

House \nConcurrent Resolution 53 is almost identical to my concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 9, which has 52 bipartisan \ncosponsors, including both the majority and minority leaders, for which \nI am most grateful.

Mr. President, Senate Concurrent Resolution 9 was \nunanimously reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in \nMarch of this year. That resolution specifically calls on President \nClinton to allow President Lee Teng-hui to come to the United States on \na private visit, and I wish to emphasize private. House Concurrent \nResolution 53 was submitted in the House by Congressmen Lantos, \nSolomon, and Torricelli, and adopted by the House by a rollcall vote of \n396 to zero last week.\n  Mr. President, the question is, Should we let the People's Republic \nof China dictate who can visit the United States? The current State \nDepartment policy of claiming that allowing President Lee to visit \nwould upset relations with the People's Republic of China officials \npersonally is offensive to this Senator.\n  Taiwan is a friend. They have made great strides toward American \ngoals--ending martial law, holding free and fair elections, allowing a \nvocal press, and steadily improving human rights.\n  Taiwan is friendly, democratic, and prosperous. Taiwan is the 6th \nlargest trading partner of the United States, and the world's 13th \nlargest. The Taiwanese buy twice as much from the United States as from \nthe People's Republic of China. Taiwan has the largest foreign reserves \nand contributes substantially to international causes.\n  Unfortunately, the United States continues to give the cold shoulder \nto the leader of Taiwan. You will recall last May, we were embarrassed \nwhen the State Department refused an overnight visit for President Lee, \nwho was in transit from Taiwan to Central America. His aircraft had to \nstop for refueling in Hawaii and he would have preferred to stay \novernight before continuing on. Unfortunately, the State Department \ncontinues to indicate that the administration will not look favorably \non a request for a private visit.\n  Mr. President, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China are making \nsignificant progress in relations between the two of them. I call my \ncolleagues' attention to the existence of an organization known as the \nAssociation for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. That organization \noperates in Beijing. The counter to that is the Mainland Affairs \nCouncil in Taiwan. These two groups get together regularly. They talk \nabout everything conceivable except the political differences between \nthe two countries. That conversation includes such things as hijacking; \nit also includes such things as eliminating the necessity of goods from \nTaiwan having to go through Hong Kong before they can come into the \nPeople's Republic of China. They are addressing now the direct shipment \nof goods from Taiwan to the mainland of China.\n  So here we have evidence that there is this dialog based on trade and \ncommerce, but still the United States is afraid to take steps to \nencourage our trade and commerce with Taiwan because of the objections \nfrom the People's Republic of China.\n  Now, we know that the People's Republic of China will object to a \nvisit by President Lee because the People's Republic of China complains \nloudly about many United States initiatives such as United States \npressure at the United Nations with regard to China's human rights \npractices, criteria for China's World Trade Organization membership, \nand anything we do to help Taiwan. But in the end, the People's \nRepublic of China Government makes a calculation about when to risk its \naccess to the United States and our market. And I think we should make \nthe same calculation.\n  The precedent does exist, my colleagues, for a visit by President \nLee. The administration has welcomed other unofficial leaders to the \nUnited States--the Dalai Lama called on Vice President Gore, over the \nPeople's Republic of China's objections, I might add. Yasser Arafat \ncame to a White House ceremony. Gerry Adams has been granted numerous \nvisits over Britain's objections.\n  In these cases, the administration I think has made the correct \nchoice to allow visits to advance American goals, and President Lee's \nvisit would do the same thing. The USA-ROC Economic Council Conference \nis going to be held in Anchorage, AK, in September. Visiting Alaska \nwould not be a political statement, by any means. We consider \nourselves, as my Alaskan colleague Senator Stevens often remarks, \nalmost another country. President Lee's alma mater, Cornell University \nin New York, would like him to visit in June to give a speech. It is \ncompletely a private matter. It is not a matter of a state visit.\n  I have heard suggestions that the Special Olympics, which will be \nheld in Connecticut, might extend an invitation to President Lee, as \nwell.\n  So I would call on my colleagues to vote to send a strong signal to \nthe administration that President Lee should be allowed to make a \nprivate--and I emphasize ``private''--visit. I call on the \nadministration to change the policy because it is simply the right \nthing to do and it is the right time to do it.\n  If the administration does not change the policy based on this \nresolution, I think they are going to face binding legislation that \nwould force the President to allow the visit. The administration should \nact before facing such a situation.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays on \nthis resolution.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that editorials from cities around the \ncountry supporting the Lee visit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Apr. 17, 1995]\n\n                     A Snub for Taiwan's Democrats\n\n       Taiwan's president, an alumnus of Cornell, wants to address \n     his alma mater this June. But a visit to the United States by \n     Lee Teng-hui is something that will not happen, says the \n     assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.\n       This pusillanimous attitude ought to change, both for \n     reasons of courtesy and as a sign the United States applauds \n     Lee's work in moving Taiwan toward full democracy. \n      [[Page S6308]]  The United States has a vital interest in \n     the sustenance of democratic governments in Asia.\n       At issue is the two-China question, one that has vexed US \n     policy makers since Mao Zedong's Communists took over all of \n     China except the island of Taiwan in 1949. For a generation, \n     The United States erred in ignoring the Communist reality; it \n     should not now denigrate the success of Taiwan.\n       While the mainland was enduring the excesses of the \n     Cultural Revolution, the people of Taiwan were laying the \n     groundwork for an economic boom. As Beijing cracked down on \n     dissidents, the Nationalists on Taiwan were opening up their \n     regime. Last December an opposition leader was elected mayor \n     of Taipei, the capital.\n       While acknowledging these achievements, Assistant Secretary \n     of State Winston Lord said last year that the United States \n     should do nothing that Beijing would perceive as lending \n     ``officiality'' to US relations with Taiwan. This fear of \n     offending Beijing explains why Lee was denied permission to \n     visit Cornell last June and why Lord implied he should not \n     bother to apply for a visa this year.\n       When thousands of Taiwanese regularly come to the United \n     States, it is inconsistent to prohibit a private visit by \n     Lee. Moreover, it compounds the insulting treatment he \n     received last year when he was denied permission to spend the \n     night in Honolulu while en route to Latin America. As an \n     alumnus of an American university, he has ties to the United \n     States that transcend politics.\n       Cornell wants Lee to give a speech at reunion weekend, Lord \n     says Taiwan ``has shown that political openness must \n     accompany political reform and that Asians value freedom as \n     much as other people around the globe.'' That message ought \n     to be heard by university alumni and a billion Chinese.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the Providence Sunday Journal, Mar. 19, 1995]\n\n                         Dishonorable Diplomacy\n\n       Lee Teng-hui came to the United States as a foreign student \n     and earned his Ph.D. in 1968 from Cornell University, one of \n     the nation's premier institutions. His thesis was cited as \n     the year's best dissertation by the American Association of \n     Agricultural Economics. After returning home, he had an \n     eventful career, topped off in 1990 by being elected \n     president of his native land, one of America's oldest and \n     most loyal Asian allies.\n       To honor Mr. Lee, Cornell officials have invited him to \n     participate in a three-day alumni reunion at the campus in \n     Ithaca, N.Y., in June, when he is scheduled to deliver the \n     school's prestigious Olin Lecture.\n       A heartwarming story. But there's one big problem: \n     President Clinton may bar Mr. Lee from visiting Cornell.\n       Why? Because Mr. Lee is the president of Taiwan, and the \n     Clinton administration fears that the Communist regime of the \n     Chinese mainland will be offended if he is allowed to come to \n     America. It's as simple--and as outrageous--as that.\n       Now, we can understand why officials in Beijing wouldn't \n     want Mr. Lee to visit this country and receive the honors. \n     They hate and fear him and what he stands for because his \n     regime has put the Communists and all their works to shame. \n     He heads a rival Chinese government that, by following \n     largely market-oriented policies, has spearheaded the \n     relatively small (population: 20 million) island of Taiwan's \n     rise as a major player on the world's economic scene. \n     Meanwhile, the Communists--by following the bizarre schemes \n     of the ``Great Helmsman,'' the late Mao Tse-tung--crippled \n     mainland China's economic development (until, in recent \n     years, they finally started to move away from Marxist \n     follies).\n       Furthermore, the regime on Taiwan is rapidly democratizing \n     itself, allowing the presence of an active opposition party, \n     which has won a strong minority of seats in the legislature. \n     In this regard, it ought to be emphasized that Mr. Lee is the \n     freely elected president of Taiwan. Whereas the Communists \n     now ruling in Beijing--while admittedly not as bad as the \n     mass murderer, Mao Tse-tung--cling to their dictatorial \n     power: no opposition parties, no freedom of speech or press, \n     no free elections. And, of course, no freely elected \n     presidents.\n       Which gets us back to Mr. Lee. President Clinton, a Rhodes \n     Scholar, is a clever fellow. And he has available to him some \n     very high-priced legal talent, as well as numerous figures--\n     in and out of the State Department--with considerable \n     experience and skill in the diplomatic arts. President \n     Clinton should be able to figure out an adroit way to allow \n     Mr. Lee to make what is essentially a private visit to \n     Cornell and receive his well-deserved honors.\n       If the Communists in Beijing want to fuss and fume, let \n     them. They may no longer be our enemies, but they are most \n     assuredly not yet our friends. Mr. Lee, on the other hand, \n     represents a brave people who have been our friends and \n     allies for more than four decades. If Mr. Clinton bars Mr. \n     Lee from coming here, he would dishonor not only himself, \n     which would be his business, but the entire United States as \n     well, and the American people should not stand for that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 9, 1995]\n\n                     Unwelcome Mat for Our Friends\n\n                          (By Arnold Beichman)\n\n       There is every possibility that President Lee Teng-hui of \n     Taiwan may one day be allowed to enter the United States just \n     like Yasser Arafat and Gerry Adams, onetime terrorists, and \n     other statesmen as distinguished as the head of the Palestine \n     Liberation Organization or the leader of Sinn Fein who have \n     been allowed to do so.\n       The possibility of a visit by the elected president of \n     Asia's island democracy has arisen because the House of \n     Representatives International Relations Committee has urged \n     President Clinton to allow Mr. Lee to enter the United \n     States. Mr. Lee has been invited to attend graduation \n     exercises at his alma mater, Cornell University.\n       The House panel didn't ask President Clinton personally to \n     receive President Lee. How could it? After all, the \n     appointments schedule of the president of the United States \n     is controlled by the Politburo of the Chinese Communist \n     Party, which decides what Chinese the president may or may \n     not receive. So all the House panel asked Mr. Clinton to do \n     is to allow President Lee to visit--that's it, nothing more--\n     just visit the United States. If Mr. Clinton turns down that \n     request will that mean the Chinese Politburo controls our \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service, too? Perhaps Mr. \n     Clinton could ask the Chinese Politburo to do something about \n     illegal immigration.\n       It isn't the first time that the appointments schedule of \n     the president of the United States was under the control of a \n     foreign communist power. In 1975, President Ford declined to \n     receive Alexander Solzhenitsyn since such an act of \n     hospitality and respect for human rights would have offended \n     the Soviet Politburo. Or so Secretary of State Kissinger \n     believed. After his election defeat in 1976, Mr. Ford \n     confessed that he had erred in barring the great Russian \n     dissident from the White House.\n       The power of the Chinese Communist Politburo extends not \n     only to which Chinese can visit the United States but it also \n     determines who can overnight on our soil. Last year, Mr. Lee \n     was barred from overnighting in Honolulu lest such a simple \n     act enrage the Beijing gerontocrats. However, it's quite all \n     right to enrage the British government and Prime Minister \n     John Major in receiving Gerry Adams and allowing him to \n     engage in dubious fund raising.\n       What presidents and their advisers do not understand is \n     that the reaction of totalitarians to American policy depends \n     less on a given American action than it does on the party's \n     long-range view. It didn't matter to Josef Stalin that Adolf \n     Hitler inveighed against the Soviet Union or communism. When \n     it suited Stalin's needs, he signed a Nazi-Soviet pact in \n     August 1939. And when it suited Hitler, he attacked the \n     U.S.S.R. despite the Nazi-Soviet Pact. President Nixon \n     ordered the bombing of North Vietnam while he was in Moscow. \n     The Soviet Politburo didn't order Mr. Nixon out of the Soviet \n     Union to show its displeasure. Moscow negotiated with the \n     United States despite the bombing of its military ally, North \n     Vietnam.\n       Whenever it suits Beijing to violate its agreements with \n     the United States, it will. Whenever it suits Beijing to lose \n     its temper with Mr. Clinton, it will--regardless of \n     protestations of past friendship.\n       For the United States to continue to treat Taiwan as an \n     outcast nation as it has for a quarter-century because of the \n     Communist Politburo is a sign of weakness that will not be \n     lost on Deng Xiao-ping's successors. After all, Taiwan's \n     democratic credentials are of the highest. Its market economy \n     has propelled Taiwan--remember this is a country with a \n     population of but 21 million--into the 13th largest trading \n     nation in the world. Taiwan enjoys a rule of law. It \n     recognizes property rights. There is a legal opposition and a \n     free press.\n       If we continue to treat a friendly people, a friendly \n     government and its chosen representatives as nonpersons at a \n     time when we would like to see a world of democracies and \n     when to further that course we have even sent troops \n     overseas, as we did to Haiti, isn't it time--at the very \n     least!--to tell the Beijing totalitarians that the president \n     of Taiwan can overnight on American soil anytime he wants to? \n     And, perhaps, even stay for two nights?\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 31, 1995]\n\n             Kowtow--The State Department's Bow to Beijing\n\n                            (By Lorna Hahn)\n\n       Lee Teng-hui, president of the Republic of China on Taiwan, \n     wishes to accept an honorary degree from Cornell University, \n     where he earned his PhD in agronomy.\n       Last year, when Cornell made the same offer, Lee was \n     refused entry into the United States because Beijing \n     belligerently reminded the State Department that granting a \n     visa to a Taiwanese leader would violate the principle of \n     ``One China'' (Cornell subsequently sent an emissary to \n     Taipei for a substitute ceremony.) This year, on Feb. 9, \n     Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told a \n     congressional hearing that our government ``will not reverse \n     the policies of six administrations of both parties.''\n       It is high time it did. The old policy was adopted at a \n     time when China and Taiwan were enemies, Taiwan's government \n     claimed to represent all of China, and Beijing's leaders \n     would never dream of meeting cordially with their \n     counterparts from Taipei. Today, things are very different.\n        [[Page S6309]] Upon assuming office in 1988, Lee dropped \n     all pretense of ever reconquering the mainland and granted \n     that the Communists do indeed control it. Since then, he has \n     eased tensions and promoted cooperation with the People's \n     Republic of China through the Lee Doctrine, the pragmatic, \n     flexible approach through which he (1) acts independently \n     without declaring independence, which would provoke Chinese \n     wrath and perhaps an invasion; (2) openly recognizes the PRC \n     government and its achievements and asks that it reciprocate, \n     and (3) seeks to expand Taiwan's role in the world while \n     assuring Beijing that he is doing so as a fellow Chinese who \n     has their interests at heart as well.\n       Lee claims to share Beijing's dream of eventual \n     reunification--provided it is within a democratic, free-\n     market system. Meanwhile, he wants the PRC--and the world--to \n     accept the obvious fact that China has since 1949 been a \n     divided country, like Korea, and that Beijing has never \n     governed or represented Taiwan's people. Both governments, he \n     believes, should be represented abroad while forging ties \n     that could lead to unity.\n       To this end he has fostered massive investments in the \n     mainland, promoted extensive and frequent business, cultural, \n     educational and other exchanges, and offered to meet \n     personally with PRC President Jiang Zemin to discuss further \n     cooperation. His policies are so well appreciated in \n     Beijing--which fears the growing strength of Taiwan's pro-\n     independence movement--that Jiang recently delivered a highly \n     conciliatory speech to the Taiwanese people in which he \n     suggested that their leaders exchange visits.\n       If China's leaders are willing to welcome Taiwan's \n     president to Beijing, why did their foreign ministry on March \n     9, once again warn that ``we are opposed to Lee Teng-hui \n     visiting the United States in any form''? Because Beijing \n     considers the ``Taiwan question'' to be an ``internal \n     affair'' in which, it claims, the United States would be \n     meddling if it granted Lee a visa.\n       But Lee does not wish to come here in order to discuss the \n     ``Taiwan question'' or other political matters, and he does \n     not seek to meet with any American officials. He simply \n     wishes to accept an honor from a private American \n     institution, and perhaps discuss with fellow Cornell alumni \n     the factors that have contributed to Taiwan's--and China's--\n     outstanding economic success.\n       President Clinton has yet to make the final decision \n     regarding Lee's visit. As Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) \n     recently stated: ``It seems to me illogical not to allow \n     President Lee on a private basis to go back to his alma \n     mater.'' As his colleague Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) added: \n     ``It is embarrassing for many of us to think that, after \n     encouraging the people and government on Taiwan to \n     democratize, which they have, [we forbid President Lee] to \n     return to the United States . . . to receive an honorary \n     degree.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 15, 1995]\n\n                              Two Visitors\n\n       Gerry Adams can tour the United States, but Lee Teng-hui \n     can't. Gerry Adams will be feted and celebrated Friday at the \n     White House, but when Lee Teng-hui's plane landed in Honolulu \n     last year, the U.S. government told him to gas up and get \n     out. The Gerry Adams who is being treated like a head of \n     state by the Clinton Administration is the leader of Sinn \n     Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army. The Lee \n     Teng-hui who has been treated like an international pariah by \n     the Administration is the democratically elected President of \n     the Republic of China, or Taiwan. The disparate treatment of \n     these two men tells an awful lot about the politics and \n     instincts of the Clinton presidency.\n       Gerry Adams's face will be all over the news for his Saint \n     Paddy's Day party with Bill O'Clinton at the White House, so \n     we'll start with the background on the less-publicized \n     President of Taiwan.\n       Cornell University has invited President Lee to come to the \n     school's Ithaca, N.Y., campus this June to address and attend \n     an alumni reunion. In 1968, Mr. Lee received his doctorate in \n     agricultural economics from Cornell. The following year, the \n     American Association of Agricultural Economics gave Mr. Lee's \n     doctoral dissertation, on the sources of Taiwan's growth, its \n     highest honor. In 1990, Taiwan's voters freely elected Mr. \n     Lee as their President. He has moved forcefully to liberalize \n     Taiwan's political system, arresting corrupt members of his \n     own party. Last year, the Asian Wall Street Journal \n     editorialized: ``Out of nothing, Taiwan's people have created \n     an economic superpower relative to its population, as well as \n     Asia's most rambunctious democracy and a model for neighbors \n     who are bent on shedding authoritarian ways.''\n       Asked last month about President Lee's visit to Ithaca, \n     Secretary of State Christopher, who professes to wanting \n     closer links with Taiwan, said that ``under the present \n     circumstances'' he couldn't see it happening. The \n     Administration doesn't want to rile its relationship with \n     Beijing. The Communist Chinese don't recognize Taiwan and \n     threaten all manner of retaliation against anyone who even \n     thinks about doing so. That includes a speech to agricultural \n     economists in upstate New York. This, Secretary Christopher \n     testified, is a ``difficult issue.''\n       Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams, meanwhile, gets the red carpet \n     treatment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Adams assures his \n     American audiences that the IRA is out of the business of \n     blowing body parts across the streets of London. He promises \n     the doubters that if people give him money, it won't be used \n     to buy more guns, bullets and bombs for the high-strung lads \n     of the IRA.\n       Now before the Irish American communities of Queens and \n     Boston get too roiled over our skepticism toward Northern \n     Ireland's most famous altar boy, we suggest they take their \n     grievances to John Bruton, who is Irish enough to be the \n     Prime Minister of Ireland. He, too, will be at Bill Clinton's \n     St. Patrick's Day party for Gerry Adams, and he has a message \n     for the two statesmen: The IRA has to give up its arms. \n     ``This is an item on the agenda that must be dealt with,'' \n     Premier Bruton said Monday in Dublin. ``It's a very serious \n     matter. There are genuine fears felt by members of the \n     community that have been at the receiving end of the \n     violence.''\n       We don't at all doubt that somewhere amid the Friday \n     merriment, Mr. Clinton will ask Mr. Adams to give up the guns \n     and that Mr. Adams will tell the President that is surely the \n     IRA's intent, all other matters being equal.\n       It is hard to know precisely what motivates Mr. Clinton to \n     lionize a Gerry Adams and snub a Lee Teng-hui. The deference \n     to China doesn't fully wash, because when Britain--our former \n     ally in several huge wars this century--expressed its \n     displeasure over the Adams meeting, the White House \n     essentially told the Brits to lump it. Perhaps the end of the \n     Cold War has liberated liberal heads of state into a state of \n     light-headedness about such matters. We note also this week \n     that France's President Francois Mitterrand has been \n     entertaining Fidel Castro at the Elysees Palace.\n       But it's still said that Bill Clinton has a great sense of \n     self-preservation. So if he's willing to personally embrace \n     Gerry Adams while stiffing the Prime Minister of England and \n     forbidding the President of Taiwan to spend three days with \n     his classmates in Ithaca, there must be something in it \n     somewhere for him.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Apr. 22, 1995]\n\n                             Let Lee Visit\n\n       Eleven months after Communist China's old tyrants loosed \n     the tanks on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square, \n     Taiwan's new president, Lee Teng-Hui, released several \n     political prisoners--the first step in his rapid march to \n     democratizing ``the other China.''

The United States \n     recognized Taiwan as the legitimate government of China until \n     1979, when then President Jimmy Carter decided that ties with \n     the mainland regime were more vital to the interests of the \n     United States.\n       In the long shadow of history, Carter's decision is likely \n     to win favor as the correct \n      [[Page S6310]]  one. But that doesn't mean we ought to slam \n     the door on the elected leader of Taiwan just because the \n     gerontocracy in Beijing might get a case of political \n     heartburn. These fellows are, after all, the very officials \n     who turned the Chinese army loose in Tiananmen Square.\n       In any case, Lee's visit to Cornell would not be a pomp-\n     and-circumstance state visit, but rather a low-visibility \n     affair. The House Committee on International Relations knew \n     that when it voted 33-0 on a resolution backing Lee's visit. \n     The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also adopted a \n     resolution in favor of Lee.

If the State Department won't let Lee into the \n     motherland of the First Amendment, then Congress ought to see \n     to it that he gets a visa. As for the State Department, it \n     could use some sensitivity training in good manners.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 1995]\n\n                A Matter of Honors Due a Staunch Friend\n\n                           (By James Hackett)\n\n       After two years of insulting America's friends and allies \n     while accommodating America's enemies, the Clinton \n     Administration finally has hit bottom. The matter involves \n     Lee Teng-hui, president of the Republic of China on Taiwan, \n     who has been invited by Cornell University to receive an \n     honored alumnus award at ceremonies at Ithaca, N.Y., in early \n     June. Mr. Lee received his Ph.D. at Cornell and wants to \n     accept the honor bestowed by his alma mater.\n       President Lee is a native of Taiwan and the first popularly \n     elected president of a country that long has been a close \n     friend and ally of the United States. But incredibly, the \n     State Department will not allow Mr. Lee to visit the United \n     States, even for such an unofficial purpose, lest it annoy \n     the communist rulers on the mainland.\n       The State Department's China hands, with the approval of \n     the Clinton White House, are trying hard to accommodate the \n     wishes of the government in Beijing. Last year, Mr. Lee and \n     his minister for economic affairs were denied permission to \n     attend an Asian economic summit in Seattle, despite Taiwan's \n     status as an Asian economic powerhouse that buys more than \n     twice as much from the United States as mainland China.\n       The worst insult to Taiwan, however, was a disgraceful \n     episode last May when Mr. Lee was denied permission to stay \n     overnight in Honolulu after his plane stopped there to \n     refuel. The State Department is following a policy of no \n     overnight stays on U.S. soil for senior Taiwan officials, \n     treatment more appropriate for criminals than for friends and \n     allies.\n       In contrast, the administration is eager to please the \n     regime in Beijing, a government that continues to test \n     nuclear weapons while developing a whole new series of \n     ballistic missiles, including some that can carry nuclear \n     weapons anywhere in Asia and even across the Pacific. China \n     also is buying frontline Russian SU-27 combat aircraft, \n     Russian Kilo-class submarines, and other equipment under a \n     major military modernization program. This Chinese \n     development of power projection capabilities is a direct \n     threat to Taiwan and the other democracies of Asia.\n       China's military buildup is being achieved even as the \n     communist regime continues to suppress human rights, commits \n     systematic genocide in Tibet, confronts its neighbors with \n     claims on oil deposits and islands in the South China Sea, \n     and threatens to invade Taiwan if that democracy declares its \n     independence. Yet the Clinton administration wants close \n     relations with the Chinese military and is eager to sell \n     China high-speed computers and other advanced technologies \n     that have significant military applications. Last October, \n     Mr. Clinton sent Defense Secretary William Perry to Beijing \n     to cement relations with the Chinese army, and Mr. Perry \n     wound up toasting the commanders who crushed the democracy \n     uprising.\n       Policy toward Taiwan, however, continues to be shaped by \n     the Shanghai Communique that was signed before the Tiananmen \n     Square uprising, which requires the United States gradually \n     to decrease the quality and quantity of military equipment \n     sold to Taiwan. Consequently, even the F-16A/B aircraft that \n     President Bush approved for sale to Taiwan just before the \n     1992 election are the oldest models of that fighter, inferior \n     even to the model being sold to Saudi Arabia.\n       As China builds up its offensive military force, the United \n     States must help Taiwan defend itself. Congress should \n     disavow the ill-considered Shanghai Communique and press Mr. \n     Clinton to sell first-line military equipment, including the \n     best available air, sea, and missile defenses, to our friends \n     on Taiwan.\n       Members of Congress of both parties are increasingly \n     unhappy with Mr. Clinton's China policy and irate at the \n     treatment of Taiwan's President Lee. The House International \n     Relations Committee approved by a vote of 33-0 a resolution \n     calling on Mr. Clinton to welcome President Lee to visit \n     Cornell University, and to allow him to attend a planned \n     meeting of the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Council in Anchorage, \n     Alaska. But the administration has ignored this unanimous \n     bipartisan congressional resolution.\n       If President Lee is denied permission to receive his honors \n     at Cornell, the Clinton administration's lack of principle \n     will have dragged this country to a new low. The House is \n     expected to bring this issue to a floor vote today to demand \n     prompt approval of a visa for Mr. Lee and the restoration of \n     common decency to our relations with Taiwan. The Senate \n     should quickly follow suit.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, Apr. 19, 1995]\n\n                       Odd Way To Reward a Friend\n\n       Eleven months after Communist China's old tyrants loosed \n     the tanks on pro-democracy students in Tianamen Square, \n     Taiwan's new president, Lee Teng-Hui, released several \n     political prisoners--the first step in his rapid march to \n     democratizing ``the other China.''

He has a Ph.D. from \n     Cornell University in upstate New York, something one would \n     wish more foreign leaders possessed.\n       Cornell wants to offer this distinguished graduate an \n     honorary degree. The Clinton administration, following the \n     policy of previous administrations, says Lee can't come back \n     to this country. The reason is that the mainland Chinese \n     would be offended.\n       That policy is inexplicable. Essentially, the U.S. is \n     allowing mainland China to dictate the terms of our relations \n     with one of our best trading partners. Lee's policies and \n     economy is far more admirable than the mainland's, but we \n     keep him at arm's length. At the minimum, Lee should be \n     allowed to visit his alma mater. An official visit to \n     Washington, D.C. is not a bad idea, either.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sept. 26, 1994]\n\n                          Tale of Two Nations\n\n       The Clinton administration is committing hundreds of \n     millions of dollars, and potentially the lives of many \n     American military personnel, to the ``restoration'' of \n     democracy in Haiti. If that third-rate nation's brutal \n     politicians and policemen suspend their practice of murdering \n     their critics and oppressing the populace, the United States \n     may reward the country with generous economic aid for years \n     to come. And, of course, its diplomats will continue to \n     receive invitations to White House soirees.\n       Meanwhile, how does the Clinton administration reward an \n     old American ally that is democratizing by choice, that has \n     established a commendable record on human rights, that has \n     embraced the free enterprise system, and that does enough \n     business with the United States to support more than 300,000 \n     American jobs? By throwing it a few crumbs and telling it to \n     keep its officials away from the White House and the State \n     Department.\n       That about explains the Clinton administration's new and \n     supposedly improved policy on the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan. The President has condescendingly allowed Taiwan to \n     rename its unofficial mission here from ``The Coordination \n     Council for North American Affairs'' to ``The Taipei Economic \n     and Cultural Representative's Office in the \n      [[Page S6311]]  United States,'' which more clearly \n     described the mission's function.\n       He also has removed the ban on direct contacts between \n     American economic and technical officials of non-Cabinet rank \n     and Taiwanese government officials in Taipei, but Taiwanese \n     officials stationed in the United States will not be \n     permitted to visit the State Department. And the President \n     may support Taiwan's membership in certain international \n     organizations, such as those concerned with trade, when he \n     can do so without implying diplomatic recognition of that \n     country.\n       In other words, Taiwan is to remain a diplomatic pariah \n     whose president is not even permitted to land on American \n     soil long enough to play a round of golf.\n       Taiwan deserves better treatment. It is the United States' \n     sixth-largest trading partner. It stood shoulder to shoulder \n     with the United States during the darkest and most dangerous \n     phases of the Cold War. It has used the United States as a \n     model in building its economic and political structures. \n     Voluntarily and enthusiastically, it is developing exactly \n     the kind of democracy that the United States advocates.\n       The United States withdrew diplomatic recognition from \n     Taiwan during the Carter administration, and denies it still, \n     in an effort to cultivate the friendship of mainland \n     Communist China, which asserts sovereignty over Taiwan and \n     vows to reclaim that island someday. Taiwan is also committed \n     to eventual reunification. The two countries have developed \n     important commercial ties in recent years, but they are far \n     from agreement on the terms for merging politically into a \n     new united China.\n       Strong arguments based on both principle and political \n     reality can be made against the United States' eagerness to \n     appease Communist China at the expense of an old American \n     friend. Tomorrow Senator Robb will convene a hearing of his \n     Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to review the \n     administration's China policies. The exchange promises to be \n     vigorous.\n       Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois considers it \n     wrong as a matter of principle for the United States to \n     disdain a country that has ``a multi-party system, free \n     elections, and a free press--the things we profess to \n     champion--while we continue to cuddle up to the mainland \n     government whose dictatorship permits none of those.'' \n     Heritage Foundation China analyst Brett Lippencott suggests \n     that by developing closer ties to Taiwan the United States \n     could promote the reunification of China. The reason, \n     essentially, is that the failure to enhance Taiwan's \n     ``international status could weaken those in Taiwan who favor \n     eventual reunification . . . and strengthen those who seek an \n     independent Taiwan.''\n       Obviously, the actual existence of two Chinas creates a \n     difficult and delicate problem for the United States. But in \n     dealing with it, our leaders should occasionally do what is \n     right instead of always doing what they think will please the \n     tyrannical rulers of the world's last remaining major \n     Communist stronghold.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Sept. 27, 1994]\n\n         Taiwan--Senate Should Urge Greater White House Support\n\n       For the second consecutive year, Taiwan's bid for \n     membership in the United Nations has been thwarted. But \n     however many ``no'' votes may have been cast against Taiwan \n     at the U.N., the island democracy off the coast of mainland \n     China deserves far better treatment from the Clinton \n     administration.\n       Last week's anti-Taiwan vote by the 28-member General \n     Assembly steering committee was hardly surprising. Because \n     Communist China considers Taiwan to be a ``renegade \n     province,'' China has waged an ongoing and heavy-handed \n     campaign against Taiwan since 1949.\n       As relations have warmed between the United States and \n     China, U.S.-Taiwan relations have suffered. U.S. policy \n     continues to be based on the traditional formula that says, \n     ``There is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China.'' \n     To be sure, President Clinton attempted to boost economic and \n     commercial ties with Taiwan earlier this month by calling for \n     more high-level visits. He is putting special emphasis on \n     those relating to technical and economic issues. But that's \n     insufficient.\n       Today may be another milestone in the evolution of U.S.-\n     Taiwan relations. The Clinton administration's new Taiwan \n     policy is scheduled to be examined by the East Asian and \n     Pacific affairs subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee. As Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois has pointed out, \n     the first thing the Senate should note is that Taiwan \n     features a multi-party system, free elections and a free \n     press. He's right.\n       Earlier this year, President Clinton said in his State of \n     the Union message that ``the best strategy to ensure our \n     security and to build a durable peace is to support the \n     advance of democracy elsewhere.'' The East Asian and Pacific \n     affairs subcommittee chairman, Charles Robb of Virginia, \n     should recite those words in his hearing room today.\n       Taiwan is the perfect place for the Clinton administration \n     to translate words into action. The way to do that is by \n     giving Taiwan greater recognition for its democratic \n     advances.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, Mar. 18, 1995]\n\n                       Let Taiwan President Visit\n\n       President Clinton's China policy (essentially, give Beijing \n     whatever it wants) is about to be challenged over his \n     snubbing of Taiwan.\n       Cornell University has invited one of its graduates to \n     address an alumni reunion in June. He is Lee Teng-hui, who \n     received a doctorate in agricultural economics from Cornell \n     in 1968. He is president of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n       Since 1979, Washington has taken the position that the \n     Communist government in Beijing, one of the most repressive \n     on earth, is the exclusive representative of the Chinese \n     people. Taiwan is a democracy and one of our largest trading \n     partners.\n       To placate the People's Republic, the president of Taiwan \n     isn't allowed to visit the United States, even in an \n     unofficial capacity. Last May, when Lee stopped in Honolulu \n     en route to Costa Rica, the State Department generously \n     offered to permit him to enter the airport, provided he \n     remain in quarantine. Lee chose to stay on his plane.\n       Why the administration must allow Beijing to jerk its \n     strings is a mystery. The regime is not the least cooperative \n     on human rights or trade.\n       Congressional Republicans are threatening to revolt. Sen. \n     Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) has 35 co-sponsors on a resolution \n     calling on the administration to allow Lee to visit Cornell. \n     If the resolution is ignored, Murkowski is threatening to \n     reopen the issue of U.S. relations with Taiwan.\n       This is a fight the president doesn't need. Beijing may \n     bluster but ultimately will do nothing. The world won't come \n     to an end if one of Cornell's more distinguished alumni \n     visits his alma mater.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Tampa Tribune, Mar. 26, 1996]\n\n                      Why Treat Taiwan Like Dirt?\n\n       Standing up for what you believe is not always easy in \n     international affairs, and President Clinton probably wishes \n     people wouldn't force him into areas of diplomacy where he is \n     so uncomfortable.\n       But it's happening again. Pesky Cornell University is \n     inviting one of its graduates, Taiwan's President Lee Teng-\n     Hui, to give a speech there in June. So President Clinton \n     must decide whether to allow the visit, sure to anger \n     mainland China, or to continue the policy of pretending \n     Taiwan's top leaders have the plague.\n       Helping keep the issue in the public eye is a proposed \n     Senate resolution, sponsored by Frank Murkowski of Alaska and \n     co-sponsored by Sen. Connie Mack of Florida and 34 others.\n       Each of the many ``whereas'' paragraphs in the resolution \n     contains a bit of information sure to make the President \n     twitch. Taiwan is the United States' sixth-largest trading \n     partner; it supports democracy and human rights; it has a \n     free press and free elections; its elected leaders deserve to \n     be treated with respect and dignity; and the U.S. Senate has \n     voted several times last year to welcome President Lee to the \n     United States.\n       Perhaps if President Clinton were more confident in the \n     diplomatic skills of his administration, he would be less \n     cautious about putting a few old Communist tyrants in a \n     temporary huff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  [From the Oregonian, Feb. 24, 1995]\n\n                      Strengthen U.S.-Taiwan Ties\n\n       Taiwan has made remarkable efforts to do the kinds of \n     things that United States foreign policy has asked of it. The \n     Clinton administration ought to reward that effort by further \n     loosening the shackles on U.S. Taiwanese relations. It made \n     some hopeful changes last September, but badly needs to do \n     more.\n       Members of both parties in Congress are dismayed--rightly \n     so--at how this country has treated Taiwan's reformist \n     President Lee Tanghui. It forbade him to stay overnight when \n     his plane landed in Hawaii for refueling last May on a trip \n     to Central America, and so far has refused permission for Lee \n     to enter the United States, even as a private citizen acting \n     in a wholly unofficial capacity, to receive an honorary \n     degree from his alma mater, Cornell University.\n       The reason for that is the ``one China'' policy adopted in \n     1979, when the United States finally abandoned hope that the \n     rump Nationalist government on Taiwan would ever regain \n     control of mainland China, the communist People's Republic.\n       China considers Taiwan a rogue province. By a combination \n     of bluster and threat, it has long persuaded other nations \n     and international organizations to isolate Taiwan.\n       But that doesn't mean the United States shouldn't do much \n     more to strengthen its unofficial economic, political and \n     cultural ties with Taiwan pending a final resolution of the \n     Taiwan-China dispute.\n       Taiwan is our fifth-largest trading partner (third-largest \n     for the Columbia-Snake River Customs District) and an \n     economic powerhouse in Asia. We ship twice as many goods to \n     the island of 20 million people as we do to the mainland.\n       Taiwan has made immense progress along the road from \n     virtual dictatorship under the late Chiang Kai-shek and his \n     son, Chiang Ching-kuo, to representative democracy.\n       One result has been that Lee's ruling Nationalist Party \n     faces significant opposition \n      [[Page S6312]]  not only from the populist Democratic \n     Progressive Party, which favors Taiwanese independence from \n     China, but also from a breakaway Nationalist group calling \n     itself the New Party.\n       Unlike the People's Republic. Taiwan has a free press and a \n     television system that is only nominally government-\n     controlled. The Taipei government tolerates an illegal cable \n     TV system that broadcast a ``democracy channel'' and news \n     from the mainland.\n       Unlike the People's Republic, Taiwan has acknowledged past \n     human-rights abuses, including the Nationalist slaughter of \n     thousands of native Taiwanese in 1947, two years before \n     Chiang's forces finally lost their civil war against the \n     communists, and has made far more human-rights progress than \n     the mainland.\n       Taiwan has taken more positive steps then the mainland to \n     protect U.S. intellectual property--the current sore point \n     between Washington and Beijing.\n       These are exactly the combination of reforms and brisk \n     march toward democracy that the United States urges on \n     Russia, China and some Latin American nations, among others. \n     The only difference is that Taiwan is getting it done.\n       That should be rewarded with closer ties to the United \n     States and U.S. help in getting Taiwan full participation in \n     the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund. \n     World Bank and other organizations that should be more \n     concerned with facts as they are than facts as China might \n     like them to be.\n       And let Lee visit Cornell.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I intend to offer my thoughts on House \nConcurrent Resolution 53, but before doing so, I would like to know if \nmy colleague from Alaska might engage in a colloquy on a particular \npoint about this resolution on which we would agree: that it is \nimportant to maintain a productive relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to enter into a colloquy with my good \nfriend from Louisiana on this point.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I wonder if it is the Senator's intent by this \nresolution to begin a two China policy, that is to violate the terms of \nthe agreement the United States made with the People's Republic of \nChina in 1979 to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole \nlegal Government of China? As my colleague knows, since signing that \nagreement, the United States has maintained only unofficial relations \nwith Taiwan, keeping commercial, cultural, and other relations without \nofficial Government representation and without diplomatic relations.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe this resolution is consistent with our \nagreements with the People's Republic of China and is consistent with \nthe Taiwan Relations Act as well. This resolution does not, in this \nSenator's opinion, violate our one-China policy. I believe that the \nUnited States can allow a private visit by President Lee to his alma \nmater, Cornell University, and to a business conference in Alaska \nwithout compromising United States foreign policy toward the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  This resolution merely calls on the administration to recognize that \nPresident Lee should be admitted to attend private events in the United \nStates to promote our friendly, albeit unofficial, ties with the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan, as envisioned under the Taiwan Relations \nAct.\n  Since 1979, circumstances have changed between the People's Republic \nof China and the Republic of China on Taiwan. I would direct my \ncolleague's attention to the relationship that has developed between \nthe People's of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan through their \nunofficial entities: the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan \nStraits in Beijing and the Mainland Affairs Council in Taiwan. The two \nsides get together and talk about everything but politics. Trade and \ninvestment has ballooned. It seems entirely appropriate that the United \nStates should also be able to take actions to increase our trade and \neconomic ties with Taiwan.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator from Alaska for that clarification. \nAs I know my colleague is aware, diplomacy is often a gray area, and I \nbelieve there can be honest disagreements over when an action crosses a \nsometimes arbitrary line. On this particular issue, the Senator from \nAlaska and I might disagree over where that line is drawn. From this \ncolloquy I think we agree that it is in the interests of the United \nStates to maintain the fundamental United States-People's Republic of \nChina relationship.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Louisiana for that colloquy.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, even with this important clarification, I remain \nextremely concerned about how actions such as this, no matter how \nharmless they may appear, could impact the United States relationship \nwith the People's Republic of China. For almost 15 years, the United \nStates has remained committed to a one-China policy that includes only \nunofficial recognition of Taiwan. This commitment is backed up by \nseveral joint communiques issued by the United States and the People's \nRepublic of China and by the Taiwan Relations Act. I am concerned about \nthe ambiguities and confusion a visit by President Lee to the United \nStates could raise in the eyes of the People's Republic of China. \nAlthough this visit would be a private one, Mr. Lee is the President of \nTaiwan, he would be staying on American soil in an official capacity, \nand the United States does have a commitment to the People's Republic \nof China to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan. I hesitate \nto muddy the waters and compromise our carefully crafted, delicate \nrelations with the People's Republic of China by initiating vague \npolicies of recognition of Taiwan's leaders, whether such visits are \nprivate or not. The People's Republic of China is entering a period of \ntransition. Deng Xiaoping is over 90, and it is unclear who will \nsucceed him as head of the Chinese Government. Now is not the time to \nlook as if we were altering the United States steadfast commitment to a \none-China policy.\n  Should this resolution pass, as I expect it will, I urge the State \nDepartment not to follow this nonbinding resolution and not to issue a \nvisa to Mr. Lee. I have the greatest respect for President Lee and this \nis in no way meant to be a personal affront to him. I have seen \nrelations between the United States and Taiwan grow and improve and I \nhave seen Taiwan take great strides toward democracy. In fact, this \nadministration completed a comprehensive review of our policy with \nTaiwan last year and implemented a number of appropriate steps to \nfurther improve our relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan has held free and \nfair elections for some offices, and I hope this trend of expanding \nfree and fair elections will continue in the near future, including for \nthe office of the Presidency. I hope the United States will continue to \nmaintain its ties with Taiwan, but these ties must remain unofficial.\n  Mr. President, this is a very, very critical time for China, the \nlargest nation in the world upon which the stability of all of Asia \nand, some would say, the stability of all of the world depends.\n  Deng Xiaoping, their leader, is transitioning out. New leaders are \ncoming in. Therefore, it is very important that the United States not \ndo anything to upset what is one of the most important pillars of our \nrelationship with them, which is a one-China policy.\n  Now the question is, Does this violate the one-China policy?\n  The Secretary of State testified before the Budget Committee in \nFebruary that the United States has committed itself to the concept of \none China and to having an unofficial relationship with Taiwan. He also \nstated that if the President of Taiwan ``is wanting to transit to the \nUnited States when he is going someplace else, that would be acceptable \nunder the new arrangements. But it is regarded as being inconsistent \nwith the unofficial character of our relationships with Taiwan for the \nPresident to visit here in what would be, in effect, an official \ncapacity.'' It is my hope that, should this resolution be enacted by \nthe Congress, the administration will continue to hold to this policy \nand will not issue the travel visa to President Lee. As I said earlier, \nwhile I have the greatest respect for the President and people of \nTaiwan, and commend them on the significant progress they have made \ntoward democracy, the United States Congress should not alter over 15 \nyears of United States foreign policy with a single resolution. Our \ncurrent foreign policy toward China and Taiwan brings maximum benefit \nto the United States; we have official diplomatic ties with \n [[Page S6313]]  Beijing while maintaining trade and cultural relations \nwith Taipei. We should not change a policy that continues to serve U.S. \ninterests so well.\n  Our Secretary of State believes this does violence to the one-China \npolicy. I, therefore, would urge my colleagues to vote against this \nresolution, and I urge the Secretary of State not to issue the visa \ncalled for by this resolution. I stand second to no one in my affection \nand regard for Taiwan. But the way to show our regard and affection for \nTaiwan and President Lee is not by departing, however ambiguously, from \nthe one-China policy.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will take only 1 minute.\n  I think this is a sound resolution. I want to get along with the \nPeople's Republic of China, but they cannot dictate what we do. Taiwan \nhas a freely elected government and a free press, all the things we say \nthat we allow. The President of Taiwan wants to come over here on a \nprivate visit and go to his alumni meeting at Cornell University. I \nthink for us to knuckle under to the People's Republic of China under \nthose circumstances just goes contrary to everything we say we profess. \nI strongly support the resolution.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this resolution has one fault: It is too \nlate in coming. It has been reported out favorably by the Foreign \nRelations Committee. It is a mistake that we should have corrected a \nlong time ago.\n  Senator Murkowski and I, and others, have for a long time been \nprotesting this travesty in the conduct of U.S. foreign relations. How \nand when did the United States reach the point in United States-\nTaiwanese relations that United States foreign policy could preclude a \nvisit to the United States of the highest ranking, democratically \nelected official of Taiwan?\n  Though I did not often disagree with Ronald Reagan--I did on \noccasion, and one of those times was when President Reagan's advisers \nmade a regrettable decision which risked jeopardizing our relations \nwith Taiwan by cuddling up to the brutal dictators in Beijing. Since \nthat time, we have been hiding behind a diplomatic screen when \ndemonstrating our commitment and loyalty to the Taiwanese people.\n  Mr. President, at the time President Reagan's advisers made that \ngrievous error, Congress was promised that the United States would \ncontinue to ``preserve and promote extensive, close and friendly * * * \nrelations'' with the people on Taiwan. But successive administrations \nhave not lived up to that promise. How in the world could any one \nconsider it close and friendly to require the President of Taiwan to \nsit in his plane on a runway in Honolulu while it was refueled? I find \nit hard to imagine that United States relations with Red China would \nhave come to a standstill because of a weekend visit to the United \nStates by Taiwan's President Lee.\n  The President's China policy is in poor shape at this point--even \nmembers of his team recognize that. So, how can anyone really believe \nthat allowing President Lee to travel to his alma mater--or to vacation \nin North Carolina--would send our already precarious relations with Red \nChina plummeting over the edge?\n  Last time I checked, the Mainland Chinese were obviously enjoying \ntheir relations with the United States--a small wonder since they are \nbenefiting $30 billion a year from the American taxpayer as a result of \nUnited States trade with Red China.\n  Time and again, the U.S. Congress has urged the administration to \ngrant President Lee a visa. We have amended our immigration law so that \nit now specifically mentions the President of Taiwan. Congress has \npassed resolution after resolution encouraging the President to allow \nPresident Lee into the United States for a visit. All to no avail.\n  But today the delay is over. I hope I will have the privilege of \nbeing one of the first to welcome the distinguished President of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan. He deserves a warm welcome from all of us.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly hope that the concurrent \nresolution will be agreed to. The President of Taiwan has studied and \ntaught at Cornell, as well as Iowa State. This is a single visit. It \nfits within the guidelines of the policy review carried out by the \nWhite House and the National Security Council. It is a resolution which \nshould get an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles be added \nas the 54th bipartisan cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise this morning as the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to join in the \nsentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Murkowski, on Taiwan, and \nin particular on the visit of President Lee.\n  I need not repeat in detail for the Senate Taiwan's many \naccomplishments, either economic or political; these have often been \ndiscussed on the Senate floor. It is sufficient to note that this \ncountry is our fifth largest trading partner, and imports over 17 \nbillion dollars worth of U.S. products annually. More importantly, \nthough, Taiwan is a model emerging democracy in a region of the world \nnot particularly noted for its long democratic tradition.\n  The Taiwanese Government has ended martial law, removed restrictions \non freedom of the press, legalized the opposition parties, and \ninstituted electoral reforms which last December resulted in free \nelections. Taiwan is one of our staunchest friends; I think every \nMember of this body recognizes that, and accords Taiwan a special place \namong our allies. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the administration \napparently does not share our views. Rather, the administration goes \nout of its way to shun the Republic of China on Taiwan almost as though \nit were a pariah state like Libya or Iran. Sadly, the administration's \nshoddy treatment of Taiwan is based not on that country's faults or \nmisdeeds, but on the dictates of another country: the People's Republic \nof China.\n  It is because the People's Republic of China continues to claim that \nit is the sole legitimate Government of Taiwan, and because of the \nadministration's almost slavish desire to avoid upsetting that view, \nthat the State Department regularly kowtows to Beijing and maltreats \nthe Government of Taiwan.\n  The administration refuses to allow the President of Taiwan to enter \nthis country, even for a private visit. A private visit, Mr. President. \nPresident Lee is a graduate of Cornell University, where he earned his \nPh.D. He has expressed an interest in attending a class reunion at his \nalma mater this June, and a United States-Taiwan Economic Council \nConference. Yet the administration has made clear that it will not \npermit him entry.\n  Mr. President, the only people that this country systematically \nexcludes from entry to its shores are felons, war criminals, \nterrorists, and individuals with dangerous communicable diseases. How \nis it possible that the administration can see fit to add the President \nof Asia's oldest republic to this list? We have allowed representatives \nof the PLO and Sinn Fein to enter the country, yet we exclude a visit \nby an upstanding private citizen?\n  Mr. President, I think we have made clear to Beijing--I know I have \ntried to--the great importance to us of our strong relationship with \nthat country. This relationship should, in my opinion, transcend \nsquabbles over diplomatic minutiae. I will always seek to avoid any \nmove that the Government of the People's Republic of China reasonably \ncould find objectionable. I believe that countries like ours should try \nhard to accommodate each others' needs and concerns, in order to \nfurther strengthen our relationship.\n  However, I believe that the People's Republic of China needs to \nrecognize the reality of this situation. Both Taiwan and the People's \nRepublic of China are strong, economically vibrant entities. Both share \na common heritage and common culture, yet have chosen political systems \nthat are mutually exclusive. And despite these differences, the United \nStates has a strong and important relationship with both.\n   [[Page S6314]] I strongly believe that it is the Chinese who must \nwork out their differences among themselves, without resort to or \ninterference by outside forces. While I am sure that a solution will \ncome eventually, it is liable to take a number of years. In the \nmeantime, it does no good to continually place the United States in the \nunproductive position of having to walk a tightrope between the two, of \ncontinually having to choose sides.\n  Mr. President, our Taiwanese friends have been very understanding \nabout our relationship with the People's Republic of China. I would \nhope that our friends in Beijing would be equally respectful of our \nrelationship with Taipei. I fully support the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the concurrent \nresolution offered by Senator Murkowski, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor.\n  This, very simply, would state the sense of the Senate that we should \nremove existing restrictions on the right of President Lee Teng-hui, of \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, to travel to the United States. As my \ncolleagues have already heard, the President of Taiwan wishes to come \nhere to visit his alma mater, Cornell University. However, he cannot, \nbecause existing U.S. policy prevents him from staying here overnight.\n  It is certainly no secret to my colleagues that a principal reason \nfor this restriction is the particular sensitivity of the Mainland \nChinese Government to how the United States deals with and treats the \nTaiwanese. I would simply say that I speak as someone who has--and \nwill--stoutly defended the United States-China relationship, even when \nMainland China was under attack here in the United States for alleged \nhuman rights transgressions. I have consistently argued that the best \npolicy toward China is one of mutual exchange and respect, of \ncooperation in trade, environmental work, population issues, and all \nelse. So I do not believe that I can fairly be accused of being \nheedless of the very real and delicate sensitivities that the Chinese \nmight display regarding this matter.\n  However, I believe that it is possible--indeed, imperative--that we \nbe open in our dealings with Mainland China and with Taiwan \nsimultaneously. We must not insult the one in order to please the \nother. Indeed, even China and Taiwan are coming to increasingly \nrecognize the foolishness of their mutual antagonism of the last \nseveral decades. It is still a sensitive and difficult problem for each \ngovernment, but ``behind the scenes,'' we are seeing more travel across \nthe Taiwan Strait, more investment, more economic and cultural \nexchange. That relationship is beginning, however slowly, to change.\n  In any case, there are limits to how much we should rebuff the \nTaiwanese in order to preserve our relationship with Beijing. We should \nstrive to trade with the Chinese, to cooperate with them on a large \nnumber of issues, but not to refuse to participate in relationships \nthat are beneficial and proper for the United States. One of these is \nwith the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, I have always been one who has argued that there is a \nvital stake in old foes coming together to hammer out their ancient \ndifferences and eternal conflicts. I believe that backchannel contacts \nwere indispensable to bringing about the possibility for expanded, \npublic talks to bring about peace in the Middle East and in Ireland. So \nI have not publicly criticized the administration for its dealings with \nYasir Arafat, or with Gerry Adams, or any of a number of at times even \njustifiable blameworthy international figures.\n  But it does strike me as very odd that we can reach out so much to \nindividuals who have previously engaged in fully criminal conduct, yet \nwe cannot even allow one of our true friends, the President of Taiwan, \nto come to the United States for a private--I stress, private--visit.\n  And he is indeed a friend to the United States--his administration \nhas made it far easier for the United States to pursue a desirable \neconomic relationship with Taiwan without sacrificing any of our \nprinciples on human rights. Taiwan has recently enjoyed the freest and \nfairest elections in its history. There is unprecedented political \ncompetition, and public debate, and fully indulged criticism of the \nGovernment, in that country. It is not an American-style democracy by \nany stretch. But the progress has been quite remarkable.\n  What we have here is a policy of punishment for precisely the type of \nbehavior which we would hope to see in our oversees counterparts. \nPresident Lee has not only worked to make the United States-Taiwan \nrelationship less troublesome, but even has exerted energy to lessen \nstrains in the Taiwan-China relationship as well. That takes genuine \npolitical courage.\n  So I congratulate my fine friend the Senator from Alaska, Frank \nMurkowski, for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, and \nI pledge to him my full support in this and future efforts to repair \nand resolve this situation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of this concurrent \nresolution.\n  The concurrent resolution offered by the Senator from Alaska is, in \nessence, a statement of a basic American principle: free association, \nor our right to meet and speak with whomever we choose. It is strictly \nlimited to this issue, and raises no fundamental questions of China \npolicy.\n  This resolution welcomes the visit of President Lee Teng-hui of \nTaiwan, as a private citizen, to attend the United States-Republic of \nChina Business Council conference in Alaska, and give a speech at \nCornell University. These activities would in no way violate any of our \ncommitments to China, and would make sure we give President Lee the \nrespect he has earned as one of Asia's great democrats.\n  The principal objection to this resolution is the claim that it would \nviolated American commitments to the Chinese Government. Let me review \nprecisely what these commitments are. In 1972, 1979, and 1982, we \nsigned a series of three communiques with the People's Republic of \nChina. In the last of these, to quote the text:\n\n       The two sides agreed that the people of the United States \n     would continue to maintain cultural, commercial, and other \n     unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.\n\n  I believe we should keep our promises. We have made commitments to \nChina to maintain a one-China policy and keep our relationship with \nTaiwan on an unofficial basis. And as long as China keeps its side of \nthe bargain--to ``strive for a peaceful resolution'' to its differences \nwith Taiwan--we should keep ours.\n  But the text of the communique is very clear. It says that our \nrelationship will be unofficial. What is does not say is equally clear. \nThat is, neither the 1982 communique nor the other two make any \ncommitment whatsoever which Chinese citizens shall be eligible for \nvisas. Thus, I am convinced that the proposed visit by President Lee as \na private citizen would fall entirely within the framework of \n``cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations.''\n  Once again, this concurrent resolution, rightly construed, does not \nbear on China policy at all. It is simply as statement of our right as \nAmericans to meet and speak with whom we choose; and of our respect and \nfriendship for President Lee personally and the people of Taiwan in \ngeneral. I support it and hope my colleagues will do likewise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I just make an announcement? The \nBudget Committee intended to go back to mark up and vote after the two \nvotes. I would like to tell them all we are going to go back to \ncommittee and have two votes, one after another. I hope they will all \ncome. No proxy votes allowed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent \nresolution.

Mr. President, today the President of the United States is \nparticipating in Russia's May 9 commemoration of V-E Day. President \nClinton accepted Russian President Boris Yeltsin's invitation to this \nevent despite the fact that I and many of my colleagues encouraged him \nto select another time for a United States-Russian summit. We were \nconcerned that because of the moral ambiguity of this commemoration, \nUnited States participation would undermine the relationship we seek to \ndevelop with Russia. We must not forget that the Soviet Union \ncontributed to the outbreak of World War II, exploited the war's end, \nand committed countless atrocities to Russians, Ukrainians, \nLithuanians, and other peoples subject to its brutal domination.\n  President Clinton should not have accepted this invitation, but now \nthat he has, it is for these reasons that during his visit to Moscow he \nmust meet not only with Russia's leaders, but the Russian people and \nemphasize three key themes. First, he must emphasize human rights. \nSecond, democracy. And, third, rejection of empire. In doing so, the \nPresident would encourage all Russians not to look nostalgically back \non the Soviet Union, but forward toward the potential of a democratic \nand postimperial Russia. That should be the principal purpose of \nPresident Clinton's visit.\n  Toward this end, President Clinton must emphasize that his role in \nthis celebration is not to honor the Soviet Union, but the valor and \nsacrifices of all the peoples who fought in opposition against Nazi \naggression.\n  He must underscore the fact that while the United States, as a whole, \ncelebrates victory in this war, it has not forgotten the victims nor \nany crimes committed during that era, be it by the Nazis, Stalin and \nhis henchmen, or others.\n  This will not slight those who fought valiantly against fascism, as \nindeed did millions of Russians. It will in fact honor them even more \nhighly by ensuring that their contributions are distinguished from the \nwar-mongering and atrocities of that brutal time. And, in this way, the \nPresident will clearly differentiate the United States from those who \nseek to reanimate the Soviet past.\n  In articulating these themes, the President must publicly and \nforcefully address the ongoing war in Chechnya. Moscow's management of \nthe Chechnyan autonomy movement is depressingly reminiscent of the \npolicies that Stalin, himself, used to terrorize the peoples \nincorporated into the former Soviet Union. It indicates the fragility \nof democracy in Russia and, perhaps, even a weakening of its impulse.\n  President Clinton vowed that he would not visit Russia as long as \nMoscow continues the war against Chechnya. Indeed, Mr. President, in \nthe weeks preceding this summit meeting, President Yeltsin actually \nstepped up military operations against the Republic, leveling more \ntowns and killing more innocent civilians, both Russian and Chechnyan.\n  It is therefore absolutely essential that President Clinton speak \nforthrightly to the Russian people, not hiding the fact that America \ncondemns the brutal use of military force against Chechnya.\n  He should state that America's relationship with Russia is contingent \nupon Moscow's peaceful resolution of its differences with the Chechnyan \npeople. Hesitation on this matter will undermine the legitimacy of \nRussia's true democrats who have valiantly protested against this war \nand will strip credibility from our efforts to support Russia's still \nembryonic democracy.\n  The bottomline, Mr. President, is that human rights is an \ninternational issue. If Russia avows to be a member of the community of \ndemocracies founded upon respect for inalienable human rights, it must \nlive up to those standards.\n  Third, in order for a true strategic partnership to evolve between \nthe United States and Russia, Moscow must respect the sovereignty of \nthe non-Russian nations of the former Soviet Union and former Warsaw \nPact.\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\n  In this regard, the President's decision to visit Ukraine is \ncrucially important. A Kyiv summit will be an important signal of \nAmerica's commitment to assist the consolidation of Ukraine's \nindependence. In light of Ukraine's intertwined history with Russia, \nthe success of Ukrainian independence and integration into the Western \ncommunity of nations will be a critical determinant of Russia's \nevolution into a postimperial state.\n  An important underpinning of the constructive role we desire Russian-\nUkrainian relations to play in European security has been the \nTripartite Agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. In \naddition to facilitating the elimination of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, \nthe agreement committed Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and \nindependence. While in Moscow President Clinton must underscore \nAmerica's commitment to this agreement and our expectations that Russia \ndo the same.\n  The President must also emphasize that NATO enlargement will \ncontribute to greater peace and stability in post-cold war Europe. He \nmust communicate that this is a normal process that is driven not only \nby the need to address the security of Central Europe but also by the \nCentral Europeans who have clearly articulated their desire for \nmembership.\n  By further ensuring stability in Central and Eastern Europe, NATO \nexpansion will positively and significantly shape the futures of Russia \nand Germany, two great powers now engaged in a delicate and complex \nprocess of national redefinition. It is a critical step toward \nproviding the security essential to enhance the prosperity and \nstability now beginning to characterize Central and Eastern Europe.\n  It is a requirement for preserving Germany's progressive role in \nEuropean affairs and promoting Russia's postimperial evolution. By \ncreating greater stability along Russia's frontiers, NATO enlargement \nwould allow Moscow to spend more of its energy on the internal \nchallenges of political and economic reform.\n  I hope that, while he is in Moscow, our President will underscore the \nfact that Russia cannot and will not have any veto over the future \nmembership of NATO.\n  We all must recognize that NATO enlargement is a process whose \noutcome Russia will, nonetheless, inevitably influence. If Russia \nresists the process through intimidation or aggression, NATO \nenlargement will more likely be directed against Russia. If Russia \nrespects the rights of other nations to determine their own \ngeopolitical orientation, if Russia recognizes the objective benefits \nof NATO enlargement, and if Russia ultimately works with the alliance, \nenlargement will contribute to a broader engagement and integration \nthat will bring Europe and Russia closer together.\n  As it was well put in one of the recent hearings of the Foreign \nRelations' Committee on this matter, it is not NATO enlargement that \nwill determine the future of Russia's relationship with the alliance, \nbut Moscow's reaction to NATO enlargement.\n  Finally, during his stay in Moscow President Clinton must emphasize \nthat America is more interested in the future of Russian democracy than \nin the fate of a single leader. I strongly encourage that the President \nmeet with members of Russia's beleaguered press and those \ndemocratically minded legislators--particularly Sergei Kovalyov, the \nDuma's former Human Rights Commissioner who was recently relieved of \nhis duties because of his courageous criticism of the Russian \nGovernment's Chechyn policy. Perhaps, the President should even meet \nwith those Russian generals who oppose this war, such as former Deputy \nMinister of Defense Boris Gromov who also lost his position for his \ncriticism.\n  I say this because the future of our relationship with Russia lies \nnot with those who fall back on the brutal mechanisms of a bygone age, \nbut with those who envision Russia as a prospering democracy.\n  Mr. President, America's role in Moscow's V-E Day celebrations should \nbe to encourage Russian people and their leaders to concentrate not on \nthe former Soviet Union, but on Russia's future. These themes--human \nrights, democracy, and the rejection of empire--are the keys not only \nto unlocking Russia's potential but also to a true strategic \npartnership between Russia and the United States. Should Moscow's \nleaders respond positively to these themes, it would be a strong \ndemonstration that Russia is shedding the imperialist ambitions and \ntotalitarian proclivities of the Soviet past.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on a series of hearings scheduled by the Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Technology and Government Information of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the wake of Oklahoma City, although one had actually been \nscheduled in advance.\n  We have so far had hearings on the statutes proposed by the \nadministration and others. We have had a hearing in response to certain \ngroups concerned with the issue of constitutional rights. A hearing is \nscheduled for this Thursday, May 11, on the so-called mayhem manuals, \nwhere you can find out how to make a bomb, and a hearing is scheduled \non May 18 on the incidents involving Waco, TX and Ruby Ridge, ID.\n  I have received correspondence from the distinguished chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Hatch, who raises a question about the \ntimeliness of the hearings and about the jurisdiction of my \nsubcommittee. I have responded to Senator Hatch, and intend to put the \ncorrespondence in the Record so it may be available for the public, by \nnoting that the jurisdiction is clear-cut on the subcommittee, both \nunder the authority on terrorism and on governmental information.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that it is important and the hearings \nare long past due on what happened at Waco, TX and what happened at \nRuby Ridge, ID. There can be no misunderstanding or no question that \nwhatever happened at Waco, TX and Ruby Ridge, ID, that there is \nabsolutely, positively no justification for the bombing of the Federal \nbuilding in Oklahoma City, OK.\n  But there has been a great deal of concern about whether there has \nbeen a candid response by the Government of the United States, and in \nthe congressional oversight responsibility, we should lay all the facts \non the table in the interest of full disclosure--let the chips fall \nwhere they may. The virtue of strength of a democracy is that we do not \ncover our mistakes; that if there are errors and if there are problems, \nwe identify them forthrightly.\n  There had been some concern that a hearing on Ruby Ridge, ID might in \nsome way prejudice the investigation by the prosecuting attorney who \nmay intend to bring some charges, perhaps even against Federal \nofficials. I have had an extended discussion with Randolph Day, Esq., \nthe county attorney for Boundary County, who has advised me that he \nsees no problem in our going forward with hearings by the subcommittee.\n  A number of Senators have made public statements about the importance \nof having such hearings. Others of my colleagues have discussed the \nmatters with me privately. I do think it is important that hearings \nproceed and that other Senators and the public be aware of the status \nof this matter.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter from Senator \nHatch to me dated May 8, with my reply to him dated May 9, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Arlen: I am writing with regard to your public \n     statements concerning the convening of a hearing in the \n     Terrorism, Technology and Government Information subcommittee \n     to review the incidents at Waco, Texas and Ruby Ridge, Idaho. \n     This letter is intended to settle any misunderstanding that \n     may exist as to what the Senate Judiciary Committee's plans \n     are surrounding a review of these matters.\n        [[Page S6317]] As you know, I share your deep concern over \n     these incidents and believe that a thorough Congressional \n     review of these, and related federal law enforcement issues, \n     is warranted. However, hearings on these matters would not be \n     properly within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on \n     Terrorism, Technology and Government Information. Indeed, \n     when your staff raised this issue with Committee staff more \n     than one week ago, my position on this matter was promptly \n     conveyed. Due to the important nature of these issues and \n     their ramifications for federal law enforcement, hearings \n     should be held at the Full Committee. I intend that hearings \n     will be held in the near future following Senate \n     consideration of comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation. \n     Indeed, I believe the House Judiciary Committee has announced \n     hearings as well. It might prove beneficial to hold our \n     hearings after the House completes its hearing.\n       The hearing you propose is an important one, but I believe \n     that it is unrelated, in any true sense, to the broader issue \n     of the prevention of domestic terrorism. Accordingly, to hold \n     the hearing as you propose at this time will serve only to \n     confuse these important issues. Indeed, by linking the Waco \n     incident to the terrorism issue through hearings at this \n     time, the Committee could inappropriately, albeit \n     unintentionally, convey the wrong message regarding the \n     culpability of those responsible for the atrocity in Oklahoma \n     City. We must not do this.\n       I appreciate your concern over this matter. I look forward \n     to working with you on this and all other matters before the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Orrin: I have your letter of May 8.\n       I disagree with you on three counts:\n       1. Hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge, Idaho, should be held \n     promptly (actually they are long overdue) rather than waiting \n     to some unspecified time in the ``near future'' or ``after \n     the House completes its hearings.''\n       2. My Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government \n     Information has clear cut jurisdiction both as our authority \n     relates to terrorism and government information.\n       3. I categorically reject your assertions that the \n     Subcommittee's scheduled hearing will ``serve only to confuse \n     these important issues'' and ``convey the wrong message \n     regarding the culpability of those responsible for that \n     atrocity in Oklahoma City.'' There can be no conceivable \n     misunderstanding that there is no possible justification for \n     the bombing in Oklahoma City regardless of what happened in \n     Waco or Idaho. The public interest requires full disclosure \n     of those incidents through hearings to promote public \n     confidence in government.\n       Since I have had and am continuing to have media inquiries \n     on these hearings, for your information I am releasing this \n     exchange of correspondence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, the Senate Budget Committee is meeting \ntoday, and they are involved in, I think, a gripping, wrenching debate \nabout how they will try to find a route toward a balanced budget. It is \nan effort that I think needs to involve all of us because I do not know \nof anybody in this Chamber who has stood on the floor and said they do \nnot agree that a balanced budget is necessary and desirable for this \ncountry.\n  There were some presentations on the floor of the Senate earlier this \nmorning talking about the issue of Medicare, and I wanted to stand and \nrespond to a couple of those comments, because part of this issue of \nbalancing the Federal budget involves the question of Medicare.\n  We are in a circumstance described, interestingly enough, by E.J. \nDionne today in the Washington Post. I would like to read a paragraph \nor two from his column:\n\n       When the House Republicans passed their big tax cut earlier \n     this year, they were not at all interested in what President \n     Clinton or the Democrats had to say about it. They wanted \n     credit for doing what they said they would do in the Contract \n     With America. And they got it.\n       But now the time has come to pay both for the tax cut and \n     for even a bigger promise, a balanced budget by year 2002. \n     Suddenly, the Republicans are whining that the President has \n     refused to take the lead in cutting Medicare and Medicaid, \n     which is what the GOP needs to do to make any sense of its \n     budget promises.\n\n  Mr. Dionne says:\n\n       Let's see: When it comes to passing around the goodies, the \n     House Republicans are prepared to take full responsibility. \n     When it comes to paying for the goodies, they want a \n     Democratic President to take full responsibility. And they \n     act shocked, shocked when he refuses to play along.\n       You can't blame the Republicans for trying. It's a clever, \n     if transparent, strategy.\n\n  The point is, there has been a lot of protest on the floor of the \nSenate and the House in the last few days about concerns many of us \nhave about the Medicare Program and the tax cut that was passed \nrecently by the House of Representatives.\n  It seems to me that at least some in Congress dived off the high \nboard and showed wonderful form as they did their double twists and \nhave now discovered there is no water in the pool.\n  A tax cut first, for the middle class they said. Of course, the chart \nshows something different. Who benefits from the tax cut bill? If you \nearn over $200,000 as a family, you get $11,200 a year in tax cuts. If \nyou are a family earning less than $30,000 a year, you get $120 a year \nin tax cuts. This is not a middle class I have seen anywhere in \nAmerica. The fact is that it is a tax cut for the wealthy. That was \npassed, and now they say we should cut Medicare to pay for it.\n  Well, we are going to have to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare. \nNo one disputes that. But before we engage in a discussion about what \nyou do about Medicare and Medicaid, many of us believe that the first \nthing you ought to do is get rid of this tax cut for the rich. It is \ntime to deep-six this kind of a proposal, then let us talk about \nMedicare. Otherwise, what you have is a direct circumstance that cannot \nbe avoided.\n  The comparison is obvious: $340 billion in tax cuts, for $300 to $400 \nbillion in Medicare and Medicaid health care cuts. Let us back away \nfrom the tax cut. As soon as the majority party does that--and I hope \nthey will--then I think this Congress ought to begin, in a joint effort \non Medicare and Medicaid and virtually every other area of the Federal \nbudget, to sift through these things to find out where we achieve the \nmeans by which we balance the Federal budget.\n  But you know, some of us have been through all of this before. Talk \nis cheap. Talking about balancing the budget is very, very easy. \nEveryone talks about it.\n  Last week, I proposed a series of budget cuts, real budget cuts in a \nwhole range of areas that totaled some $800 billion, and I am going to \npropose more. That package does not include Medicare and Medicaid, and \nI know we have to reduce the rate of growth on both of those. But I \nalso feel very strongly that as we approach this problem, we should not \nallow the other party to pass a very big tax cut first and then say to \nothers later, ``Now help us pay for that by taking it out of the hide \nof your constituents.''\n  Let us join together and work together, but let us do it in a way \nthat gets rid of the tax cut that was ill-advised, bad public policy, \nnot middle class, but essentially a tax cut that benefits the wealthy. \nGet rid of it, disavow it and then move on together in every single \narea of the Federal budget and do what is right for the country.\n  That is what the American people expect and deserve, and I think that \nis what will benefit this country's future in a real and meaningful \nway.\n  Let me thank the President for allowing me to extend the time. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6317-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6317-S6318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the pending business and what is the status of \nthe pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending unfinished business is H.R. 956, \nand the pending question is amendment No. 709. The Senate is operating \nunder cloture.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is that the Gorton-Rockefeller-Dole amendment to the \nCoverdell-Dole amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, since we are now under cloture and without \nthe presence of my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, I should like, very \ntentatively, to announce what I hope the course of action will be this \nafternoon.\n  I will, unless there is objection, within a reasonable period of \ntime, ask unanimous consent for a minor but significant amendment to \nthe Gorton-Rockefeller-Dole amendment, a proposition that does require \nunanimous consent to keep the undertaking that Senator Rockefeller made \nwith respect to the right of a new trial after a judge imposed additur.\n  After that, I would propose that we go forward by adopting the \nGorton-Dole-Rockefeller amendment and the underlying amendment and then \nhaving a debate on any further amendments to the bill, some of which \nwill require unanimous consent in order to bring them up, as I \nunderstand from the Parliamentarian, because of the position in which \nwe find ourselves.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have agreed that amendments from the other \nside, during the pendency of cloture, that Members opposed to this bill \nwant to bring up ought to be allowed to be brought up, and certainly we \nwill grant unanimous consent for that taking place.\n  Each of these will require cooperation and essentially unanimous \nconsent. Senator Rockefeller is not back yet. One of the opponents to \nthe bill is here. I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum so that \nMembers can digest this request, so that the leaders can get together \nif they wish, and so we can proceed for the rest of the day. I hope \nthat we will end up being able to finish the entire bill and having our \nfinal vote on final passage before the day is out, as the leader would \nlike to go on to other bills.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. If the Senator will withhold the quorum call, regarding \nwhat the Senator has said about asking unanimous consent, I think \nSenator Hollings should be on the floor to respond to that. I think he \nhas some feelings on it. However, I do realize this: It is my \ninformation that unless that happens, then unanimous consent is going \nto be necessary for each and every amendment to occur. Now, I have been \ntalking with various people on our side who are very knowledgeable on \nparliamentary proceedings. I think it is something we will want to look \nat. If we enter into a quorum call, we ought to investigate and see \nexactly what the parliamentary status is and what Senator Hollings' \nfeelings are on that. He articulated to me earlier rather strong \nfeelings against it. But he may have reconsidered it since that time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I think the Senator from Alabama is correct about the \nparliamentary situation. Certainly, given Senator Hollings' views on \nthe subject, I want his full knowledge and participation before we go \nahead. My announcement was just in hopes that we can get interested \npeople here to make those decisions. Awaiting our ability to do so, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, am I correct that we are now on the \nproduct liability bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now on that matter, H.R. 956, \nthe product liability bill under cloture.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak about this legislation that is before \nthe body, and I would like to talk about what I think is at stake in \nthe vote that we just cast and what would be at stake in some votes \nthat we will also be casting over the next day or day and a half.\n  As I see it, we started out with a bill that was unfair, which I \nthink tipped the scale of justice away from consumer protection and in \nfavor of corporate wrongdoers. Then as we went along, there was an \noverreaching by some of the insurance companies and other big corporate \ndefendants, and yet more amendments were attached onto this bill making \nit truly awful. Then as a result of several cloture votes--when it was \nclear that this piece of legislation with all of the additional awful \namendments could not pass--it was stripped down to now being just \nprofoundly wrong for people in this country, which is not what I would \ncall much of an improvement.\n  Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. But as I understand the features of \nthis bill there is a tremendous amount of unfairness. I quite frankly \ncannot figure out why this body went ahead and invoked cloture. First \nof all, there is still a cap on punitive damages, as I understand it, \nof $250,000 or twice compensatory damages. Compensatory means both the \neconomic and the noneconomic damages. So that, for example, if you were \nnot an executive of a large company but a wage earner, if you did not \nmake as much money, if you were a woman--women generally speaking make \nless than men in the work force--or if you were a senior citizen, and \nyou were hurt by exactly the same behavior and received exactly the \nsame harm from exactly the same defendant as some CEO, there would be \ndifferences in terms of what the award would be. The punishment would \nbe greater for hurting the CEO.\n  This is still an absurd result and still an indefensible one. When I \nspoke last week I asked my colleagues to consider the faces of people \nwho will be hurt by this provision. LeeAnn Gryc from my State of \nMinnesota was 4 years old when the pajama she was wearing ignited \nleaving her with second- and third-degree burns over 20 percent of her \nbody. An official with the company that made the pajamas had written a \nmemo 14 years earlier stating that because the material they used was \nso flammable the company was ``sitting on a powder keg''. This latest \nproposal, the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute, would cap the punishment \nthe defendant receives. How would this affect LeeAnn? It is not clear. \nAll of that would depend upon what kind of compensatory damages the \njury awards. Are we really willing to sit here in Washington, DC, and \nchange that and preempt Minnesota law and make that kind of \ndetermination?\n  Mr. President, this proposed improvement has new language which would \nallow a judge to award higher punitive damages than the caps would \notherwise provide if the judge thinks it is necessary to serve the twin \npurposes of punishment and deterrence. Again, first of all, what we do \nis set this cap and it is either $250,000 or twice a combination of \neconomic and noneconomic damages which is discriminatory, by the way, \ntoward low income, moderate income, middle income in terms of how that \nformula works out. Then we go on.\n  When you think about the case of LeeAnn Gryc, or the case of a whole \nlot of other people who are hurt in this country, who is prepared to \nsay that the cap ought to be $250,000 or a little above? Who is \nprepared to say that a defendant should be punished less because he or \nshe hurt a wage earner as opposed to a CEO of some of the largest \ncompanies in this country? I do not see the Minnesota standard of \nfairness.\n  The new language then, in what is apparently supposed to be an \nimprovement, allows the judge to award more punitive damages than the \ncaps would otherwise provide, if the judge thinks that it is necessary \nto serve the twin purposes of punishment and deterrence. But what \nhappened to the jury? People on juries elect us to office. We have all \n [[Page S6319]]  the confidence in the world in the people who sit on \njuries to elect us to office. But all of a sudden we do not trust them \nto sit in judgment of their peers. They sit in judgment of us, do they \nnot? Are not they usually the finders of fact? I would think that it \nwould be difficult to find some standard of fairness where we \nessentially remove juries from this important process.\n  Then I was surprised to find in what is apparently supposed to be an \nimprovement a provision saying that if we are worried about the backlog \nof cases and paperwork reduction and all of the rest, we tell judges \nthat it is OK to go above the caps whenever they think it is necessary, \nbut we can also count on an additional court proceeding. On the bottom \nof page 22 in the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute, it says that if a \ndefendant does not like the judge's decision to go above the caps, \n``the court shall set aside the punitive damages award and order a new \ntrial on the issue of punitive damages only.''.\n  So what we get back to is essentially a meaningless provision where \nwe go to yet another trial if the defendant does not like the decision \nthe judge has made. My colleague, Senator Levin from Michigan, I \nthought came out here with a lucid presentation of this problem.\n  Joint liability I think is the thorniest issue. Actually in the Labor \nCommittee, when we were talking about this question, I may or may not \nhave said thinking out loud that I struggled with this question. But I \ndo not think the substitute does anything to correct the problem. It \neliminates joint liability for noneconomic damages. Some of my \ncolleagues have referred to this as the ``deep pocket pays problem.'' \nBut I think they are wrong. This is really a ``victim pays problem.''\n  I will tell you that it is really a difficult question. Suppose a \ncompany is responsible for only a portion of what it would take to \nrestore a victim to whole, compensatory damage. Yet with joint \nliability that company might have to be responsible for more than its \nfair share. That does not make a lot of sense. It does not seem as if \nit is fair.\n  But, Mr. President, now what we have is a provision which essentially \nsays to the consumer, to the citizen that is hurt, to the citizen that \nis injured, maimed, that they will always have to assume some of those \ndamages, if one of the responsible parties cannot pay. I do not see the \nstandard of fairness. In my State of Minnesota we came up with what I \nthink is a reasonable compromise; that is, we set a threshold. I think \nit was 15 percent. What we said was that, if you are responsible for \nless than 15 percent of the overall damage, then you would not have to \nbe responsible for more than your fair share.\n  But, Mr. President, it does not make any difference what Minnesota \nhas done. We have struggled with the problem. We have come up with a \nmiddle ground. But that all is preempted by this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, it just sounds like a clever political argument. But \nit really is not. So many people have talked about decentralization. So \nmany people have talked about relying more on States and local \ngovernments being the decisionmakers. But in this particular case, we \nare preempting some of the good work that has been done in a good many \nStates in this country, and I would put Minnesota at the very top.\n  Mr. President, there are huge problems with this piece of \nlegislation. It is a giveaway to corporate wrongdoers. I think it is a \nprofound mistake. We did not really have that much debate on the whole \nquestion of the 20-year statute of repose. But, again, let me just \nsimply say, that regardless of how you look at it, I think again this \nis arbitrary and indefensible. What possible justification is there for \nit? After all, if a product is defective and does not hurt anybody \nuntil it is over 20 years old, is the harm to the victim any less? Is \nthe responsibility of the manufacturer any less?\n  I talked about Patty Fritz from Minnesota. She is pretty well known \nin our State, and she is pretty well known in our country for her \ncourage. In her particular case, her daughter, Katie, was crushed to \ndeath by a defective garage door opener.\n  If it had been after 20 years, if the company had produced this \nproduct which was defective from the word go but she had only been hurt \nafter 20 years, does that mean the damage to that family is any less? \nDoes that mean the responsibility of the company is any less?\n  Mr. President, we are closing the courthouse door to people who are \nhurt by products produced by some of the businesses--thank God, not \nmany of the businesses--within our country. Some of my colleagues came \nout on the floor of the Senate with a bill last week. Then there were \namendments, which, as I said before, made it a truly egregious piece of \nlegislation. We were successful in opposing a good number of cloture \nmotions. Now the bill has been stripped away of some of the worst \nprovisions, but it is still a piece of legislation which is profoundly \nanti-consumer, profoundly antiordinary citizen, and I think it tips the \nscales of justice way too far in the direction of corporate wrongdoers \nand really denies people some of the redress for grievances that they \ncurrently have within our court system.\n  Finally, I think there is a gigantic problem with this Federal \npreemption. If a State like the State of Minnesota has come up with \nsome reasonable middle-ground proposals to deal with the problems of \nexcessive litigation, to deal with some of the problems of joint \nliability, to try to have some fairness between the businesses and the \nconsumers and the lawyers, it seems to me States ought to be able to \nhold on to some of the legislation they passed and not be preempted by \nthis national legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will have further debate on this piece \nof legislation, and I hope my colleagues will oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my southern \nneighbor, Senator Gorton from Washington, for agreeing to clarify a few \npoints about S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act. I also want to \nthank Senator Gorton's staff for their willingness to work out some of \nthe finer points of this legislation.\n  Section 102(c) of S. 565 lists a number of laws that are not \nsuperseded or affected by the act. My first question seeks to clarify \nthe language in section 102(c)(2). Section 102(c)(2) provides: \n``Nothing in this title may be construed to * * * (2) supersede or \nalter any Federal law;''\n  The committee report at page 28, footnote 101, gives examples of \nFederal statutes that are not superseded by S. 565. The examples in the \ncommittee report include the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Oil Pollution \nAct of 1990, and the Trans Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act.\n  My question to my friend is whether the language ``any Federal law'' \nin section 102(c) also includes Federal common law. I assume that it \ndoes and, therefore, that S. 565 does not supersede any Federal \nstatutory or common law, such as admiralty law. Would my friend clarify \nthis point for me, please?\n  Mr GORTON. The assumption of the Senator from Alaska is correct. \nSection 102(c)(2) provides that S. 565 does not supersede ``any Federal \nlaw,'' and that includes both Federal statutory law and Federal common \nlaw. The act, therefore, would not affect any causes of action or any \nremedies, including punitive damages, determined under Federal \nstatutory or common law, including admiralty law.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Washington for that \nconfirmation. My second question seeks to clarify the so-called \nenvironmental exclusion--section 102(c)(7)--which I support. Could you \nelaborate on the statutory exclusion and the statement in the committee \nreport that provides: ``The exception for environmental cases in this \nsection makes clear that this act does not apply to actions for damage \nto the environment.''?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to elaborate on this section for the \nSenator from Alaska. Section 102(c)(7) reads:\n\n        [[Page S6320]] Nothing in this title may be construed to * \n     * * (7) supersede or modify any statutory or common law, \n     including any law providing for an action to abate a \n     nuisance, that authorizes a state or person to institute an \n     action for civil damages or civil penalties, cleanup costs, \n     injunctions, restitution, cost recovery, punitive damages, or \n     any other form of relief for remediation of the environment * \n     * * or the threat of such remediation.\n\n  As the Senator notes, the committee report explains that the \nexception for environmental cases is intended to exclude from S. 565 \nall causes of action and remedies that are available under Federal or \nState statutory or common law for damage to the environment. Therefore, \nthis act would not place a cap on any punitive damage award or other \nremedy under any cause of action related to damage to the environment, \nincluding an action under a product liability theory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to focus on this point for a \nmoment, if I may. Section 102(c)(7) excludes from coverage under the \nbill any actions for ``remediation of the environment.'' The section \nrefers to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \nLiability Act of 1980 for the definition of ``environment,'' which \nincludes the navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone, the \nocean waters of the United States, and any other surface water, ground \nwater, drinking water supply, land surface or subsurface strata, or \nambient air within the United States. The section does not define \n``relief for remediation,'' which is not a legal term of art.\n  It is not clear whether ``relief for remediation of the environment'' \nincludes all other remedies to make injured parties whole, such as \nrelief for damage to private property and lost revenues, or whether the \nexclusion is limited strictly to damage to the environment. I note that \nthe committee report states with respect to section 102(c)(7) that the \nbill ``does apply to all product liability actions for harm'' which is \ndefined as ``any physical injury, illness, disease, death, or damage to \nproperty caused by a product.'' I ask the Senator if he could please \nexplain how this exclusion is intended to be applied in the case of an \noilspill that causes damage to the environment and damage to private \nproperty?\n  Mr. GORTON. The exclusion in section 102(c)(7) would apply to all \ncauses of action and remedies for damage to the environment. As the \nSenator from Alaska has correctly noted, the bill would apply to \nactions under State law for injury to persons or property that are \ncaused by a product. As mentioned earlier, this bill would not apply to \nany Federal statutory or common law cause of action.\n  To expand on the Senator's question, in the case of an oilspill \ncaused by the failure of a storage tank in which the plaintiffs seek to \nrecover for both damage to the environment and loss of property, the \nrules in the bill would establish the standard of proof and the limit \nof punitive damages with respect to recovery on the basis of damage to \nproperty under any applicable State law.\n  The bill would not apply to any aspect of the recovery for \nenvironmental damages, including any recovery for cleanup costs, \nremedial measures, damages or penalties for loss of wildlife, or \npunitive damages that are assessed for damage to the environment, \nwhether under State or Federal law and even if the cause of action is \nbased on a product liability theory. As is noted on page 22 of the \ncommittee report in the discussion of the definition of ``harm'' ``it \nis the nature of the loss that triggers the application of the act'' \nwith respect to State law, not the cause of action used.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for that explanation. My final \nquestion is whether the owner or operator of a product, such as a tank \nwhich contains oil, who is sued following an environmental accident may \nsue the manufacturer of the ship or tank under a product liability \ncause of action without limitation by this bill if it was product \nfailure that caused the damage to the environment? My concern is that \nthe equipment operator will be unable to recover fully from the \nmanufacturer. Ultimately, the original plaintiff may only be able to \nrecover to the extent that the operator is able to recover.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator's request for absolute clarity. \nFurther reference to the example of the ruptured oil tank may best \nillustrate the answer to your question. Suppose the oil tank ruptures \nas a result of a manufacturing defect. It leaks oil, causing damage to \nthe environment and the neighboring private property, as well as damage \nto the tank owner and the tank.\n  The statutory construction of the environmental exemption is clear. \nThis bill will not alter any law under which any injured party could \nrecover for damage to the environment.\n  To the extent that the owner or manufacturer of the tank is liable \nfor civil damages or civil penalties, cleanup costs, restitution, cost \nrecovery, punitive damages or any other form of relief ordered to \nrestore, correct, or compensate for damage to the environment, the \nrules in this bill would not apply. The bill would apply to an action \nby the private property owner to recover under State law for damage to \nthat property based on the failure of the tank or on the basis that the \noil, which is also a product, caused the harm.\n  Similarly, under section 102(c)(7) this bill would not apply to third \nparty actions related to environmental damages. For example, the tank \nowner could implead or cross-claim against the manufacturer of the tank \nfor damages awarded against the tank owner for remediation of the \nenvironment under any theory, including product liability. S. 565 would \nnot apply as a limitation on the causes of action or remedies available \nto the tank owner in an action against the manufacturer, but only to \nthe extent that the tank owner is seeking to recover against the \nmanufacturer for damages awarded against the tank owner for remediation \nof the environment. Applicable Federal or State law, other than this \nbill, would continue to govern the action with respect to environmental \ndamage.\n  However, this bill would apply with respect to any action under a \nproduct liability theory by the tank owner against the manufacturer for \nharm, as defined by this bill, caused by the product. In the case of a \ntank owner which has been held liable under a strict liability regime \nsuch as that found in section 1002 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, \nany damages assessed against the tank owner, including damages for \ninjury to real or personal property caused by the product, should be \nconsidered economic damages to the tank owner for purposes of this \nbill, and an action to recover those economic damages from the \nmanufacturer under a product liability theory would be without \nlimitation under this bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Washington \nfor taking the time to clarify the scope of these two provisions. I \nwant to thank, again, him and his staff for assisting me and Annie \nMcInervey and Earl Comstock of my staff to clarify these issues which \nare of vital importance to my State.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do believe there is one other \nclarification that needs to be made. The questions that have been \npropounded by the Senator from Alaska refer to S. 565. Technically \nspeaking, S. 565 is not before us. We are dealing with a House bill and \na Senate amendment which incorporated all of the provisions of S. 565 \nin it. And so the questions and answers are applicable equally to that \namendment as they would be if the identical S. 565 were before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will this still be called the Product Liability Fairness \nAct?\n  Mr. GORTON. It will be.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Then our comments should be addressed, for legislative \nhistory, to that act. I thank the Senator from Washington for \nclarifying that.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this has truly been a year of reform. Since \nthe outset of this Congress, the pervasive theme has been to \nfundamentally change a system of government that has gone awry. Thus \nfar, most of these efforts at reform have been targeted at the \nCongress, and rightfully so. As some have said, we must first stop the \nbleeding. However, there are many very formidable tasks before us. One \nof which we discuss today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to dedicate my support to the effort to \nreform the product liability system.\n  Justice in America is fundamentally rooted in the principles of the \nequality, \n [[Page S6321]]  expedience, and accessibility. Our current system of \nproduct liability is in conflict with all of these principles.\n  Where product liability cases are concerned, we certainly, cannot say \nthat there is equality in the system. There is a total lack of \nuniformity in the current product liability system. Due to the broad \ndiversity of legal standards from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is \nabsolutely impossible to predict what, when and how you will be \ncompensated for losses resulting from a faulty product. Where \nbusinesses are concerned, this unpredictability leads to \ndisproportionately high risk calculations and insurance rates as \ncompanies are forced to calculate the worst-case-scenario in assessing \nliability risk.\n  These risk costs have, not only an adverse effect on those directly \ninvolved in any particular case, but on all Americans. \nDisproportionately high insurance costs have several negative effects \non American business. In each case, that negative impact effect all of \nus.\n  Confronted with impossible-to-calculate liability costs, American \nbusinesses often choose not to introduce new technologies and \ninnovations into the marketplace. Thus denying consumers the benefits \nof enhanced products and services.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than the biomedical industry. In my \nState of Indiana, there is a large biomedical industry. Among other \nthings, these companies make artificial limbs. This is an industry that \nprovides hope and freedom to so many people who may otherwise find \ntheir lives limited by disability. However, due to disproportionate \nliability costs, the manufacturers of the raw materials utilized in the \nconstruction of these prosthetic device are increasingly choosing to \nforego the market. The sales to the biomedical industry represent such \na small percentage of total profits that liability costs outweigh \nbenefits.\n  Furthermore, American businesses are confronted with insurance costs \n20 times greater than their European competitors and 15 times greater \nthan those of Japanese industries. In addition to making American \nproducts more expensive at home, this adversely effects competitiveness \nin a global marketplace. That means damage to job creation.\n  An excellent example of this is a case in Coatesville, IN. A small \ncommunity of around 600 people, Coatesville is the home of the Magic \nCircle Corp.--a company employing around 30 people from Coatesville and \nFilmore, a small town next door.\n  Magic Circle is a small business that produces riding lawn mowers. \nThe engine of these mowers is manufactured to automatically shut off \nwhen a person gets up from the mower seat. Unfortunately, in a cemetery \nin a nearby State, someone decided to tape down the seat so that the \nmower continued to run when that person left it unattended on a \nhillside. The mower rolled forward and injured their foot.\n  That person, the one who taped down the seat and left the mower\n   unattended on the side of a hill, sued Magic Circle for $7 million. \nThere was no alteration or misuse defense in the State in which the \nincident occurred. The amount of damages requested exceeded the total \nof all Magic Circle profits and assets. In the end, they were forced to \npay $10,000 in attorney fees and its insurance company paid out $35,000 \nto the claimant.\n\n  There is an interesting footnote to this case. Officials of a foreign \ngovernment later contacted the owners of Magic Circle to see if they \nwould be interested in relocating in that country. One of the selling \npoints of their presentation was the country's product liability laws.\n  There are those who argue that the threat of large punitive damages \nis what makes America's products safe. This argument is fundamentally \nflawed. What makes American products the best in the world is not a \nlottery-style product liability legal system. The American consumer \noperating in a free market, who demands quality and excellence, is what \nmakes American manufactured products the most high-quality products in \nthe world today. However, the impact of our current product liability \nsystem is beginning to take its toll. If we do not take action now, we \nwill be in danger of losing our competitive edge.\n  Even the most adamant defenders of our current system certainly \ncannot say that it is expedient. A GAO report shows that product \nliability cases take an average of 2\\1/2\\ years to move from filing to \nverdict. One case cited took nearly 10 years to move through the \njudicial process.\n  The cynical result of these delays is that both parties are \nultimately forced to negotiate compromises because they are overwhelmed \nwith legal costs. These compromises often have little to do with guilt \nor innocence and much to do with predatory lawyers and a bizarre \npatchwork of legal standards and procedures.\n  Mr. President, I am an attorney. Many of my distinguished colleagues \nare attorneys. I am not here to attack lawyers. However, in the legal \nindustry, as in any industry, there are those who lack scruples. There \nare those who will pursue personal financial interests above ethical \nconsiderations. In civil liability cases, lawyer's fees account for 61 \npercent of funds expended on product liability claims. These expenses \ninclude both defendant and plaintiff costs. The net effect of this \nincredible statistic is that realistic accessibility to the legal \nsystem and legal defense is a mere myth in most situations.\n  Mr. President, clearly there is a need for fundamental reform to the \nproduct liability legal system. We have debated this issue since I came \nto Washington.\n  Fundamental product liability reform offers the hope of removing one \nof America's most destructive obstacles to job growth. When frivolous \nsuits are traded, when weak cases are brought, when litigation \nexplodes, our economy is crippled. New technology never comes to \nmarket. Medical costs increase. The doors to factories close. Insurance \ncosts increase. American products are unable to compete around the \nworld. Perhaps most sorrily, a legal system that was once the envy of \nthe world, has been twisted and distorted to a point where the very \nprinciples on which it was originally constructed cannot even be \nrecognized. We must turn this tide.\n  A Rand Corp. study found that most of the money awarded in injury \ncases is taken by the legal process itself. Less than half actually \ngets through to victims. According to a GAO study, 50 percent or more \nof payments made by defendants in a product liability trial goes to \nlawyers. Victims get less than 50 percent. This same report discovered \nthat when a case is appealed, defense costs can actually double.\n  Estimates vary, but one professor at the University of Virginia has \nestimated that when all the costs are finally counted, a mere 15 \npercent of injury litigation awards go to a victim.\n  Innocent victims must find relief and the help they deserve--and this \nbill preserves that obligation. But a runaway legal system must not be \nallowed to make victims of us all.\n  The current state of product liability law does not work for victims, \nit does not work for manufacturers, for consumers, for America.\n  Like so many of the reforms that we have already passed and stand to \ntake action on, product liability reform is long overdue and at a \ncritical stage. For the sake of our workers, for our economy, and for \nthe victims trapped in a legal morass, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, by consent of all parties, I ask for \naction on the Gorton-Rockefeller-Dole amendment.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 709, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 709, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 709), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n   [[Page S6322]] The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for the next 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dole pertaining to the introduction of S. 770 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer the amendment I have in my hand which the \nDemocrats have also seen and it be in order notwithstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXII. This is the so-called additur fix amendment \nrequested by the White House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hollings, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, during the course of debate in discussing \nthe breadth of the products liability bill, I mentioned that a nuclear \npower plant or a component part thereof could be included within the \npurview of the products liability bill. I also stated that maybe the \nbill might not cover a nuclear power plant or a component part thereof.\n  I, in effect, raise two issues: One being the issue of pain and \nsuffering, and the other being the statute of repose. In regard to \nthese issues, I mention the Chernobyl melt-down.\n  Since that time, my office has been contacted by reliable and \ninformed individuals who feel that I misspoke on this issue.\n  First, they say the difference between design and operation of the \nUnited States and Soviet plants make a Chernobyl-style accident \nvirtually impossible.\n  Second, they state that the bill would not in any way prohibit \ncompensation for injured parties in the event of a nuclear accident \nregardless of the time of the manufacture of the plant or components. \nThey particularly point out that Congress has provided a sure and \ncertain recovery system for any member of the public injured as a \nresult of a nuclear power plant accident--the Price-Anderson Act--and, \nfurther, that Congress in 1988 increased the amount of funds available \nfor claims to more than $6.8 billion and pledged to review the \nsituation in the case of an accident where more funds were needed to \ncompensate the injured. The nuclear power industry, I am told, has \nwillingly agreed to be assessed up to $63 million against each licensed \nreactor in order to pay damage claims. The nuclear power industry has \nmet this obligation to provide a clear and reliable source of liability \ncompensation when it is justified.\n  While I have not researched this issue completely, I do find that \nfollowing the case of Klick v. Metropolitan Edison Co. (1986, CA3 Pa) \n784 F2d 490, which limited certain damages to an ``extraordinary \nnuclear occurrence,'' Congress did amend the Price-Anderson Act to \ninclude a ``nuclear incident.''\n  In the exclusion clause of the products liability bill there is a \nstatement to the effect that the bill does not supersede any Federal \nlaw.\n  I have great confidence in the knowledge and reliability of the \nindividuals who have brought this to my attention, and I would like to \nput the record straight. I will continue to research this matter; and \nif there is anything different from what I have been told, I will make \nit known to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 768 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I have a Senate resolution which has been \ncleared with both leaders, and they are both cosponsors. I have the \nclearance from them to take up the resolution and proceed with its \nimmediate consideration. I therefore send a Senate resolution to the \ndesk and I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill read the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 118) concerning United States-Japan \n     Trade Relations.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this resolution is being jointly cosponsored \nby Senators Dole, Daschle, Baucus, Reid, Ashcroft, Warner, Levin, \nHollings, Pressler, Dorgan, Brown, and Sarbanes.\n  Mr. President, the long and difficult negotiations between the United \nStates and Japan over United States access to the Japanese automotive \nmarket collapsed last Friday, May 5, 1995, in Whistler, Canada. Japan \nsimply cannot kick the habit of a closed automotive market, that is the \nantithesis of free trade. It is not clear as to whether the Japanese \nwill return to the negotiating table with a changed position, or \nwhether Japan's automakers will themselves announce an agreement with \nspecific measures of progress to allow American products to compete \nfairly there. Let us hope that they do break the impasse, but this \ndisappointing result of strenuous, long-term efforts by the United \nStates to get fair access to this lucrative market brings us to a \nwatershed in our trading relations with Japan. This blow cannot help \nour overall relationship with a nation that we have worked with for \ndecades to promote our mutual goals of security, stability, and peace \nin the Pacific.\n  My distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, \nstated on this floor this past Wednesday that the nature of the \ndifficult problem in getting fair access to Japan's market. Japan rigs \nher market against us, despite economic pressures to be more open. \nDespite the recent increase in the value of the yen, which would make \nUnited States products more competitive in Japan, Japan keeps her \nmarket closed to cheaper imports and overprices goods offered to the \nJapanese consumer. Increased savings which should be passed on to \nJapanese consumers, resulting from the increased strength of the yen \nvis-a-vis other currencies are never passed on to the Japanese \nconsumer. The increased profits which are accumulated by Japanese \nproducers are used to subsidize exports, keeping prices for those same \ngoods artificially low here in the United States, making Japan \nartificially \n [[Page S6323]]  more competitive. It is a controlled pricing \nsituation, not based on free market principles. The devastating result \nof these practices in the automotive industry, for both new cars and \nparts, has been an unacceptably high and persistent trade deficit with \nJapan.\n  The result in 1995 was a ballooning record trade deficit with Japan \nof $66 billion, up 10 percent over 1994, of which $37 billion, or 56 \npercent of the total is attributable to cars and auto parts. The \nautomotive trade deficit with Japan constituted some 22 percent of our \nentire trade deficit with the world. American manufacturers cannot get \nJapanese distributors to put American cars in their showrooms. Overall, \nwhile Japanese automakers hold some 22.5 percent of the American \nmarket, the share of the Japanese market held by the Big Three United \nStates automakers is less than 1 percent. As for parts, it is extremely \ndifficult for United States parts, which are highly competitive from \nboth a price and value standpoint, to break into the ``Karetsu'' system \nof interrelationships between Japanese car manufacturers, suppliers and \ndealers. Despite the fact that United States government studies show \nthat Japanese aftermarket repair parts cost, on average, some 340 \npercent higher than comparable United States parts, the Japanese \nconsumer is essentially denied the ability to buy those American parts. \nThe result is that Japanese vehicle manufacturers control about 80 \npercent of the parts market, as compared to a wide-open American market \nin which independent replacement parts producers account for some 80 \npercent of the United States market. So, our market is open, Japan's is \nclosed.\n  These important economic realities are well known to both governments \nand industry on both sides of the Pacific. The impact on our domestic \nauto industry is crucial. Every $1\n billion of U.S. exports means some 17,000 jobs. The health of our \naluminum, glass, steel, rubber, electronics, and many other industries \nis tied to the auto sector. It is our largest manufacturing industry, \nwith some 700,000 people employed directly by the automakers, and \nanother 2.3 million employed in the parts industry supplying the \nautomakers.\n\n  There is extensive support across the board from industry and labor \norganizations for the current negotiations. They have been grinding on \nfor some 18 months before the stinging Japanese rebuff on Friday in \nCanada. Last October 1994, our Trade Representative opened an \ninvestigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 of the unfair \npractices in the aftermarket parts market, which constitutes about a \nthird of the automotive deficit with Japan. The unwillingness of Japan \nto address this unfair automotive trade balance demands a strong \nadministration response and equally strong supportive actions by this \nbody and American industry, both business and labor. President Clinton \nand our Trade Representative, Ambassador Kantor, have made it clear \nthat the end of long, long American tolerance and give has now been \nreached on this issue. On Friday, Ambassador Kantor indicated that the \n``government of Japan has refused to address our most fundamental \nconcerns in all areas'' of automotive trade, and that ``discrimination \nagainst foreign manufacturers of auto and auto parts continues.'' The \nPresident indicated on the same day that the United States is \n``committed to taking strong action'' regarding Japanese imports into \nthe United States in the absence of an agreement.\n  Pursuant to the 301 case, trade sanctions, meaning tariff retaliation \nagainst a variety of Japanese goods imported into the United States, \nare now in order. Such retaliation has been openly discussed regarding \nthese negotiations for months, and so the Japanese are saying, either \n``we do not believe you will do it,'' or ``we do not care,'' or, \nlately, that ``you cannot impose sanctions under the 301 law \nbilaterally on Japan because it is illegal under the newly created \nWorld Trade Organization rules.''\n  Mr. President, the stakes of these automotive negotiations and U.S. \nactions under 301 are very high. The auto trade is very lucrative, and \nthus there is a major financial stake. But there is more at stake than \nmoney here. At issue is whether nontariff barriers, discriminatory \ntreatment by foreign economic interests, aided by a maze of regulatory, \nbureaucratic obstacles to open trade, will dominate large sectors of \ninternational trade. As opposed to an open United States market, our \nmajor Asian trading partners practice wide discriminatory treatment \nagainst our goods. China and Korea appear to be taking a cue from \nJapanese behavior and the apparent success of these unfair practices. \nOther sectors will continue to follow suit, such as the highly \nexplosive and rich trade in telecommunications, where we are \nexperiencing similar problems.\n  The inability of our two nations to resolve our differences on trade \nin a way which demonstrates a real commitment to fairness by Japan will \ninevitably corrode our overall relationship. It is unrealistic to \nexpect to insulate the costly effects to the U.S. economy, to jobs, and \nthe health of so many of our important industries from the total \nrelationship. Our economic health is critical to our national security \nand to our staying power as the key deployed military power in the \nPacific. It all hangs together. The fabric of our economic health and \nJapan's national security is a seamless web, and a strong United States \nauto industry is an important strand in that web. I hope the Japanese \nwill come to understand that this is all interrelated.\n  The Japanese have threatened to bring a case against United States \nimposition of sanctions under section 301 before the World Trade \nOrganization, in the hope the WTO would rule against the United States \nand declare the imposition of sanctions a violation of WTO rules. I am \ngratified that Ambassador Kantor has said he would welcome such a \nchallenge, because, according to his comments in the New York Times of \nMay 7, 1995, ``it would give us an opportunity to make clear to the \nworld the full range of Japan's discriminatory practices'' in the \nautomotive market. I hope Japan does bring the case to the WTO. I am \nfully confident that our Trade Representative would conduct a vigorous \ndefense of United States actions, and turn the tables against the \nJapanese, whose trade sanctuary regime is anathema to the goal of an \nopen world trading system. We should insist on a complete review of \nJapan's practices. Either we are heading toward a more open world \nsystem or we are not. This would be a litmus test of the actions and \nposture of the WTO. It would be a key test of the future of the WTO. I \ncannot conceive of continued U.S. commitment to an organization that \nwould reward blatant discrimination and the perpetuation of sanctuary \nbehavior. Thus, the case would be a welcome, early test of what kind of \nworld organization we have created.\n  Mr. President, I am offering this resolution as a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that puts the Senate on record as supporting the President's \nactions. First, it expresses the Senate's regret that negotiations \nbetween the United States and Japan for sharp reductions in the trade \nimbalances in automotive sales and parts, through elimination of \nrestrictive Japanese market-closing practices and regulations have \ncollapsed. Second, it states, if negotiations under section 301 of the \nTrade Act of 1974 fail to open the Japanese auto parts market, the \nUnited States Senate strongly supports the decision by the President to \nimpose sanctions on Japanese products in accordance with section 301.\n  There is still opportunity for Japan to return to the negotiating \ntable and satisfy the legitimate case of the United States that \nimmediate action to open Japan's market is urgently needed. I hope the \nJapanese see the light before it is too late. There are press reports \nthat the Japanese think we may shrink from the imposition of sanctions. \nI hope that we here in the Senate will send a strong message of support \nfor the President on this matter, and help disabuse the Japanese of \nthat view.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I am a cosponsor of the resolution. I \nthank my distinguished colleague from West Virginia for adding me as a \ncosponsor of the resolution. I think it is very timely \n [[Page S6324]]  and very important. I hope my colleagues will strongly \nsupport the efforts of Senator Byrd in this area.\n  This resolution is not an example of Japan-bashing. The United States \nhas now negotiated in good faith for 2 years in this administration. \nPrevious administrations tried to pry open the Japanese auto market \nthrough serious negotiation. The results have been disappointing, at \nbest.\n  Congress has passed market-opening trade laws because U.S. \nnegotiators have needed effective tools. They are there to be used, if \nnegotiations fail. They are not empty threats.\n  Section 301 is not a threat, it is an effective tool. I happen to \nbelieve Ambassador Kantor has wielded this tool responsibly.\n  That is why, if a negotiated solution cannot be found, I support the \nuse of section 301 to impose appropriate sanctions.\n  Madam President, this would be strong medicine. Some people might not \nlike it. Some people might think it disruptive.\n  But there has always been bipartisan agreement that the United States \nmust pursue more open markets. We have always provided leadership on \nthis issue, and we will continue to do so.\n  There comes a time in every trade negotiation, when all other means \nhave been exhausted, to take strong, decisive action. That time may \nhave come, Madam President, if a last minute solution cannot be found. \nI urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate and stand up \nfor American commercial interests abroad.\n  In my view, if nothing else, a strong vote on this resolution will \nsend an urgent message to the negotiators, more particularly the \nJapanese negotiators, that we are serious, we mean business, we stand \nbehind the administration and their efforts to break the logjam.\n  So I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his cosponsorship and for his fine statement. I believe we would \nlike to have the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I rise to explain my opposition to this \nresolution. Although this resolution calls attention to a serious \nproblem, the persistence of Japanese trade barriers, it does not \nidentify a workable solution.\n  Japanese trade barriers need to come down. They need to come down \nbecause they contribute to America's bilateral trade deficit with \nJapan. Studies cited by the administration have found that removing \nevery single Japanese barrier would reduce the bilateral merchandise \ntrade deficit by around 20 percent.\n  Note, however, that Japanese trade barriers do not themselves account \nfor America's global trade deficit, only its composition. As the \nadministration itself admits in the President's 1994 annual report on \nthe Trade Agreements Program:\n\n       The United States still suffers from relatively low savings \n     at a time when domestic investment is growing rapidly. The \n     shortfall between domestic saving and investment was larger \n     in 1994 and was filled by a net increase in foreign capital \n     inflows. The United States thus had a large surplus on its \n     international capital account and a large offsetting deficit \n     on its trade or current account.\n\n  In plain English, our domestic budget deficit crowds out savings and \nrequires us to import capital. This leads to our global trade deficit.\n  Japanese trade barriers also need to come down because they reduce \nthe Japanese people's quality of life and impede the process of \ndemocratization in Japan. Japan's democratization is also in our \ninterest; it is the only way we will have a stable, democratic, \nprosperous Japanese partner in our efforts to secure a stable \ninternational environment.\n  So, on this point, we agree, Japan's trade barriers must come down.\n  However, the administration's strategy, which this resolution \nsupports, is the wrong way to do this. Declaring unilateral trade war \non Japan--and, make no mistake, that is what we are talking about--\nwould once again leave the United States isolated in the world. \nEuropeans, Latin Americans, and Asians, fearing similar treatment from \nus in the future, would line up with Japan.\n  Currency markets will react badly. If you think a rate of 80 yen to \nthe dollar is disadvantageous to this country, as I do, imagine a rate \nof 75 or even 70. I am not alarmist when I say that this could threaten \nthe position of the dollar as the international reserve currency. \nIndeed, Japan is already talking of switching its reserves out of \ndollars and into deutschmarks.\n  This dispute is likely to end in the fledgling World Trade \nOrganization. No matter what happened there, support would be weakened. \nEither the United States would lose, causing a tidal wave of calls to \nleave the World Trade Organization, or Japan would lose, leading to \nreduced Japanese support for the international trading system. Either \nway, we all lose.\n  Finally, by strengthening the power of the bureaucrats, who are \nstanding up to the Americans, a trade war would cut across the forces \nof transparency, democratization, and accountable electoral politics \nwhich are the ultimate answer to our trade imbalance.\n  I have spoken many times of a better way to reduce Japan's trade \nbarriers, one that works with the forces shaping Japan, does not cut \nacross our interests in the new World Trade Organization, and \ndepoliticizes the trade relationship. To repeat, I believe we can best \naddress Japan's trade barriers by establishing a dispute resolution \nmechanism, similar to the ones in the United States-Japan and United \nStates-Canada free trade agreements, to impartially adjudicate United \nStates-Japan trade disputes.\n  Madam President, it is ironic that we are voting on this resolution. \nIn many ways, it is like judo. What appears strength is actually \nrevealed as weakness.\n  I, for one, believe in strength. This is why I believe we must take a \nstrategic, long-term approach to the United States-Japan trade \nrelationship. A strong America will negotiate and adjudicate, as I have \ndescribed. A weak America will only, impotently, bash.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the resolution? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the resolution.

Res. 118) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to\n.\n[[Page S6325]]\n\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 118\n\n       Whereas, the United States and Japan have a long and \n     important relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Pacific region;\n       Whereas, tension exists in an otherwise normal and friendly \n     relationship between the United States and Japan because of \n     persistent and large trade deficits which are the result of \n     practices and regulations which have substantially blocked \n     legitimate access of American automotive products to the \n     Japanese market;\n       Whereas, the current account trade deficit with Japan in \n     1994 reached an historic high level of $66 billion, of which \n     $37 billion, or 56 percent, is attributed to imbalances in \n     the automotive sector, and of which $12.8 billion is \n     attributable to auto parts flows:\n       Whereas, in July, 1993, the Administration reached a broad \n     accord with the Government of Japan, which established \n     automotive trade as one of 5 priority areas for negotiations, \n     to seek market-opening arrangements based on objective \n     criteria and which would result in objective progress;\n       Whereas, a healthy American automobile industry is of \n     central importance to the American economy, and to the \n     capability of the United States to fulfill its commitments to \n     remain as an engaged, deployed, Pacific power;\n       Whereas, after 18 months of negotiations with the Japanese, \n     beginning in September 1993, the U.S. Trade Representative \n     concluded that no progress had been achieved, leaving the \n     auto parts market in Japan ``virtually closed'';\n       Whereas, in October, 1994, the United States initiated an \n     investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into \n     the Japanese auto parts market, which could result in the \n     imposition of trade sanctions on a variety of Japanese \n     imports into the United States unless measurable progress is \n     made in penetrating the Japanese auto parts market;\n       Whereas, the latest round of U.S.-Japan negotiations on \n     automotive trade, in Whistler, Canada, collapsed in failure \n     on May 5, 1995, and the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador \n     Kantor, stated the ``government of Japan has refused to \n     address our most fundamental concerns in all areas'' of \n     automotive trade, and that ``discrimination against foreign \n     manufacturers of autos and auto parts continues.''\n       Whereas, President Clinton stated, on May 5, 1995, that the \n     U.S. is ``committed to taking strong action'' regarding \n     Japanese imports into the U.S. if no agreement is reached. \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) The Senate regrets that negotiations between the United \n     States and Japan for sharp reductions in the trade imbalances \n     in automotive sales and parts, through elimination of \n     restrictive Japanese market-closing practices and \n     regulations, have collapsed;\n       (2) If negotiations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 fail to open the Japanese auto parts market, the United \n     States Senate strongly supports the decision by the President \n     to impose sanctions on Japanese products in accordance with \n     Section 301.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nresolution was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 693 to Amendment No. 690\n\n(Purpose: To provide that a defendant may be liable for certain damages \n  if the alleged harm to a claimant is death and certain damages are \n         provided for under State law, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk--No. \n693, I believe it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and Mr. \n     Heflin, proposes an amendment numbered 693 to amendment No. \n     690.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS RELATING TO DEATH.\n\n       In any civil action in which the alleged harm to the \n     claimant is death and, as of the effective date of this Act, \n     the applicable State law provides, or has been construed to \n     provide, for damages only punitive in nature, a defendant may \n     be liable for any such damages without regard to this \n     section, but only during such time as the State law so \n     provides.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I offer today on behalf of myself and \nthe senior Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin] an amendment to ensure \nthat individuals guilty of wrongful deaths are not provided unfair and \nunwarranted protection by the product liability reform legislation we \nare considering today.\n  This amendment we are offering was accepted last week by both sides \nbut was excluded from the Gorton-Rockefeller-Dole amendment today. I \nbelieve that all of my colleagues will support this measure once they \ntake time to examine its merits. It is unique to the State of Alabama. \nMy State of Alabama has a wrongful death statute, the damages of which \nare construed as only punitive in nature--not compensatory but only \npunitive in nature. Under the product liability bill that we are \nconsidering today, along with some of the proposed amendments to this \nbill, people who have committed or are guilty of a wrongful death in my \nState of Alabama, the damages available will be severely limited. While \nthe bill here allows for additur, the additur procedures in this \nlegislation are cumbersome at best and possibly unworkable.\n  Madam President, in 1852, I believe it was, the Alabama Legislature \npassed what is known as the Alabama Homicide Act. This act permits a \npersonal representative to recover damages for a death caused by a \nwrongful act, omission, or negligence. For the past 140 years, the \nAlabama Supreme Court has interpreted this statute as imposing punitive \ndamages for any conduct which causes death.\n  Alabama believes that all people have equal worth in our society so \nthe financial position of a person is not used as a measure of damages \nin wrongful death cases in Alabama as it possibly is in other States. \nThe entire focus of Alabama's wrongful death civil action is on the \ncause of death.\n  The amendment I am offering today on behalf of myself and Senator \nHeflin will provide that in a civil action where the alleged harm to \nthe claimant is death and the applicable State law only allows for \npunitive damages, the punitive damages provision of this bill will not \napply. In other words, this amendment will only apply to my State of \nAlabama.\n  Madam President, I believe there are legitimate reasons to exclude \nfrom the coverage of this bill actions such as those brought under \nAlabama's wrongful death statute. Cases of wrongful death are often \nsome of the most legitimate instances where punitive damages should be \nawarded.\n  Everyone in this body knows that I have great reservation about this \nlegislation now before us. However, I do believe the addition of this \namendment will help ensure that this bill will not unduly, not unduly, \nMadam President, penalize the citizens of my State.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I join with the distinguished Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nShelby] in his amendment.\n  Of all of the 50 States, Alabama has a different method pertaining to \nthe recovery of damages when a death occurs as a result of culpable \naction, regardless of whether it be simple negligence, gross \nnegligence, willful conduct, intentional conduct, wanton conduct, any \ntype of conduct that allows for the recovery. It allows under the \ninterpretation given for this statute that punitive damages only can be \nrecovered. It is different from other States where most of the other \nStates allow a plaintiff, the executor or the administrator or the \nparent of the child, if deceased, to be able to introduce, for example, \nhospital bills.\n  A person may have died after 6 months in a hospital, and under \nhospital bills of today they can accumulate to over $150,000. Burial \nexpenses in most States can be introduced into evidence and can be an \nelement of compensatory damages. Loss of earning capacity, noneconomic \ndamages, pain and suffering in some instances in some States can be \nintroduced as an element \n [[Page S6326]]  of damages, and so on down the list of all of the \ntypes of damages.\n  But in Alabama you are not allowed to introduce any of that. You \nattempt to introduce a hospital bill, and a doctor's bill, and whether \nthey were $150,000 or whether, on the other hand, they amounted to $500 \nor $25, you cannot introduce that in evidence as an element of damages \nunder the Alabama wrongful death statute as has been interpreted, and \nthe charge to the jury is that it is a matter of punishment for the \nwrongdoer, and therefore it is limited to that.\n  Over the years, the companies, corporate America, in Alabama, \ninsurance companies, defense counsel who represent them, have fought to \nmaintain this, and over the years the plaintiffs' lawyers have come to \nlive with it, and therefore it is accepted as being the measure of \ndamages.\n  However, under the provisions that we have here under this bill in \nproduct liability cases the provisions pertaining to this would apply. \nAnd under the DeWine amendment, you would be limited in a situation \nwith regard to that to almost zero, where there would be nothing that \ncould be recovered, and it would limit it, restrict it substantially.\n  So I support the Shelby amendment in this regard. This is a situation \nthat applies only to Alabama. The language of this bill is basically \nthe same language that was considered in the 101st Congress and in the \n102d Congress. They came out of the Commerce Committee. We had pointed \nthis defect out, and the drafters of the bill, including people who had \nbeen working on product liability, put a provision in those bills that \nwould allow for the Alabama law to prevail. We offered it as an \namendment in regard to the Gorton and Rockefeller underlying \nsubstitute, and it was accepted after they made some changes in the \nlanguage. Senator Shelby and I are agreeable to any changes in the \nlanguage of the Shelby amendment that they might want to propose \nprovided it allows for recovery--it is limited strictly to the wrongful \ndeath cases, and therefore we are amenable to any change that they \nmight make as long as it does not abolish, or greatly minimize the \nrecovery under the Alabama statute.\n  So we feel that this is something which should be adopted. Otherwise, \nit is singling out Alabama, and Alabama has a very unique, they argue, \nuniformity, and the preemption matters ought to be uniform among all of \nthe 50 States. But what it means is that in the preemption which does \nbring about some uniformity as it would apply to the preempted \nsections, that it will not apply to Alabama. And it is a very \ndiscriminatory act in regard to Alabama. I would think that it has, \nfrom a Federal constitutional basis, some imperfections in regard to \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the Shelby-Heflin \namendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 693, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend the \namendment that I have filed that is the subject of debate.\n  I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object. That is a modification \nto the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator is correct. It just clarifies this amendment. \nI mention in the amendment section 107. That is all it does.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Washington and I had a \ndiscussion about another amendment. I am sitting around making sure \nthat unanimous consent is not given for that amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. This is not that amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 693), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS RELATING TO DEATH.\n\n       In any civil action in which the alleged harm to the \n     claimant is death and, as of the effective date of this Act, \n     the applicable State law provides, or has been construed to \n     provide, for damages only punitive in nature, a defendant may \n     be liable for any such damages without regard to section 107, \n     but only during such time as the State law so provides.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I assume section 107, I ask Senator Gorton, is the \nsection dealing with punitive damages.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. So it is limited to that. But does that include the \nDeWine amendment and language in regard to small business, and the \nindividual relative to the $500,000?\n  Mr. GORTON. It does. That is in section 107, as well.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. That is all included in section 107, all punitive \ndamages?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is.\n  I simply pointed out to the distinguished junior Senator from Alabama \nthat the way the amendment was set up it did not have any reference to \nany section, but it was about punitive damages. His correction is to \nsee to it that it applies to the punitive damages section. But that is \nthe section that has all the punitive damages in it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I regret that I have to oppose the \namendment sponsored by the two Senators from Alabama. In some respects, \nI am sorry that I have to do so, but I believe that I have good and \nsufficient reasons for doing so.\n  First, the senior Senator from Alabama said that this was included in \nprevious product liability bills, which is certainly true. But those \nprevious product liability bills did not have rules like this relating \nto punitive damages.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Did not have what? I did not understand the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. There were no DeWine amendments and there were no Snowe \namendments in previous bills.\n  Second, this is, Mr. President, to be candid, a very peculiar rule in \nthe State of Alabama where negligence is accounted to be the subject of \npunitive damages. It is not the rule in any other State in the Union.\n  Nothing in this bill, without this amendment, prevents Alabama from \nproviding any kind of damages for wrongful death that it wishes to, \neither through its legislature or through its court interpretations. So \nAlabama is not going to be penalized any more than any other State by \nthis bill unless Alabama wants to be, and willfully refuses to conform \nits laws to those of other States.\n  But, more significant than that, Mr. President, are two other \nfeatures about this amendment. The first, one of the most carefully \nworked out elements in this entire bill, the most carefully worked out \nelement in this bill, is the triple set of requirements we have with \nrespect to punitive damages, one of which, in the ultimate analysis, \nallows judges to impose unlimited punitive damages when they find the \nconduct of the defendant to have been sufficiently egregious. The \nsecond is the Snowe amendment which, in most cases, will limit punitive \ndamages to twice the total amount of all compensatory damages. And the \nthird, Mr. President, is the fact that this body, I think, with a wide \nmajority, determined that we were not going to allow punitive damages \nin a single case simply to destroy small businesses or individuals of \nrelatively modest assets, with total assets of less than $500,000.\n  Now, if this amendment passes, that will be the rule in 49 States--in \n49 States, Mr. President. It will not be the rule in Alabama. In \nAlabama, there will not be any Snowe limitation in general cases, and \nthere will not be any protection for small businesses or for \nindividuals with net assets of less than half a million dollars.\n  Mr. President, this is only 1 State out of 50, but Alabama is the \nsingle most notorious State in the United States of America related to \nits size for punitive damage awards. It is a cottage industry in that \nState to award very, very large, huge punitive damages awards against, \ngenerally speaking but not necessarily limited to, out-of-State \ncorporations.\n  So what we are saying is that the set of rules that we have adopted, \nin most of these cases by very large majorities in this body, will \napply in every State except the State that comes first in the alphabet, \nAlabama, and none of the \n [[Page S6327]]  limitations will apply in the State of Alabama. Why? \nBecause it has a peculiar law which can be changed by one word by its \nState legislature or, for that matter, by its supreme court. And we are \ngoing to do this, for all practical purposes, permanently.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a profound change has taken place in this \nbody since the time this amendment was first proposed in this debate. \nWhen it was first proposed in this debate, the absolute maximum for \npunitive damages was the Snowe amendment--twice compensatory damages--\nwhich, as the two Senators from Alabama pointed out, under this \npeculiar Alabama law, would be zero. And, of course, twice zero is \nzero. So that is no longer the case.\n  So the bill, the way it exists now, the way it has been amended now, \nallows the judge in any case on certain findings to impose punitive \ndamages in unlimited amounts. That, in the bill as it exists now, \nwithout this amendment, of course, applies in Alabama, and will allow \nthose Alabama judges to impose whatever they wish, if they meet the \nstandards for punitive damages, themselves. So at that level, at least, \nthis proposal is entirely unnecessary in a way that was not the case or \nnot the argument just a few days ago in this bill.\n  So even if Alabama is perverse enough to keep its law in its present \npeculiar fashion, this will not mean that there cannot not be any \nrecovery in wrongful death cases. But if it is passed, we set one rule \nfor Alabama in which everything is the sky is the limit in a State \nwhere the sky is higher already than it is in any other State in the \nNation, and a quite different rule for 49 other States.\n  Mr. President, that is absolutely unfair; that is profoundly unfair \nthat this State, because of one peculiar rule, should be exempted from \nall of the rules which the great majority of Members here have said are \nappropriately applied to all of the States.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I would just like to say again, I believe it was in 1852, the Alabama \nSupreme Court decreed that there would be, in a wrongful death action, \npunitive damages only, and that has worked in my State since 1852. That \nis one reason I oppose all of this legislation.\n  Every State has different problems. Alabama, my State, is unique as \nfar as measuring the wrongful death damages. They do it by punitive \ndamages. It is not anything new. It goes back way over 100 years. But \nit has worked. It has worked for my State. This would only deal in \nwrongful death cases, nothing else. All we are asking the Senate to do \nis to preserve what we have and what we have had for over 100 years.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am rather surprised to hear my good \nfriend from Washington, who has long been an advocate of federalism, \ncome forward with language from the screaming Federal Eagle over States \nsaying: ``Alabama, you change your law or else you don't get even \npeanuts.''\n  In other words, this is federalism in reverse, the big Federal \nGovernment that we have heard so much about telling the Alabama \nLegislature and the Alabama courts, ``You change your law.'' Now you \nhave preemption that takes place. This is a mandate as to whether a \nclaimant is going to recover or not.\n  I am rather surprised that we would hear that language coming from \nsuch a strong supporter of the concept of federalism. If the Federal \nGovernment is going to tell a State you do this or not, we usually give \nthem a carrot or some type of incentive. But my colleague's position \nis, to me, an example of brute force--``you change your law or you're \nnot going to be able to protect your people.''\n  Then we have the additur provision pertaining to the judge. Clearly, \nthat is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of the United States, in \nthe case of Dimick versus Schiedt, has already ruled on that issue. In \npractice what will occur is where an additur is made by the judge but \nthe defendant does not want to accept the new amount, the defendant or \ndefendants will request a new trial. However, that is what appeals are \nfor--new trials.\n  So, automatically a defendant will ask for a new trial if he does not \nlike what the judge added to the judgment. If the judge, therefore, \nfeels that the punitive damage award was inadequate, because the \ndefendant's conduct was extremely egregious and the plaintiff's \ninjuries were great, the judge could award additional punitive damages.\n  In the normal course of events, when the judge adds that to the \ndamage award, a defendant takes an appeal to reverse it where he could \nget a new trial. But, the punitive damages provisions of this bill give \ndefendants the automatic opportunity to request a new trial.\n  Well, what defendant is going to not take advantage of it? Every \ndefendant is going to say, ``Give me a new trial. I can keep my money, \ndraw interest on my money in the meantime, and delay a new trial for 2 \nyears.'' Therefore, if the overall award was $300,000, and if the judge \nadded to it above the $250,000 cap that is in this bill, the defendant \ntakes its $300,000 and draws interest or makes investments with it.\n  Defendants are going to follow that course of action with the idea \nalso that they have to go back to a new trial which means that every \nissue will have to be litigated all over again. There is not much to \nlose in following this course of action. So automatically you are going \nto find that every defendant is going to demand a new trial. What \nhappens? A defendant knows he is not going to get any more than what \nwas originally put in the judgment, the amount he put there. Then it \ncomes back to the judge again and the judge says, ``Well, I believe \nthat that conduct was so egregious and find this is a terrible case and \nthat the defendant ought to be punished, and therefore, I will again \nmake an additur.''\n  What does the defendant say? ``Well, I have under this bill \nautomatically a right to a new trial, and I demand a new trial.'' So \nthe defendant delays it 2 more years, draws his interest, and makes his \ninvestments in the meantime.\n  Then he goes back and retries it and gets the same judgment. Then the \ndefendant says, ``All right, I'm going to take advantage of my \nopportunity for a new trial'' and receives a new trial. So the case is \ntried a third time and, finally, the plaintiff says, ``It doesn't make \nany difference what the judge adds, there is no way in the world that I \ncan collect it, and I just have to give in, there is nothing I can \ndo.'' The judge and the jury felt that defendant's conduct was \negregious and met the extremely high standards of this bill. However \nthere is no way under this language that a defendant can ever recover \nbecause instead of having the normal event of trying to reverse a case \non appeal and have a new trial, the defendant just has an automatic \nright to a new trial on punitive damages.''\n   When you think about it, the situation is just plain ridiculous. I \nthink Alabama's legislature and its courts have the clear right to \ndetermine that its wrongful death statute is to be punitive in nature \nonly, recognizing the sacredness and value of human life. The concept \nof federalism that every State has its right to choose its laws ought \nto respect that right of my state. But here we have the American \nFederal Government imposing, and intruding, and saying: ``All right, \nyou can't recover for the death of an Alabamian or the death of a \nWashingtonian if you are traveling in Alabama or any other individual \nthat might be there.''\n  What we are asking is, let us allow federalism to prevail, and if the \nState of Alabama wants to, it can continue to recognize the validity of \nits wrongful death statute which is designed to protect its citizens by \nmaking it of a punitive nature only.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, very briefly on the subject. No, I say, \nMr. President, nothing in this law limits the State of Alabama from \nproviding unlimited compensatory damages in the case of wrongful death. \nIt is Alabama that has said that it will not grant compensatory damages \nin the case of wrongful death, and Alabama \n [[Page S6328]]  can change that at any time that it wants. Nothing in \nthis bill puts any limit on compensatory damages awarded by courts in \nthe State of Alabama for wrongful death; absolutely nothing.\n  What this bill does do is to take a modest step toward bringing under \na certain degree of control punitive damages with rules for small \nbusiness, rules for larger organizations and an exception when a judge \nwishes to go above any of the latter limitation. That is all. This \namendment seeks for a single State to be totally exempt from that rule, \ntherefore, in the view of this Senator is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum because \nit is my hope that we are about to reach a unanimous consent agreement \non all of the rest of the amendments that are to be offered and perhaps \na chance to vote on them all and on final passage of this bill the same \ntime tomorrow and serve the convenience of our colleagues.\n And so I will do that in just a moment, though I do not want to limit \nanyone else having a right to say something.\n\n  I do need to say two other things. First, with respect to this \nconstant new trials for large punitive damage awards, the Senator from \nWest Virginia considered that last night, worked with his friends and \nsupporters on his side of the aisle on that subject last night and \nworked with staff on this side. We agreed to take that section or \nsubsection out of the bill. Because of cloture rules, we can only do \nthat by unanimous consent. Opponents of the bill--Senator Hollings--\nhave refused that unanimous consent.\n  I am here publicly to assure all Members that it will not appear in \nany bill coming out of conference, because Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave made that commitment. We will not bring back a conference report \nwith that proposal in it. We wish that we could have the courtesy of \nsuch unanimous-consent agreement. But we cannot, and they are certainly \noperating under the rules. But it is not going to appear in any final \nbill. We can assure them of that.\n  With that, Mr. President, hoping that we will soon be able to reach a \nunanimous-consent agreement about votes, I will suggest--I withhold \nthat.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from \nWashington just made a very, very important point, one which he and I \nhave already made in public at a press conference which we held several \nhours ago, and that is that we are, in spite of the fact that the \nSenator from South Carolina, my esteemed, cherished ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee--who is a very good friend and has been, and his \nwife and my wife for a long, long time--does not wish to give consent \nfor us to be able to do this--I think with the idea being that if he \ndoes not give consent, then the chances that this bill would be less \nattractive to the White House would increase.\n  Senator Gorton and I are trying to make this more attractive to the \nMembers of the Senate, Members of the House, and the White House. But I \nhave also taken the same blood oath that the Senator from Washington \nhas, and that is that we are so committed in terms of the additur \namendment that we will not come back from conference without its being \nin the proper condition, and that, in fact, if it does not come back \nfrom conference in the proper condition, as we said at our press \nconference, we will vote against a motion for cloture.\n  I do not know how it is possible for any two floor managers to put \nanything in stronger terms, or to say anything with greater faith and, \ntherefore, it grieves me very much that we will not be granted \nunanimous consent to do that here when we are being so direct and \nhonest and forthright with our colleagues.\n  There were just timing problems in terms of submitting this, or else \nthe amendment would have been filed and could have been brought up as a \nmatter of the order. Nevertheless, that was not done. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina does have the power to grant us unanimous consent, but \nhe chooses not to do so.\n  Mr. President, I also want to simply indulge my colleagues in a \ncouple of thoughts, to make some comments on the discussion here about \nthe section in the compromise now pending. We are there. It deals with \npunitive damages. No. 1, the whole section is the result of many, many \nmonths of negotiation and discussion on, in fact, how a product \nliability reform bill might best deal with the costs and the problems \nand the erratic nature which we all recognize is at play--punitive \ndamages.\n  I have tried to represent the Clinton administration's discomfort--\nexpressed discomfort--with the idea of imposing a flat cap on punitive \nawards, while accommodating the strong desires of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to include some reform in this bill, to pursue the \nidea that the punishment impleaded in punitive damages should have some \nsense of connection, in fact, to the crime.\n  I also have to say that in my own personal experience, I do not like \nto vote for caps. I am on the Finance Committee, and when medical \nmalpractice was before us last year and there was a vote on a cap on \nnoneconomic damages, I voted against it. I do not like caps. It has \nbeen my own personal purpose in which I have negotiated in good faith \nwith Members of my own party and the other party to find a way to make \nsure that the cap would be uncapped. I think we have done that. The \nSenator from South Carolina knows that. And I say this with respect \nbecause he is within his rights and he is a very skilled legislator and \na very good friend. I repeat that. He understands that we are, in fact, \ntrying to improve the bill in a way which would appeal to virtually all \nMembers on my side of the aisle, including, in fact, in truth, I \nbelieve the Senator from South Carolina himself, because it would be a \nbetter amendment with the judge additur provision refined and nobody \ncould dispute that.\n  It would be better than simply two times compensatory damages with an \nalternate ceiling of $250,000 because one can construe that--although \none can never guess what noneconomic damages will be--one can construe \nthat, in theory, to be a cap. So I have been trying my best in \nnegotiating with both sides to try and get that out and have succeeded. \nI have some sense of accomplishment in that, which is now being put \naside by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make a correction for the record \nregarding the discussions of the constitutionality of the judge additur \nprovision in the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment.\n  The judge additur provision in section 107 (b) of our amendment, as \nit exists now, creates a right to a new trial for defendants if they do \nnot accept the additional punitive awards set by the judge. This \nprovision was inserted to address a perceived constitutionality concern \nwith the judge additur provision--perceived. Senator Gorton and I are \nnow in agreement that this right to a new trial provision is in fact \nunnecessary to meet any constitutionality test.\n  The Associate Attorney General, in several conversations with my \nstaff, has asserted that he believes the judge additur provision in \nSenator Gorton's and my amendment is constitutional on its own--free \nstanding--without the provision creating a right to a new trial for the \ndefendant should the defendant object to an award which results from \nthe judge additur provision.\n  Indeed, the Department of Justice prepared a list of precedents and \nauthorities for judicial determinations of the amount of punitive \ndamages which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAuthorities Which Support the Constitutionality of Requiring Judges To \n                Determine the Amount of Punitive Damages\n                           some of the cases\n\n       Tull versus United States, 481 U.S. 412 (1987), held it did \n     not violate the Seventh Amendment to have a judge determine \n     the amount of a civil penalty under the Clean Water Act. The \n     Supreme Court indicated that ``[n]othing in the Amendment's \n     language suggests that the right to jury trial extends to the \n     remedy phase of a civil trial.'' 481 U.S. 426 n.9. It also \n     reasoned that ``highly discretionary calculations that take \n     into account multiple factors are necessary in order to set \n     civil penalties * * * These are the kind of calculations \n     traditionally performed by judges.'' 481 U.S. at 427.\n       Smith versus Printup, 866 P.2d 985 (Kan. 1993), upheld the \n     constitutionality of Kansas \n      [[Page S6329]]  Stat. Sec. 60-3701, which requires courts to \n     determine the amount of punitive damages. The Kansas Supreme \n     Court reasoned: ``Because a plaintiff does not have a right \n     to punitive damages, the legislature could, without \n     infringing upon a plaintiff's basic constitutional rights, \n     abolish punitive damages. If the legislature may abolish \n     punitive damages, then it also may, without impinging upon \n     the right to trial by jury, accomplish anything short of \n     that, such as requiring the court to determine the amount of \n     punitive damages * * *''\n       Federal statutes. Various existing federal statutes require \n     judicial assessment of punitive damages. See Petroleum \n     Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2805(d)(2); \n     Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681n(2); Patent \n     Act, 35 U.S.C. Sec. 284; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1691e(b). None of these statutes has ever been \n     held unconstitutional See Swofford versus B & W, Inc., 336 \n     F.2d 406 (5th Cir. 1964) (holding that plaintiffs in patent \n     action were not entitled to jury trial on issues of exemplary \n     damages).\n       Courts have also upheld judicial determination of punitive \n     damages in a variety of other contexts. See, e.g., Tingely \n     Systems, Inc versus Norse Systems. Inc., 49 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. \n     1995) (holding that remittitur of jury verict was not \n     reversible error because judge was entiteld to determine \n     punitive damages under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices \n     Act).\n\n\n                        SOME OF THE COMMENTATORS\n\n       Dean Dorsey D. Ellis, Jr., Punitive Damages, Due Process, \n     and the Jury, 40 Ala. L. Rev. 975, 1005 (1989). (``Under a \n     traditional legal analysis, punitive damages are more \n     analogous to fines than to damages. The determination of the \n     appropriate amount of a fine is traditionally treated as a \n     question of law, hence an issue for the judge, and not a \n     question of fact for the jury.

Rev. 263 (1993) (``Some critics have \n     challenged judicial assessment of punitive damages as a \n     violation of a defendant's right to jury trial under the \n     Seventh Amendment * * * This criticism is unlikely to hold up \n     if asserted in court. In the past, defendants in criminal \n     cases have challenged judges' activity in sentencing as a \n     violation of their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.

This list sets the precedents and authorities \nsupporting the constitutionality of requiring judges to determine the \namount of punitive damages. And is therefore valuable information to be \nconsidered in this debate.\n  I rely on the word and the integrity of the Associate Attorney \nGeneral and his staff at the President's Justice Department. They \nbelieve, as I have indicated, that a freestanding judge additur \nprovision as it is written in the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment, and we \nwould like to modify it by striking section 107(b)(3)(C), passes \nconstitutional muster. I have said that several times purposely.\n  In my view, as an author of this legislation, that is sufficient \nauthority to say that a severability amendment regarding additur is \nsuperfluous.\n  To reiterate, relying on the Justice Department's determination that \na judge additur provision is constitutional, I do not believe it is \nnecessary to further amend this provision to sever the judge additur \nrequirements of this bill in an effort to guard against a circumstance \nwhere this provision would be deemed unconstitutional. It will not be \ndeemed unconstitutional for the reasons I have articulated.\n  Mr. President, I just want to take this opportunity to make my \ncolleagues aware that we have, in fact, addressed the concerns raised \nabout constitutionality.\n  The judge additur provision, coupled with the modification that \nstrikes the defendant's right to a new trial, is a constitutional \nprovision. Again, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould like to add additional language which makes this particular \nprovision severable, to make absolutely certain that the \nconstitutionality of this bill will not be tested as a result of this \nprovision.\n  I have assured them, based upon my conversations with the Department \nof Justice and others, that their extra cautious approach is not \nrequired.\n  In concluding, I cannot remember in the 10 years that I have been in \nthe Senate where the two managers of different political persuasions \nhave publicly said that they are so committed to rectifying something \nwhich is of concern to the Senator from South Carolina, to some of my \ncolleagues, and to the White House; that the Senator from Washington \nhas said, ``We will not come back from the conference with these \nprovisions;'' and where the Senator from Washington this morning at a \npublic press conference said that he would vote against the motion to \ninvoke cloture, assuming that the conference report was filibustered. I \nshare exactly that same view.\n  I think that is pretty strong and dealing in good faith. We would \nlike to hope that we can be dealt with in good faith also.\n  Mr. President, I thank the presiding officer. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the manager of the bill, Senator Gorton, yield \nfor a question about a particular section of the bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I would be glad to do so.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator. The bill, at section 106, sets \nout a provision to hold individuals who misuse or alter a product \naccountable for any injury resulting from the misuse or alteration. \nThis provision would allow for the reduction of damages based on such \nmisuse or alteration.\n  This section, at 106(b), also provides that this provision only \nsupersedes State laws that do not already impose such apportioning of \ndamages among responsible parties, including the injured party found to \nhave misused or altered the product, is that not correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But, this apportioning of damages would only occur if \nthe court has found the defendant liable for at least some portion of \nthe plaintiff's injuries. In other words, if, under State law, the \ndefendant has no liability, for example under the ``common knowledge'' \ndoctrine, then this provision would not change that result. Am I \nreading this section correctly?\n  Mr. GORTON. Indeed. Under the ``common knowledge'' doctrine the \ndefendant is not held responsible for injuries to the plaintiff caused \nby the plaintiff's misuse of a product that is commonly known and \nrecognized to be dangerous by ordinary users.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, the Senator shares my understanding that this bill \nwould not overturn the result in, for example, Friar v. Caterpillar, \nInc., (539 So. 2d 509, La. App. 5th Cir., 1988) or Colson v. Allied \nProducts Corp. (640 F.2d 5, 1981)? Those both involved situations in \nwhich the plaintiffs were injured using products that the courts found \npresented a danger of which plaintiffs were aware.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. The Friar case involved a forklift and the Colson \ncase involved the use of a lawnmower. In \n [[Page S6330]]  both of those cases the courts held there was no duty \nto warn where the dangers are of common knowledge.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This basic principle is part of case law and it is \nalso set forth in the Restatement of Torts, at section 402A, which I \nwould like to include in the Record. The relevant part provides that \ndefendants\n\n       Are not required to warn with respect to products, or \n     ingredients in them, which are only dangerous, or potentially \n     so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long \n     period of time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger, \n     is generally known and recognized. Again the dangers of \n     alcoholic beverages, are an example, as are also those foods \n     containing such substances as saturated fats, which may over \n     a period of time have a deleterious effect upon the human \n     heart.\n\n  I thank my colleague for responding to my inquiries.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am glad we clarified the meaning of section 106.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been at the Budget Committee all \nafternoon, and so I have not been able to monitor all the nuances, but \nwe are now hearing that reasoned objections need not be given to this \nprovision because the distinguished Senators say that they are going to \ntake care of this issue in conference.\n  That could be. I have served on many a conference committee and I \nhave learned that you are never able really to control it. Each Senator \nis given a vote, along with the House Members.\n  Be that as it may, I will not give the reasons why I am concerned \nabout this provision at this particular time, other than to say that I \nam also honestly objecting. I am courteously objecting. I do not know \nhow to say it any better than that.\n  When the proponents make a request, a unanimous-consent request, and \nassume that theirs is the only honest request, courteous request, and \nsincere request, and how they can be more honest, then that constrains \nme to stand and say that I am just as courteously objecting and \nhonestly objecting as I know how to object. And I object.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, and this has been \ncleared by the Democratic leader, at 12 noon on Wednesday, May 10, the \nSenate proceed to calendar 74, S. 534, the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think Senator Harkin plans to offer his \namendment in about 20 minutes, at 7 o'clock. I am not certain whether \nthe amendments by Senator Boxer or Dorgan will be offered.\n  We have the agreement, in any event. I want to thank my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. This means no more votes tonight. We can alert \nour colleagues but there will be debate on the Harkin amendment, and I \nassume other amendments if they want to be called up. I thank the \nChair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the product \nliability reform bill now under consideration, and I would like to just \npreface my remarks by offering my compliments to the bill's managers \nfor their tenacity in sticking with this process as we have moved \nthrough all the various perspectives to find a point of common \nagreement between 60 Members of the Senate. I think both Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Gorton worked very effectively on this product \nliability reform effort.\n  I believe the bill represents an excellent start at reforming our \ncivil justice system, a system that eats up over $300 billion a year in \nlegal and court costs, awards, and litigants' lost time, not to mention \nthe loss to consumers and the economy from higher prices for products, \ninnovations and improvements not on the market, and unnecessarily high \ninsurance costs.\n  By placing reasonable limitations on punitive damages in product \nliability suits, this legislation will begin the process of reforming \nour litigation lottery without harming anyone's right to recover for \ndamages suffered.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill now includes a special \nprovision limiting punitive damages for individuals with assets of less \nthan $500,000 and for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees. \nThis provision is modeled on a proposal that Senator DeWine and I \ncosponsored and provides that the maximum award against such \nindividuals or entities is the lesser of $250,000 or twice compensatory \ndamages.\n  Mr. President, no one benefits when businesses go bankrupt because of \narbitrary punitive damage awards. Small businesses are particularly \nsusceptible to such problems as are the millions of Americans employed \nby them.\n  The bill will also eliminate joint liability for noneconomic damages \nin product liability cases. Thus the bill would end the costly and \nunjust practice of making a company pay for all damages when it is only \nresponsible for, say, 20 percent just because the other defendants are \nsomehow judgment proof.\n  The bill would replace the outmoded joint liability doctrine with \nproportionate fault in which each defendant would have to pay only the \namount necessary to cover the damage for which he or she was \nresponsible.\n  The bill also creates some important limitations on the liability of \nsellers of products generally as well as on the liability of suppliers \nof raw materials critical to the production of lifesaving medical \ndevices.\n  These provisions go a good way toward restoring individual \nresponsibility as the cornerstone of tort law. They also recognize an \nimportant fact about our legal system. Ultimately, in its current form, \nit is profoundly anticonsumer. By raising the prices of many important \ngoods, our legal system makes them unavailable to poor individuals who \ncannot afford them when an exorbitant tort tax has been added. And in \nextreme cases our legal system can literally lead to death or misery by \ndriving off the market drugs that, if properly used, can cure terrible \nbut rare diseases or medical devices for which raw materials are \nunavailable on account of liability risks.\n  These are important reforms, Mr. President; reforms that will \nincrease product availability, decrease prices and save jobs.\n   [[Page S6331]] When we allow our tort system to stifle production \nand innovation the real losers are consumers--who must pay higher \nprices and choose between fewer and less advanced goods--and workers--\nwhose job opportunities disappear.\n  By eating up 4.5 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, the tort \nsystem costs jobs. Besides causing companies to discontinue or not \nintroduce products, it also hurts American businesses overall by making \nthem less competitive in the world market.\n  A 1994 Business Roundtable survey of 20 major U.S. corporations \nreveals that they receive 55 percent of their revenue from inside our \ncountry, but incur 88 percent of their total legal costs here. Clearly \nsuch discrepancies in legal costs put our companies at a disadvantage \nin the world marketplace.\n  It is no secret that I wish we had gone farther with this bill, to \nprotect the nonprofit organizations, the towns and villages and the \nordinary Americans who remain victims of our current broken legal \nsystem. I hope that Members of this body who support this legislation \nbut at this time do not want to apply its reforms more broadly will on \nfurther reflection see their way clear to taking the next step; to \nenact similar reforms to assist homeowners, accountants, farmers, \nvolunteer groups, charitable organizations, all small businesses, State \nand local governments, architects, engineers, doctors and patients, \nemployers and employees. But I feel strongly that the legislation under \nconsideration, even limited to its present scope, is an important step \ntoward making our civil justice system fair and efficient and improving \nthe lives of our citizens. I urge its prompt final passage.\n  I urge its prompt final passage.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I hope that we will go further in the days \nahead, whether in the form of independent legislation or as part of \nfurther discussions of legal reform that may come before the Senate in \nthe context of securities litigation or some other issue before us, \nbecause I think that we need an overall and comprehensive reform of the \nsystem.\n  I know that I speak for a number of the Senators who are active and \nworking on this bill in saying that we are delighted with the progress \nwe have made so far and, while we may not think we are yet close to our \nfinal destination, we have taken a good first step. And, most \nimportantly, I can say that, at least for this Senator, I am dedicated \nand committed to continuing the fight to keeping this whole issue of \nreforming our legal system before the Senate and I remain hopeful that \nwe will enact more reforms in the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nI am about to send to the desk be made in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 749 to Amendment No. 690\n\n  (Purpose: To adjust the limitations on punitive damages that may be \n                  awarded against certain defendants)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 749 to amendment No. 690.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 107(b) of the amendment as amended by amendment \n     No. 709 insert the following:\n       ``(6)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the amount of \n     punitive damages that may be awarded in any product liability \n     action that is subject to this title against an owner of an \n     unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, \n     unit of local government, or organization that has 25 or more \n     full-time employees shall be the greater of--\n       ``(I) an amount determined under paragraph (1); or\n       ``(II) 2 times the average value of the annual compensation \n     of the chief executive officer (or the equivalent employee) \n     of such entity during the 3 full fiscal years of the entity \n     immediately preceding the date on which the award of punitive \n     damages is made.\n       ``(ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term \n     `compensation' includes the value of any salary, benefit, \n     bonus, grant, stock option, insurance policy, club \n     membership, or any other matter having pecuniary value.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. \nIt simply provides that the caps on punitive damages that are in the \namendment will not apply in cases where a business is sued and the \nchief executive officer's salary over the previous 3 years is greater \nthan the total compensatory damages in the case for businesses with 25 \nor more employees.\n  This is less than 13 percent of all businesses, according to the \nCensus Bureau. In those instances, the cap on punitive damages, in my \namendment, would be raised to twice the compensation of the chief \nexecutive officer for 1 year averaged over the last 3 years.\n  Again, let me try to put it in plain English. What my amendment \nprovides is that if a corporation is sued and it has over 25 employees, \nthen the cap on punitive damages that is in the Gorton substitute \namendment will not apply. The formula to be used would be that punitive \ndamages would be capped at twice--just twice--the annual compensation \nof the chief executive officer of that corporation and that annual \ncompensation would be determined by averaging the last 3 years.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that punitive damages that are paid \nshould not be disproportionate, but proportionate to what? This \nlegislation basically says that a multibillion-dollar corporation can \nconsciously and flagrantly disregard the safety of others and have that \nconduct proven, not just by a preponderance of the evidence but by \nclear and convincing evidence. So what this means is that the \nlegislation before us says this multibillion-dollar corporation can \nconsciously, flagrantly disregard the safety of others, be sued and go \nto court, have it proven that they consciously and flagrantly \ndisregarded the safety of others by clear and convincing evidence, and \nthe maximum punitive damages for this kind of heinous conduct is only \ntwice the compensatory damages of the plaintiff, even if those damages \nare such a small amount that they are only a tiny proportion of the \ncompany's profits and assets.\n  I believe the more important comparison in punitive damage cases is \nthe proportion of the damages to the size and the financial strength of \nthe business.\n  The compensation package of the CEO of a company with at least 25 \nemployees, as my amendment provides, is inevitably going to be a \nreasonably fair proportion of the total cash flow of the company. Now, \nI have chosen to have it apply to only those businesses that have 25 or \nmore employees so that a small business, a sole proprietor, who retains \nall of the profits of the company as his or her compensation is not \naffected.\n  There is only one purpose for punitive damages, and that is \ndeterrence. That is the only purpose of punitive damages, to deter that \nflagrant, irresponsible action, that disregard from the safety of \nothers, from happening in the future. Yet, who believes that a punitive \ndamages award of a few hundred thousand dollars is going to have a \nsignificant impact on a company the size of, say, a major motor \ncompany, a multibillion-dollar corporation?\n  The CEO's of some companies make $250,000 a week. So how great of a \ndeterrent will it be to a big corporation if their total punitive \ndamages is $250,000? That is what they pay their CEO for 1 week.\n  So why did I choose the compensation packages of the CEO's of these \nlarge companies? Because I believe that unless executive compensation \nis \n [[Page S6332]]  ruinously disproportionate to the resources of the \ncompany--and that is seldom the case--twice that compensation package \nwill not be so large that it will cause the company to close. No one \ncan argue that a multibillion-dollar corporation that pays its CEO, \nsay, $5 million a year is going to close its doors because a punitive \ndamage award comes to $10 million or 2 years' salary.\n  The other reason I have chosen executive compensation is because it \nis something that is entirely within the control and discretion of the \ncompany's management. And it also takes into account the cash flow of \nthe company. It is, therefore, more fair than a system based on the \ntotal assets of the company which may be fixed productive resources.\n  Mr. President, let me read a few examples of the compensation \npackages in a few of the major corporations. This is from the recent \nissue of Forbes Magazine in the May 22 issue. The cover says ``Pigging \nit up: Corporate management who subdues their directors into \nsubmission.'' In this issue it says 800 chief executives are paid $1.3 \nmillion per year. That would be one of the lower ones. Some of them are \nextremely high. I am just going to read a few. These are some of the \ncompanies that may be involved in the potential lawsuit we are talking \nabout here.\n  Here is the compensation of the CEO of General Electric: $8.6 million \nper year. Let us see now; that would come out to be about $300,000 \nevery 2 weeks, or about $600,000 a month. So you can see, if General \nElectric were to make a product that they knew consciously, flagrantly \ndisregarded the safety of others--and this was proven in a court of law \nby clear and convincing evidence --under the bill before us, they get \n$250,000, or twice the compensatory damages. Well, as I showed you, the \nCEO makes almost $250,000 a week. So what kind of a deterrent is that \ngoing to be?\n  Here is Trinity Industries. The CEO there makes $6.2 million a year. \nThat is about $250,000 every couple of weeks.\n  Here is Morton International, where the CEO makes $7.5 million a \nyear.\n  Here is Chrysler, where the CEO, Mr. Eaton, makes $6.2 million a \nyear.\n  Here is Premark International. I do not even know what they do. They \npay their CEO $12.121 million a year. Well, let us see, that is a \nmillion dollars a month. That is $250,000 a week, I guess. So if \nPremark consciously, flagrantly made a product in disregard of the \nhealth and safety of others and were sued and taken to court, and that \nwas proved by clear and convincing evidence, one of the highest \nstandards, they could have their damages capped for a figure as low as \nwhat their CEO makes in 1 week.\n  Do you think that is a deterrent? That is not a deterrent at all. \nThey would laugh that off.\n  Here is Colgate-Palmolive. Mr. Mark makes $13.460 million a year as \nthe CEO. I think you get the picture.\n  Here is Mattel Toys. Their CEO makes $7.6 million per year. Yet, we \nare going to say that some kid who got injured by a toy, permanently \ndisabled for life--and again, let us think again; is it just some kid \nwho got hurt by a toy because they were misusing it? No, they have to \ngo to court and prove that the company flagrantly and consciously \ndisregarded the safety of that child in making that toy. It has to be \nnot by a preponderance of the evidence but by clear and convincing \nevidence, a higher standard. After all that, we will slap their hands \nand cap the punitive damages at a small fraction of their company's \nworth.\n  So, again, I think, Mr. President, you get the picture. There are 800 \ncompanies here. I am not going to run through them all. Again, I am not \nmentioning these companies because I want to cast aspersion on these \ncompanies. I have nothing against them. In fact, they are probably \npretty decent, good companies. I have had dealings with some of them \nbefore. I am sure they want to be good citizens and want to employ \npeople, and they want to make our country great. I am not saying these \ncompanies are bad. I am just using this as an example of the kinds of \ncompensation they pay their CEOs.\n  Again, my amendment says that if you go through all of these hoops \nand you get punitive damages, we are going to cap it just at twice the \nannual compensation of the CEO. Mr. President, here is an article from \nthe Tampa, Florida, Tribune, April 13th. I want to read the first \ncouple of paragraphs. It says:\n\n       The Nation's corporate chief executives find their jobs an \n     enriching experience these days. ``Greed clearly is back in \n     style,'' says Robert Mongs, a principal of Lenz, Inc., an \n     activist investment fund in Washington.\n      ``There is almost a feeling among CEO's that the money is \nthere to be taken.''\n\n  If these companies want to pay their CEO's $12 million a year, or $7 \nmillion a year, that is their business. I believe it is our business as \nlawmakers charged with responsibility to provide for the general \nwelfare of our people.\n  Now, Mr. President, the word ``welfare'' appears twice in the \nConstitution of the United States. Most people do not know that. It \nfirst appears in the Preamble of the Constitution, which is part of the \nConstitution, where it lays out the reasons for the Constitution. One \nof the reasons is to promote the general welfare. It does not say stand \nback and let the States do it. It charges Congress with promoting the \ngeneral welfare of our people.\n  Then in article I, section 8, which lays out the duties and \nresponsibilities of Congress to lay and impose duties and customs, to \nregulate the Army and Navy--it has a whole list--to regulate commerce, \na whole list of things that Congress is specifically charged to do, in \narticle I, section 8.\n  One of those is to provide for the common welfare of the people. That \nis our responsibility. We are charged by that when we raise our hand \nand swear our oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\n  The Constitution says clearly that we are to provide for the general \nwelfare. In providing for the general welfare, we want to make sure \nthat people--average citizens of this country--have the assurance that \nwhen they buy a product, consume a product, or use a product, when they \ntravel on our highways, that they can be reasonably certain that what \nthey are using, what they are buying, what they are consuming, is not \ngoing to harm them. That is our responsibility.\n  That is why we pass safety and health laws. That is why we put \nstoplights on our intersections. Now a stoplight, Mr. President, \nrestricts my freedom. I want to go down that street. I do not want to \nstop at a stoplight but that stoplight restricts my freedom of \nmovement. We have decided for the public safety that we will regulate \nthe flow of traffic and we put up stoplights.\n  That is why we have food inspection laws. That is why we have all \nkinds of safety laws. And that is another reason why we have left \nuntouched in our country for these 200-plus years the common law that \nwe inherited from Great Britain that goes back over 600 years, the \nconcept of tort feasor, the concept that someone must take due care and \nconcern that his actions do not harm others. If those actions do harm \nothers, I am held accountable and responsible.\n  I believe it promotes responsibility. It makes people think twice \nabout their actions and about what we make, how we act, and what we do. \nThat is why I find this bill before the Senate so out of step with what \nwe have been doing for 600 years and so out of line with what we in our \noffices and in our speeches say we want. We want people to act \nresponsibly. We say if someone is not responsible we want them held \naccountable.\n  In the bill as it is, a corporation could make something, hurt \nsomebody. As I pointed out, they could be maimed for life. How are they \nheld accountable in terms of deterrence and punitive damages if we have \nthese low caps?\n  I believe that is a modest amendment. It is not going to bust any \ncompany. There is no company--no company in this magazine, not one \ncompany--could say that if they had to give up 2 years of their CEO's \ncompensation, that they will go broke. If they are, their board of \ndirectors will fire everybody running that company.\n  I believe that at least 2 years of compensation of what a CEO makes \ncould be a deterrent to that company in terms of their future actions. \nCertainly, $250,000 is not a deterrent.\n  Does any person think that a company with the resources to pay one \nperson $12 million a year would flinch from paying even $1 million in \npunitive damages? Some of the individuals make as much money as the \nsalaries of \n [[Page S6333]]  all the United States Senators combined, and no one \nthinks we are undercompensated here.\n  We all agree with the Dole proportionality of punitive damages award. \nIt ought to be apportioned to the damages caused and the pain and \nsuffering and the injury to the person. It also ought to be apportioned \nto the resources of the person or the company that caused that injury. \nThis goal of proportionality has been served for centuries by the jury \nsystem, under the watchful eye of a judge.\n  Mr. President, I must also say that this bill surprises me. Many of \nthe proponents of the bill keep talking about returning power to the \nlocal level. It does not get any more local than putting a decision in \nthe hands of a jury of one's peers. These are not people who ran for \noffice. These are not people who went through years of law school or \nother special training for their jobs.\n  The people who the proponents of this bill apparently think can \napparently no longer be trusted to come up with fair verdicts are good \ncitizens, the ones who serve on juries, pay their taxes, and go to the \npolls.\n  Now we are being told by the proponents of this bill, ``We cannot \ntrust you.'' Well, considering that everyone here was put here by those \nsame citizens who sit on the juries, how can we now doubt their wisdom? \nJuries, by and large, are fair and come up with reasonable verdicts. \nAnd they have been doing it since the dawn of our democracy.\n  What is it about juries that now makes them constantly make these so-\ncalled foolish decisions that the bill's proponents have been reading? \nWill the proponents of this bill say that the people who serve on \njuries are ignorant? If so, stand up and say so. Will the proponents of \nthis bill say that the people who serve on juries are easily misled? If \nso, let them stand up and say so. Do the proponents of this bill say \nthat the people who serve on juries lack common sense or they have no \nsense of fairness? If so, let them get up and say so. Do the proponents \nof this bill say that a jury cannot look at a person who has had a \nserious injury and then go on to decide that the product that was \ninvolved was not negligently manufactured? Do the proponents say that? \nIf they believe so, let them get up and say it.\n  The facts are just the opposite. In fact, juries decide against \nplaintiffs about half the time. Juries have had a long track record in \ndispensing wisdom, a record about three or four times as long as the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I find it very interesting that the proponents of this legislation, \nsome of them are the strongest voices about returning government to the \nlocal level, giving power back to the local level. There is nothing \nmore local than a jury of your peers. Now the proponents of this bill \nare saying, ``We cannot trust you to make these kind of decisions. We \nwill take it out of your hands.''\n  As far as I know, there is nothing more fair, there is nothing that \ndispenses wisdom and justice more evenly, than juries of our peers. I \nmay not agree with every jury verdict. Sometimes I believe a jury makes \na mistake. But I was not sitting there. I did not listen to all the \ntestimony. I was not able to weigh all the pros and cons.\n  So what I read in the paper may upset me. I can honestly say that \nthere are times when I have heard of jury decisions that make me mad. \nBut then after I dig into it, find out about it, and read more about \nit, then I find out why the jury reached the decision they did.\n  So juries are not ignorant. Juries are our neighbors, our relatives, \nour friends, the people who put Members in this body in the first \nplace.\n  All I say, Mr. President, is that I have opposed caps on damages, but \nif we are going to have a cap, and this bill says we are going to have \na cap, let it at least be high enough that punitive damages can serve \ntheir purpose to deter truly heinous actions by the largest companies \nin this country.\n  We should not make it so that they would be so high as to bankrupt a \ncompany. We should not make it so that it would put small businesses \nout. That is why I have exempted those businesses of less than 25 \nemployees.\n  I believe that the amendment I have offered accomplishes that fine \nbalance and the balance of deterrence, punitive damages high enough to \nreally deter that kind of action in the future. Not high enough to \nbankrupt the company. And not so low as in this bill as to where \ncompanies will just laugh it off. Just laugh it off--$250,000.\n  Now, I know the proponents of the bill will say, well, the judge can \nraise the $250,000 if he wants. True. But then the defendant can say, \nwell, I do not like it. I want to go back to another trial and go right \nback to the process again. And again these multibillion-dollar \ncorporations will get to write off, of course, all the attorney's fees \nand expenses as an ordinary business expense, and we taxpayers pick \nthat up.\n They go right back through the process again. Thus, the cycle just \nkeeps going. So really what we really have in this bill is a $250,000 \ncap. That is not enough to be a deterrence.\n\n  I believe this amendment will be a deterrence, I believe it is fair, \nand I believe it is reasonable.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa assumes the question \nof deterrence, misconstrues the actual impact of punitive damages, and \ntotally misstates the provision that he purports to amend. There is no \n$250,000 punitive damage cap. In the case of serious injuries, for \nanything other than the small business, which is exempted both in the \nbill and in the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, for anything other \nthan a small business, the cap is $250,000 only if the damages to the \nplaintiff are minimal. In the cases repeatedly cited by the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the individual maimed for life--that was the last quotation \nI remember--it is obvious that the economic damages to that individual \ntogether with the award for pain and suffering, unlimited by any \nfeature of this bill, added together and multiplied by two is \ninfinitely greater than $250,000.\n  Every week in the United States we have compensatory damage awards \nwell up into the millions of dollars, and in each of those cases, \nexcept for the very, very small business, the maximum award of punitive \ndamages on the part of the jury under the bill as it exists now is \ntwice whatever those damages are. The $250,000 figure was only put back \ninto this proposal to say that you could go that high in case of a jury \naward for actual damages that was extremely small. And, Mr. President, \nif a claimant goes all the way through a trial and proves that his or \nher damages are only $10,000, why should we allow a $4 million punitive \ndamage award? That is, of course, the essence of what this debate is \nabout.\n  Moreover, even the figure twice the sum of economic and noneconomic \nor pain and suffering damages contained in the bill has an exception \npursuant to which the judge can increase that award, if the judge finds \nthe conduct of the defendant to be as egregious as the description \npropounded to us by the Senator from Iowa. The Senator from West \nVirginia and I have said that this bill in its final form will not \ncontain any automatic new trial right for a defendant in any such \ncases.\n  So, Mr. President, the present bill that we are being asked to vote \non does not have any ultimate cap at all on punitive damages in that \nextraordinarily rare case in which a judge felt that a very, very high \nsuch award was appropriate. So the Senator from Iowa is wrong that a \nbadly injured, maimed individual is not going to have a $250,000 cap on \npunitive damages when an injury was caused by the deliberate acts or \nthe outrageous acts of the large corporation. In fact, that individual \nis not going to be subject to any cap at all if he or she can prove the \nkind of case which was given us here as this horror story. But what we \nare doing in this bill is to provide some remote connection between the \nactual losses an individual suffers and how much can be added to that \namount by a jury acting without any rules or instructions whatsoever. \nIt is neither more nor less than that.\n  We should not have the legal system of the United States of America \nas a national lottery where, under certain circumstances with a handful \nof juries \n [[Page S6334]]  in modest cases with almost no damages, the lottery \ncan create a bonanza partly for an individual but basically, this is \nwhat the debate is all about--for the lawyer class in this country who \nfind these actions to bring.\n  More fundamentally, and we have not gotten back to this point \nrecently in this debate, and I speak not just of the remarks of the \nSenator from Iowa but of all of the opponents of this bill, none has \nshown that their slogans about deterrence have any true meaning. No \nsingle study has ever shown that punitive damages, the lottery of a \nhuge punitive damage award, has any real effect on deterrence or on \nsafety.\n  I am astounded that a Member of this body who believes so firmly in \nthe presence of government in our life and of its regulatory capacities \nhas so little faith in the ability of all of the statutes of the United \nStates and of all of the statutes of the States dealing with safety in \nthe production of products to cause them actually to be safe. We passed \nmeasures on automobile safety, on toy safety, and on all other kinds of \nproduct safety, and on the way in which we license drugs and the way in \nwhich we build airplanes to see to it that they are safe and effective. \nYet, apparently, according to the opponents of this bill, nothing would \nbe safe in America if we did not have unlimited punitive damages. That \nis the only way we can see to it that corporations behave, that we can \nhave a reasonable society.\n  Mr. President, retired Justice Powell said--and I paraphrase him but \nI agree with him--the jury system of litigation taken as a whole is the \nmost irrational method of business regulation imaginable.\n  It is not a criticism of a particular jury to say so, Mr. President. \nThat jury deals with a single instance. It does not know what other \ninstances there are in many cases. The Congress of the United States, \nthe legislatures of the several States, when they determine on \nregulation, determine it on the basis of all of the evidence, of all of \nthe weighing of how much we want to encourage certain kinds of \nproduction and what kind of cautions we put on them. This is the way in \nwhich the job is done.\n  No study shows that punitive damages do anything other than have an \nutterly irrational impact of telling many companies it is not \nworthwhile going into a new line of business--it is not worthwhile, as \none of our major companies has said, to try to go into the business of \nfinding a new drug which helps AIDS. We cannot make enough money on it \nto risk that lottery that some lawyer someplace will persuade some jury \nto whack us with a $25 million punitive damage award.\n  So we have had dozens of companies get out of the business of \nproducing the vaccine against whooping cough. Is that a triumph of the \nAmerican system, that the cost of whooping cough vaccine has gone up \n500 percent and only one or two companies are even willing to make it?\n  Is it a triumph of the American system that 18 of the 20 companies \nthat used to manufacture football helmets are not in the business \nanymore because it just simply is not worthwhile? Is it a vindication \nof the American system that a large company which produces plastic \npiping for heart implants, on which it might possibly make $1 million \nin a several-year period, has paid close to 40 times that in defending \nsuccessfully product liability actions, and looks at the bottom line \nand says, what in the world are we doing this for? Why should we \nproduce this particular product? Those legal fees adhere to defendants \nwho win just as much as they do to those who lose. And when the company \nsays it is just costing us too much, we will abandon this line of \nresearch; we will abandon this product; the American people are not \nbenefited. Who is benefited? A tiny handful of lucky players and a \nlarger group of trial lawyers.\n  So what we do in this bill, much more modestly than I would prefer, \nis to say at least in the great bulk of cases there ought to be some \nrelationship to how badly the plaintiff or claimant is actually damaged \nand what the maximum punitive damages are. Let there be a ratio. If in \nfact the individual is maimed for life, then they are going to be \nentitled to huge punitive damages. But if in fact they are damaged \n$10,000 or $500, why should they win the lottery when there is no \nevidence that this does anything but to constrict our economy?\n  I say once again, the State immediately adjacent to the State of the \nSenator from Iowa, Nebraska, like my own State of Washington, just does \nnot have punitive damages in the kind of cases we are talking about \nhere. It does not allow them at all. Why? Because the Constitution of \nthe United States protects anyone accused of a crime. They have fifth \namendment rights. The case against them has to be proven beyond a \nreasonable doubt. There is a maximum sentence. But those who uphold \nthose constitutional protections as fundamental to our system of \njustice say, oh, no, but a civil jury can punish without any limitation \nor without any guidelines whatsoever, rationally or totally or \ntemporarily. There just is no connection between those two.\n  Moreover, there is also no relationship at all between the \nresponsibility of business enterprises, the safety with which they \nbuild their products, that is related to whether or not they operate in \na State which has punitive damages or one which bans punitive damages. \nNot a scintilla of evidence, not any instance has been imparted to this \nbody that oh, boy, we better keep punitive damages because look at how \nirresponsible companies are that operate in Nebraska or Washington or \none of the other States. Not a peep, Mr. President, about that.\n  The bottom line is we are dealing with a system that is a great \nsystem for a handful of lawyers in this country. They and their \nsidekicks get 60 percent of all of the money that goes into this \nproduct liability system. Claimants get 40 percent of it. We want to \nmake it a little bit more rational.\n  The Harkin amendment does not make it more rational. The Harkin \namendment does not even recognize the nature of the $250,000 cap, which \ndoes not apply to anything he talked about, or the fact that there is \nno cap at all when the judge finds that the conduct of the defendant \nhas been particularly egregious, and the Harkin amendment should \ntherefore be rejected.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, not only do I agree with everything \nthat my able colleague from the State of Washington has said, the \nHarkin amendment adds a new section to the bill for setting punitive \ndamages against businesses with 25 or more employees. It has to be \ngreater than the amount recorded or using a formula laid out in the \ncompromise bill which is twice compensatory damages or $250,000, \nwhichever is greater, or twice the value of annual compensation of the \nbusiness' chief executive officer.\n  Well, that last one obviously is an eye-catcher, ear-catcher. It \nsounds innocent enough--and fun. It is kind of fun, cute. But we are on \na deadly serious bill. The people who voted today to make sure that we \nwould continue to discuss and amend product liability reform were not \ntrying to have fun with this.\n  We have been on this bill for several weeks now. I have been doing \nthis for 9 years. I am sure the Senator from the State of Washington \nhas been doing it for longer than that. There is nothing in any of my \nefforts to sort of do something to amuse myself, enjoy myself. I am \ntrying to make America better. I am trying to help defendants who \ncannot get their claims in time. I am helping to make things more \npredictable for businesses so we can strike a balance between consumers \nand business.\n  One thing this is not is just kind of fun. When I say it is deadly \nserious, I mean deadly serious because I truly believe there are \nproducts not being developed today which could save lives, and that \npeople are dying because that is not happening.\n  There are a couple of facts which I think are relevant. There is not \na $250,000 cap in the Gorton-Rockefeller compromise on product \nliability reform, as suggested by the Senator from Iowa. There is not \nthat cap.\n  I suggest to those who do read the bill, in product liability cases, \nif the jury agrees that the punitive damages should be awarded, the \njury can, and under the bill punitive damages will, \n [[Page S6335]]  set an alternative ceiling of $250,000, or twice the \namount of compensatory damages.\n And then the judge, under the additur provision, decides if that is \nnot enough, to take it up. So there is no floor.\n\n  We are not talking about treating people unfairly. In fact, I think \nwe are trying to talk, for the first time in a long time, about \ntreating people fairly.\n  To highlight some more information about the suggestion of the \nSenator from Iowa that there is any sort of special protection for \nbusinesses which are tempted to make defective or unsafe products, \neverybody needs to remember that juries under our bill can award \ncompensatory damages in amounts that span from hundreds of dollars to \nmillions and millions of dollars.\n  I have made this point several times, but I will make it again and I \nwill give you a few more examples this time. I have already talked \nabout the State of the Senator from Washington, not even considering \npunitive damages at all, and within the last 5 or 6 weeks there was an \naward of $40 million. I have no idea what the circumstances were. But \nthat was economic plus noneconomic--compensatory damages, $40 million.\n  You do not need punitive damages to get a big award. I am for the \npunitive damages, but you do not need them to get major awards.\n  There was a $70 million compensatory award, again, not even \nconsidering punitive, to the family of a woman who died when a \ndefective helicopter crashed--in, as it turns out, Missouri. But that \ndid not stop the jury from awarding $70 million. So we are not kidding \nhere. We are not doing anything fun here.\n  There was a $15 million compensatory award--again, not even \nconsidering punitive damages; but a compensatory award--to a boy in a \ncase involving a defective seat belt. Now, I do not know the \ncircumstances. This was in Los Angeles County, 1993. I do not know the \ncircumstances, but this is just compensatory award.\n  Almost $20 million, Mr. President, in compensatory damages was \nawarded to a man injured in some circumstances in which a motorcycle \nspun around on the ground during a turn. My eloquence cannot exceed \nthat, unfortunately, because I do not know what it was. But the man was \ninjured by a motorcycle and got almost $20 million--I say again, in \ncompensatory damages alone.\n  So there is no kind of joking around here. We are trying to do the \nright thing.\n  I might say, on the other side of it--and I do not want to stretch \nthis out--that there are a lot of things that are not happening in this \ncountry because of the fact that our punitive damages situation is \nscaring people away from new products, new research, new improvements, \nor whatever.\n  I have used this case before and I will use it again, because I think \nit is devastatingly powerful.\n  I care a lot about health care and I have worked a lot on health \ncare. I have been into kidney dialysis clinics. They are not a lot of \nfun to go into. The former Governor of Missouri knows what I am talking \nabout, the Presiding Officer. It is kind of dark and people are lying \nback in chairs, and their blood is being completely changed. It is kind \nof depressing to be there. I do not think they enjoy it much. Nobody is \ntalking to anybody else. They cannot work. They are tied into these \nhuge machines which rise up beside them and behind them.\n  This was carried a little step further and they developed a dialysis \nmachine that you could take home with you so that if you worked within \n2 or 3 miles, or 4 or 5 miles away, you could come home to that \ndialysis machine, do it yourself and then go back to work. It was a \ntremendous improvement, because you could go back to work, if your work \nwas close enough so that you could come back two or three times to do \nthat.\n  But then Union Carbide comes along and really comes up with the \nanswer. They put the whole thing into a suitcase-sized dialysis machine \nthat you can take to your job with you and do the dialysis on the job.\n  My 15-year-old son has one of his best friends who, a couple of years \nago, we discovered had diabetes. That is not a lot of fun for a young \nkid to find something like that out. I cannot get over the way that \nyoung man, 12 years old at the time, simply adjusted to his new \ncircumstances and was able to give himself insulin; just disappear for \na few minutes and do it. His courage--he actually grew, grew in my \neyes, and I think he grew in his own realization in the sense of \nmortality and what he could do and how precious everything was. He is a \nremarkable boy. In fact, I think his aunt is Madeleine Albright, our \nAmbassador to the United Nations--a wonderful boy.\n  But Union Carbide, when they came up with this same kind of you-can-\ndo-it-right-on-the-spot kidney dialysis machine, had to sell their \nbusiness to a foreign company where uniform product liability laws did \nnot give the same litigation potential because Union Carbide, an \nenormous company, determined that the potential liability risk made the \nproduct uneconomical.\n  So I have to assume there are hundreds of thousands of people who \nneed these blood changes in this country who are deprived of that now \nbecause Union Carbide could not do that.\n  I have 20 examples. I will not give them. It is late.\n  So I know that the amendment has sort of a nice, populist ring to \nit--CEO's salary. But this is dead-serious business that we are \ninvolved in.\n  Product liability reform is something I have fought for as a \nnonlawyer because I want to see people's lives get better and I want to \nsee products developed and I want to see--just on personal grounds, my \nmother spent years dying from Alzheimer's disease. There is a cure out \nthere, but somebody has to put the money up to find that cure. It is \nprobably not going to be the Federal Government, because we are cutting \nback.\n  So all of this is deadly serious. This is not a bill that should be \nused to beat up on business. This is a bill that should be used to beat \nup on a legal system which is failing us and, as the Senator from \nWashington said, in which the lawyers get 50 to 70 percent of the \nmoney. I do not respect that. I do not like that. I want to change \nthat.\n  And for that, among other reasons, I oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof John Deutch to become Director of Central Intelligence [DCI]. As a \nlong-time member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have enjoyed \nworking with him in his various roles at the Department of Defense--and \nI look forward to working with him as DCI. Dr. Deutch has an extremely \nimpressive resume, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his \nbiography be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, his background and training clearly \nindicates that Dr. Deutch brings a broad background to the DCI \nposition. His scientific background makes him particularly prepared to \ndeal with the many, formidable technical issues confronting the \nIntelligence Community from satellites to signals intelligence \n[SIGINT]. Dr. Deutch also brings significant administrative and \nnational security expertise to the DCI job from his past and current \nsenior management experiences at the Defense Department. His toughness \nin making difficult decisions and his knowledge of, and experience in, \nnational security matters will make him a very capable manager of the \nU.S. Intelligence Community.\n  I have been especially pleased with the principal purposes Dr. Deutch \nhas articulated for the Intelligence Community: Striving to assure that \nthe President and other national leaders \n [[Page S6336]]  have the best information available before making \ndecisions; providing adequate support to military operations; the need \nfor intelligence to address the growing problems of international \nterrorism, crime, and drugs; and that our counterintelligence \ncapabilities are able to assure that America's enemies do not penetrate \nour national security apparatus.\n  The new CIA Director comes along at an important time for the U.S. \nintelligence community. For almost half a century, the intelligence \ncommunity--indeed our Nation's entire national security \ninfrastructure--has been focused primarily on the Soviet threat. And \nduring the cold war period, our Government viewed most national \nsecurity issues--justifiable or not--through the prism of the United \nStates-Soviet competition.\n  Obviously, this is no longer the case as America is coming to terms \nwith a rapidly changing world. And having a robust and effective \nintelligence community is an indispensable means to that end. Timely \nand accurate intelligence forms the foundation of our foreign policy \nand defines the threat to U.S. national security that is--or should \nbe--the basis of our defense spending.\n  Yet with the end of the cold war, some have argued that the CIA is a \nrelic which has outlived its usefulness, and we should do away with it. \nI strongly disagree with such views. In this unprecedented time of \nenormous change and uncertainty in the world--as the on-going problem \nof the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and recent acts of \nterrorism at home and around the world clearly demonstrate, our need \nfor the intelligence community and a robust intelligence budget is \ngreater than ever before.\n  The requirement for an intelligence capability is by no means a cold \nwar aberration. This year, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of \nthe end of World War II. And history has ultimately revealed to the \npublic the important role of intelligence in that war.\n  Mr. President, like all veterans of that conflict, the 50th \nanniversary commemorations of specific events of World War II have \nspecial meaning to me. One of the most moving ceremonies I have ever \nattended was last June's ceremony in France commemorating the D-Day \ninvasion of Normandy.\n  And unsurprisingly, intelligence made an extraordinary contribution \nto the success of D-Day's planning and implementation. Intelligence \nagents acquired an\n accurate map of the German Atlantic Wall fortifications, and an \nintelligence deception operation code-named Body Guard used German \nspies captured in England as double agents who sent false messages to \nthe Nazis regarding the precise location of the planned invasion of \nEurope. This latter operation also successfully passed along false \ninformation regarding the location of Allied invasion forces in \nEngland.\n\n  Intelligence played a decisive role in Allied victory in World War II \nin many ways. Signals intelligence [SIGINT], for example, played an \ninstrumental role in winning World War II as Allied intelligence \nsuccessfully broke German and Japanese codes.\n  And as we enter one of the most unpredictable and dangerous periods \nin world history, we must ensure that our SIGINT as well as human \nintelligence [HUMINT] and other intelligence capabilities will be able \nto meet the intelligence challenges of tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the other recommendations being made to \nDr. Deutch, as DCI, I would like to add one more.\n  Next March, the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the \nUnited States Intelligence Community--which was initiated by this \ncommittee last year--will issue its report, including recommendations \nto reorganize the intelligence community in the postcold war era. While \nI look forward to reviewing the Commission's report, I must admit that \nI have been somewhat skeptical over the years about the utility of \nGovernment by ``Blue Ribbon Panel''--and have sought to educe the \nnumber of such commissions through oversight action of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, where I am now the ranking member.\n  As Dr. Deutch assumes his duties as DCI and he perceives significant \nproblems--organizational and otherwise--that are impending the \nintelligence community's ability to meet its requirements, I sincerely \nhope that he will act expeditiously to remedy these problems and not \nwait for the Commission's report next March.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Dr. Deutch \nas DCI.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             John M. Deutch\n\n       The Honorable John M. Deutch was sworn in as Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense on 11 March 1994, following a unanimous \n     vote in the Senate. He previously served as the Under \n     Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) from 15 \n     April 1993 until his confirmation as Deputy Secretary.\n       Prior to his nomination to these positions, Mr. Deutch \n     served in a number of educational government posts. Mr. \n     Deutch became a member of the faculty of the Massachusetts \n     Institute of Technology in 1970 and since then has been an \n     associate professor and professor of chemistry, chairman of \n     the Department of Chemistry, dean of science, provost, and \n     Institute Professor.\n       His government assignments include service in the \n     Department of Energy as Director of Energy Research, Acting \n     Assistant Secretary for Energy Technology, and Under \n     Secretary of the Department. In recognition of his \n     contributions, he was honored with the Secretary's \n     Distinguished Service Medal and the Department's \n     Distinguished Service Medal. He has been a member of the \n     White House Science Council, the Defense Science Board, the \n     Army Scientific Advisory Panel, the Chief of Naval Operations \n     Executive Panel, the President's Commission on Strategic \n     Forces, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, \n     and the President's Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee. He \n     also served as a consultant to the Bureau of the Budget.\n       He has been a trustee of the Urban Institute, a member and \n     Chair of the National Science Foundation Advisory Panel for \n     Chemistry, an overseer of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, \n     a trustee of Wellesley College, a director of Resources for \n     the Future, a member of the Trilateral Commission, and a \n     member of the Governor of Massachusetts Technology and \n     Economic Development Council.\n       A graduate of Amherst College with a B.A. in history and \n     economics, he earned both a B.S. in chemical engineering and \n     a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from M.I.T. He holds honorary \n     doctoral degrees from Amherst College and the University of \n     Lowell. Mr. Deutch has been a Sloan Research Fellow and a \n     Guggenheim Fellow and is a member of Sigma Xi and the \n     American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n       Mr. Deutch was born in Brussels, Belgium, and became a U.S. \n     citizen in 1946. He has three sons, and his permanent \n     residence is in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6335-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6336-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6336-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6336-S6337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-880.

A bill to protest the constitutional right to travel to \nforeign countries; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                         freedom to travel act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation dealing with \nthe \n [[Page S6338]]  constitutional right of American citizens and legal \npermanent residents to travel to foreign countries.\n  Last October 5, I held a hearing in my capacity as chairman of the \nConstitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on the \nConstitutional Right to International Travel. The hearing focused on \nthe derivation of this well-established constitutional right, on the \ncircumstances under which the right can be restricted, and on the \nwisdom as a policy matter of restricting the ability of Americans to \nvisit nations with whom we may have political differences.\n  In the course of this hearing, it became clear to me that there are \nlimited instances in which the right of Americans to travel abroad \nshould be restricted--namely, instances where international travel \nendangers the safety of the traveler or implicates national security \nconcerns. Otherwise, as a matter of both constitutional law, the first \nand fifth amendments as well as other constitutional provisions, and \npolicy, the right to a free trade in ideas and to investigations into \nother nations and cultures should be not only left untrammelled, but \nencouraged.\n  When such restrictions on foreign travel are in place, they do great \ndamage to a number of interests that we hold dear. When Americans are \ndenied the right to travel to a foreign country:\n  Businessmen are prevented from exploring opportunities in that \ncountry that might confer economic benefits on this country;\n  American scholars are denied the opportunity to engage in a dialog \nwith their foreign colleagues;\n  Americans with families abroad are prevented from visiting their \nloved ones;\n  Human rights organizations concerned about abuses abroad are \nprevented from seeing those abuses first-hand,\n and from giving corrupt foreign governments the kind of close scrutiny \nthat forces reform of repressive systems;\n\n  Average Americans with an interest in world affairs are denied the \nopportunity to become better informed citizens by virtue of their \ndirect exposure to nations that play an important role in our own \nforeign policy;\n  Finally, our own Government loses the ability to influence foreign \ngovernments through the transmission of American ideals of democracy \nand justice. It is no coincidence that in those nations to which \nAmerican travel was not restricted--such as the nations of the former \nSoviet bloc--the infusion of American ideas contributed mightily to the \ndownfall of repressive regimes.\n  The fact that travel abroad should in most cases be encouraged, and \nnot restricted, however, has not prevented administrations both past \nand present from limiting the right of Americans to travel abroad. In \nresponse to these efforts, Congress has often stepped in to limit the \nPresident's right to restrict foreign travel. Most recently, last \nyear's Foreign Relations Authorization Act limited the President's \nauthority to impose travel related restrictions on Americans seeking to \nvisit foreign countries that are not currently the subject of such \nrestrictions. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, however, \npermitted the President to continue to impose travel, restrictions to \nthose countries now subject to such restrictions--even though none of \nthese countries pose any threat to the health or safety of prospective \nvisitors, or to America's national security. These countries include \nLibya, Iraq, North Korea, and, most controversially, Cuba.\n  The bill I now introduce--the Freedom to Travel Act of 1995--would \nextend the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act's limitations on the \nPresident's power to restrict travel to those countries that are \ncurrently the subject of travel restrictions. The bill would also make \nclear that the President may only restrict travel to countries with \nwhich the United States is at war, where armed hostilities are in \nprogress, or where there is imminent danger to the public health or the \nphysical safety of U.S. travelers. This is the standard that currently \ngoverns the Government's right to deny a passport to a U.S. citizen. I \nbelieve that this standard should apply to any Government effort to \nrestrict foreign travel.\n  I believe this legislation to be necessary both as a matter of policy \nand as a matter of international and constitutional law. Protecting the \nright of Americans to travel abroad is constitutionally required, is \ninternationally recognized as part of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, and is an important way of safeguarding and furthering \nour intellectual, economic, and political interests. I hope my \ncolleagues will join our efforts to work for this protection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 766\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to extend the deadline for \nthe imposition of sanctions under section 179 of the act that relate to \na State vehicle inspection and maintenance program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  clean air act amendment legislation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that I believe \nwill help States and municipalities in their efforts to comply with the \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act. Specifically, this bill will extend \nthe deadline for sanctions under section 179 of the act that relate to \nState vehicle and inspection programs. Congressman Schiff has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act \nset forth requirements for areas that are not in attainment for certain \nair pollutants. These requirements include submission and \nimplementation by those nonattainment areas of extensive and detailed \nremediation plans. Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, many States \nand municipalities have made great strides in fulfilling these \nrequirements.\n  Under section 179 of the act, however, the Environmental Protection \nAgency can levy sanctions on those areas that fail to meet the \nrequirements, sanctions which include the cutting off of highway \nfunding. Unfortunately, implementation of some of the requirements has \nproven to be much more time-consuming than originally thought. Prime \nexamples of this problem are the provisions for vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance programs, also known as I/M programs. The EPA has \npromulgated very complex--and often controversial--rules for I/M \nprograms. Although States and municipalities are trying very hard to \nimplement the I/M rules, and although many are getting very close to \ncompliance, it has become clear that in some cases they will simply \nneed more time.\n  This bill addresses this situation by delaying sanctions for failure \nto implement I/M programs by 12 months, thus allowing States and \nmunicipalities to finish coming into compliance with these Federal \nmandates without losing critically needed highway funds. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF SANCTIONS DEADLINE.\n\n       (a) Extension.--Section 179(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7509(a)) is amended in the matter following paragraph \n     (4) by inserting ``(or, in the case of a requirement relating \n     to a State vehicle inspection and maintenance program, 30 \n     months)'' after ``18 months''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect with respect to any finding, disapproval, \n     or determination made under section 179(a) of the Clean Air \n     Act after the date that is 18 months prior to the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Shelby, \n        and Mr. Packwood):\n  S. 768. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nreauthorize the act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   endangered species act reform act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today is an important day for working \npeople and their families across America whose lives have been impacted \nby the implementation of the Endangered Species Act. Today I am proud \nto introduce legislation, together with Senator Johnston, Senator \nShelby, Senator Breaux, and Senator Packwood to amend the Endangered \nSpecies Act to require that the act consider people.\n  For 6 years, this Senator has fought to bring legislation before the \nSenate to amend the Endangered Species Act. For much of these 6 years, \nI have been unsuccessful in forcing the Senate to debate \nreauthorization of the act.\n  This year, however, is different. I believe that this year proponents \nof reform have a unique opportunity to bring legislation to reform the \nact before the Senate for debate. I intend to work very hard to see \nthat this does, in fact, happen. I am committed to working with Senator \nChafee, as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nand with Senator Kempthorne, as chairman of the Drinking Water, \nFisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee, to see that legislation to \nreauthorize the act is passed by the Senate this year.\n  The debate over the ESA is all about choices. Difficult, yet \nfundamental choices that as people who live in a free and productive \nsociety have to make. How important to society is this species?\n  What is the biological significance of the species? Is it the last of \nits kind? Will it provide a cure for a deadly disease? How many people \nwill lose their jobs as a result of protecting this species? How will \nspecies protection impact the lives of people, their families, and \ntheir communities? In short, the debate will be about people, and \nchoices we must make.\n  Earlier this year, a wonderful book entitled ``Noah's Choice'' \nfocused on these choices. The title is designed to remind us of the \nstory in the book of Genesis, where God commands Noah to build an ark \nto house his family and a male and female pair of every species. As the \nstory goes, it then rained for 40 days and nights, and when the rain \nstopped, and the water dried, Noah had saved every living substance. \nThe authors write:\n\n       Noah had it easy. The materials he needed to build his Ark \n     were at hand and the design, provided by the Supreme Deity, \n     was guaranteed to be sufficient for the task. Two by two, the \n     creatures walked aboard, filling the vessel just to capacity. \n     When the parade finished, Noah had fulfilled his obligations. \n     He had saved ``every living substance.'' There had been no \n     need to exercise judgement or agonize over tough choices. He \n     and his sons \n      [[Page S6340]]  just stood on the gangplank and let \n     everything in. When no creature was waiting outside, he shut \n     the door and waited for rain.\n\n  Unfortunately our choices are not so simple. The act must be reformed \nto include choices, Mr. President, because currently it does not. The \ncurrent act is all about uncompromising, intrusive, and unrelenting \nFederal mandates, and little about choices. To prove this point, you \nonly have to take a look at the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n              pacific northwest as a test case for the esa\n\n  Consider this: less than a decade ago, rural timber communities \nacross my State were thriving. Families were strong and together. \nFathers had a steady job at the mill, that paid a good family wage. \nMothers could afford to stay home and take care of the children, to be \nthere when they got home from school. Parents could save for their \nkids' education. Kids could be kids.\n  These were good places to live and work. Rural areas, surrounded by \nour national parks and forest lands. Communities built up around the \ntimberlands. Families who had worked for generations in the woods, \ncontinued to pass the trade down to the next generation. These were \ncommunities where you didn't have to lock the front door. Places where \nstrangers get a wave, or a nod of acknowledgement as they drive through \ntown. That was 10 years ago.\n  Today it's different. Unemployment is up. Families that were once \nstrong, and together, are falling apart. Divorce and incidents of \ndomestic violence have dramatically increased. People can't find work. \nMills have shut down. Food bank use has skyrocketed. Homes are for \nsale. Once proud, and productive members of our society, have, \nreluctantly, become society's burden.\n  All of this, Mr. President, in the period of 6 short years.\n  It began when the northern spotted owl was listed under the \nEndangered Species Act in 1989. And in the time since that listing, the \ndestruction of rural timber communities has followed. But I want to \nmake clear, it was not the listing of the owl that caused this \ndevastation. It was the implementation of the act that caused it--the \nimplementation of an act that does not consider the impacts on people, \nand their communities.\n  Last month, I held a timber family hearing in Olympia, WA. The \npurpose of my hearing was to hear from the people whose lives have been \nimpacted by the Endangered Species Act, to hear from them, once again, \nas to why this act must be changed. Over the course of 6 years, I have \nheard the personal stories of people who live--or once lived--in my \nState's timber communities. Their stories are hard to listen to, \nbecause their stories could have been different--if only their Federal \nGovernment had listened to their plight. Here are a few of the stories \nI heard.\n  One man, probably close to 40 years old, told me that before the \nlisting of the spotted owl, he went to work each day and came home to \nhis wife and children. In other words, he lived a normal life. But \ntoday he's got to go across the State in order to find work. He's away \nfrom home for weeks at a time. He told me that he can't afford to buy a \nvideo camera or VCR to record his children as they grow up. He told me \nthat he misses his children, that he misses his wife. He asked me if I \ncould fix this law so that he could go home to stay, so that he could \nlive with his family again.\n  Another story. Barbara Mossman and her husband used to own a logging \ntruck company. Today they live day to day, and, if they are lucky \nenough to find work, paycheck to paycheck. Before the owl crisis, \nBarbara and her husband were hardworking small business owners.\n  Barbara told me about the first time she and her husband had to go to \na food bank. They didn't want to do it, that's not the way they were \nraised. They were brought up to believe that if you are a hard worker, \nyou will always find a job, that you should take care of yourself, your \nfamily, and help your neighbor. They were proud. But, as Barbara told \nme, they had to set aside their pride and go to the food bank, because \nthey did not have anything to eat.\n  But if anything captured the spirit of my timber family hearing it \nwas a plea from Bill Pickell, of the Washington Contract Loggers \nAssociation. The people in this room, he said, do not want a handout. \nThey do not want a government program. They want to take care of their \nneighbors, help their community spring back to life. They want to work.\n  Mr. President, the stories are real. They are not made up. There are \nhundreds of stories like this from across my State. The message is the \nsame--the act does not consider people.\n  Of course, if you read the newspapers, or listen to the nightly news \nyou would never realize that people are suffering across my State, and \nthe Nation, because of misguided Federal policies. The media spins a \ndifferent tale. In 1990, in the media frenzy to pit people against \nnature, there was a rush to judgment. A judgment was made that people \nwho live and work in natural resource-based industries cannot coexist \nwith their environment. That the two are mutually exclusive. That the \ntimber worker was an evil raper of the land. That the environment would \nperish because of his life's work.\n  In this rush to judgment, Time magazine put a spotted owl on its \ncover with the heading ``Who Gives a Hoot? The timber industry says \nthat saving this spotted owl will cost 30,000 jobs. It isn't that \nsimple.''\n  Time got one thing right--it is not that simple. But I wonder, in \n1995, would Time put a picture of the unemployed timber worker and his \ncommunity on the cover of its magazine, under the heading ``Can it be \nsaved?'' The answer? Probably not.\n  It's a tactic often used by the media to oversimplify. To make it, us \nversus them. Jobs versus the environment. People versus owls. This \nSenator believes that the media does the public a great disservice in \nits efforts to provide trite, oversimplifications of complex issues. \nThis Senator gives the American public more credit.\n  The legislation that I have introduced today, with that of my primary \nsponsors, recognizes that in order to find the appropriate balance \nbetween people and their desire to protect the environment difficult \nchoices must be made. My legislation recognizes that these decisions \nare not simple, and that the people and the communities most directly \naffected by these decisions must have a say in the process. My \nlegislation attempts to achieve the delicate balance that has long been \nabsent from the current act.\n                       the esa reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago Congress passed, and President Nixon \nsigned, legislation creating the Endangered Species Act. The \nlegislation was written in broad brush stokes--leaving the details to \nFederal bureaucrats to plug in. Not having been a Member of the U.S. \nSenate at the time the original law was enacted, one can only guess \nthat most Members of Congress were enthusiastic about passing such \nlegislation. This was legislation, after all, that would protect our \nNation's symbol of freedom, the bald eagle, and the other precious and \nunique creatures that we identified with as Americans. Simply put, the \nlegislation was as American as baseball and apple pie.\n  In writing the original legislation, Congress, in all its wisdom, \ndecided that it could, in fact, become Noah. The Endangered Species Act \nwas developed, as most laws are, to address a seemingly one-dimensional \nsituation--to stop species from extinction. But 22 years later, the \ndetails of the legislation have been filled in, and slowly people have \nbegun to realize that the original act was written without an eye to \nthe consequences.\n  Mr. President, from the start of this debate in 1989, I have \nadvocated for a balance--a delicate balance between the needs of people \nand that of their environment. The two are not mutually exclusive. In \n1989, my call for balance was viewed as radical and extreme. In 1995, \nnewspaper editorials in my State consistently use the word to describe \nhow the act should be reformed. The administration has even put forward \n10 principles for ESA reform that advocate for a more balanced \ndecisionmaking process.\n  Under my legislation, sound, peer reviewed science would drive the \nlisting process. Economic considerations are not included in the \nlisting process. Upon a final decision to list a species, an interim \nmanagement period would begin, in which the listed species would \n [[Page S6341]]  be provided with the protection against a direct \nkilling or injury to the species. This is a dramatic departure from \ncurrent law. Under current law, with the final listing decision comes a \nwhole host of regulations restricting the use of property and ongoing \nactivities. Under my legislation, the Secretary is required to make a \nwell informed decision before designating critical habitat or other \nregulations.\n  Once a final listing decision is made, the Secretary convenes a \nplanning and assessment team to review the biological, economic, and \nintergovernmental impacts of the listing decision. The team would \nconsist of representatives of affected local communities, as nominated \nby the communities, representatives from the State, as nominated by the \nGovernor, and the appropriate biologists, economists, and land use \nspecialists.\n  The cornerstone of the legislation is the development of the \nSecretary's conservation objective for the listed species. The team \nprovides the Secretary with the information from which he will develop \nhis conservation objective for the listed species. The team provides \nthe Secretary with the answers to questions like this: What's the \nbiological significance of the species? What is the critical habitat of \nthe species? How many jobs would be lost if the species were afforded \nthe full protections of the act? What would be the impact on the local \neconomy? On social, and community values? In other words, the team \nprovides the Secretary with the information to select the conservation \nobjective for the species.\n  Under current law, the Secretary must provide for the full recovery \nof a species once it is listed. No flexibility. No questions asked. My \nbill changes this by providing the Secretary with a range of options.\n  In developing a conservation objective for the species, the Secretary \nselects an objective from a range consisting of, but not limited to: \nfull recovery of the species, conservation of the existing population \nof the species, or a prohibition against direct injury or killing of \nthe species. The Secretary must always provide protection for the \nlisted species from direct injury or killing. The selection of this \nobjective is solely at the Secretary's discretion. This is a \nrevolutionary concept. No longer will the Secretary's hands be tied to \nan inflexible standard.\n  In selecting a conservation objective, and, if necessary, developing \na conservation plan for the listed species, the Secretary is provided \nthe broadest discretionary authority. The only challenge to the \nSecretary's decision in the courts would be if it could be proven that \nthe Secretary grossly abused his authority, traditionally a very hard \nchallenge to meet. What does this mean? In real life terms it means \nthat the Secretary cannot hide behind the law he is charged with \nimplementing in making a decision to conserve a species. The \nadministration could no longer say that a plan it put together to \nprotect a species, although it might be bad for people, was the best \nplan it could put forward under the law. Under my legislation, there \nwould be no more excuses. The\n Secretary would be held politically accountable for his or her \ndecision.\n\n  After the Secretary develops a conservation objective for the \nspecies, the Secretary is directed to look toward voluntary, non-\nFederal conservation proposals that meet the objective. My legislation \nrecognizes that the Federal Government is not the solution to every \nproblem--that individuals, and State and local governments, if given \nthe incentive and opportunity, can effectively provide for the \nconservation of a listed species.\n  There is, however, a degree of risk to my legislation. The Secretary \nhas the discretion to totally disregard all of the information--all of \nthe social and economic consequences of draconian recovery measures--\nand mandate full recovery, for every single species, every time. And, \nif the Secretary makes this decision, under the full sunshine of public \nreview, then so be it. But the people affected by his decision will \nknow that it was his decision--and his alone--to make. If the people \naffected by the decision don't like it, they have a recourse. Their \nrecourse comes every other November in the voting booth. Under my \nlegislation, the Secretary and his boss, the President of the United \nStates, will be held politically accountable for their decision.\n  Throughout my legislation everyday citizens are included in the \nprocess. Contrary to old ways of thinking, I believe that people, their \nfamilies, and local communities know best. They know how to run things \nbetter than Washington, DC bureaucrats. To some people--especially for \nthe opponents of change--this is a revolutionary way of thinking. For \nme, and for the people I have been fighting alongside for 7 years, \nthese are not revolutionary ideas. It is just the way it should be.\n\n\n               administration's 10 esa reform principles\n\n  Two short months ago, after years of insisting that the ESA did not \nneed to be reformed, the administration put forward 10 principles for \nESA reforms. When I read the reforms, I found myself nodding in \nagreement with each one. ``Minimize Social and Economic Impacts of the \nAct'' reads one. This Senator certainly agrees with that principle. \n``Base ESA Decisions on Sound and Objective Science'' reads another. I \nagree with this principle too. In fact, Senator Johnston, Senator \nShelby, and I, agreed with each and every principle put forward by the \nadministration and included them in our legislation. I applaud the \nadministration for recognizing that the act must be reformed.\n\n\n                       people must be considered\n\n  The fundamental flaw of the current act is that it does not consider \npeople. In the case of the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest, \npeople, their jobs, and their communities were not considered at all in \nthe decisionmaking process. Their life's work was denigrated. Their \nviews were not considered. Their Federal Government did not care about \ntheir plight.\n  The decisions we must make to protect endangered or threatened \nspecies will involve choices. Sometimes these choices will be easy, and \nmost often they will not. But we must give the people whose lives are \ndirectly affected by these decisions an opportunity to have their \nvoices heard. To know that they have a say in the decisions that will \nforever change their lives.\n  Six years ago, I wish that the people in timber communities in my \nState had the opportunity to have a say in the decisionmaking process. \nTo tell the Secretary on how their lives would forever be changed by \nhis decision. Maybe the Secretary would have ignored their views, but \nat least they could say that they had given it a shot. That they had \nparticipated in the process. That they went down swinging. But they \nwere not given that opportunity.\n  We must change the act to give people the opportunity to be heard.\n  I recall again, Bill Pickell's request of me last month at my timber \nfamily hearing:\n\n       The people in this room do not want a handout. They don't \n     want a government program. They want to take care of their \n     neighbors, help their community spring back to life. They \n     want to work.\n\n  A simple, heartfelt plea that speaks more eloquently than I can about \nthe need for us to bring balance to this act. To give communities \nacross our Nation the ability to work, to provide for their families, \nand be productive members of our society.\n  The debate that we will have this year will be about choices. Choices \nthat will impact people's lives, their families, their communities. \nThis Senator believes that the people who are directly affected by \nthese decisions should have the opportunity to be heard. That is what \nmy legislation seeks to accomplish, and I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in this effort.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the defenders of the current wording of \nthe Endangered Species Act have engaged in a desperate attempt over the \npast few years to claim that the act is flexible, that it takes account \nof human economic and social needs and that it actually works at \nrecovering species. They are dead wrong on each of these points. The \nESA currently takes almost no account of human economic concerns, \nprovides less flexibility for private land owners than for Federal \nagencies, and is an open-ended statute with no focus on the recovery of \nendangered species.\n  Less than 20 species have ever been delisted and most of these \nactions were the result of listing errors. The effort to reform this \nlaw is about bringing flexibility, common sense and effectiveness to \nthe statute. Something \n [[Page S6342]]  that is sorely lacking under the current law. With \n4,000 listed and candidate species and virtually the entire country \ncovered by the range of one or more endangered species, the imperative \nto act to change the law has never been stronger.\n  As currently constructed, the bill makes many needed changes to what \nis, in its design and application, a misguided and overly broad \nstatute. The current law provides no mandatory requirement for the \nindependent review of the science supporting listing decisions. This \nlegislation would make such a peer review mandatory, upon request of an \naffected party. In addition, the bill would create a binding \nconservation and recovery plan for each listed species.\n  Currently, recovery plans are not required for each listed species \nand have no binding effect on the Secretary of Interior even when they \nare promulgated. As a result, a species listing becomes an open ended \ncommitment with no focus on recovering and ultimately delisting a \nspecies.\n  The bill also provides important flexibility and discretion to the \nSecretary of the Interior in carrying out the requirements of the act.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary will be given broad discretion \nas to how to proceed with a species' recovery or to decide whether \nrecovery is at all feasible for some species. In addition, the \nSecretary will be given the authority to issue regional exemptions from \nthe take provisions of the act for particular activities that may or \nmay not affect the habitat of a given species. Such an exemption \nprocess could have dramatic effects in preventing future regional train \nwrecks where entire categories of commercial activities are halted by a \nspecies listing.\n  The bill also narrows the definition of harm to a species back to its \ncongressionally intended scope of meaning actual injury to a member of \nspecies. The current broad interpretation of ``take'' under the act is \nthe single most egregious provision in the law with respect to \nassaulting the property rights of individuals caught in the path of the \nESA.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention that I do not regard \nthis bill as perfect legislation, but instead as an excellent starting \npoint for reform.\n  Indeed, I would have liked for this legislation to include more \nsubstantive protections under the act for private property owners. \nComprehensive private property rights legislation becoming law is far \nfrom guaranteed in this Congress and I believe that this legislation \nshould have included a provision to compensate property owners for lost \nland value as a result of the act. Eighty-five percent of the land in \nAlabama is privately owned and the State is fourth in the Nation in \ncandidate and listed species.\n  These two statistics speak volumes for the concerns I have about \nprotecting private property rights.\n  In addition, I would have preferred that the legislation eliminate \nthe ability of the Interior Department to list population segments of \nlarger, healthy species. In Alabama, and across the country, a \nsubstantial percentage of new listings and proposed listings deal with \narcane population segments like snuffbox mussels and shoal sprite \nsnails.\n  Preserving these population segments is less often about concerns for \nthe larger species and more likely to be a convenient way to slow or \nimpede commercial activity. Not surprisingly, the Fish and Wildlife \nService was prepared last year to list the Alabama Sturgeon as a \npopulation segment after failing for years to establish it as a \ndistinct species.\n  However, we have a long way to go in this process and as part of the \nteam effort to reform the ESA, I will work to further strengthen this \nlegislation in concert with my colleagues here today.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \ncolleagues, Senator Gorton and Senator Shelby, in introducing the \nEndangered Species Act Reform Amendments of 1995. This is the first \nstep in reforming and reauthorizing a law that, although well-\nintentioned, has proven to be unworkable and unnecessarily burdensome. \nOur purpose is to address the very real shortcomings of the law while \nmaintaining our Nation's commitment to the vitality of our living \nnatural resources.\n  Mr. President, Louisiana has plenty of experience with the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Its provisions have been applied with respect to the \nLouisiana black bear, the red cockaded woodpecker, and several species \nof sea turtles. My experience is that the act sometimes requires \nprivate parties to take extraordinary and unreasonable actions, such as \nthe overly burdensome measures that are imposed on the shrimping \nindustry with respect to the sea turtle. The result is that the act has \nbecome enormously unpopular with large groups of our citizens, \nparticularly in the West and Southeast, which the Act has been applied \nmost frequently.\n  Since I entered the Senate in 1972, I have witnessed the evolution of \nthe Endangered Species Act from a noncontroversial bill that passed the \nSenate by voice vote in 1973 to our most restrictive and controversial \nenvironmental law. I particularly remember the prolonged controversy \nthat arose when a creature known as a snail darter was discovered late \nin the construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee. As some of my \ncolleagues may recall, that led to the Supreme Court's decision in TVA \nversus Hill, which held that the Endangered Species Act is supreme to \nall other Federal, State, and local law. Congress then created the so-\ncalled ``God Committee'' to resolve conflicts between the act and other \nnational goals, but this mechanism has proved to be almost entirely \nunworkable. Ironically, the only good news is that the snail darter has \nbeen found in many others rivers since the battle over the Tellico Dam.\n  The time has come to thoroughly reexamine the act and its \nimplementation. The act has been due for reauthorization since 1993, \nand we should delay no further. I intend to do everything I can to \nenact legislation in 1995, and I believe that it is vitally important \nthat the debate be conducted on a solidly bipartisan basis. Although I \nhave no doubt that there is room for improvement in the bill, I think \nit is a sound starting point for that debate.\n  As we begin the process of reforming this enormously complex law, we \nshould be guided by certain principles that I believe we all share. \nSecretary Babbitt did an admirable job of articulating a set of \nprinciples in his March 6 publication, ``Protecting America's Living \nHeritage: a Fair, Cooperative, and Scientifically Sound Approach to \nImproving the Endangered Species Act.''\n  Those 10 principles are:\n  First, Base ESA decisions on sound and objective science; second, \nminimize social and economic impacts; third, provide quick, responsive \nanswers and certainty to landowners; fourth, treat landowners fairly \nand with consideration; fifth, create incentives for landowners to \nconserve species; sixth, make effective use of limited public and \nprivate resources by focusing on groups of species dependent on the \nsame habitat; seventh, prevent species from beginning endangered or \nthreatened; eighth, promptly recover the delist threatened and \nendangered species; ninth, promote efficiency and consistency; and \nlast, provide State, tribal, and local governments with opportunities \nto play a greater role in carrying out the ESA.\n  I believe that our bill reflects these principles. However, I \nunderstand that the devil is in the details, and am quite open to \nsuggested modifications that will better achieve these principles.\n  Although I will not attempt to summarize the entire bill, there are \nseveral provisions that should be emphasized. First, the bill requires \nthat the decision to list a species be based solely on sound science, \nand that the science be independently peer-reviewed. Specifically, the \nSecretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may \nbe, appoints a three-person peer review panel from among qualified \npersons recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. As my \ncolleagues know, the promotion of sound science is a high priority of \nmine, and there is no place where science is more important than in \nimplementing the Endangered Species Act.\n  Second, the bill instills political accountability by requiring the \nSecretary to establish a specific conservation objective for each \nlisted species. Before we expend tens of millions of public and private \ndollars on efforts to restore a particular species, we need a high-\nranking member of the Federal \n [[Page S6343]]  Government to stand up and take responsibility for \nthat decision. We need the official to explain to us why the species is \nimportant. And if the species is important, we need that official to \nset forth a conservation plan, based on the best reasonably obtainable \nscience, that will actually achieve that conservation goal. And if the \nspecies is important, and there is a conservation plan that will \nactually work, we need to know that the Secretary has formulated that \nplan after considering the economic and social impacts of the plan.\n  Third, the bill encourages and facilitates cooperative actions \nbetween the Federal Government and States, local governments, and the \nprivate sector to conserve species without the need to trigger the more \nrestrictive provisions of the act. The most effective and efficient way \nto protect species is to take cooperative measures as early as \npossible, before a species declines to the point that more restrictive \nand expensive steps are needed.\n  Finally, I want to mention a matter that we are not addressing in the \nbill. At least one of the outside groups urging reform of the ESA asked \nSenator Gorton and me to include a provision that would have \ncompensated private landowners whose property values are lowered by the \nrestrictions of the act. I concluded, and Senator Gorton concurred, \nthat this legislation is not the place to try to resolve the incredibly \ncomplex issue of when to compensate landowners for reductions in \nproperty value due to governmental regulations. That issue cuts across \nall of our environmental laws, not just the ESA, and it should be \naddressed in that larger context. Furthermore, I believe that the \nreforms of the act that we are proposing in this bill, along with the \nrequirement that the bill be administered so as to minimize impacts on \nprivate property, will greatly reduce the frequency and severity of the \nimpacts of the act on the value of private property.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Gorton and Senator Shelby, the \nmembers of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and other \ninterested Senators to revise the ESA in a way that allows us to \neffectively protect our natural heritage without imposing unnecessary \nburdens on our citizens. The present act is not working, and failure to \naddress its problems can only lead to further crisis and confrontation, \nfollowed by calls to scrap the act altogether. The bill we are \nintroducing today marks the opening of the debate on how to reform the \nESA so as to save it. This bill is a work in progress, and I invite all \ninterested parties to contribute their efforts toward improving it as \nwe move through the legislative process.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this morning, the Senator from Washington \nState, Senator Gorton, introduced his reauthorization of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. I would just like to make a few comments about that act \nand also the amendments that will be offered in its reauthorization.\n  Congress was scheduled to reauthorize it this year and, of course, \nlast year, and it has been a while since it has been done. I think it \nis about time that this Congress take a look at the Endangered Species \nAct and try to make it more workable.\n  Currently, there are about 60 listed or candidate species in Montana \non the Endangered Species Act. There always seems to be new species \nfrom some group that wants it put on the list just about every week. In \na recent effort by a group based in Colorado, they want the black-\ntailed prairie dog placed on the candidate list. This petition is \nrelated to the black-footed ferret.\n  If you want to hear some stories about one act and how it impacts a \nState or community, we can probably write an entire book about this. \nBut our largest industry in the State of Montana is agriculture. If you \nask Montana farmers and ranchers what law they want Congress to fix, \nmost will say this act, the Endangered Species Act. If you are in the \nwestern part of the State, near the wood products industry and those \nfolks that work in the woods, and you ask them what law needs fixing, \nthey would also reply the Endangered Species Act, because half of the \neconomy of western Montana is based on wood products. They will tell \nyou a lot of stories about infringing on their ability to make a living \nfor their families, about the grizzly bears, the road closures, and \nonce again, coming back to the old Endangered Species Act.\n  There is no doubt that we must reform the law. It is the single most \nrestrictive law that Montanans and other Americans who rely on the land \nto make a living must deal with. The communities in Montana lack the \neconomic stability and the predictability that they deserve.\n  When we have 38 percent total land mass in one State that belongs to \nthe Federal Government, it is hard to find that stability and \npredictability about the policies carried out on those public lands. \nThe current law has many communities in Montana and throughout our \nNation living on pins and needles. Jobs have been lost because of this \nact. The bottom line, of course, is the economic well-being of \ncommunities, and our communities are suffering.\n  We need to change the act, that it really does protect the species \nand recover species, that it does not cost millions of dollars per \nspecies and it will protect the private property rights and also \nperhaps bring some economic viability and predictability to our \ncommunities.\n  This act should be amended so we can recognize species in trouble and \nemphasize restoring the populations to healthy levels. Emphasis must be \nplaced on recovery, however.\n  The current law emphasizes the listing of species instead of \nprotecting and recovering species. In order to do this, the new act \nshould contain the following principles. The new act needs to be \namended so it is based on better science. We know that our science has \nnot been too good in the past. Peer review procedures need to be added \nto improve the overall data collected so that the right decision can be \nmade, or at least to arrive at some decision based on proper science. \nWe must have these decisions made outside of politics, and instead done \nby objective individuals who have a background in that science.\n  As I stated earlier, above all, we must concentrate our efforts on \nrecovery plans. I think if we want a simplified solution to it, we have \nto decouple the listing process from the recovery process. If we do \nthat, we would focus on the least costly alternative and we would have \naccess to impacting the decisions made under the act, and of course \ntake into consideration local economics.\n  In addition, this would force priorities to be set and would generate \nrecovery plans which are reasonable. And yes, they are attainable. I \nthink that is very, very important. The decoupling process may be the \ntoughest part of this entire debate.\n  The best decisions are those that are made at the local level. I \nbelieve we need increased private participation in our conservation \nefforts. The fact is that local individuals are the best people to \nsupport any kind of a conservation plan. We are finding that out now, \nwith the farm bill, in the 1985 farm bill, which required conservation \nplans on farms and ranches in order to participate in the farm program.\n  We need people who live and work in the areas that are affected, \nbecause they have a stake in what happens in their own backyard. \nWashington should not forget that these people want to maintain the \nquality of life that they have for their families now.\n  The act should encourage cooperative management agreements for non-\nFederal efforts. We just talked this morning about several activities \ngoing on in Montana that have the cooperation not only of private \nlandowners, but also several environmental groups and Federal land \nmanagement agencies that are cooperating now in order to provide the \nbest use of a natural resource on public lands, but also to protect the \nenvironment and hang onto the economic viability of the area. Just to \nmention a couple, there are Willow Creek and Fleecer up in Montana and, \nof course, the Blackfoot challenge that we talked about this morning in \nour office.\n  However, we cannot solely rely on these cooperative management \nagreements. Some landowners and communities will not have the resources \nto pay for some of these agreements.\n  It is in these instances that the Federal Government will have to \nplay a larger role. Local involvement is still essential to carry out \nthe objectives of recovering species. Any proposal \n [[Page S6344]]  should require local public hearings in the affected \ncommunities.\n  Local communities must be given the opportunity to express their \nsupport, comments and, yes, their areas of concern. Also, the \nconservation and recovery process must recognize State and local laws. \nFederal agencies should not be allowed to run roughshod over State \nmanagement agencies, State laws, or their agreements.\n  Without a doubt, compensation must be given individuals who lose the \nuse of their private property under a Federal Government conservation \nplan. Our Constitution and property rights need protection on every \nfront. Anything short of that is selling our constitutional rights down \nthe river.\n  It is also, if one has to wonder why we take property rights so \nseriously, because when we pass that property on to our children and \nour offspring, it is our only thing that we can pass along to them that \nensures their freedom for generations to come.\n  The Endangered Species Act has a good goal. It does make everyone \naware of the world. However, since it has become law, it has been \ntwisted and misused for other purposes.\n  We need some common sense to put back in not only recovering the \nspecies but also taking into account the human factor. After all, part \nof the system, the ecosystem, is man himself. Starting from a new \nviewpoint in crafting the act, which would truly reflect what we want \nto do is to conserve and recover the species, has to be the focus.\n  It cannot let the existing law and regulations run multiple use off \nof our lands. Most of our lands are under multiple use, use for the \nhighest economic benefit. Of course, most of the time, that is either \nlogging, mining, running of livestock, or grazing, but sometimes it is \nalso recreation. Even recreation can be in conflict with the recovery \nof the Endangered Species Act.\n  The bill, introduced by Senators Gorton, Johnston, and Shelby, is a \ngood starting point. I have added my name as a cosponsor because I am \nvery supportive of this process moving forward. I am supportive of the \nbasic concepts of this reform bill.\n  The bill makes sure that better science is used. It provides peer \nreview. It also allows for more local participation incentives and non-\nFederal efforts, and encourages cooperative agreements and habitat \nconservation plans.\n  This bill places the emphasis on recognizing the species that are in \ntrouble, coming up with a plan to protect them, and most importantly, \nrecovering the species.\n  We have a great job ahead of Members. It takes a great deal of \ncooperation between private landowners, Government agencies, and State \nand local communities in order to get it done. However, I am a \nsupporter of the bill.\n  I have some reservations about it. The current act is complicated. I \nwould like to see it reformed, simplified, and made easier for \nlandowners and people who use the public lands to be in compliance with \nthe law.\n  Basically, the law needs to be streamlined. I also strongly believe \nin private property compensation if the need arises. The bill ensures \nthat people are not denied reasonable use of their property. However, \nthere is no compensation provision. The consultation provision needs to \nbe strengthened. There are just too many instances where other Federal \nagencies cannot use plain old common sense because the Interior or \nCommerce Departments will not let them, based on this and other areas \nof the law which I think we need to take a closer look at.\n  I am glad that we have finally started moving the process forward. I \nam thankful for the work that has been done by the sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, I have made a request to Senator Kempthorne that a \nhearing on this issue be held in the State of Montana. I do not know \nwhether there is a State in the Union that is impacted more by this \naction than the State of Montana. After all, we have been dealing with \nthe grizzly bear a long, long time.\n  By the way, the recovery has been very successful. In fact, \nbiologically, the animal now can be delisted and taken off the list of \nthose endangered.\n  I hope this summer Senator Kempthorne's Subcommittee on Clean Water, \nFisheries and Wildlife will be able to come to my home State of Montana \nand hear the testimony from us folks who live in Montana.\n  Reforming the Endangered Species Act is essential. It is essential to \nour economy. Our four largest industries, agriculture, timber, mining, \nand oil and gas, rely on the use of those lands. It is these industries \nwhich supply the jobs and the tax base for the State of Montana.\n  Changing the laws on conserving and recovering endangered species is \nimportant for jobs for Montana. It is important for sound land \nmanagement activities. It is time we took a look at this area. I want \nto reiterate on how, possibly, we can make the act work. There has to \nbe a different process of listing a species and then the process of how \nto recover the species.\n  Right now the law is pretty hard and tough. Once a species is listed \nas threatened or endangered, the law kicks in and kicks out all \nconversation or any flexibility, in order to recover the species \nwithout large impacts where the species is to be recovered.\n  I applaud my colleagues for their work on this bill. I am a cosponsor \nof it. It is a bill that needs reforming and the time has come.\n  I urge all my colleagues in the Senate to get involved in this debate \nand let us reform the Endangered Species Act so it will work for this \ncountry and the species we are trying to recover.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 769. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to limit \nthe value of certain real and personal property that the debtor may \nelect to exempt under State or local law, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                      bankruptcy abuse reform act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--the \nBankruptcy Abuse Reform Act of 1995--to address a problem that \nthreatens Americans' confidence in our Bankruptcy Code. The measure \nwould cap at $100,000 the State homestead exemption that an individual \nfiling for personal bankruptcy can claim. Let me tell you why this \nlegislation is critically needed.\n  In chapter 7 Federal personal bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is \nallowed to exempt certain possessions and interests from being used to \nsatisfy his outstanding debts. One of the chief things that a debtor \nseeks to protect is his home, and I agree with that in principle. Few \nquestion that debtors should be able to keep roofs over their heads. \nBut in practice this homestead exemption has become a source of abuse.\n  Under section 522 of the code, a debtor may opt to exempt his home \naccording to local, State or Federal bankruptcy provisions. The Federal \nexemption allows the debtor to shield up to $15,000 of value in his \nhouse. The State exemptions vary tremendously: some States do not allow \nthe debtor to exempt any of his home's value, while a few States allow \nan unlimited exemption. The vast majority of States have exemptions of \nunder $40,000.\n  My amendment to section 522 would cap State exemptions so that no \ndebtor could ever exempt more than $100,000 of the value of his home.\n  Mr. President, in the last few years, the ability of debtors to use \nState homestead exemptions has led to flagrant abuses of the Bankruptcy \nCode. Multimillionaire debtors have moved to one of the 8 States that \nhave unlimited exemptions--most often Florida or Texas--bought multi-\nmillion-dollar houses, and continued to live like kings even after \ndeclaring bankruptcy. This shameless manipulation of the Bankruptcy \nCode cheats creditors out of compensation and rewards only those whose \nlawyers can game the system. Oftentimes, the creditor who is robbed is \nthe American taxpayer. In recent years, S swindlers, insider trading \nconvicts, and other shady characters have managed to protect their ill-\ngotten gains through this loophole.\n  One infamous S banker with more than $4 billion in claims against \nhim bought a multi-million-dollar horse ranch in Florida. Another man \nwho pled guilty to insider trading abuses lives in a 7,000-square-foot \nbeachfront home worth $3.25 million, all tucked away from the $2.75 \nbillion in suits against him. These deadbeats get wealthier while \nlegitimate creditors--including the U.S. Government--get the short end \nof the stick.\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\n  Simply put, the current practice is grossly unfair and contravenes \nthe intent of our laws: People are supposed to get a fresh start, not a \nhead start, under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  In addition, these unlimited homestead exemptions have made it \nincreasingly difficult for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nand the Resolution Trust Corporation to go after S crooks. With the \nS crisis costing us billions of dollars and with a deficit that \nremains out of control, we owe it to the taxpayers to make it as hard \nas possible for those responsible to profit from their wrongs.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I have introduced today is simple, \neffective, and straightforward. It caps the homestead exemption at \n$100,000, which is close to the average price of an American house. And \nit will protect middle class Americans while preventing the abuses that \nare making the American middle class question the integrity of our \nlaws.\n  Indeed, it is even generous to debtors. Other than the eight States \nthat have no limit to the homestead exemption, no State has a homestead \nexemption exceeding $100,000. In fact, 38 States have exemptions of \n$40,000 or less. My own home State of Wisconsin has a $40,000 exemption \nand that, in my opinion, is more than sufficient.\n  Mr. President, this proposal is an effort to make our bankruptcy laws \nmore equitable. We owe it to the average American to ensure that the \nBankruptcy Code is more than just a beachball for millionaires who want \nto protect their assets. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nmeasure, and I ask that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 522 of title 11, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(2)(A) by inserting ``subject to \n     subsection (n),'' after ``(2)(A)'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) As a result of electing under subsection (b)(2)(A) to \n     exempt property under State or local law, the debtor may not \n     exempt an aggregate interest of more than $100,000 in value \n     in real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent \n     of the debtor uses as a residence, in a cooperative that owns \n     property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as \n     a residence, or in a burial plot for the debtor or a \n     dependent of the debtor.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inouye, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Brown, Mr. Mack, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. \n        Bradley):\n  S. 770. A bill to provide for the relocation of the United States \nEmbassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for other purposes; ordered held at \nthe desk.\n\n\n            Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, the Senator from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, and others, \nto move the United States Embassy in Israel to the capital of \nJerusalem. I am pleased to be joined by a number of my colleagues, and \nI ask unanimous consent at this time that when I send the bill to the \ndesk, it be held at the desk until noon tomorrow for additional \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I know the interest in this legislation is \nconsiderable, and that is why I have asked it be held at the desk.\n  The issue of Jerusalem has many elements--emotional, religious, \ncultural, spiritual, historical, and political. Jerusalem may be the \nmost remarkable city in the world. Three of the world's great religions \nhave roots in Jerusalem. No other city has been the capital of the same \ncountry, inhabited by the same people speaking the same language \nworshipping the same God today as it was 3,000 years ago. And yet the \nUnited States does not maintain its Embassy in Jerusalem.\n  This issue of where to place the American Embassy in Israel has a \nlong history in the United States Congress. Successive Congresses and \nsuccessive administrations have been on opposite sides.\n  At the outset, I want to commend the leadership of some of my \ncolleagues on this issue, in particular Senator Moynihan and\n Senator D'Amato. They have led congressional efforts to relocate the \nU.S. Embassy for many years.\n\n  Years ago, I was one of those who expressed concerns about the timing \nof proposals to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I \nfelt that doing so could have undermined our efforts and ability to act \nas a peacemaker. However, much has changed since those earlier efforts. \nThe Soviet Union is gone. We successfully waged war--with Arab allies--\nto liberate Kuwait. Jordan and the PLO have joined Egypt in beginning a \nformal peace process with Israel. The peace process has made great \nstrides and our commitment to that process is unchallengeable. Delaying \nthe process of moving the Embassy now only sends a signal of false \nhopes.\n  I was proud to join with 92 of my colleagues--Republican and \nDemocratic--in signing the D'Amato-Moynihan letter last March urging \nthe administration to move our Embassy no later than May 1999. As the \nletter pointed out to Secretary Christopher, the United States enjoys \ndiplomatic relations with 184 countries--but Israel is the only country \nin which our Embassy is not located in the functioning capital.\n  Yesterday, I met with Prime Minister Rabin, and we discussed this \nlegislation. As Prime Minister Rabin said after our meeting, the people \nof Israel ``would welcome recognition of the fact that Jerusalem is the\n capital'' of Israel, and ``we will welcome embassies that will come.''\n\n  The time has come to move beyond letters, expressions of support and \nsense of the Congress resolutions. The time has come to enact \nlegislation that will get the job done--to move the United States \nEmbassy in Israel to Jerusalem by May 1999. The Jerusalem Embassy \nRelocation Act of 1995 is that legislation.\n  This is not a partisan effort, and this is not an effort to undermine \nthe peace process. Democrats have historically supported efforts to \nmove the Embassy. In fact, as the Democratic leader Tom Daschle pointed \nout in a speech last night, support for moving the Embassy to Jerusalem \nhas been in the Democratic Party's platform since 1968. It has been in \nthe Republican platform for many years as well.\n  Placing the American Embassy in Jerusalem is an idea whose time has \ncome. Construction will take time, but we should begin soon. The fact \nis that Jerusalem has been and should remain the undivided capital of \nIsrael. Let me close by quoting from a speech I gave 18 years ago in \nJerusalem:\n\n       In the search for a solution to the dilemma which Israel's \n     first President called ``a conflict of right with right,'' \n     whatever else may be negotiable, the capital of Israel \n     clearly is not.\n  Let me also thank my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who has \nactually been in the forefront of this legislation, who had the initial \nidea. We have been working with him and now put together, I believe, \nlegislation that can be sponsored or cosponsored by nearly all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. We certainly welcome cosponsors. \nThe legislation will be held at the desk under the previous consent \nagreement until noon tomorrow. So anybody wishing to cosponsor the \nlegislation just notify the clerk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  S. 770, the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995\n\n       Provides that construction begin on a new United States \n     Embassy in Jerusalem in 1996, and the new Embassy open by May \n     31, 1999.\n       Section 1 states the short title of the legislation is the \n     Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995.\n       Section 2 states Congressional findings on the history and \n     status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n       Section 3 establishes a timetable for the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy including groundbreaking by December \n     31, 1996, and official opening no later than May 31, 1999. \n     Section 3(b) withholds 50% (approximately $200-250 million) \n     of fiscal year 1997 \n      [[Page S6346]]  State Department foreign construction funds \n     until the Secretary of State determines and reports to \n     Congress that construction has begun. Section 3(c) withholds \n     50% of fiscal year 1999 foreign construction funds until the \n     Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that \n     the embassy has opened.\n       Section 4 earmarks $5 million of already appropriated \n     fiscal year 1995 funds for immediate costs associated with \n     relocating the Embassy.\n       Section 5 authorizes $25 million for fiscal year 1996 and \n     $75 million for fiscal year 1997. Estimates are based on new \n     embassy construction in a high-threat area.\n       Section 6 requires a report within 30 days by the Secretary \n     of State detailing the Department's plan to implement the \n     Act, including estimated dates of completion and costs.\n       Section 7 requires semiannual reports to Congress on \n     implementation of the Act.\n       Section 8 defines ``United States Embassy'' to include both \n     the offices of the diplomatic mission and the residence of \n     the chief of mission.\n                  moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a member of the committee to commemorate--\nin 1996--the 3,000th anniversary of Jerusalem as the capital of the \nJewish people, I am pleased to join Senator Dole and introduce the \nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995, to begin \nimmediate construction on a United States Embassy in Jerusalem.\n  It is historic and important that the majority leader and the Speaker \nof the House are the primary sponsors of this legislation in the Senate \nand House.\n  For three millennia--since King David established Jerusalem as the \ncapital of the Jewish people--Jerusalem has been the center of Jewish \nliturgy. Twice a year, for the last 2,000 years, Jews from around the \nworld have offered a simple prayer: ``Next Year in Jerusalem.''\n  And throughout the Jewish people's long exile from the land of \nIsrael, through the Holocaust, pogroms, and countless expulsions the \n``City Upon a Hill'' served as the focal point of their aspiration to \nrebuild Israel.\n  In addition to Israel's undisputable historical and biblical claim to \nJerusalem, upon regaining control over East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel \nhas restored the holy city as a place open to all for worship.\n  Memories may be short, but it is important to remember that while \nJordan occupied East Jerusalem--1948-1967--Jews were expelled and many \nChristians, feeling persecuted, emigrated. During this period, proper \nrespect was not given to the spiritual importance of the city. A \nhighway was even built on ancient burial grounds and religious sites \ndesecrated.\n  Yet, successive United States administrations since 1948--for fear of \ninterfering with the ability of the United States to serve as an honest \nbroker for Arab and Israeli claims--have refused to recognize Israeli \nsovereignty over Jerusalem, and have refused to locate the United \nStates Embassy in the capital of Israel. While there is superficial \nlogic to that concern, I believe it bases United States policy on a \ndisingenuous position--that if Arab leaders hold out long enough, the \nUnited States might abandon our ally and force it to do the one thing \nIsrael has made clear it will never do--abandon its claim to Jerusalem \nas its eternal and undivided capital.\n  The fact is, the United States will not do that. Better that all \nparties understand that at the outset, rather than learning it at the \nunsuccessful conclusions of negotiations.\n  United States Middle East diplomacy should be based on honesty and on \nthe power and loyalty to our friends and our principles. Moving the \nEmbassy to Jerusalem should aid in any peace between Israel and her \nneighbors by sending a clear, unambiguous message that the status of \nJerusalem is not and never will be negotiable.\n  Israel cannot under any circumstances negotiate this issue any more \nthan Americans would negotiate over Washington being our Capital.\n  Moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem does no injustice to \nthe Arab people, nor is it intended, in any way, to be disrespectful to \nthem. During the hundreds of years in which Jerusalem was under Arab or \nMoslem rule, Jerusalem never served as a capital city for the rulers. \nAnd while East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, Jordan's capital \nremained in Amman and was never moved to Jerusalem. Islam's holiest \ntext, the Koran, does not mention Jerusalem a single time.\n  Even Moslems who pray at the Al-Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem face Mecca \nwhen they pray. No one can dispute, however, the historical and \nspiritual vitality of Jerusalem to Israel.\n  It is time for the United States to locate its embassy in the capital \ncity of Israel, as is the case for every other country that the United \nStates recognizes, whether it be ally or enemy.\n  Those who have expressed support for United States recognition of \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel now have a way to convert words to \naction, by supporting the Dole-Kyl-Inouye resolution, so that \nconstruction of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem will commence in \ntime for the city's 3,000 year anniversary as the capital of the people \nof Israel. ``Next Year in Jerusalem.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, as an original cosponsor of the \nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995.\n  It is outrageous that the United States has diplomatic relations with \n184 countries throughout the world and in every one, but Israel, our \nEmbassy is in the functioning capital. In Israel, our Embassy is in Tel \nAviv. I see no reason why this should be the case. It is wrong and it \nmust end now. Jerusalem should not be thrown around like a bone to \nYasir Arafat.\n  Israel has endured much throughout her history and for her to have to \nsuffer the indignity of her main ally refusing to place its Embassy in \nher functioning capital is an insult. With the exception of the Sinai \ngiven back under the treaty with Egypt, she has had to fight again and \nagain for the same pieces of land. Jerusalem, however, is a different \ncase. Jerusalem, the holy city and ancient capital of Israel, must \nnever again become divided.\n  It was for this reason that Senator Moynihan, myself, and 91 other \nMembers of the Senate sent a joint letter to the Secretary of State \nurging him to begin planning now for the relocation of the Embassy to \nJerusalem by no later than May 1999. This letter was sent in March of \nthis year. To date, there has been no reply. This is unfortunate.\n  The matter is simple. Jerusalem is and will remain the permanent and \nundivided capital of a sovereign Israel. I'm not going to let the State \nDepartment bureaucrats forget that.\n  I call on the President to recognize this and to begin the process \ntoward moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. It is shameful that the \nUnited States continues to bend to pressure to place the American \nEmbassy in Tel Aviv and not in Jerusalem.\n  Mr. President, while I understand that the present negotiations are \ndelicate, I do not want this administration to be under the impression \nthat Jerusalem is some prize to be claimed by the Palestinians or \nanyone else. Let the message be clear: A united Jerusalem is off limits \nfor negotiation. Jerusalem belongs to Israel and our Embassy belongs in \nJerusalem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and I urge its \nswift passage so that our Embassy in Israel can finally be rightfully \nlocated in Jerusalem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks appear in the \nRecord along with those of Senator Dole and the other cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nDole, is right on target with his legislation to move the United States \nEmbassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Action by Congress is long overdue, \nand I'm delighted to be a principal cosponsor of Senator Dole's \nlegislation.\n  There has been some murmuring during the past few days by those who \noppose moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nTheir contention is that this is a sensitive time in the peace process. \nFair enough, but I need to be informed as to when no sensitive time in \nthe peace process exists.\n  I remember well a time in 1988 when I offered legislation to move the \nUnited States Embassy to Jerusalem. After extensive negotiations with \nthe Department of State--that also was a sensitive time in the peace \nprocess--we ended with what I understood to be an agreement to acquire \nland for an Embassy in Jerusalem. I am sorry to hear that my efforts of \n1988 are being used \n [[Page S6347]]  today as an argument against passage of the \nlegislation before us today.\n  Mr. President, the mere acquisition of land in Jerusalem is not \nenough. My purpose then, as now, was to get the United States Embassy \nto Jerusalem, not to begin real estate negotiations.\n  The point, Mr. President, is this: There is only one nation in this \nworld where the United States mission is not in the capital city, and \nthat is Israel.\n  Jerusalem, the Holy City, was divided by barbed wire for almost two \ndecades. Worshippers were denied access to the Holy places under \nJordanian rule in East Jerusalem. In the 28 years during which Israel \nhas presided over a united city of Jerusalem, the rights of Christians, \nJews and Moslems have been fully respected.\n  Time and again, the Senate has voted overwhelmingly in favor of \nrecognizing United Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.\n  I commend Senator Dole for his leadership in this and other matters.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 771. A bill to provide that certain Federal property shall be made \navailable to States for State use before being made available to other \nentities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                      surplus property legislation\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter that \nreceives far too little attention here in Washington, but is of vital \nimportance to all of our States. I am speaking about the surplus \nproperty donated by the Federal Government to various entities.\n  As my colleagues know, once a Federal agency has decided that a desk \nor a computer or some other item of personal property has been declared \n``excess'' to that agency, that piece of property is then offered to \nother Federal agencies for their use. If no other Federal agency has a \nneed for that property, then the surplus property can be donated to the \nStates or other entities for their use. In 1992, 603 million dollars \nworth of surplus property was sent to the States.\n  Mr. President, the surplus property that goes to our States is very \nimportant to local jurisdictions throughout the country. For example, \nthe State of Arkansas has received high quality equipment that enables \nlocal jurisdictions to fight forest fires, carry out rescue operations, \nand repair State and county highways. In each and every State, this \nsurplus property, from trucks to air compressors, provides critical \nequipment to help jurisdictions to carry out their programs. \nFurthermore, the local jurisdictions receive this equipment at a vastly \nreduced rate which provides some much-needed financial relief to their \nbudgets.\n  However, as a result of years of legislation amending the property \ndisposal program, States are being denied some useful and desirable \nsurplus property. While these legislative initiatives were well-\nintended, they changed the priorities and placed other entities at the \nfront of the line, limiting the property available to States.\n  For example, in 1986, the Defense authorization bill contained a \nprovision that permitted the Pentagon to make some of its excess \nsupplies available for humanitarian relief. Originally, this program \nwas designed to assist the refugee and resistance groups in \nAfghanistan. While this program had a very modest beginning, and \ninvolved only 4 million dollars worth of property the first year, which \nwas mainly clothing, this program has grown rapidly. Some 25,802 items, \nworth $227 million, were shipped in 1993. Today, our States are \nconcerned that they are losing opportunities to bid on Federal surplus \nproperty. While none of our States object to shipping surplus blankets \nand food items to needy people, this program has expanded and now \nincludes heavy construction equipment as well. These road graders, \nfront loaders, and pick-up trucks were bought and paid for by U.S. \ntaxpayers, but our States did not even get to look at them. This is the \ntype of surplus property that the States would very much like to \nreceive.\n  Mr. President, I share the concern of our States about this program. \nWhile I am glad that our Nation can assist refugees around the world \nwith blankets and surplus food, I think the time has come to examine \nthis donation program. A program that began by shipping clothes to one \nor two countries now involves hundreds of millions of dollars worth of \nitems going to 117 countries. We already have a number of foreign-aid \nprograms and I do not think we should operate yet another one out of \nthe Pentagon.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I have heard of sketchy reports that \nquite often this excess equipment is not being used by the recipient \ncountry. There are basically two ways that this well-intended program \nmay be abused. First of all, this equipment can be sold immediately by \nthe recipient nation. Instead of being put to good use, this valuable \nequipment can be sold and the money spent on anything the recipient \nnation wants. Second, there have been reports that some of this heavy \nconstruction equipment is sitting idle due to the lack of skilled \nmechanics and the resources to repair it. I have been disappointed to \ndiscover that despite these reports, there has been no comprehensive \nreview of the final end-use of this equipment. Today I am writing to \nthe Inspector General at the Pentagon to ask her to fully investigate \nthis program to determine if these reports are factual.\n  Another provision of my legislation addresses another program that \nhas caused concern in many of our States. In 1990, the Congress passed \na provision that permitted DOD to make available to certain African \ncountries property for use in the preservation of wildlife. While \neveryone wants to help preserve elephants, the States have a legitimate \nquestion as to why does\n this program receive a higher priority than the interests of U.S. \ntaxpayers? The simple solution is to put the States first. My \nlegislation would allow the States to take a first look at this surplus \nproperty to see if they can use any of it. Then, and only then, it \ncould be shipped to help preserve African wildlife.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today returns to the \nbasic principal of the fair and equitable distribution of surplus \nGovernment personal property. While there are many worthy entities \ninterested in this property, I think it is time to again put our States \nfirst in line.\n  My bill puts States at the head of the list before the Humanitarian \nAssistance program at the Department of Defense and the Foreign \nenvironmental protection program; ensures the State agencies for \nsurplus property are part of the process in the Small Business donation \nprogram; repeals the authority for the Department of Energy to dispose \nof personal property outside of the regular process involving the State \nagencies; allows DOD to continue to donate surplus small arms and \nammunition to local law enforcement agencies while excluding surplus \nmotor vehicles from the program; and requires the General Services \nAdministration to review the entire range of surplus personal property \nprograms to determine how effective these programs are, the amount of \nproperty donated through these programs, and to suggest any legislative \nrecommendations to improve the process and ensure the States \nparticipation in this process. GSA, in the course of its review, will \nnot be able to limit the access of local communities impacted by the \nclosure of a military base.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time to put our States first in line \nwhen it comes to receiving surplus property. My bill does just that and \nI urge my colleagues to support it. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill and a summary be printed in the Record. I also have a letter from \nMr. Gerald Marlin, manager of Federal surplus property in Arkansas that \nI ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The regulations require that the General Services \n     Administration administer the disposition of this personal \n     property to ensure its fair and equitable distribution.\n       This program was a good example of Federal-State \n     cooperation. However, beginning in 1986 Congress has enacted \n     legislation that placed a variety of interests higher on the \n     priority list to receive surplus property. The National \n     Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property (NASASP) \n     has compiled a partial listing of these legislative \n     provisions:\n       1986--Humanitarian Assistance Program. (Section 2547), 10 \n     USC) Program gives foreign countries excess DOD property \n     before it is available to the States.\n       1987--Southern Regional Amendment. Congress authorized DOD \n     to make equipment available to base rights countries prior to \n     its being available to other Federal agencies or states.\n       1989--Small Business Administration. Congress authorized \n     SBA to make Federal surplus property available to 8A \n     contractors before the states.\n       1990--Wildlife Preservation in Africa. Congress authorized \n     DOD to make available to certain African countries excess \n     property for use in the preservation of wildlife, prior to \n     its becoming available to other Federal agencies or states.\n       1990--Law Enforcement Assistance. Authorized DOD to make \n     property available directly to state law enforcement agencies \n     to combat drugs prior to its becoming available to other \n     Federal agencies or states.\n       The total effect of these, and other provisions, has been \n     to erode the idea that one agency within each state would \n     work with the Federal government and with localities to \n     ensure ``fair and equitable distribution,'' While these \n     programs are worthwhile, taken as a whole, they fragment our \n     surplus property disposal system.\n       Summary of bill: The bill has seven sections:\n       Section 1--Places States before foreign countries. The \n     humanitarian assistance program (HAP) began as an effort to \n     get food and blankets to the Afghanistan refugees. It has \n     grown to include the shipping of construction equipment and \n     motor vehicles. The dollar value of the property shipped in \n     1994 was $136 million. Of particular interest to the States \n     is construction equipment that is being sent overseas. The \n     bill would leave HAP intact, but would allow states to review \n     the DOD inventory and bid on any item for which they have a \n     need. The truly humanitarian portion of the property (i.e. \n     food rations, blankets) would continue without disruption.\n       Section 2--Excludes motor vehicles from the DOD program to \n     aid law enforcement. The states are concerned that the larger \n     local jurisdictions are receiving trucks and other vehicles \n     before other jurisdictions have a chance to bid for them. DOD \n     would still be able to provide surplus ammunition and \n     firearms directly to local police departments, however, motor \n     vehicles would be distributed through the state property \n     agencies. This section also repeals the provisions creating \n     the special equipment depots that receive the surplus before \n     the States bid on it.\n       Section 3--Amends the Wildlife preservation program so that \n     property may not be transferred unless there is a \n     determination that there is no Federal or State use for the \n     property. The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration shall make this determination.\n       Section 4--Amends the Small Business program to ensure \n     distribution of property through the State agencies. The \n     property would still be designated for and allocated to small \n     businesses, but it would be coordinated through the existing \n     state agency for surplus property. This has been an \n     underutilized program and this section should increase the \n     amount of property going to small businesses.\n       Section 5--Eliminates the Department of Energy's Science \n     education program. The program is designed to give DOE the \n     authority to give its excess property directly to schools. \n     However, this allows certain jurisdictions to benefit to the \n     detriment of others. By eliminating this special program this \n     property will be distributed through the state agencies and \n     give each and every school system an opportunity to receive \n     this equipment.\n       Section 6--Modifies the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \n     program. Instead of equipment going directly from the Federal \n     laboratories to educational institutions without any \n     direction from the General Services Administration, this \n     provision requires that the laboratory certify to GSA that \n     the particular equipment is needed for scientific and \n     educational research. This will bring this program into the \n     overall surplus property program and alleviate concern that \n     some of the scientific equipment has been sold when an \n     institution receives it.\n       Section 7--Requires a report on disposal and donation of \n     surplus personal property. While the other sections of this \n     bill will begin the process of returning our property \n     disposal system to its original focus of fair and equitable \n     distribution nationwide, there are still other issues and \n     special exemptions to review. The GSA is able to study this \n     matter and report to Congress on the volume of property going \n     out under other authorities and whether legislative changes \n     should be considered to alleviate any concern of unfair \n     treatment of various entities.\n        [[Page S6349]] The bill will not allow GSA to recommend \n     any change to the base closure authority. Congress has only \n     recently begun this program which gives local jurisdictions \n     access to the personal property on the military base that is \n     being closed. This exemption is widely supported and can be \n     justified due to the adverse economic impact on the local \n     jurisdiction of the closing of the base.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             Arkansas Department of Education,\n\n                            North Little Rock, AR, March 14, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I want to thank you for the support of \n     Federal Surplus Property Donation Program. This program has \n     been a great help to the state for the many years it has been \n     operating.\n       I am sure that our Donees that serve all segments of our \n     state are pleased with your support. Many of our small school \n     districts, counties, cities, and rural fire departments tell \n     us they would not be able to provide needed services without \n     help from this donation program.\n       I received, from our National Association of State Agencies \n     for Surplus Property, a draft of your Bill to provide that \n     Federal Surplus Property be made available to states before \n     being made available to other entities. The Chairman of our \n     Legislative Committee tells me our association is working \n     with your staff on this and is thankful for the opportunity.\n       In fiscal year 1994, there were 17,184 line items valued at \n     $136,752,392.00 transferred to the Humanitarian Assistance \n     Program. The State of Arkansas receives approximately \n     $7,500,000.00 per year, and this is property that the \n     Humanitarian Assistance Program has rejected.\n       We really appreciate your work as our Senator!\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 Gerald D. Marlin,\n                                Manager, Federal Surplus Property.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 772. A bill to provide for an assessment of the violence broadcast \non television, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  television violence report card act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Hutchison and I \nare introducing legislation that will help empower parents and all \nconsumers to take the responsibility to address the problem of \ntelevision violence. Our legislation, the Television Violence Report \nCard Act of 1995 would authorize grants to private, not-for-profit \nentities to conduct quarterly assessments of violence on television.\n  This legislation is similar to a bill I introduced in the last \nCongress, but it has some significant differences. The primary \ndifference is that this bill would not involve any direct governmental \nassessment of the content of television. Under this legislation, the \ngovernmental role would be limited to identifying credible and \nqualified research entities which will be awarded a nominal amount of \nfunding to ensure that regular assessments of the violent content of \ntelevision programming is conducted and that the public has access to \nthis information.\n  Ninety-eight percent of all American households have a least one \ntelevision set. More Americans have televisions than have telephones or \nindoor plumbing. The average American watches over 4 hours of TV each \nday and the average household watches over 7 hours a day. Children \nbetween the ages of 2 and 11 watch television an average of 28 hours \nper week.\n  Television is, beyond a doubt, the most influential cultural and \nsocial teacher of American children. Consider the fact that the average \nAmerican teenager spends less than 2 hours per week reading, only 5\\1/\n2\\ hours doing homework and 21 hours per week watching television.\n  The problem is that children and adults are getting a steady diet of \nviolence through television. According to a 1992 University of \nPennsylvania study, a record 32 violent acts per hour were recorded \nduring children's shows and several other studies have found that \ntelevision violence increased during the 1980's during prime-time and \nchildren's television hours. The American Academy of Pediatrics \nestimates that violence on television tripled in the 1980's and the \nNational Coalition on Television Violence found that 25 percent of \nprime-time television shows contain ``very violent'' material. The \naverage child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on \ntelevision before finishing elementary school.\n  Television enables the television industry to bypass parents, slip \npast the front door of the home, and enter the family living room where \nthey can speak directly to children. For better or worse, TV is one of \nthe most powerful instruments of social and behavioral instruction in \nthe life of a child.\n  Television, unfortunately, uses its potency and influence to portray \nviolence as sexy and glamorous, not to mention Hollywood's obsession \nwith the more violence, the better. To the networks, violence is a \nquick tool to better ratings. To our children, violence becomes the way \nof life that is taught over the airways and into the fabric of our \nculture.\n  The fact is that television is more than just entertainment, it is a \npotent force that shapes everyday life in American culture and society. \nThe question is: What kind of a force is it. Newton Minow, former FCC \nChairman under the Kennedy administration, referred to television as a \n``vast wasteland * * * of blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, \nmurder.'' He also said: ``In 1961, I worried that my children would not \nbenefit much from television, but in 1991 I worry that my children will \nactually be harmed by it.'' And according to a March 3, 1993 poll by \nTimes Mirror, three-fourths of the public find TV too violent and even \na higher percentage of TV station managers agree (Electronic Media \npoll, Aug. 2, 1993). Even children believe television is a bad \ninfluence. According to a ``Children Now'' survey released in February, \nmost children say what they see on television encourages them to engage \nin aggressive behavior, to take part in sexual activity too soon, to \nlie, and to show disrespect for their parents.\n  Children that are continually exposed to television violence do not \nperceive their own aggressive behavior as deviant or unusual, they see \nit as the way life is and that's how one goes about solving problems. \nAggressive behavior is learned.\n\n\n                      the problem of tv violence:\n\n  Public concern about TV violence is not a new issue, Congress has \nbeen down this road before. Congressional hearings were held 40 years \nago, at the beginning of the television age, on the impact that \ntelevision and radio was having on children and youth. In the sixties \nand seventies, Congress held more hearings.\n  Each time, the pattern has been the same. The public expresses \noutrage and concern over the bloodshed that a handful of media magnates \npour into the Nation's living rooms. The industry either denies the \nproblem, or offers earnest promises of reform, but no results. The \nNation's attention shifts to other problems, as it always does.\n  Television is a habit. One student of the industry called it a \n``plug-in drug,'' especially where children are concerned. Violence on \nTV is an addiction too--children become addicted to watching. \nTelevision violence viewing leads to heightened aggressiveness, which \nin turn leads to more television violence viewing. As with any \naddiction, it takes constantly bigger doses to achieve the same effect.\n  According to ``Prime Time: How TV Portrays American Culture,'' by \nLichter et al., a review of 1 month of prime-time fictional series \nepisodes found over 1,000 scenes involving violence. One out of five \nviolent scenes involved gunplay, and nearly half included some kind of \nserious personal assault. The review also showed that weekly fictional \nseries averaged between three and four scenes of violence per episode.\n  In addition, Lichter's study found that violent crime is far more \npervasive on television than in real life. A comparison between real \nlife crime statistics (FBI's ``Uniform Crime Reports: Crime in the \nUnited States'') and television's crime levels shows that:\n  Since 1955 television characters have been murdered at a rate 1,000 \ntimes higher than real world victims. In the 1950's, there were 7 \nmurders for every 100 characters seen on TV--this was over 1,400 times \nhigher than the actual murder rate for the United States during the \nsame period.\n  Violent crimes not involving murder accounted for 1 crime in 8 on TV \nduring the decade 1955 to 1964, which occurred at a rate of 40 for \nevery 1,000 characters. At that same time, the real world rate for \ncrimes involving murder was only 2 in every 1,000 inhabitants.\n   [[Page S6350]] During the decade covering 1965 to 1975 crime rose \nboth on TV and the real world, but TV crime rate remained more than \nfive times that of the real world, at 140 crimes per 1,000 characters.\n  While the FBI-calculated rate for violent crime also doubled to 3 \nincidents per 1,000 inhabitants, the TV rate for violent crimes was \nover 30 times greater than reality at a rate of 114 incidents per 1,000 \ncharacters.\n  Although television crime and real life crime have moved closer \ntogether in the past 20 years, FBI statistics showed that serious crime \nwas about half the rate in real life than on television. Violent crime \nrates were only one-eighth the rate seen on television.\n  TV crime not only presents a higher rate of violent crime than the \nreal world, it portrays a different type of crime. On TV, violent crime \nis more often calculated and felony in nature, whereas in real life, \nmost--40 percent--of the murders committed are committed out of passion \nor the result of an argument.\n  Guns are more pervasive on TV. In the real world, about one-fourth of \nall violent crimes, and a majority of murders, involve guns. Almost all \nof television's violent crimes involve some type of gun.\n  Television is not only more crime-ridden than real life, it also \nhighlights the most violent serious crimes. A majority of crimes \nportrayed on TV involve violence and 23 percent are murders.\n  There is no disputing the link between television content and human \nbehavior. Twenty-six people died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds to \nthe head after watching the Russian roulette scene in the movie ``The \nDeer Hunter'' when it was shown on national TV. It has been alleged \nthat the cartoon Beavis and Butt-head's depiction of setting objects on \nfire recently led a 5-year-old in Ohio to set his family's mobile on \nfire, causing the death of his 2-year-old sister.\n  The American Psychological Association has found that ``since 1955, \nabout 1,000 studies, reports, and commentaries concerning the impact of \ntelevision violence have been published * * * the accumulated research \nclearly demonstrates a correlation between viewing violence and \naggressive behavior.'' Here are just a few of those research studies \nand reports. These studies, lead to one conclusion: violence on \ntelevision is a threat to our Nation's children and our society at \nlarge:\n  First, report to the Surgeon General, ``Television and Growing up: \nThe Impact of Televised Violence,'' 1972. The Surgeon General concluded \nthat there is indeed a causal effect of viewing violent television \nprograms and subsequent aggressive behavior in children.\n  Second, a technical report to the Surgeon General, volume III: \nLefkowitz, Eron, Walder, and Huesman, ``Television Violence and Child \nAggression: A Follow-up Study.'' (Television and Social Behavior, \n1972.) ``A violent television diet is related to violent behavior.'' \nThis study shows a direct positive correlation between the amount of \ntelevision viewed by third-grade boys and aggressiveness 10 years \nlater. Early aggression in boys is a predictor of and a basis for later \naggression.\n  Third, National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], ``Television and \nBehavior,'' 1982. After 10 more years of research, in 1982, the NIMH \ndid a follow-up report to the 1972 Surgeon General's report and \nconcluded that violence on television does lead to aggressive behavior \nby children and teenagers who watch the programs. It also concluded \nthat television violence is as strongly correlated with aggressive \nbehavior as any other behavioral variable that has been measured.\n  Fourth, ``U.S. Attorney General's Task Force on Family Violence,'' \n1984. This report says that ``the evidence is overwhelming--TV violence \ncontributes to the acting out of real violence. Just as witnessing \nviolence in the home may contribute to normal adults and children \nlearning and acting out behavior, violence on TV and in the movies may \ncontribute to the same result.''\n  Fifth, Huesmann, Eron, Lefkowitz and Walder, ``The Stability of \nAggression Over Time and Generations,'' 1984. (Developmental \nPsychology.) After studying the viewing habits and behavior of 875 \nchildren in a rural New York county at ages 8, 19, and 30, this study \nconcludes that the more a subject watched television at 8, the more \nserious the crime he was convicted for at age 30.\n  Sixth, Singer, Singer and Rapaczynski, ``Family Patterns and \nTelevision Viewing as Predictors of Children's Beliefs and \nAggression,'' 1984. This study concluded that children who watch more \nthan 4 hours of television violence per day during preschool years, \nexhibit later aggressive behavior. Children who view violent adult \nprograms were suspicious or fearful of their neighborhood and world. \nAnd they tended to be restless when required to wait.\n  Seventh, American Psychological Association [APA], ``Violence on \nTelevision: APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for \nPsychology,'' 1985. In the early 1980's, the APA did a complete review \nof reports and literature on television violence. As a result, the APA \nadopted the position that television violence has a causal effect on \naggressive behavior.\n  Eighth, David Phillips, ``Natural Experiments on the Effects of Mass \nMedia Violence on Fatal Aggression,'' 1986. This study provides \nevidence that some types of mass media violence tend to elicit fatal \naggression--suicide, homicide, and accidents--among adults in the \nUnited States.\n  Ninth, L. Rowell Husemann and Laurie S. Miller, ``Long-Term Effects \nof Repeated Exposure to Media Violence in Childhood,'' 1994. The \nviolent scenes that a child observes on television can serve to teach a \nchild to be aggressive through several learning processes, as the child \nnot only observes aggressive patterns of behaviors but also witnesses \ntheir acceptance and reinforcement. This study finds that there is a \nsevere negative outcome for children who display antisocial behavior, \nand that televised violence is regarded as one contributor to the \nlearning environment of children who eventually go on to develop \naggressive and antisocial behavior.\n  Tenth, George Comstock and Haejung Paik, ``The Effects of Television \nViolence on Antisocial Behavior: A Meta-Analysis,'' 1994. This study \nsuggests that the influence of violent television portrayals is not \nconfined to childhood or early adolescence and concludes that the \nfindings obtained in the last 15 years strengthen the evidence that \ntelevision violence increases aggressive and antisocial behavior.\n\n\n      The Solution--Public Information and Free Market Regulation\n\n  In my judgment, this legislation is as critically important as ever. \nWe have to make the television industry accountable, and the way to do \nthis is through public information. It is not the role of Government in \nthis country to tell people what they can watch. Nor should we try to \ntell broadcasters and sponsors what they can put on the air. But it is \nthe role of Government to help make the free marketplace work, by \nproviding information to the public--information on which they can make \ntheir own free choices. That's what I'm proposing regarding violence on \nTV.\n  Under this approach, the Government wouldn't regulate; parents would. \nGovernment would do for them no more than it does for business of all \nkinds: gather information that would help parents express their own \nfree choices.\n  Why shouldn't the Government start helping parents, the way it helps \ncorporations? The Federal Government spends millions and probably \nbillions of dollars a year, gathering data for use by business. The \nCensus Bureau alone provides a treasure drove of demographic research \nfor ad agencies and corporate marketing departments. Corporations use \nthis Government data to target consumers. Now it's time to give parents \ndata by which they can target advertisers who are abusing their \nchildren.\n  If Americans don't really care about this violence, then it would \ncontinue. If they do care about it, and send their market message \naccordingly, then it would change. That's the way a democracy and a \nmarket economy are supposed to work.\n\n\n                            Industry Actions\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, public concern over television violence is \nnot new. Several hearings were held in the 103d on this issue. In \naddition, the industry, in response to public concern, \n [[Page S6351]]  has adopted some measures to address this problem.\n  In 1990, the Congress passed legislation, the Television Violence Act \nof 1990, which provided the television industry a 3-year antitrust \nexemption to allow it to develop standards on television violence. In \nDecember 1992, the three major networks adopted ``Standards for the \nDepiction of Violence in Television Programs'' which included \ncommitments by the industry to:\n  Only include depictions of violence when such depictions are relevant \nand necessary to the plot;\n  Reject gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence as \n``unacceptable''; and\n  Not use depictions of violence to shock or stimulate the audience.\n  The National Cable Television Association adopted an industry policy \nin January 1993 to address the problems of television violence. The \nprogram\n includes voluntary industry standards and encourages cable program \nnetworks to adopt their own standards and practices.\n\n  In July 1993, the networks adopted an additional plan to impose \nwarning labels on programming that contained violence, ``The Advance \nParental Advisory Plan'' which will use the following warning label \npreceding violent shows: ``Due to some violent content, parental \ndiscretion advised.'' A similar advisory program was adopted by the \nIndependent Television Association.\n  And late last year, both the broadcast networks and the cable \nindustry agreed to finance independent studies that are currently \nmonitoring and analyzing violence on television. These actions are good \nand I applaud the industry's efforts. In particular, I believe their \nmonitoring studies will provide a positive contribution to the debate \nover television violence.\n  In addition to television industry actions, the Electronic Industries \nAssociation [EIA], representing television manufacturers, has been \nworking diligently over the past year and a half toward establishing a \nvoluntary standard which will allow for the implementation of \ntechnology to block violent programming. EIA's efforts reflect the fact \nthat television manufacturers recognize consumers' desires and are \nattempting to provide adequate choice in the marketplace.\n  EIA's leadership demonstrates that voluntary efforts can be \neffective. It is my preference that voluntary industry efforts would be \nthe solution, as opposed to a Government mandate. It is my hope that \nall sectors of the television industry work together with the EIA in \ntheir effort toward empowering parents and providing consumers the \ntools to control what is broadcast into their homes.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Although industry actions are commendable, legislation is necessary \nthat will augment the industry-led monitoring programs. The fundamental \npurpose of this legislation is to ensure that consumers, especially \nparents, have access to useable information about what violent shows \nare on television and who sponsors those shows. Despite all the \nresearch and the monitoring studies established by the broadcast and \ncable industries, there is still a void in assuring consumers that \nregular, usable information in the form of a report card will be \navailable.\n  It seems to me that the approach of establishing television violence \nreport cards, created by private entities, is a very modest and \nappropriate response for the Congress. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Television Violence Report \n     Card Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Three out of every four people in the United States \n     consider television programming too violent, according to a \n     1993 poll by Electronic Media.\n       (2) Three Surgeon Generals, the National Institute of \n     Mental Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the American \n     Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and \n     the American Psychological Association have concurred for \n     nearly 20 years as to the deleterious effects of televised \n     violence on children.\n       (3) In conjunction with other societal factors such as \n     poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, and poor education, the \n     depiction of violence in all forms of media contribute to \n     violence in United States society.\n       (4) The entertainment industry is becoming increasingly \n     sensitive to public sentiment against excessive violence in \n     television programming. A recent survey of 867 entertainment \n     executives by U.S. News and World Report and the University \n     of California in Los Angeles reveals the following:\n       (A) 59 percent of such executives consider violence on \n     television and in movies a problem.\n       (B) Nearly 9 out of 10 such executives say that violence in \n     the media contributes to the level of violence in the United \n     States.\n       (C) 63 percent of such executives believe that the \n     entertainment media glorify violence.\n       (D) 83 percent of such executives believe that the debate \n     on excessive violence in television programming has affected \n     the programming decisions made by the broadcast television \n     industry.\n       (5) The broadcast television and cable programming \n     industries have undertaken efforts to decrease violence on \n     television through joint standards on violence, \n     implementation of an advance parental advisory plan, and the \n     establishment of independent efforts to monitor the incidence \n     of violence in television programming, analyze the portrayal \n     of violence in network television programming and in other \n     forms of video programming, and analyze the trends and \n     changes in the treatment of violent themes by the media.\n       (6) The American Psychosocial Association finds that \n     approximately 1,000 studies and reports on the effects of \n     violence on television have been published since 1955. The \n     accumulated research clearly demonstrates a correlation \n     between the viewing of violence on television and aggressive \n     behavior.\n       (7) To the fullest extent possible, parents and consumers \n     should be empowered to choose which television programs they \n     consider appropriate for their children and which programs \n     they consider too violent.\n\n     SEC. 3. TELEVISION VIOLENCE REPORT CARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall, during \n     fiscal years 1996 and 1997, make grants directly to one or \n     more not-for-profit entities for purposes of permitting such \n     entities to carry out in such fiscal years an assessment of \n     the violence in television programming. The amount of the \n     grants shall be sufficient to permit such entities to carry \n     out the assessment.\n       (b) Assessment.--(1) In carrying out an assessment under \n     this section, an entity shall----\n       (A) review current television programs (including programs \n     on broadcast television, on independent television stations, \n     and on cable television) in order to determine the nature and \n     extent of the violence depicted in each program;\n       (B) prepare an assessment of the violence depicted in each \n     program that describes and categorizes the nature and extent \n     of the violence in the program; and\n       (C) take appropriate actions to make the assessment \n     available to the public.\n       (2) An entity shall carry out a review under paragraph \n     (1)(A) not less often than once every 90 days.\n       (3) In making an assessment public under paragraph (1)(C), \n     an entity shall identify the sponsor or sponsors of each \n     television program covered under the assessment.\n       (c) Grant Procedures.--The Secretary shall determine the \n     entities to which the Secretary shall make grants under this \n     section using competitive procedures. Applications for such \n     grants shall contain such information as the Secretary may \n     require to carry out the requirements of this Act.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to make the \n     grants required under this section.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Coats, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Frist, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Craig, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Grassley, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Heflin, Mr. Bond, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. \n        Helms):\n  S. 773. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for improvements in the process of approving and using animal \ndrugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                      animal drug availability act\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today, together with a bipartisan \ngroup of colleagues, I am introducing the Animal Drug Availability Act \nof 1995. This legislation will reform the Food and Drug \nAdministration's animal drug approval and export processes and \npolicies.\n  There is a serious lack of drugs for treating animals, in part \nbecause the drug review process at the Food and Drug Administration's \nCenter for Veterinary Medicine is cumbersome and \n [[Page S6352]]  unpredictable. This discourages the development of new \ndrugs. The FDA has approved only four new chemical entities (new drugs) \nfor food-producing animals in the last 5 years. Further, an internal \nstudy by the Center for Veterinary Medicine found that the agency was \ntaking an average of 58 months to approve drug applications. By law, \nthe process should take no more than 6 months.\n  The extra-label drug bill that was signed into law last year is a \nshort-term response to this problem. It assures that veterinarians can \nlegally prescribe drugs approved for one use or species for other uses \nor species. But all involved in the extra-label bill last year agreed \nthat the real answer to the problem was reforming the animal drug \napproval process.\n  Second, because our approval process is so slow, unpredictable, and \ncumbersome and our export policies very restrictive, many animal drug \nmanufacturers are moving research and manufacturing facilities--and \njobs--abroad to take advantage of more efficient and predictable review \nand approval processes and lucrative, growing world markets.\n  This legislation has the broad support of the animal producer groups, \nthe Animal Health Institute, and the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation.\n  I would welcome additional cosponsors of the Animal Drug Availability \nAct of 1995.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this \nlegislation, which is intended to streamline and expedite the Food and \nDrug Administration's approval process for animal drugs without \ndiminishing the human health protections contained in current law. This \nbill represents a commendable effort to address a serious impediments \nto the effective treatment of animal health problems, and is thus \nparticularly important to veterinary practitioners and livestock and \npoultry producers.\n  For some time there has been an insufficient number of suitable, \nfully approved and labelled drugs for the treatment of animals. In \nsignificant part, this lack of approved drugs is attributable to delays \nin the approval process used by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. \nLast year legislation was enacted to sanction the extra-label use of \nFDA-approved drugs by or at the direction of veterinarians. Even at the \ntime that legislation was passed, however, there was general agreement \nthat the best solution to the lack of fully-approved and labelled \nanimal drugs is to remedy the unnecessary delays and other problems in \nFDA's animal drug approval process.\n  The legislation introduced today is a strong and substantial step \ntoward improving FDA's animal drug approval process by reducing the \npotential for delays, making the process more predictable and rational, \nand lessening burdensome aspects of the current procedures. Again, this \nbill is not designed or intended to lessen human health protections in \nany way. Its primary focus, from a substantial perspective, is on the \nproof of efficacy required to gain approval.\n  As we continue to work on this legislation, we will need to give \nadditional consideration to its various possible ramifications in \nactual practice. I will be closely following the analysis of these \nissues in order to ensure that the bill is appropriately modified to \naddress concerns that may arise. In particular, we must carefully \nconsider whether that may arise. In particular, we must carefully \nconsider whether the bill might have the unintended consequence of \ndiminishing human health protections in some way that is not now \nevident or anticipated. I also want to obtain additional information on \nthe operation of the export provisions of the bill, including assurance \nthat FDA will continue to have sufficient authority to limit exports of \nanimal drugs on the basis of unacceptable risk to human health, either \nin this country or in foreign countries.\n  In conclusion, this legislation addresses a pressing need in the \nfield of animal health. A good deal of work and thought have gone into \nthe bill thus far, and I look forward to working with Chairman \nKassebaum and other senators in further shaping the measure and gaining \nits enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK:\n  S. 774. A bill to place restrictions on the promotion by the \nDepartment of Labor and other Federal agencies and instrumentalities of \neconomically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit \nplans; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                         PENSION PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill help protect the pensions of our Nation's seniors. The Pension \nProtection Act will stop the administration's ongoing efforts to raid \nour Nation's pension funds.\n  In an effort to find capital for its social projects, the Clinton \nadministration has effectively been chipping away at the strict \nfiduciary standards set up by the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct [ERISA]. The Department of Labor has issued new interpretations of \nERISA fiduciary standards which challenge the requirement that pension \nfunds be invested for the sole purpose of increasing the economic \nbenefit of the pension's beneficiaries. This relaxing of ERISA \nstandards combined with a well-defined strategy to encourage pension \nplan managers to invest in social projects puts at risk the hard-earned \npension benefits of current and future retirees. It is no surprise that \nthis administration wants to finance its social projects and pet \npolitical programs with private pension funds. Currently, these funds \nhold over $3.5 trillion in assets. Many see this pot of money as a \nlucrative and untapped source of funding to finance their own political \nagenda.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration has always viewed pension \nfunds as a convenient source of public funding. In fact, in his book \n``Putting People First,'' President Clinton proposed a $20 billion \ninvestment program paid for with pension funds. These economically \ntargeted investments [ETI's] would use pension funds to pay for \nGovernment programs. This nice-sounding term is merely a disguise for \nthe systematic raiding of our pension funds.\n  My legislation would put the brakes on a dangerous course of action \nwhich is being orchestrated by the Department of Labor. Specifically, \nthis legislation would abolish the ETI Clearinghouse recently \nestablished by the Department of Labor. This Clearinghouse is designed \nto identify investments that the administration deems socially \nbeneficial. The legislation would also nullify Secretary Reich's 1994 \nInterpretive Bulletin that encourages ETI's and would in effect ensure \nthat pension managers do not select investments which have a purpose \nother than serving the ``sole interest of the plan participant.'' In \naddition, this legislation would instruct the Labor Department to cease \nacting as a promoter of ETI's and instead act as the enforcer of \nERISA's fiduciary standards. Finally, this bill would deny funding to \nany Government agency for the purpose of operating an ETI database or \nlist.\n  Last year, the American people sent a loud and clear mandate for less \nspending, less taxes, and less government. But this administration has \ndecided to ignore that mandate by trying to increase spending on \nGovernment programs. First they raised taxes to pay for their programs \nand now they seek to spend our retirees' hard-earned pension funds. \nThis is wrong.\n  Mr. President, directing private pension funds to replace public \nfunding of Government programs is yet another example in a long line of \n``spend now, pay later'' policies that the Federal Government has \nadopted over the years. Encouraging pension funds to participate in \nrisky investments deserves our strongest opposition. We should not be \ncompromising fiduciary standards and the financial security of our \nNation's retirees in order to meet partisan, political goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 776. A bill to reauthorize the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation \nAct and the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                            striped bass act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the legislation that I introduce today \nreauthorizes a law that has been a great success: The Atlantic Striped \nBass \n [[Page S6353]]  Conservation Act. This legislation will allow the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to \ncontinue their important research and oversight role in support of \nstate efforts to conserve the Atlantic striped bass fishery.\n  From Maine to North Carolina, the striped bass has been an important \nspecies for Atlantic coast fishermen for centuries. And, the presence \nof the striped bass fishery has provided significant economic and \ncultural benefits to the Atlantic Coastal States, and to the Nation.\n  Striped bass--often called rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay area--are \nanadromous fish. They spawn in freshwater streams and migrate to \nestuarine or marine waters. During their relatively long lives--up to \n29 years--stripers are on the move. They migrate north during the \nsummer and south during the winter. Consequently, striped bass pass \nthrough the jurisdictions of several States, and conservation efforts \nmust be well coordinated.\n  In 1979, I offered an amendment to the Anadromous Fish Conservation \nAct that directed the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine \nFisheries Service to conduct an emergency study of striped bass. Why \nwas this study necessary? Fishermen had sounded the alarm that striped \nbass landings had declined precipitously. The commercial striped bass \nharvests dropped from 15 million pounds in 1973 to 3.5 million pounds \nin 1983. The Federal study found that, although habitat degradation \nplayed a role, overfishing was the primary cause of the population \ndecline.\n  In order to prevent overfishing, restrictions on the striped bass \nharvest were necessary in 14 jurisdictions. The Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act helped promote a coordinated approach to management by \nrequiring that the States fully implement a striped bass fishery \nmanagement plan developed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries \nCommission. If a State is found to be out of compliance with the \nCommission's management plan, a Federal moratorium on striped bass \nfishing is to be imposed jointly by the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Commerce. It is a testament to the efficacy of the \nAtlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act and the cooperative efforts of \ncountless Federal and State biologists and managers, and commercial and \nrecreational fishermen, that the Federal sanction has only been applied \nonce in the past 10 years.\n  What else has happened over the past decade? The Atlantic striped \nbass populations have made a dramatic recovery. All Atlantic striped \nbass populations are recovering or improving. In the Chesapeake Bay, \nthe spawning ground for 90 percent of the Atlantic striped bass, the \npopulation has been declared recovered. The Delaware stock is \nrecovering. The Albemarle Sound/Roanoke River stock is improving. \nAccording to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, without the State-\nimposed moratoria and restrictions on harvest, fishing mortality rates \non the Chesapeake Bay striped bass stock would have exceeded the level \nwhere the population could be maintained. In other words, without the \nState-Federal partnership\n promoted through the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act, the \nstriper might have been fished to oblivion.\n\n  The striped bass have proven once again that, given half a chance, \nnature will rebound and overcome tremendous setbacks. But, we must give \nit that half a chance. Reauthorization of the Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act will allow the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \ncontinue its coastwise tagging program, populations monitoring, and \nother data collection efforts to provide information that informs the \nmanagement decisions essential to maintaining healthy populations of \nstriped bass. The oversight authority shared by the Interior and \nCommerce Departments regarding the management of the striped bass \nfishery will ensure that States move cautiously as they reopen the \nharvest. I believe that a continued Federal involvement is important at \nthis crucial time--a time to celebrate, and to monitor closely, the \nrecovery of the Atlantic striped bass.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Striped Bass Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS CONSERVATION ACT\n\n       Section 7(a) of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act \n     (Public Law 98-613; 16 U.S.C. 1851 note) is amended by \n     striking ``1986'' and all that follows through ``1994'' and \n     inserting ``1995 through 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 3. ANADROMOUS FISH CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n       Section 7(d) of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 757g(d)) is amended by striking ``1991, 1992, 1993, \n     and 1994'' and inserting ``1995 through 1998''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my friend from \nRhode Island, Senator Chafee, in introducing the Atlantic Striped Bass \nAct of 1995. This legislation reauthorizes the Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act and the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act. Atlantic \nstriped bass is an important commercial and game fish that ranges from \nMaine to North Carolina. Its comeback from overfishing and habitat \ndestruction in the late 1980's is one of the great success stories of \nfisheries management. One of the most critical contributors to that \nrecovery was the enactment of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation \nAct in 1984.\n  The Striped Bass Act has provided the incentive for implementing \ncoordinated and comprehensive management of a wide-ranging species that \nmigrates throughout Atlantic coastal waters. The affected States came \ntogether, made the hard decisions, and enacted the restrictions on \nfishing that were necessary for the stocks to recover. Although great \nsacrifices were required during the rebuilding period, now sport \nanglers and commercial fishermen are seeing the benefits of effective \nmanagement. In Massachusetts, the commercial quota has been increased \nsubstantially, and bag limits for the recreational fisherman have \ndoubled. These harvest increases are even more heartening since the \nmanagement program for striped bass is still very conservative--only 25 \npercent of the available adult population may be taken this year. This \nsuccess proves that conservative fishery management can work and \nprovides a blueprint for other fisheries that face difficult management \nproblems. I complement the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership \non this legislation and I encourage my colleagues to join with us in \nsupporting the extension of the Striped Bass Act and the Anadromous \nFish Conservation Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 777.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill promote a more even playing field for workers and employers. \nConditions have worsened for workers and their families in recent \nyears. It is time to reexamine our labor laws and see if we can't make \nthem fairer for the average working man and woman.\n  To improve working conditions and enhance workplace productivity, we \nmust reject both the adversarial approach to worker-management \nrelations and the oppressive, let's hold them down, attitude held by \nsome in management and government. Both of these extreme approaches \nreduce productivity by destroying workplace comity. What we need to \nenhance our productivity is a strong spirit of cooperation in the \nworkplace. And in order to bring this about, we need strong, vital \nlabor unions.\n  While unions have remained strong in other industrialized nations \nover the past two decades, they have been steadily declining here in \nthe United States. Union membership has now fallen to about 15 percent \nof the American workforce, and to 10.9 percent of private non-\nagricultural workers. In Canada, by contrast, about 37 percent of the \nworkers belong to a union; in Germany, about 39 percent, in Great \nBritain, 41 percent; and in Japan, about 24 percent. Of all the \nindustrialized democracies, only South Korea ranks below the United \nStates in union membership.\n  Not coincidentally, as union membership has declined, so had the \naverage manufacturing wage. As late as 1986, the average hourly \nmanufacturing wage in the United States was higher than that of any \nother nation. Today, 10 nations have average manufacturing wages higher \nthan ours.\n  This decline in American workers' wages relative to those of workers \nin other industrialized countries has been accompanied by increased \nincome disparities within our country. A recent study of worldwide \nwealth and income trends by Prof. Edward Wolff of New York University \nconcludes that the United States now has the widest wealth and income \ndisparities of any advanced industrialized nation. The wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans now own 40 percent of all the Nation's wealth. By \ncontrast, in England, a nation which we tend to think of as much more \nclass-based than our own, the top; 1 percent own only 18 percent of the \nwealth, less than half the share of the wealthiest 1 percent of \nAmericans.\n  The distribution of income in the United States is similarly skewed. \nWhile the top 20 percent of households--those making $55,000 per year \nor more--take home 55 percent of all after-tax income paid to \nindividuals, the lowest-earning 20 percent of Americans receive only \n5.7 percent of all after-tax individual income. Since 1979, the 20 \npercent of families in the lowest income brackets have seen their \naverage real wages decline by 15 percent. Those in the second 20 \npercent have suffered a 7 percent decrease. In contrast, those in the \ntop 20 percent income bracket have enjoyed an 18 percent increase.\n  To reverse these unfortunate trends, we need to take steps to \nfacilitate the revival of organized American labor.\n  In addition to their importance in fighting for a fair wage for \nAmerican workers, American labor unions have played a vital role in \nenhancing workplace safety and in supporting progressive social \nlegislation such as child labor laws, minimum wage laws, and Social \nSecurity. And there is no question in my mind but that we would have a \nmuch better health care delivery system in the United States if we had \nas high a percentage of our workers organized as do Canada, Germany and \nmany other nations.\n  The causes of the decline of unions in America are numerous and \ncomplex. Our large and persistent trade deficits have certainly played \na role in this decline, as have our Federal budget deficits. Part of \nthe decline has also been caused by past failures on the part of a few \nunions to include women and minorities in their membership.\n  But the principal cause of this decline, in my view, has been a \npublic policy that has permitted and even encouraged some employers to \nactively resist union organizing activities.\n  The legislation I am introducing today seeks to reverse this trend by \nfacilitating workers' efforts to organize and bargain collectively for \nbetter wages and working conditions, to receive prompt adjudication of \ntheir grievances when problems arise, and to enjoy better working \nconditions.\n  I am well aware that we face firm opposition to these reforms. Steps \ntaken in recent months by the majority party would drive down the wages \nof working families, threaten workplace health and safety, and further \nweaken labor unions. Among the changes that have been proposed in \nrecent months are: repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act, which would lower the \nwages of workers in the construction industry; the weakening of \nworkplace safety and health laws; and a watering down of the time-and-\na-half provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Even proposals to \nhelp those at the lowest rung of the income ladder by raising the \nminimum wage, after fifteen years of decline in its real purchasing \npower, have been greeted with scorn or indifference by many of those in \npower.\n  Still, I believe that once we take a serious look at the conditions \nof the hardest working and most vulnerable members of our society, the \nconclusion will be unavoidable that we must do more to ensure that \ntheir interests are represented fairly and equitably.\n  Following are brief descriptions of the eight bills I am introducing \ntoday; and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of each bill be printed \nin the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To address this problem, I am \n     introducing the ``Labor Relations First Contract Negotiations \n     Act of 1995,'' a bill which will require the arbitration of \n     initial contract negotiation disputes.\n       Under this Act, if an employer and a newly elected \n     representative have not reached a collective bargaining \n     agreement within 60 days of the representative's \n     certification, the employer and the representative shall \n     jointly select a mediator to help them reach an agreement. If \n     they cannot agree on a mediator, one will be appointed for \n     them by the Federal Medication and Conciliation Service. In \n     the even that the parties do not reach an agreement in 30 \n     days, the remaining issues may be transferred to the Federal \n     Medication and Conciliation Service for binding arbitration.\n       The Federal government can do more to sanction firms that \n     demonstrate a pattern and practice of National Labor \n     Relations Act violations. By debarring such firms from \n     Federal contracts, the ``Federal Contractor Labor Relations \n     Enforcement Act of 1995'' will encourage higher levels of \n     compliance with the law.\n       Under the Act, firms that are determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor to have shown a clear pattern the practice of NLRA \n     violations will be debarred from receiving contracts, \n     extensions of contracts, or modifications of existing \n     contracts with agencies of the Federal government for a \n     period of three years.\n       Similarly, the ``Federal Contractor Safety and Health \n     Enforcement Act of 1995'' directs the Secretary of Labor to \n     withhold Federal contracts in cases where firms show a clear \n     pattern and practice of Occupational Safety and Health Act \n     violations. This Act will help to ensure that employees who \n     repeatedly disregard the safety and health of their workers \n     will face consequences for their failure to abide by the law.\n       The ``Labor Relations Remedies Act of 1995'' protects \n     workers by making it unlawful for an employer to discharge an \n     employee for exercising rights protected under the National \n     Labor Relations Act. The Act also directs the National Labor \n     Relations Board to award additional damages in the event that \n     it finds that an employee has of his right to sue for \n     punitive damages and damages under any other state or Federal \n     law.\n       The ``National Labor Relations Board ruling Time Limit Act \n     of 1995'' will require that employees receive a prompt ruling \n     on claims of wrongful discharge. The Act provides that the \n     National Labor Relations Board shall rule on wrongful \n     discharge complaints within thirty days of receiving them.\n       I am also introducing legislation today that will address \n     the problem of law firms and consulting firms that stray over \n     the line into counseling their clients to implement illegal \n     policies or practices. Under the ``National Labor Relations \n     penalty Act'' persons or firms who encourage an employer or a \n     labor organization to violate the National Labor Relations \n     Act will be subject to a fine of up to $10,000.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PACKWOOD:\n  S. 785. A bill to require the trustees of the Medicare trust funds to \nreport recommendations on resolving projected financial imbalance in \nMedicare trust funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          medicare legislation\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, the 1995 annual reports of the trustees \non the status of the two Medicare trust funds, released on April 3, \n1995, raise serious concerns about future financial viability of the \nMedicare Program.\n  The trustees conclude that the Federal hospital insurance trust \nfund--called Medicare part A:\n  First, has taken in less in Medicare payroll taxes than it has paid \nout in Medicare benefits every year since 1992;\n  Second, starts having to liquidate assets next year, 1996; and\n  Third, will run out of money by the year 2002.\n  The status of the supplemental medical insurance trust fund--called \nMedicare part B--is not much better. The trustees ``note with great \nconcern the past and projected rapid growth in the cost of the \nprogram.''\n  Four Cabinet members of this administration are trustees of the \nMedicare trust funds--the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nLabor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner \nof the Social Security Administration. These Cabinet members all signed \nthe 1995 trustee report, agreeing with the conclusions that the \nMedicare trust fund is in serious financial trouble.\n  But this administration refuses to become engaged in proposing any \nsolutions. Repeatedly, the President and his Cabinet members have said \nthey are waiting for the Republicans' budget resolution before they \noffer any suggestions to save Medicare.\n  In my memory, this is the first time an administration has so \ncompletely refused to be a part of the budget process. The \nadministration claims to have done its part because it submitted its \n1996 budget to the Congress. However, the President's 1996 budget \nleaves Medicare virtually untouched. Medicare proposals in that budget \ndo not even do enough to delay Medicare insolvency for 1 year.\n  The financial problems of the Medicare Program are real. They exist \nregardless of whether or not there is a budget resolution, or the \ncontent of a budget resolution. We simply cannot avoid addressing this \nissue, and the sooner the better.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill requiring the trustees of the Medicare \ntrust funds to report back to Congress by June 30, 1995, with their \nrecommendations for the specific program legislation to deal with \nMedicare's financial condition that they call for in their 1995 annual \nreports on the Medicare trust funds. This is an urgent responsibility \nof this administration and they must come forward with initiatives so \nthat we can preserve the Medicare Program, not only for future \ngenerations, but for our current senior population.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRUSTEES' CONCLUSIONS REGARDING FINANCIAL STATUS \n                   OF MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (A) HI Trust Fund.--The 1995 annual report of the Board of \n     Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, \n     submitted on April 3, 1995, contains the following \n     conclusions respecting the financial status of such Trust \n     Fund:\n       (1) Under the Trustees' intermediate assumptions, the \n     present financing schedule for the hospital insurance program \n     is sufficient to ensure the payment of benefits only over the \n     next 7 years.\n       (2) Under present law, hospital insurance program costs are \n     expected to far exceed revenues over the 75-year long-range \n     period under any reasonable set of assumptions.\n       (3) As a result, the hospital insurance program is severely \n     out of financial balance and the Trustees believe that the \n     Congress must take timely action to establish long-term \n     financial stability for the program.\n       (b) SMI Trust Fund.--The 1995 annual report of the Board of \n     Trustees of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust \n     Fund, submitted on April 3, 1995, contains the following \n     conclusions respecting the financial status of such Trust \n     Fund:\n       (1) Although the supplementary medical insurance program is \n     currently actuarially sound, the Trustees note with great \n     concern the past and projected rapid growth in the cost of \n     the program.\n       (2) In spite of the evidence of somewhat slower growth \n     rates in the recent past, overall, the past growth rates have \n     been rapid, and the future growth rates are projected to \n     increase above those of the recent past.\n       (3) Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the \n     program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent \n     per enrollee in the last 5 years.\n       (4) For the same time period, the program grew 19 percent \n     faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the \n     costs of the program.\n\n     SEC. 2. RECOMMENDATIONS ON RESOLVING PROJECTED FINANCIAL \n                   IMBALANCE IN MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1995, the Board of \n     Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Board of Trustees of the Federal Supplementary Medical \n     Insurance Trust Fund shall submit to the Congress \n     recommendations for specific program legislation designed \n     solely--\n       (1) to control medicare hospital insurance program costs \n     and to address the projected financial imbalance in the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund in both the short-range \n     and long-range; and\n       (2) to more effectively control medicare supplementary \n     medical insurance costs.\n       (b) Use of Intermediate Assumptions.--The Boards of \n     Trustees shall use the intermediate assumptions described in \n     the 1995 annual reports of such Boards in making \n     recommendations under subsection (a).\n

117--RELATING TO DEDUCTIONS FOR HOME MORTGAGES\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Kempthorne) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 117\n\n       Whereas homeownership is an important factor in promoting \n     economic security and stability for American families;\n       Whereas homeownership is a fundamental American ideal, \n     which promotes social and economic benefits beyond the \n     benefits that accrue to the occupant of the home;\n       Whereas homeownership promotes and stabilizes neighborhoods \n     and communities;\n       Whereas it is proper that the policy of the Federal \n     Government is and should continue to be to encourage \n     homeownership;\n       Whereas the increase in the cost of housing over the last \n     10 years has been greater than the increase in family income;\n       Whereas for the first time in 50 years, the percentage of \n     people in the United States owning their own homes has \n     declined;\n       Whereas the percentage of people in the United States \n     between the ages of 25 and 29 who own their own homes has \n     declined from 43 percent in 1976 to 38 percent today;\n       Whereas the current Federal income tax deduction for \n     interest paid on debt secured by first homes located in the \n     United States has been a valuable cornerstone of this \n     Nation's housing policy for most this century and may well be \n     the most important component of housing-related tax policy in \n     America today;\n       Whereas the current Federal income tax deduction for \n     interest paid on debt secured by second homes located in the \n     United States is of crucial importance to the economies of \n     many communities; and\n       Whereas the Federal income tax deduction for interest paid \n     on debt secured by a first or second home has been limited \n     twice in the last 6 years, and was further eroded as a result \n     of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     current Federal income tax deduction for interest paid on \n     debt secured by a first or second home located in the United \n     States should not be further restricted.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, of the challenges confronting America \ntoday--challenges that must be addressed by this Congress--the security \nof the American family is paramount. Much has been written and spoken \nabout the welfare of family life, about the need to keep the family \nunit strong in our effort to secure a bright and productive American \nfuture.\n  One of the significant resources our families have is home ownership. \nIndeed, this resource is of such value that home ownership is \nconsidered the icon of the American dream. It lends to economic, \nphysical, and emotional security. It keeps our neighborhoods strong and \ncontributes to a necessary sense of community. It gives families not \nonly a stake in the future, but a means to improve the future. Home \nequity and ownership often become the means by which we send our \nchildren to college, finance small businesses, or prepare for \nretirement.\n  It's clear that the benefits of home ownership go far beyond the \nfamily; they contribute to society as a whole. For example, the \nproperty tax base is often the foundation for public education. And as \na Nation we have been richly rewarded by the Government policies that \nhave encouraged people to realize the American dream.\n  What concerns me today, Mr. President, is that a full 60 percent of \nAmericans can no longer afford a median-priced home. It concerns me \nthat the increase in the cost of housing over the last 10 years has \nbeen greater than the increase in family income. And it concerns me \nthat for the first time in 50 years, the percentage of people in the \nUnited States owning their own homes has declined.\n   [[Page S6358]] When trends like these threaten the American Dream, \nand these trends are being felt, Mr. President, I was troubled by a \nGallup-CBS polls taken recently that showed that 8 out of every 10 \nAmericans believe it will be harder for the next generation to achieve \nthe American Dream--8 out of every 10. When these trends threaten the \nAmerican Dream of home ownership, we must be clear in our policies here \nin Washington, that we will continue to work to promote an environment \nof security and opportunity.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, in submitting a resolution to \nprevent further restriction of the Federal income tax deduction for \nhome mortgage interest. To further limit or eliminate the deductibility \nof mortgage interest for homeowners--the majority of which are middle-\nincome Americans--would be to restrict their ability to buy into the \nAmerican dream.\n  It is no secret that homeownership is a fundamental American ideal. \nCutting or wiping out this deduction, which has been available to \nAmericans since 1913, will simply put the possibility of homeownership \nout of reach for many Americans. The mortgage interest deduction is one \nof a number of tax benefits that serves a good social purpose. It is \nnot an unintended loophole but, rather, a provision created to foster \ninvestment by the private sector. The home mortgage interest deduction \nhas served as one of the cornerstones of our national housing policy, \nmaking us one of the best housed countries in the world and creating \nsafe and secure neighborhoods.\n  Further restrictions could also have a disastrous effect on the \nAmerican housing industry, especially if interest rates continue to \nrise. People simply will not be able to buy homes, which would have a \ndevastating impact on the economy, particularly the banking, lending \nand construction industries. Higher unemployment rates would result and \nlocal governments would suffer, as shrinking homeownership would, in \nturn, mean a dwindling tax base.\n  Mr. President, the National Association of Home Builders estimates \nthat eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction would reduce the \nvalue of an average American home by about 20 percent. For all intents \nand purposes this would have the effect of a heavy tax increase. For \nthe sake of the economy and middle-income Americans we cannot erode the \nAmerican dream: homeownership.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6357-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 118--CONCERNING UNITED STATES-JAPAN TRADE RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, \nMr. Ashcroft, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Pressler, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Specter, Mr. Brown, and Mr. D'Amato) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

A civil \n     action for negligent entrustment is similarly not subject to \n     this Act and shall be subject to applicable State law.\n       (b) Scope of Preemption.--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), this Act supersedes any State law regarding \n     recovery for harm caused by a product only to the extent that \n     this Act establishes a rule of law applicable to any such \n     recovery. Any issue arising under this Act that is not \n     governed by any such rule of law shall be governed by \n     applicable State or Federal law.\n       (2) The provisions of title I shall not supersede or \n     otherwise preempt any provision of applicable State or \n     Federal law.\n       (c) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by any State under any provision of law;\n       (2) supersede any Federal law;\n       (3) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States;\n       (4) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (5) preempt State choice-of-law rules including those with \n     respect to claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of \n     a foreign nation;\n       (6) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of forum non conveniens; or\n       (7) supersede any statutory or common law, including an \n     action to abate a nuisance, that authorizes a State or person \n     to institute an action for civil damages or civil penalties, \n     cleanup costs, injunctions, restitution, cost recovery, \n     punitive damages, or any other form of relief resulting from \n     contamination or pollution of the environment (as defined \n      [[Page S6361]]  in section 101(8) of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980; 42 U.S.C. 9601(8)), or the threat of such contamination \n     or pollution.\n       (d) Construction.--This Act shall be construed and applied \n     after consideration of its legislative history to promote \n     uniformity of law in the various jurisdictions.\n       (e) Effect of Court of Appeals Decisions.--Any decision of \n     a United States court of appeals interpreting the provisions \n     of this Act shall be considered a controlling precedent and \n     followed by each Federal and State court within the \n     geographical boundaries of the circuit in which such court of \n     appeals sits, except to the extent that the decision is \n     overruled or otherwise modified by the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of its enactment and \n     shall apply to all civil actions pursuant to this Act \n     commenced on or after such date, including any action in \n     which the harm or the conduct which caused the harm occurred \n     before the effective date of this Act, but shall not apply to \n     claims existing prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\n           TITLE I--ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES\n\n     SEC. 102. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A claimant or defendant in a civil action \n     subject to this Act may, within the time permitted for making \n     an offer of judgment under section 101, serve upon an adverse \n     party an offer to proceed pursuant to any voluntary, \n     nonbinding alternative dispute resolution procedure \n     established or recognized under the law of the State in which \n     the civil action is brought or under the rules of the court \n     in which such action is maintained. An offeree shall, within \n     ten days of such service, file a written notice of acceptance \n     or rejection of the offer; except that the court may, upon \n     motion by the offeree make prior to the expiration of such \n     ten-day period, extend the period for response for up to \n     sixty days, during which discovery may be permitted.\n       (b) Defendant's Penalty for Unreasonable Refusal.--The \n     court shall assess reasonable attorney's fees (calculated in \n     the manner described in section 101(f)) and costs against the \n     offeree, if--\n       (1) a defendant as offeree refuses to proceed pursuant to \n     such alternative dispute resolution procedure;\n       (2) final judgment is entered against the defendant for \n     harm caused by a product; and\n       (3) the defendant's refusal to proceed pursuant to such \n     alternative dispute resolution procedure was unreasonable or \n     not in good faith.\n       (c) Good Faith Refusal.--In determining whether an \n     offeree's refusal to proceed pursuant to such alternative \n     dispute resolution procedure was unreasonable or not in good \n     faith, the court shall consider such factors as the court \n     deems appropriate.\n\n                 TITLE II--STANDARDS FOR CIVIL ACTIONS\n\n     SEC. 202. UNIFORM STANDARDS OF PRODUCT SELLER LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Standards of Liability.--In any civil action for harm \n     caused by a product, a product seller other than a \n     manufacturer is liable to a claimant, only if the claimant \n     establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that--\n       (1)(A) the individual product unit which allegedly caused \n     the harm complained of was sold by the defendant; (B) the \n     product seller failed to exercise reasonable care with \n     respect to the product; and (C) such failure to exercise \n     reasonable care was a proximate cause of the claimant's harm; \n     or\n       (2)(A) the product seller made an express warranty, \n     independent of any express warranty made by a manufacturer as \n     to the same product; (B) the product failed to conform to the \n     product seller's warranty; and (C) the failure of the product \n     to conform to the product seller's warranty caused the \n     claimant's harm; or\n       (3)(i) the product seller engaged in conduct representing a \n     conscious or flagrant indifference to safety or in conduct \n     representing intentional wrongdoing; and\n       (ii) such conduct was approximate cause of the harm that is \n     the subject of the complaint.\n       (b) Conduct of Product Seller.--(1) In determining whether \n     a product seller is subject to liability under subsection \n     (a)(1), the trier of fact may consider the effect of the \n     conduct of the product seller with respect to the \n     construction, inspection, or condition of the product, and \n     any failure of the product seller to pass on adequate \n     warnings or instructions from the product's manufacturer \n     about the dangers and proper use of the product.\n       (2) A product seller shall not be liable in a civil action \n     subject to this Act based upon an alleged failure to provide \n     warnings or instructions unless the claimant establishes \n     that, when the product left the possession and control of the \n     product seller, the product seller failed--\n       (A) to provide to the person to whom the product seller \n     relinquished possession and control of the product any \n     pamphlets, booklets, labels, inserts, or other written \n     warnings or instructions received while the product was in \n     the product seller's possession and control; or\n       (B) to make reasonable efforts to provide users with the \n     warnings and instructions with it received after the product \n     left its possession and control.\n       (3) A product seller shall not be liable in a civil action \n     subject to this Act except for breach of express warranty \n     where there was no reasonable opportunity to inspect the \n     product in a manner which would or should, in the exercise of \n     reasonable care, have revealed the aspect of the product \n     which allegedly caused the claimant's harm.\n       (c) Treatment as Manufacturer.--A product seller shall be \n     deemed to be the manufacturer of a product and shall be \n     liable for harm to the claimant caused by a product as if it \n     were the manufacturer of the product if--\n       (1) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process \n     under the laws of any State in which the action might have \n     been brought; or\n       (2) the court determines that the claimant would be unable \n     to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer.\n       (d) Rented or Leased Products.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person \n     engaged in the business of renting or leasing a product \n     (other than a person excluded from the definition of product \n     seller under section 314(a)(b)(c) shall be subject to \n     liability in a product liability action under subsection (a), \n     but shall not be liable to a claimant for the tortious act of \n     another solely by reason of ownership of such product.\n       (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), and for determining the \n     applicability of this title to any person subject to \n     paragraph (1), the term ``product liability action'' means a \n     civil action brought on any theory for harm caused by a \n     product or product use.\n\n     SEC. 203. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Punitive damages may be awarded in any \n     civil action subject to this Act to any claimant who \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm \n     suffered by the claimant was the result of conduct \n     manifesting a manufacturer's or product seller's conscious or \n     flagrant indifference to the safety of those persons who \n     might be harmed by the product. A failure to exercise \n     reasonable care in choosing among alternative product \n     designs, formulations, instructions, or warnings is not of \n     itself such conduct. Punitive damages may not be awarded in \n     the absence of an award of compensatory damages.\n       (b) Judicial Determination.\n\n     SEC. 204. UNIFORM TIME LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Statute of Limitations.--Any civil action subject to \n     this Act shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within \n     two years of the time the claimant discovered or, in the \n     exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the harm \n     and its cause, except that any such action of a person under \n     legal disability may be filed within two years after the \n     disability ceases. If the commencement of such an action is \n     stayed or enjoined, the running of the statute of limitations \n     under this section shall be suspended for the period of the \n     stay or injunction.\n       (b) Statute of Repose for Capital Goods.--(1) Any civil \n     action subject to this Act shall be barred if a product which \n     is a capital good is alleged to have caused harm which is not \n     a toxic harm unless the complaint is served and filed within \n     twenty-five years after the time of delivery of the product. \n     This subsection shall apply only if the court determines that \n     the claimant has received or would be eligible to receive \n     compensation under any State or Federal workers' compensation \n     law for harm caused by the product.\n       (2) A motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or train, used \n     primarily to transport passengers for hire, shall not be \n     subject to this subsection.\n       (3) As used in this subsection, the term--\n       (A) ``capital good'' means any product, or any component of \n     any such product, which is of a character subject to \n     allowance for depreciation under the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, and which was--\n       (i) used in a trade or business;\n       (ii) held for the production of income; or\n       (iii) sold or donated to a governmental or private entity \n     for the production of goods, for training, for demonstration, \n     or for other similar purposes; and\n       (B) ``time of delivery'' means the time when a product is \n     delivered to its first purchaser or lessee who was not \n     involved in the business of manufacturing or selling such \n     product or using it as a component part of another product to \n     be sold.\n       (c) Extension of Period for Bringing Certain Actions.--If \n     any provision of this section would shorten the period during \n     which a civil action could be brought under otherwise \n     applicable law, the claimant may, notwithstanding such \n     provision of this section, bring the civil action pursuant to \n     this Act within one year after the effective date of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Effect on Right to Contribution or Indemnity.--Nothing \n     in this section shall affect the right of any person who is \n     subject to liability for harm under this Act to seek and \n     obtain contribution or indemnity from any other person who is \n     responsible for such harm.\n       (e) Paragraph (b)(1) does not bar a product liability \n     action against a defendant who made a warranty in writing as \n     to the safety of the specific product involved which was \n     longer than 25 years, but it will apply at the expiration of \n     that warranty.\n\n     SEC. 205. WORKERS' COMPENSATION SUBROGATION STANDARDS.\n       (a) In General.--(1) An employer or workers' compensation \n     insurer of an employer \n      [[Page S6362]]  shall have a right of subrogation against a \n     manufacturer or product seller to recover the sum of the \n     amount paid as workers' compensation benefits for harm caused \n     to an employee by a product if the harm is one for which a \n     civil action has been brought pursuant to this Act. To assert \n     a right of subrogation an employer or workers' compensation \n     insurer of an employer shall provide written notice that it \n     is asserting a right of subrogation to the court in which the \n     claimant has filed a complaint. The employer or workers' \n     compensation insurer of the employer shall not be required to \n     be a necessary and proper party to the proceeding instituted \n     by the employee.\n       (2) In any proceeding against or settlement with the \n     manufacturer or product seller, the employer or the workers' \n     compensation insurer of the employer shall have an \n     opportunity to assert a right of subrogation upon any payment \n     and to assert a right of subrogation upon any payment made by \n     the manufacturer or product seller by reason of such harm, \n     whether paid in settlement, in satisfaction of judgment, as \n     consideration for covenant not to sue, or otherwise. The \n     employee shall not make any settlement with or accept any \n     payment from the manufacturer or product seller without \n     notifying the employer in writing prior to settlement. \n     However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the \n     employer or workers' compensation insurer of the employer is \n     made whole for all benefits paid in workers' compensation \n     benefits or has not asserted a right of subrogation pursuant \n     to this section.\n       (3) If the manufacturer or product seller attempts to \n     persuade the trier of fact that the claimant's harm was \n     caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the issue whether the claimant's harm was \n     caused by the claimant's employer or coemployees shall be \n     submitted to the trier of fact. If the manufacturer or \n     product seller so attempts to persuade the trier of fact, it \n     shall provide written notice to the employer. The employer \n     shall have the right to appear, to be represented, to \n     introduce evidence, to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and \n     to argue to the trier of fact as to this issue as fully as \n     though the employer were a party although not named or joined \n     as a party to the proceeding. Such issue shall be the last \n     issue submitted to the trier of fact. If the trier of fact \n     finds by clear and convincing evidence that the claimant's \n     harm was caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the court shall proportionally reduce the \n     damages awarded by the trier of fact against the manufacturer \n     or product seller (and correspondingly the subrogation lien \n     of the employer) by deducting from such damages a sum equal \n     to the percentage at fault found attributable to the employer \n     or coemployee multiplied by the sum of the amount paid as \n     workers' compensation benefits. The manufacturer or product \n     seller shall have no further right by way of contribution or \n     otherwise against the employer for such sums. However, the \n     employer shall not lose its right of subrogation because of \n     an intentional tort committee against the claimant by the \n     claimant's coemployees or for acts committed by coemployees \n     outside the scope of normal work practices.\n       (4) If the verdict shall be that the claimant's harm was \n     not caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the manufacturer or product seller shall \n     reimburse the employer or workers' compensation insurer of \n     the employer for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs \n     incurred in the resolution of the subrogation claim, as \n     determined by the court.\n       (b) Effect on Certain Civil Actions.--(1) In any civil \n     action subject to this Act in which damages are sought for \n     harm for which the person injured is or would have been \n     entitled to receive compensation under any State or Federal \n     workers' compensation law, no third party tortfeasor may \n     maintain any action for implied indemnity or contribution \n     against the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive \n     representative of the person who was injured.\n       (2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any \n     provision of a State or Federal workers' compensation law \n     which prohibits a person who is or would have been entitled \n     to receive compensation under any such law, or any other \n     person whose claim is or would have been derivative from such \n     a claim, from recovering for harm caused by a product in any \n     action other than a workers' compensation claim against a \n     present or former employer or workers' compensation insurer \n     of the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive \n     representative of the person who was injured.\n       (3) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any \n     State or Federal workers' compensation law which permits \n     recovery based on a claim of an intentional tort by the \n     employer or coemployee, where the claimant's harm was caused \n     by such an intentional tort.\n\n     SEC. 206. SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in \n     any civil action subject to this Act, the liability of each \n     defendant for noneconomic loss shall be joint and several.\n       (b) De Minimis Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), \n     in any civil action subject to this Act, the liability for \n     noneconomic loss of each defendant found to be less than 15% \n     at fault shall be several only and shall not be joint.

A civil \n     action for negligent entrustment is similarly not subject to \n     this Act and shall be subject to applicable State law.\n       (b) Scope of Preemption.--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), this Act supersedes any State law regarding \n     recovery for harm caused by a product only to the extent that \n     this Act establishes a rule of law applicable to any such \n     recovery. Any issue arising under this Act that is not \n     governed by any such rule of law shall be governed by \n     applicable State or Federal law.\n       (2) The provisions of title I shall not supersede or \n     otherwise preempt any provision of applicable State or \n     Federal law.\n       (c) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by any State under any provision of law;\n       (2) supersede any Federal law;\n       (3) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States;\n       (4) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (5) preempt State choice-of-law rules including those with \n     respect to claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of \n     a foreign nation;\n       (6) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of forum non conveniens; or\n       (7) supersede any statutory or common law, including an \n     action to abate a nuisance, that authorizes a State or person \n     to institute an action for civil damages or civil penalties, \n     cleanup costs, injunctions, restitution, cost recovery, \n     punitive damages, or any other form of relief resulting from \n     contamination or pollution of the environment (as defined in \n     section 101(8) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; 42 U.S.C. 9601(8)), \n     or the threat of such contamination or pollution.\n       (d) Construction.--This Act shall be construed and applied \n     after consideration of its legislative history to promote \n     uniformity of law in the various jurisdictions.\n       (e) Effect of Court of Appeals Decisions.--Any decision of \n     a United States court of appeals interpreting the provisions \n     of this Act shall be considered a controlling precedent and \n     followed by each Federal and State court within the \n     geographical boundaries of the circuit in which such court of \n     appeals sits, except to the extent that the decision is \n     overruled or otherwise modified by the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n\n     SEC. 5. JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL COURTS.\n\n       The district courts of the United States shall not have \n     jurisdiction over any civil action pursuant to this Act, \n     based on section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, United States \n     Code.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of its enactment and \n     shall apply to all civil actions pursuant to this Act \n     commenced on or after such date, including any action in \n     which the harm or the conduct which caused the harm occurred \n     before the effective date of this Act, but shall not apply to \n     claims existing prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\n           TITLE I--ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES\n\n     SEC. 102. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A claimant or defendant in a civil action \n     subject to this Act may, within the time permitted for making \n     an offer of judgment under section 101, serve upon an adverse \n     party an offer to proceed pursuant to any voluntary, \n     nonbinding alternative dispute resolution procedure \n     established or recognized under the law of the State in which \n     the civil action is brought or under the rules of the court \n     in which such action is maintained. An offeree shall, within \n     ten days of such service, file a written notice of acceptance \n     or rejection of the offer; except that the court may, upon \n     motion by the offeree make prior to the expiration of such \n     ten-day period, extend the period for response for up to \n     sixty days, during which discovery may be permitted.\n       (b) Defendant's Penalty for Unreasonable Refusal.--The \n     court shall assess reasonable attorney's fees (calculated in \n     the manner described in section 101(f)) and costs against the \n     offeree, if--\n       (1) a defendant as offeree refuses to proceed pursuant to \n     such alternative dispute resolution procedure;\n       (2) final judgment is entered against the defendant for \n     harm caused by a product; and\n       (3) the defendant's refusal to proceed pursuant to such \n     alternative dispute resolution procedure was unreasonable or \n     not in good faith.\n       (c) Good Faith Refusal.--In determining whether an \n     offeree's refusal to proceed pursuant to such alternative \n     dispute resolution procedure was unreasonable or not in good \n     faith, the court shall consider such factors as the court \n     deems appropriate.\n\n                 TITLE II--STANDARDS FOR CIVIL ACTIONS\n\n     SEC. 201. CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n       A person seeking to recover for harm caused by a product \n     may bring a civil action against the product's manufacturer \n     or product seller pursuant to applicable State or Federal \n     law, except to the extent such law is inconsistent with any \n     provision of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 202. UNIFORM STANDARDS OF PRODUCT SELLER LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Standards of Liability.--In any civil action for harm \n     caused by a product, a product seller other than a \n     manufacturer is liable to a claimant, only if the claimant \n     establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that--\n       (1)(A) the individual product unit which allegedly caused \n     the harm complained of was sold by the defendant; (B) the \n     product seller failed to exercise reasonable care with \n     respect to the product; and (C) such failure to exercise \n     reasonable care was a proximate cause of the claimant's harm; \n     or\n       (2)(A) the product seller made an express warranty, \n     independent of any express warranty made by a manufacturer as \n     to the same product; (B) the product failed to conform to the \n     product seller's warranty; and (C) the failure of the product \n     to conform to the product seller's warranty caused the \n     claimant's harm; or\n       (3)(i) the product seller engaged in conduct representing a \n     conscious or flagrant indifference to safety or in conduct \n     representing intentional wrongdoing; and\n       (ii) such conduct was approximate cause of the harm that is \n     the subject of the complaint.\n       (b) Conduct of Product Seller.--(1) In determining whether \n     a product seller is subject to liability under subsection \n     (a)(1), the trier of fact may consider the effect of the \n     conduct of the product seller with respect to the \n     construction, inspection, or condition of the product, and \n     any failure of the product seller to pass on adequate \n     warnings or instructions from the product's manufacturer \n     about the dangers and proper use of the product.\n       (2) A product seller shall not be liable in a civil action \n     subject to this Act based upon an \n      [[Page S6364]]  alleged failure to provide warnings or \n     instructions unless the claimant establishes that, when the \n     product left the possession and control of the product \n     seller, the product seller failed--\n       (A) to provide to the person to whom the product seller \n     relinquished possession and control of the product any \n     pamphlets, booklets, labels, inserts, or other written \n     warnings or instructions received while the product was in \n     the product seller's possession and control; or\n       (B) to make reasonable efforts to provide users with the \n     warnings and instructions with it received after the product \n     left its possession and control.\n       (3) A product seller shall not be liable in a civil action \n     subject to this Act except for breach of express warranty \n     where there was no reasonable opportunity to inspect the \n     product in a manner which would or should, in the exercise of \n     reasonable care, have revealed the aspect of the product \n     which allegedly caused the claimant's harm.\n       (c) Treatment as Manufacturer.--A product seller shall be \n     deemed to be the manufacturer of a product and shall be \n     liable for harm to the claimant caused by a product as if it \n     were the manufacturer of the product if--\n       (1) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process \n     under the laws of any State in which the action might have \n     been brought; or\n       (2) the court determines that the claimant would be unable \n     to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer.\n       (d) Rented or Leased Products.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person \n     engaged in the business of renting or leasing a product \n     (other than a person excluded from the definition of product \n     seller under section 314(a)(b)(c) shall be subject to \n     liability in a product liability action under subsection (a), \n     but shall not be liable to a claimant for the tortious act of \n     another solely by reason of ownership of such product.\n       (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), and for determining the \n     applicability of this title to any person subject to \n     paragraph (1), the term ``product liability action'' means a \n     civil action brought on any theory for harm caused by a \n     product or product use.\n\n     SEC. 203. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Punitive damages may be awarded in any \n     civil action subject to this Act to any claimant who \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm \n     suffered by the claimant was the result of conduct \n     manifesting a manufacturer's or product seller's conscious or \n     flagrant indifference to the safety of those persons who \n     might be harmed by the product. A failure to exercise \n     reasonable care in choosing among alternative product \n     designs, formulations, instructions, or warnings is not of \n     itself such conduct. Punitive damages may not be awarded in \n     the absence of an award of compensatory damages.\n       (b) Judicial Determination--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, in an action that is subject to this Act in which \n     punitive damages are sought, the trier of fact shall \n     determine, concurrent with all other issues presented, \n     whether such damages shall be allowed. If such damages are \n     allowed, a separate proceeding shall be conducted by the \n     court to determine the amount of such damages to be awarded.\n       (2) Factors.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, in determining the amount of punitive damages awarded in \n     action that is subject to this Act, the court shall consider \n     the following factors:\n       (A) The likelihood that serious harm would arise from the \n     misconduct of the defendant in question.\n       (B) The degree of the awareness of the defendant in \n     question of that likelihood.\n       (C) The profitability of the misconduct to the defendant in \n     question.\n       (D) The duration of the misconduct and any concealment of \n     the conduct by the defendant in question.\n       (E) The attitude and conduct of the defendant in question \n     upon the discovery of the misconduct and whether the \n     misconduct has terminated.\n       (F) The financial condition of the defendant in question.\n       (G) The total effect of other punishment imposed or likely \n     to be imposed upon the defendant in question as a result of \n     the misconduct including any awards of punitive or exemplary \n     damages to persons similarly situated to the claimant and the \n     severity of criminal penalties to which the defendant in \n     question has been or is likely to be subjected.\n       (H) Any other factor that the court determines to be \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 204. UNIFORM TIME LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Statute of Limitations.--Any civil action subject to \n     this Act shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within \n     two years of the time the claimant discovered or, in the \n     exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the harm \n     and its cause, except that any such action of a person under \n     legal disability may be filed within two years after the \n     disability ceases. If the commencement of such an action is \n     stayed or enjoined, the running of the statute of limitations \n     under this section shall be suspended for the period of the \n     stay or injunction.\n       (b) Statute of Repose for Capital Goods.--(1) Any civil \n     action subject to this Act shall be barred if a product which \n     is a capital good is alleged to have caused harm which is not \n     a toxic harm unless the complaint is served and filed within \n     twenty-five years after the time of delivery of the product. \n     This subsection shall apply only if the court determines that \n     the claimant has received or would be eligible to receive \n     compensation under any State or Federal workers' compensation \n     law for harm caused by the product.\n       (2) A motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or train, used \n     primarily to transport passengers for hire, shall not be \n     subject to this subsection.\n       (3) As used in this subsection, the term--\n       (A) ``capital good'' means any product, or any component of \n     any such product, which is of a character subject to \n     allowance for depreciation under the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, and which was--\n       (i) used in a trade or business;\n       (ii) held for the production of income; or\n       (iii) sold or donated to a governmental or private entity \n     for the production of goods, for training, for demonstration, \n     or for other similar purposes; and\n       (B) ``time of delivery'' means the time when a product is \n     delivered to its first purchaser or lessee who was not \n     involved in the business of manufacturing or selling such \n     product or using it as a component part of another product to \n     be sold.\n       (c) Extension of Period for Bringing Certain Actions.--If \n     any provision of this section would shorten the period during \n     which a civil action could be brought under otherwise \n     applicable law, the claimant may, notwithstanding such \n     provision of this section, bring the civil action pursuant to \n     this Act within one year after the effective date of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Effect on Right to Contribution or Indemnity.--Nothing \n     in this section shall affect the right of any person who is \n     subject to liability for harm under this Act to seek and \n     obtain contribution or indemnity from any other person who is \n     responsible for such harm.\n       (e) Paragraph (b)(1) does not bar a product liability \n     action against a defendant who made a warranty in writing as \n     to the safety of the specific product involved which was \n     longer than 25 years, but it will apply at the expiration of \n     that warranty.\n\n     SEC. 205. WORKERS' COMPENSATION SUBROGATION STANDARDS.\n       (a) In General.--(1) An employer or workers' compensation \n     insurer of an employer shall have a right of subrogation \n     against a manufacturer or product seller to recover the sum \n     of the amount paid as workers' compensation benefits for harm \n     caused to an employee by a product if the harm is one for \n     which a civil action has been brought pursuant to this Act. \n     To assert a right of subrogation an employer or workers' \n     compensation insurer of an employer shall provide written \n     notice that it is asserting a right of subrogation to the \n     court in which the claimant has filed a complaint. The \n     employer or workers' compensation insurer of the employer \n     shall not be required to be a necessary and proper party to \n     the proceeding instituted by the employee.\n       (2) In any proceeding against or settlement with the \n     manufacturer or product seller, the employer or the workers' \n     compensation insurer of the employer shall have an \n     opportunity to assert a right of subrogation upon any payment \n     and to assert a right of subrogation upon any payment made by \n     the manufacturer or product seller by reason of such harm, \n     whether paid in settlement, in satisfaction of judgment, as \n     consideration for covenant not to sue, or otherwise. The \n     employee shall not make any settlement with or accept any \n     payment from the manufacturer or product seller without \n     notifying the employer in writing prior to settlement. \n     However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the \n     employer or workers' compensation insurer of the employer is \n     made whole for all benefits paid in workers' compensation \n     benefits or has not asserted a right of subrogation pursuant \n     to this section.\n       (3) If the manufacturer or product seller attempts to \n     persuade the trier of fact that the claimant's harm was \n     caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the issue whether the claimant's harm was \n     caused by the claimant's employer or coemployees shall be \n     submitted to the trier of fact. If the manufacturer or \n     product seller so attempts to persuade the trier of fact, it \n     shall provide written notice to the employer. The employer \n     shall have the right to appear, to be represented, to \n     introduce evidence, to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and \n     to argue to the trier of fact as to this issue as fully as \n     though the employer were a party although not named or joined \n     as a party to the proceeding. Such issue shall be the last \n     issue submitted to the trier of fact. If the trier of fact \n     finds by clear and convincing evidence that the claimant's \n     harm was caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the court shall proportionally reduce the \n     damages awarded by the trier of fact against the manufacturer \n     or product seller (and correspondingly the subrogation lien \n     of the employer) by deducting from such damages a sum equal \n     to the percentage at fault found attributable to the employer \n     or coemployee multiplied by the sum of the amount paid as \n     workers' compensation benefits. The manufacturer or product \n     seller shall have no further right by way of contribution or \n     otherwise against the employer for such sums. However, the \n     employer shall not lose its right of subrogation because of \n     an intentional tort committee \n      [[Page S6365]]  against the claimant by the claimant's \n     coemployees or for acts committed by coemployees outside the \n     scope of normal work practices.\n       (4) If the verdict shall be that the claimant's harm was \n     not caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or \n     coemployees, then the manufacturer or product seller shall \n     reimburse the employer or workers' compensation insurer of \n     the employer for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs \n     incurred in the resolution of the subrogation claim, as \n     determined by the court.\n       (b) Effect on Certain Civil Actions.--(1) In any civil \n     action subject to this Act in which damages are sought for \n     harm for which the person injured is or would have been \n     entitled to receive compensation under any State or Federal \n     workers' compensation law, no third party tortfeasor may \n     maintain any action for implied indemnity or contribution \n     against the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive \n     representative of the person who was injured.\n       (2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any \n     provision of a State or Federal workers' compensation law \n     which prohibits a person who is or would have been entitled \n     to receive compensation under any such law, or any other \n     person whose claim is or would have been derivative from such \n     a claim, from recovering for harm caused by a product in any \n     action other than a workers' compensation claim against a \n     present or former employer or workers' compensation insurer \n     of the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive \n     representative of the person who was injured.\n       (3) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any \n     State or Federal workers' compensation law which permits \n     recovery based on a claim of an intentional tort by the \n     employer or coemployee, where the claimant's harm was caused \n     by such an intentional tort.\n\n     SEC. 206. SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in \n     any civil action subject to this Act, the liability of each \n     defendant for noneconomic loss shall be joint and several.\n       (b) De Minimis Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), \n     in any civil action subject to this Act, the liability for \n     noneconomic loss of each defendant found to be less than 15% \n     at fault shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each \n     defendant shall be liable only for the amount of noneconomic \n     loss allocated to such defendant in direct proportion to such \n     defendant's percentage of responsibility as determined under \n     subsection (c). A separate judgment shall be rendered against \n     such defendant for that amount.\n       (c) Proportion of Responsibility.--For purposes of this \n     section, the trier of fact shall determine the proportion of \n     responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.\n       (b) Other Civil Actions.--In any civil action subject to \n     this Act in which not all defendants are manufacturers or \n     product sellers and the trier of fact determines that no \n     liability exists against those defendants who are not \n     manufacturers or product sellers, the court shall enter a \n     judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of any \n     defendant which is a manufacturer or product seller if it is \n     proved that the claimant was intoxicated or was under the \n     influence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug and that as a \n     proximate cause of such intoxication or the influence of the \n     alcohol or drug the claimant was more than 50 percent \n     responsible for the accident or event which resulted in such \n     claimant's harm.\n       (c) Intoxication Determination to be Made Under State \n     Law.--For purposes of this section, the determination of \n     whether a person was intoxicated or was under the influence \n     of intoxicating alcohol or any drug shall be made pursuant to \n     applicable State law.\n       (d) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``drug'' \n     means any non-over-the-counter drug which has not been \n     prescribed by a physician for use by the claimant.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      McCONNELL AMENDMENT NO. 748\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BREAUX submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 690, proposed by Mr. Coverdell to amendment No. 596, \nproposed by Mr. Gorton, to the bill, H.R. 956, supra; as follows:\n\n       In amendment No. 655, add the following new subsection (c):\n       (c) This Section shall not apply to foreign manufacturers \n     located in a country:\n       (i) with which the United States has an Agreement of \n     Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, or the equivalent, which \n     provides for nationals of that country to receive national \n     treatment with respect to access to the courts of justice \n     within the territory of the United States;\n       (ii) with that is a signatory to the Hague Convention on \n     the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in \n     Civil or Commercial Matters;\n       (iii) with that is a signatory to the Hague Convention on \n     the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters; \n     or\n       (iv) with which the United States has a Consular Agreement, \n     or the equivalent, permitting consular service of process \n     within that country;\n\n     at the time a relevant product liability action is initiated.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 749\n\n  Mr. HARKIN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 690 proposed by Mr. \nCoverdell to amendment No. 596 proposed by Mr. Gorton to the bill H.R. \n956, supra; as follows:\n\n       In section 107(b) of the amendment as amended by amendment \n     No. 709, insert the following:\n       (6)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the amount of \n     punitive damages that may be awarded in any product liability \n     action that is subject to this title against an owner of an \n     unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, \n     unit of local government, or organization that has 25 or more \n     full-time employees shall be the greater of--\n       (I) an amount determined under paragraph (1); or\n       (II) 2 times the average value of the annual compensation \n     of the chief executive officer (or the equivalent employee) \n     of such entity during the 3 full fiscal years of the entity \n     immediately preceding the date on which the award of punitive \n     damages is made.\n       (ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term \n     `compensation' includes the value of any salary, benefit, \n     bonus, grant, stock option, insurance policy, club \n     membership, or any other matter having pecuniary value.''.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6358-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6365-S6366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nongoing situation in Iran.\n  Clearly, the situation in Iran today is one of desperation. The \nIranian people, suffering the depredations of 16 years of rule by a \ncorrupt, terrorist, regime, deserve better. They deserve to have a \ngovernment that respects the rich and dignified history of the Iranian \npeople. Unfortunately, what they have gotten is a government that \nviolates their human rights and has brought a formerly rich and varied \neconomy down upon the shoulders of the people, suffocating them.\n  While we know that the regime in Teheran practices terrorism with \ngreat frequency throughout the world, most people forget that they also \ninflict terror against their own people. If they will torture and \nexecute their own people, what respect will they have for those of \nother nations?\n  Mr. President, today we must understand one simple fact: the \nterrorist regime in Iran does not represent the Iranian people. It \nrepresents murder, terror, and destruction, nothing more and nothing \nless. The Iranian people deserve better, and they deserve freedom from \nthe corrupt rule of the terrorist regime that calls itself the \nGovernment of Iran.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6366-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6366-S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             GOVERNOR EDWARDS ON THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nspeech by Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards be printed in the Congressional \nRecord. Governor Edwards recently made remarks concerning the House-\npassed Contract With America and its effect on Louisiana. I found \nGovernor Edward's remarks very informative, and I wanted to share them \nwith my colleagues.\n  The speech follows:\n\n                       Speech by Governor Edwards\n\n       I have said repeatedly that I do not believe the actions of \n     American voters last fall were an endorsement of the so-\n     called Republican ``Contract with America'' so much as a \n     general dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for \n     new faces.\n       National surveys indicate that few voters knew anything \n     about the contents of the so-called contract when they went \n     to the polls, and still fewer based their votes on support \n     for its provisions.\n       As the Republican Congressional leaders continue to act \n     upon what they claim is a mandate for their so-called \n     contract, however, it has been necessary for me as a \n     responsible Governor of a small state (1.7 percent of U.S. \n     population) with a large percentage of poor people to take a \n     closer look at just what the provisions mean to the people of \n     Louisiana.\n       I don't like what I see. I am convinced that Louisianians, \n     at least, would not have voted for the contract. I am alarmed \n     because it appears that the end result effectively will be a \n     contract ``on'' the children of Louisiana and, ultimately, on \n     the well-being of the entire state.\n       Neither Louisiana nor our nation can afford to balance the \n     federal budget on the backs of its most vulnerable and its \n     most precious resources--its children. But what makes these \n     particular efforts even more onerous is that the cuts will \n     not be applied to reduce the federal deficit and, thus, \n     reduce the price these same children will be paying on behalf \n     of the nation in the future. Rather, the cuts will be used to \n     compensate for tax breaks to wealthy individuals and \n     corporations.\n       This ``contract on Louisiana children'' means that while \n     families with incomes of $200,000 a year get tax breaks that \n     will put cash in their pockets, many of our poor children \n     will have food taken out of their mouths. Literally, 59,000 \n     of Louisiana's poor children will lose school lunches; 28,500 \n     poor children will lose meals and snacks in child-care and \n     Head Start programs, and about 410,000 children will lose 10 \n     percent of their food stamp benefits.\n       Under the welfare block grant proposal of House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich, Louisiana will lose about $1.68 billion over \n     the next five years that otherwise would be used for our \n     children--especially those who are poor, hungry, disabled, \n     abused or neglected, or sick.\n       Even setting aside the devastating human effect, the state \n     would suffer economically. The $1.68 billion potentially lost \n     to the state's economy represents almost twice as much as \n     Louisiana's annual, net income-tax revenues. The ripple \n     effect throughout our business community--whether it be ``Mom \n     and Pop'' service stations, shoe shops or grocery chains \n     would be a disaster that would have a ruinous ``trickle \n     down'' effect on our parishes and towns.\n       Louisiana already is struggling to meet its obligations to \n     serve the health-care needs of our poor people under new \n     federal Medicaid requirements that have reduced federal aid \n     to the state and threaten to wipe out new economic gains the \n     state is making. We cannot afford this contract on our \n     state's economy.\n       And that would only be the start. Louisiana would get a \n     smaller share of federal dollars that it does today, despite \n     having a larger proportion of poor people than most other \n     states and an average per-capita income that is only 80 \n     percent of the U.S. average. History shows that block grants \n     tend to shrink over years as the spotlight fades away from \n     them. Further, if the national economy fell into a decline, \n     there would be no strengthening of the assistance safety net.\n       And there is more. The contract threatens the 433,958 \n     children under age 21 who received Medicaid-covered services \n     in 1993 in Louisiana at a cost of about $1,928 per child.\n       In 1991, 31,420 births were financed by Medicaid, and \n     payments for maternity and newborn care were 4.5 percent of \n     total Medicaid expenditures in the state. Meanwhile the \n     infant mortality rate decreased by 22 percent between 1984 \n     and 1992--from 12.1 to 9.4 per 1,000 live births--obviously a \n     result of better access to health care, among other factors.\n       What will happen to the birth rate, to the pregnant \n     mothers, the infants, and to our children if that access is \n     reduced because of budget cuts? That is a campaign \n     ``contract'' victory I for one would not care to claim.\n       I am the very embodiment of the difference a good education \n     can make in the future of a poor child. However, if \n     Republicans succeed with their stated intentions: 101,621 \n     Louisiana college students--who already pay more than the \n     Southern states' average in tuition--will pay more for \n     student loans; 670 of Louisiana's young people will not \n     participate in national service jobs that allow them to earn \n     college tuition; 62 of our state's 66 school districts will \n     lose money now available to help them make their schools safe \n     and drug-free; 2,400 Louisiana students with special needs \n     will lose extra help they need to learn and to succeed, and \n     27,000 teenagers in Louisiana will lose summer jobs.\n       Our young people cannot afford this ``contract on their \n     future.''\n       And there is more: 7,460 Louisiana children are at risk of \n     losing access to safe, affordable child care--a move which \n     not only threatens the well-being of the children but also \n     the \n      [[Page S6367]]  psychological well-being of the parents \n     while they are at work; another 1,700 abused and neglected \n     children will lose foster care; 28,500 blind and disabled \n     children lose SSI cash assistance immediately, and 114,000 \n     low-income children lose cash assistance.\n       The contract falls also on 41,531 senior citizens and \n     families with children in our state who will lose assistance \n     they depend upon to provide heat during the winter, and \n     17,747 Louisiana families who otherwise could count on an FHA \n     loan, their only access to an affordable home loan, to help \n     them buy their first houses.\n       These are only some of the disastrous effects of the \n     contract on Louisiana that threaten the young, the weak and \n     the poor--in short, the very people who need our help the \n     most. I do not believe that was the intent of the American \n     voters nor is the wish of Louisiana voters. And I do not \n     believe it is in the best interests of either the American \n     people or their elected representatives.\n       I am reminded of the words of Jesus who described in the \n     Gospel of St. Matthew (Chapter 25, verses 44-45) how on \n     Judgement Day those on the left hand of God would ask: `Lord, \n     when saw we Thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or \n     naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? \n     Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, \n     Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye \n     did it not to Me.'\n       May I respectfully suggest as we open our ears to listen to \n     the popular political rhetoric of tax cuts and budget \n     balancing that we pause for a moment and open our eyes to the \n     consequences on those who can least afford to bear the \n     burdens which will be heaped upon them in the attempt to \n     achieve these goals.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6366-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO CATONS CHAPEL-RICHARDSON COVE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Catons \nChapel-Richardson Cove Volunteer Fire Department in Sevierville, TN, \nfor their dedication and service to their community. In east \nTennessee's Sevier County, the county-operated fire department is often \nunable to reach the remote areas of Catons Chapel and Richardson Cove \nin time to save a burning house or building--the distance is just too \ngreat. As a result, residents in those areas of the county obtained a \nState charter in 1992 to create a volunteer fire department that could \nbetter serve those communities.\n  The fire department began with a handful of volunteers, who met in \nthe basement of a local store to plant the development and cost of a \nfully operational fire department. With about $18,000 from the county \nto get started, the volunteers held small fundraisers and obtained a \nbank loan to raise the additional money they needed to construct a \nfirehouse and purchase fire trucks and other equipment. A local \nresident donated land, and in November 1993, the community broke ground \nfor the firehouse.\n  Mr. President, not only did the Catons Chapel-Richardson Cove \nvolunteers do much of the construction on the fire station themselves, \nthey have built this entire department from the ground up. These \nvolunteer firefighters are the true definition of public servants--they \nrecognized a need in their community and have worked hard to satisfy \nit.\n  Now, all of that work is beginning to pay off. The fire department \nhas 22 volunteer firefighters, most whom have been trained by the \nSevier Firefighters School. The department also has three fire trucks, \nincluding one that can pump more than 1,000 gallons of water per \nminute, protective clothing, air packs, and experience--volunteers from \nthe Catons Chapel-Richardson Cove department have responded to and \nassisted on many calls in the area.\n  Mr. President, the most important thing about these firefighters is \nthat they are all volunteers. Every time the department receives a call \nto respond, these citizens leave their families and risk their lives to \nhelp save a neighbor's life and home or to prevent a local business \nfrom losing everything that it has. Mr. President, this country is full \nof dedicated public servants like the volunteers in Sevier County, but \nall too often, their work goes unnoticed. Today, I would like to \nrecognize the firefighters in the Catons Chapel-Richardson Cove \nVolunteer Fire Department and the nine members of the department's \nvolunteer advisory board and thank them for their efforts and dedicated \nservice to their community.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6367-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LADY OF REDEMPTION CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an \nimpressive milestone which will soon be achieved by a church in Warren, \nMI. On May 13, 1995, Our Lady of Redemption Church will celebrate its \n75th anniversary. The church serves over 4,000 parishioners in the \nDetroit area. In fact, it is the largest Melkite-Catholic Eastern Rite \nParish in the United States.\n  The Detroit community benefits from a number of community service \nactivities performed by members of this historic church. Our Lady of \nRedemption regularly holds food drives and their contributions reach \nfar and wide to Detroit area food banks. Parishioners provide volunteer \nhelp to area hospitals, they support the Hunger Action Coalition, and \nthey participate in the Metro Detroit Youth Day. The parish annually \ndonates its facilities for use by the city of Warren's Parks and \nRecreation Department. Not only is Our Lady of Redemption the spiritual \ncenter for its members, but the church regularly organizes activities \nwith parishes of other denominations to interchange fellowship in the \nspirit of ecumenism.\n  Please join me in saying congratulations to an integral member of the \nDetroit community--Our Lady of Redemption Church. I thank the clergy \nand members of this church for their dedicated service and wish them \nmany more years of fellowship.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/09/senate-section/article/S6367-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      SUBMISSION OF MOTION ADOPTED IN THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.
