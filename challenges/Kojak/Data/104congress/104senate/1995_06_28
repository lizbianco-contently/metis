Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1484\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes for debate equally divided on the second Specter amendment, \n1484, to be followed by a vote on the amendment. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before my 2 minutes commence, may we have \norder in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would leave it to the \ndiscretion of the trial judge, as the Federal judges have discretion in \nall other cases, to decide whether there ought to be discovery after \nthe defense files a motion to dismiss. The judges currently have the \nfull authority to stop discovery if it is inappropriate.\n  What is happening here, as with many of the other rules changes in \nthe bill, is a wholesale revolution in the way securities cases are \nhandled without having followed any of the usual procedures prescribed \nby law under which the Supreme Court of the United States establishes \nthe rules after hearings and consideration by advisory committees and \nrecommendation from the Judicial Conference, and without ever having \nhad the Committee on the Judiciary consider these issues.\n  It is true that there are some frivolous lawsuits which are filed in \nAmerica today, but we are dealing here with an industry which in 1993 \nhad transactions on the stock exchanges of $3.663 trillion, new issues \nof $54 billion, and the savings of many small investors and the \nproverbial widows and orphans at risk.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission does not have the resources to \nhandle all the potential violations as enforcement matters. That is why \nthere are private actions. When you take a look at the lawyers' fees, \nthey are a pittance compared to the over $3.6 trillion involved. What \nis happening here, Mr. President, is we are not throwing the baby out \nwith the bath water. We are throwing out the entire family with the \nbath water.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if we are going to talk about the \nsecurities industry we should talk about its role in capital formation, \nin fact the securities industry is an integral part of the American \nsystem--and that system is now being ripped off. As a matter of fact, \none law firm does handle about 30 percent of all this litigation. They \ngo out and hire plaintiffs, they have lists of plaintiffs to chose \nfrom, and then they race to the courthouse.\n  Let me tell you, once they bring the suit, firms feel they have to \nsurrender. In 93 percent of the cases brought, people give up. Do you \nknow why? Because the average case costs you $6 million to defend; so \neven if you win you lose.\n  So the defendants are forced to settle before costs get too high. The \npeople, the small investors get nothing back. The law firm rakes in the \nsettlement. No wonder the lawyers want to keep the system the same.\n  Now, let me tell you something what this legislation says on staying \ndiscovery. When a person makes a motion to dismiss, ``discovery and \nother proceedings shall be stayed unless the Court finds, upon the \nmotion of any other party, that particularized discovery is necessary \nto preserve evidence.''\n  So you can stay discovery unless the court rules against that motion. \nIf you cannot stay discover, however, then they are in there fishing, \nfishing, fishing, until they find any piece of evidence to force \ncorporate America to give up, to surrender. The little guy is not \nprotected by this process. The interest of a group of entrepreneurial \nlawyers is advanced. This amendment would continue that system and let \nthose lawyers continue to go out fishing and keep corporate America \nheld hostage. It is about time we freed them.\n  Mr. President, if all time has been yielded back, I move to table, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 1484, offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, \n[Mr. Specter]. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes for debate equally divided for the third Specter amendment No. \n1485, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have asked my colleagues to listen to \nthis amendment. In the well of the Senate, I won several votes, finally \nhaving received a hearing on the last amendment.\n  What this amendment does is to accept the very stringent standard of \nthe second circuit on pleading to show state of mind, and then it adds \nto the legislation the way the second circuit says you can allege the \nnecessary state of mind.\n  The bill, quite properly, tightens up the pleading standards by \nestablishing the most stringent rule of any circuit. The committee \nreport takes pride and says that the committee does not adopt a new and \nuntested pleading standard but takes the second circuit standard. But \nthen in four lengthy, well-reasoned opinions, the second circuit has \nsaid this is how you can allege the required state of mind. They set \ntwo ways down to prove it, which I would like to read to you but I do \nnot have time.\n  All this amendment does is says that when you take the second circuit \nstandard, admittedly stringent, this is how you get it done--not the \nexclusive way--but the way you get it done. In asking the managers and \nthe proponents of the bill, I have yet to hear any reason advanced why \nthis is not sound, even after they conferred with their staffs.\n  This is just basic fundamental fairness that if you take the second \ncircuit standard, you ought to take the entire standard, which is very \ntough on plaintiffs to establish state of mind, which is hard to prove. \nHow do you get into somebody else's head? But at least \n\n[[Page S9201]]\nwhen the second circuit says this is the way it ought to be done and \nthe bill says let us make it really tough, at least let the plaintiff \nknow how they are going to be able to plead it by the way the second \ncircuit itself permits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know that the proponents of this \nlegislation are attempting to stop the kind of litigation that has made \nsecurities cases a sham. This amendment goes too far, however, because \nit actually tells the court how to interpret S. 240's pleading \nstandards. S. 240 codifies the second circuit pleading standard, but \nthis amendment goes further, to say precisely what evidence a party may \npresent to show a strong inference of fraudulent intent. I think this \nstraitjackets the court.\n  Having said that, I could accept referring to the courts \ninterpretation, but I think we are going too far if we adopt the \nlanguage that the court referred to because it would tie the courts \nhand by forcing it to ask that plaintiffs prove exactly the delineated \nfacts; alleging facts to show the defendant had both the motive and \nopportunity to commit fraud and by alleging facts that constitute \nstrong circumstantial evidence.\n  To be quite candid with you, I think it places too great a burden on \nthe plaintiffs, and I have a difficult time understanding how the \nSenator from Pennsylvania feels that this would add fairness to this \nprocess. We tried to be balanced in setting this standard, that is why \nwe did not straitjacket the court with the language in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to move to table. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1480\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 7 \nminutes of debate on the Boxer amendment, with 5 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Boxer and 2 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom New York, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. My colleagues, I will make this \nvery brief and, I hope, interesting, because I think it is an \ninteresting issue that is raised by the Boxer amendment. This is the \nlast Boxer amendment on this bill, I am happy to say.\n  I think we have shown in this Chamber we can be very tough on crime. \nToday I am giving Members a chance to show we can be tough on white-\ncollar crime. I am afraid if we do not adopt this amendment, we are \nopening the door to insider trading, which could really hurt a lot of \nsmall investors.\n  My amendment simply says that you do not get the benefit of the safe \nharbor in S. 240 if you are an insider trader who personally profits in \nconnection with the issuance of a false and misleading statement.\n  Let me show a couple of real examples. Here is the company called \nCrazy Eddie. Some may remember. What happened here? The insiders bought \na lot of the stock, it went up, and at the peak, they started selling \nit after they made a false and misleading statement: ``We are confident \nthat our market penetration can grow appreciably. Growing evidence of \nconsumer acceptance of the Crazy Eddie name augurs well for continuing \ngrowth.'' They get out, and the top officer flees the country with \nmillions of dollars. The CEO is convicted of fraud. Under this bill, \nthe safe harbor would apply to these people.\n  I will show another quick example. Here is another company, T2 \nMedical. They said: ``T2 plans to lead the way through the 1990's. We \nexpect steady revenue in earnings growth.'' Then there is a bad report \nabout the company, which they obviously knew because they get out of \nthe stock. It goes down and all the stockholders are left holding the \nbag.\n  What we are basically saying is, if you are an insider and you \nbenefit, you should not have the benefit of the safe harbor under this \nbill.\n  I want to tell Members what the opponents of my amendment have said. \nFirst, they said my definition of insiders is too broad. Nothing could \nbe farther from the truth. It is a boilerplate. It is the corporation, \nit is the officers, and the board of directors. That is what insiders \nare.\n  Then they say, ``But, Senator, you include purchases as well as \nsales.'' Anyone who follows the stock market knows that insiders often \npurchase the stock of a company before the false and misleading \nstatement so they can get in at a cheap price.\n  The last thing they have said is that, ``Gee, this is covered by \nanother statute.'' That is not true. Only if you happen to buy the \nspecific shares that the insider sells you, are you covered in another \nstatute. If you are an ordinary shareholder, a small investor, you get \nhit, because these guys run away with all the money, the stock, plus \nyou are left holding the bag.\n  I want to show one article here. If Members are wondering whether \ninsider trading is common now--because we heard about it in the \n1980's--let me tell Members about it. Saturday, in the Los Angeles \nTimes, ``Insider-Trading Probes Make a Comeback.'' ```We have more \ninsider-trading investigations now than at any time since the takeover \nboom in the 1980's,' says Thomas Newkirk, Associate Director of \nEnforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission.''\n  Then I thought this statement by Gary Lynch, who, as chief of \nenforcement at the SEC in the 1980's, brought about the investigations \nof Boesky and Milken: ``What's happening now is exactly what everyone \npredicted back in the '80's: That with the number of high profile cases \nbrought, the incidence of insider trading would decline for a while, \nbut as memories dulled, insider trading would pick up again,'' said \nLynch. ``The temptation is too great for people to resist.''\n  So, insider trading is back. We should not have a safe harbor for \nthese people. Forty-eight Members voted for one of the Sarbanes \namendments, which would have taken another look at this safe harbor. It \ndid not pass.\n  I say to my friends who voted against that, the least those Members \ncan do is narrow the safe harbor for people who profit, who make false \nand misleading statements. I want to say that again: The only people \nwho would not get the safe harbor in S. 240 under the Boxer amendment \nare those insiders who personally profit in connection with the \nissuance of a false and misleading statement. \n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, please stand up against white-collar crime. I \nthink this is a very good amendment Members could be proud to support. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I hesitate to challenge my friend from \nCalifornia. She has a background as a stockbroker. This is an area \nwhere she has great expertise.\n  I must share with Members my own experience in trying to recruit \ndirectors for a company that would become a public company. They said, \n``The grief that goes with being a director under the present law is so \noverwhelming that I simply do not need it. I will not accept \nappointment as a director.'' The only way we could change their minds \nwas to assure them that we had 20 million dollars' worth of officer and \ndirector insurance.\n  I know from my own experience as a director of a public company that \nthe present law is very stringent and, in my opinion, adequate. I am \nforbidden, as a director, to buy or sell any securities 30 days prior \nto a public announcement of our earnings, and, after the announcement \nhas been made, for another 48 hours after that announcement, I cannot \nenter the market to either buy or sell under the present law.\n  In my opinion, the present law is sufficient. The kind of people that \nare being talked about in the article that she offers from the Wall \nStreet Journal are breaking the law now and we do not need the \nredundancy of the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me say, first of all, insider trading is prohibited \nby section 10(B) and rule 10b-5 of the Federal securities laws. What \nthis amendment does is destroy the safe harbor, absolutely destroys it. \nAny small company that pays a director with stock options will be \neffectively excluded from the safe harbor. All the plaintiff would have \nto do is allege wrongdoing to bring a suit, which will open up this \nwhole area to continued litigation. This is a carefully crafted \namendment which would destroy what we are attempting to do, which is to \nfree corporate America from a group of bandits.\n  Mr. President, I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BOND (when his name was called).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express some concerns I \nhave regarding S. 240, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as \nreported by the Banking Committee.\n  The laudable goal of this legislation has been to reform the \nSecurities Litigation System to curb frivolous lawsuits. I strongly \nsupport the goal of deterring meritless securities class action \nlawsuits and believe that there is room for constructive improvement in \nthe current Federal securities litigation process. In some instances, \nmeritless class action cases can be costly to defend against and may \nimpose large and unnecessary costs on issuers and other participants in \nthe market. In other cases, small investors themselves are taken \nadvantage of by overzealous attorneys.\n  Nevertheless, in our quest for reform, it is crucial that we do not \nundermine the right of investors, particularly small investors, to \nprotect themselves against unscrupulous swindlers who use grossly \nexaggerated claims to lure investors. Private litigation under Federal \nsecurities laws is an important complement to the SEC's Enforcement \nProgram. We must not curtail legitimate rights of the investor to \nlitigate.\n  Over the past several weeks, an intense battle has been waged over \nthe airwaves on the merits and motives of this legislation. At times, \nthese assaults have been aimed not only at the bill's provisions, but \nat its sponsors as well, with insinuations that supporters of S. 240 \nare intentionally protecting securities fraud and are against senior \ncitizens. Unfortunately, once again mass media lobbying campaigns have \ndistilled a complex, and I believe earnest, reform effort into a white \nhat or black hat screenplay, casting any one who supports this branded \nbill an enemy of senior citizens. Somewhere in this heated debate, I \nbelieve that a balance must be achieved that protects the rights of \ndefrauded investors while also providing relief to above board \ncompanies who might find themselves the target of meritless or \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, \nand as a strong advocate of consumer protections against the elderly, I \nsuggest that there can and should be some middle ground. I am extremely \nconcerned about issues that affect the welfare of our senior citizens \nand, in particular, about fraudulent and abusive practices that are \ndirected against them. The Aging Committee has\n held a series of hearings on the special needs and issues facing the \nsmall, and often unsophisticated, investor. As interest rates declined \nover the last decade, the quest for higher yields has intensified, \nparticularly among senior citizens who often rely on their investments \nas a principal means of support. Many of them are low- and middle-\nincome retirees who have worked hard for their pensions, and who must \nnow make these pensions stretch over two or even three decades.\n\n  Retirees and others know they can invest in CD's with long periods of \nmaturity, but they are reluctant to tie up their money fearing that \nthey may have to tap into their savings for a major operation, \nexpensive drugs, or some other emergency. As a result, the lucrative \nsecurities market became a popular choice for the small, but often \nfinancially unsophisticated and inexperienced, investor.\n  For the first time in American history, investment company assets \nhave surpassed commercial bank deposits. The percentage of U.S. \nhouseholds that own mutual funds has more than quadrupled since 1980, \nwith over 38 million Americans investing in those funds. One out of \nthree American families now have investments in mutual funds or the \nstock market. While this mass movement into the securities market has \nprovided new opportunities for investors, it has also increased risk, \nled to a great deal of confusion, and, unfortunately, created \nopportunities ripe for fraud by securities dealers who misrepresent \nrisks to unsuspecting investors.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  Our Aging Committee hearings showed that low interest rates create an \nenvironment in which small investors are susceptible to outright \ninvestment fraud and abusive sales practices. Senior citizens are not \nthe exclusive prey of these market manipulators, but one factor makes \nscamming the senior citizen small investor particularly odious: Younger \nAmericans can restore some or all of their losses through new earnings, \nwhile seniors' savings are not a renewable resource. Accordingly, \nscammed seniors living on fixed incomes cannot write their losses off \nas a lesson learned for the future. Instead, their financial losses may \nbe the loss of their entire future.\n  Our Aging Committee investigation and hearings revealed a wide range \nof small investor frauds, from penny stock scams to large mutual fund \ncompanies deceptively peddling junk bonds. Our hearings also examined \nthe questionable marketing practices of some banks that sell uninsured \ninvestments, such as mutual funds, annuities and stocks. While we \nshould not close the door to banks wanting to sell securities, the \nhearing pointed out the special dangers and problems that this trend in \nbanking presents, namely that there is tremendous potential for \nconfusion by bank customers about the safety and nature of the \ninvestments they are buying. As bank customers are swayed more toward \nuninsured investments, we must ensure that they are fully informed of \nthe risks inherent in some of these investments and have adequate \nopportunity to seek redress remedies if they are intentionally misled \ninto these investments.\n  I cosponsored S. 240 as introduced to indicate my support for \nsecurities litigation reform efforts. Frivolous lawsuits have become \nall too common. I have concerns, however, that the bill reported by the \nBanking Committee does not strike the appropriate balance between \nsecurities litigation reform and investor protection.\n  First, I question whether the safe harbor provisions of the revised \nS. 240 may make it very difficult to sue when intentionally misleading \ninformation clauses investors to suffer losses. The original S. 240 \ndirected the SEC to develop regulatory safe harbor rules for forward-\nlooking statements. The new version of S. 240, however, establishes \nstatutory safe harbor rules. I am concerned that these rules would \nunwisely protect even some fraudulent statements that were made \nknowingly.\n  I have concerns that the revised version of S. 240 would leave \ndefrauded investors with the nearly insurmountable task of establishing \na corporate executive's actual intent, and that a few carefully placed \ndisclaimers could provide a legal protection for misleading statements \nthat were made knowingly.\n  I believe that the SEC should be given an opportunity to fashion a \nsafe harbor that strikes the proper balance.\n  Finally, S. 240 as reported dropped the extension of the statute of \nlimitations for private securities fraud actions contained in the \noriginal bill. I believe that the extension should have been retained \nin order to tip the balance of reform more toward investor protections.\n  I believe that the Banking Committee deserves much credit for \naddressing some of the major concerns with the original S. 240. The \nbill before us, for instance, contains no loser-pays provision, a \nprovision of the original bill which caused me concern.\n  Mr. President, the challenge before us today is to identify ways to \nmake the legal system more balanced and efficient. We must sift through \nthe dueling advertisements and challenges of ``pro-Keating'' and \n``antisenior'' on one side and challenges of ``antibusiness'' and \n``antireform'' on the other. An appropriate balance between the rights \nof investors to hold companies responsible for wrongdoing and the need \nof the companies to be protected from costly, meritless litigation must \nbe achieved.\n  I believe that the safe harbor rules should be implemented by \nregulation rather than statute. The regulatory process allows for full \nand fair comment by all sides to determine appropriate safe harbor \nrules. Also, once established, regulatory safe harbor rules offer \ngreater flexibility than would statutory ones. In the fast-changing \nworld of investment finance, this flexibility is important.\n  I wish that S. 240 retained the original safe harbor provision; \nbecause it does not, however, I regret that I can no longer support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the legislation currently before this \nbody, S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, is \nvery important for two reasons. First, what it seeks to achieve and \nsecond, what in actuality it will achieve if passed in its current \nform.\n  One of the stated purposes of this legislation is to curb abusive \nlawsuits--so-called strike suits where lawyers seek to get rich quick \nby preying on a company which suffers a loss in value. That is what \nthis legislation seeks to do and no one can quarrel with this goal. The \ninterests of the American people and the integrity of the American \nlegal system are not served by meritless lawsuits which drain precious \nresources from our national economy. This is true not just in the \ncontext of securities fraud, but also in the areas of product \nliability, of medical malpractice, in short, in every field of American \njurisprudence. Frivolous lawsuits should be discouraged.\n  However, what this bill will actually do is limit the rights of \ninvestors to recover money they lose due to fraud. Unfortunately, as \nmany of colleagues have already pointed out, this legislation fails to \nproperly balance the goal of stopping frivolous lawsuits with the need \nto preserve the rights of legitimate investors to recover in cases of \nsecurities fraud.\n  It is important to note that the laws this legislation amends, the \nSecurities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were \nthe direct result of the Great Depression. As the report to S. 240 \npoints out--the goal of these laws was to promote investor confidence \nin the securities markets. Unfortunately, the legislation we are now \nconsidering will erode, not enhance, investor confidence.\n  I want to touch briefly upon a few areas that I find particularly \nproblematic.\n\n\n              safe harbors for forward looking statements\n\n  The pending legislation contains a so-called safe harbor provision \nfor forward looking statements. I support the notion that full and \ncandid disclosure regarding the potential of a given company is \nbeneficial, not only to the potential investors but also to the \ncompanies involved. Candor, however, should not be confused with fraud. \nThe standard established by S. 240 makes only the most blatantly \nfraudulent statements subject to liability. The standard of proof is so \nhigh that the private plaintiff who actually prevails will be rare \nindeed.\n  I might add that the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, Arthur Levitt, in a letter dated May 25 said in regard to \nthis provision:\n\n       . . . I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud \n     to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection. The \n     scienter standard in the amendment is so high as to preclude \n     all but the most obvious fraud.\n\n  It is one thing to protect statements that are made in good faith, \nwithout intent to defraud, it is another issue altogether to protect \npeople based upon the standard contained in this legislation.\n  The appropriate approach, ironically the approach contained in the \noriginal bill, is to allow the SEC to complete the rulemaking process--\nto review comments and testimony--and determine the proper scope of the \nsafe harbor. Unfortunately, this commonsense approach has given way to \nan expansive exemption for all but the most egregious statements. This \nis unfortunate. While we clearly want to protect companies from being \ndragged into court over every comment or remark they make, we do not \nand should not protect those who engage in fraud at the expense of \ninnocent investors.\n  This is not an either-or proposition. The language of S. 240 seems to \nsuggest that the only way to truly protect the company is to also limit \nthe rights of investors.\n  I suggest this is far from the truth. The original S. 240 contained \nthe proper approach. We should return this function to the SEC, let \nthem do their work and adopt guidelines for a safe harbor which \nprotects companies and investors, but not those who deal in fraud. The \npurpose of this legislation is to eliminate fraudulent behavior, not to \nprotect it.\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\n\n\n                         statute of limitations\n\n  Another area of this legislation which does a disservice to the \nmillions of Americans who invest in securities is the failure to extend \nthe statute of limitations from bringing an action based upon \nsecurities fraud.\n  Under existing law, as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in \nLempf versus Gilbertson, the prevailing statute of limitations is 1 \nyear from discovery of the violation or no more than 3 years from the \ndate of the violation. This period is far too short. The complexity of \nthese cases necessitates an extension of this limitation.\n  Once again, S. 240 had the proper solution when it was introduced, \nyet as reported, the bill sustains the woefully inadequate status quo. \nThe original bill extended the statute of limitations to 2 years from \nthe date of discovery and 5 years from the date of violation. The \namendment of the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, would have adopted \nthis equitable standard.\n  With the exception of criminal offenses, all causes of action in the \nAmerican legal system are subject to a statute of limitations. The \ntheory being that while we want to give plaintiffs an adequate \nopportunity to recover, people should not live forever under the threat \nof litigation. The Bryan amendment recognized this and would have \nachieved that important balance.\n  The current statute of limitations goes beyond being fair to \npotential defendants. In fact, as Chairman Levitt pointed out in \ntestimony, the current statute of limitations rewards those \nperpetrators who conceal their fraud for only 3 years.\n  I might also note, that in regard to those handful of attorneys who \nthrive on frivolous litigation, the statute of limitations is of little \nconcern.\n  If, as we have heard during this debate, attorneys simply scan the \nnewspapers looking for companies reporting bad news, then fill in the \nblanks on their boiler plate complaints and rush to the courthouse \nwithin days of the news reports, what difference does the statute of \nlimitations make?\n  But for the innocent investor, who is saving for retirement, or to \nput children through college, or maybe just trying to live a little \nbetter life, it may mean the loss of a lifetime of hard work and \nsavings. The failure to extend the statute of limitations will result \nin legitimate plaintiffs, through no fault of their own, being \nforeclosed from any recovery. The statute of limitations does matter to \nthe average American investor--it matters a great deal.\n\n\n                          AIDING AND ABETTING\n\n  One final area that I want to touch upon is the liability of aiders \nand abetters, those lawyers, accountants and other professionals who \nassist primary wrongdoers in committing securities fraud. The private \ncause of action against aider and abettors, is a necessary tool in \ndeterring securities fraud.\n  Until last year, this private cause of action was available in every \ncircuit in America, provided that the assistance was substantial and \nhad some element of deception or recklessness. However, the Supreme \nCourt eliminated this private right.\n  Why should aiders and abettors, those people who profit from the \nfraud, why should they escape culpability? The answer to this question, \nand it should be obvious to all, is that they should not escape \nresponsibility.\n  Critics argue that these other professionals work behind the scenes \nand do not communicate directly with investors--in essence critics \nargue they are simply doing their jobs on someone elses behalf. Well, \nin my view there is a vast distinction between vigorously representing \nyour client and perpetuating that client's fraudulent actions.\n  And that is what we are talking about here--instances where aiders \nand abettors act recklessly or knowingly in perpetrating fraud. The SEC \nhas been very clear on this issue. Chairman Levitt came to the Senate \nand indicated that the conduct in question, aiding and abetting, should \nbe deterred and that in light of the Supreme Court's holding, the only \neffective way to do this is for Congress to act.\n  I have yet to hear a salient argument as to why a professional--and \nthese are professionals, lawyers, accountants, bankers--who recklessly \nor knowingly perpetrates a fraud on any investor should escape \nliability simply because they are not the primary defendant.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard from all sides of this debate a constant \nrefrain that we must reign in frivolous lawsuits. I agree with that \nobjective, but the legislation before us is not a balanced approach. It \nhurts the average American investor, by limiting access to the courts, \nand limiting the ability to recover money that others have fraudulently \ntaken from them.\n  I want to commend my colleagues from Maryland, Nevada, and \nCalifornia, as well as my colleague from Alabama for their efforts in \nimproving this legislation. They have offered a number of amendments \nthat could have improved this legislation. The amendments were \nuniformly rejected--that is regrettable.\n  This bill is important, and I had hoped that we could end up with \nlegislation which we could all support. However, unless the protection \nof the average American investor is given greater consideration, I \ncannot support this legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the legislation the Senate has been \nconsidering these past few days has been the subject of intense debate. \nWhile the legislation would appear to be rather dry and technical, its \neffect extends to a wide range of interests. Fraudulent actions by \nmanagement can destroy an individual investor's retirement nest egg; \nlikewise, a frivolous suit filed against a start-up high-technology \ncompany can stop that business dead in its tracks.\n  Most of us would agree that our goal here is to strike a balance. I \nhave been mindful that there are investors on both sides of the \nequation, and I have listened carefully to their concerns. I have also \nspoken with SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt about his agency's concerns and \nrecommendations about enforcing our securities laws.\n  Me and my staff have met regularly with the high-technology community \nin Massachusetts on this issue. This sector, which has been the most \nfrequent target of strike suits, is critical to our economic growth and \nthe creation of highly skilled, family-wage jobs. I want this sector to \ncontinue to grow and prosper, but frivolous strike suits have a truly \nchilling effect on start-up high-technology, bio-technology, and other \ngrowth businesses. The committee report states: ``small, high-growth \nbusinesses--because of the volatility of their stock prices--are \nparticularly vulnerable to securities fraud lawsuits when projections \ndo not materialize.'' Companies in Massachusetts and elsewhere have \nbeen hurt, but more importantly the people in those companies--from the \nCEO's on down--have been hurt by such strike suits.\n  I can also cite cases where companies in Massachusetts repeatedly \nmisrepresented sales, senior executives had to resign, and some of the \ncompanies went bankrupt. In one case a company paid an analyst for a \nleading national business magazine to publish a favorable report about \nits projected sales and earnings. Cases remain pending against some of \nthe auditors, so I will not mention names. These fraudulent actions \nresulted in hundreds if not thousands of investors losing significant \namounts, if not all, of their investments. The point is: It is not \ndifficult to find instances of abuse on both sides of the issue.\n  There is no doubt that this is an extremely complex area of the law, \nwhere minor word changes can produce major consequences. For example, \ndirecting plaintiffs to plead particular facts demonstrating the state \nof mind of each defendant at the time the alleged violation occurred \nseems reasonable to defendants. But for plaintiffs, this standard is \nmore like having to clear a pole vault bar than a high hurdle. I am \npleased the committee adopted my amendment regarding the pleadings \nstandard, and believe this example demonstrates the need for careful \nconsideration of the effect of seemingly minor word changes in this \narea. That is why I believe it is of the utmost importance that we \nproceed cautiously in amending our Nation's securities laws.\n  As the committee report notes: ``S. 240 is intended to encourage \nplaintiffs' lawyers to pursue valid claims for securities fraud and to \nencourage defendants to fight abusive claims.'' According to some \nsecurities litigators, the legislation as presently construed will make \nit more difficult to pursue \n\n[[Page S9205]]\nfrivolous cases, but not impossible to pursue valid ones, as some have \nargued during this debate. This legislation should also strengthen the \nhand of businesses in responding to suits they view as abusive by \nreducing the incentive they claim the present system imposes upon them \nfor early settlement. If the committee's expectations prove true in \npractice, then I believe we will have achieved the balance we sought \nwith regard to the initiation of so-called strike suits.\n  My outstanding concerns with this legislation lie at the conclusion \nof the process, where it is unclear whether we have achieved a balance \ncomparable to that established at the outset. In light of the \nlimitations on joint and several liability and in aiding and abetting \nin private actions, I question whether the legislation assures that \ninvestors who are victims of fraudulent securities actions will be able \nto recover all of their losses. Certainly, some of the provisions in \nthe bill will help investors recover a greater share of their losses \nvis-a-vis the attorneys; however, it is uncertain whether they will be \nable to recover all their losses, as proponents of the bill claim. \nHere, it would appear the legislation leans toward protecting \nproportionately liable defendants rather than toward assuring victims \nof fraud will recover fully their losses. Unfortunately, the amendments \noffered on the floor to provide such balance did not prevail.\n  A title of the legislation that will directly serve investors' \ninterests by requiring early detection and disclosure of fraud is \n``Title III--Auditor Disclosure of Corporate Fraud.'' I am proud to \nhave coauthored this title with Representative Wyden originally as \nfreestanding legislation, S. 630, the Financial Fraud Detection and \nDisclosure Act of 1993. It places on accountants and company auditors a \nclear responsibility for early detection and disclosure of illegal \nactions by management. The provision requires that if an accountant \nlearns of an illegal act that may have a material effect on the \ncompany's financial statements, the accountant must inform management, \nand, if management fails take corrective action, the accountant must \ninform the board of directors. If the board fails to notify the SEC \nwithin 1 day of its notification, and accountant must notify the SEC \nthe following day. Failure to provide this notification will subject \nthe accountant to stiff civil penalties. I believe these clear \nprocedures for early detection and disclosure of fraud by the \naccountants will serve the interests of both investors and business, \nand am pleased the committee incorporated this title into the \nlegislation.\n  The securities litigation reform bill we are about to vote upon is \nlikely to make it more difficult to bring frivolous strike suits, but \nmy preference also would have been to include stronger investor \nrecovery provisions in the sections relating to joint and several \nliability and aiding and abetting. I was disappointed that amendments \non these subjects did not prevail.\n  On balance, however, this legislation should lead to the creation of \na more favorable climate for investors and businesses. Investors should \ngain better information about the marketplace, more control over \nsecurities litigation should they choose to pursue class action suits, \nand, with the safeguards intended to weed out frivolous suits, \ninvestors should also find a climate more conducive to the fullest \nprosecution of securities fraud cases. A diminished threat of abusive \nstrike suits should strengthen the ability of businesses to raise \ncapital and to provide investors more information. Taken as a whole, \ntherefore, I will support S. 240.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our securities laws have served this \ncountry well for more than 60 years. Remember, the 1933 and 1934 \nsecurities acts were borne out of the 1929 stock market crash. Yet, the \nbill we are debating would topple our well-founded securities laws.\n  I oppose the so-called Securities Litigation Reform Act--not because \nI do not think we need some reforms--but, because by supposedly \ndiscouraging frivolous lawsuits, this legislation would discourage \nlegitimate suits too.\n  Let us be honest. Most corporate executives and plaintiff lawyers are \nresponsible. What we should do is target and penalize those who abuse \nthe system. But, we should not close the courthouse door to the many, \nin an attempt to reform the abuses of the few.\n  In an effort to fix abuses, this legislation strips safeguards that \nprotect millions of average Americans whose pensions are invested in \nsecurity plans. The result of which will be to let white collar \ncriminals go free.\n  I fought for 7 long years in this Chamber to pass a tough, smart, \nbalanced crime bill. And I stood on this floor with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle as we debated who could be tougher on crime.\n  Yet, here we stand today, debating a bill to give white collar crooks \nin three-piece suits a free ride. This so-called Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act is about white collar crime.\n  This is about law and order. The financial losses victims suffer can \nwipe them out.\n  I realize that securities laws are complex, but the devastating \nimpact of this legislation is simple:\n  It impacts our senior citizens--with 3 out of 4 seniors relying on \ninvestment income to meet some of their day-to-day living expenses.\n  It impacts police, firefighters, teachers, and labor and automobile \nunion members whose pensions are invested in securities.\n  Whether you live in a small town or a big city, if you are a small or \nlarge investor, this legislation affects you.\n  I have several major concerns with this legislation. First, investors \nwould have to prove that a corporation made a falsehood with a clear \nintent to deceive. That's incredibly tough to prove. Under current law, \ninvestors must show that unreasonable or reckless predictions of a \ncorporation's performance misled investors. If this bill becomes law, \nhowever, companies could get away with making misleading, even \nfraudulent, statements about their earnings.\n  Second, accountants, auditors, lawyers, and underwriters are given a \nfree ride--they can escape liability even if they go along with a \nfraudulent scheme. Some have compared that to giving the driver of a \ngetaway car immunity from prosecution for an armed robbery.\n  Third, the bill fails to modestly extend the statute of limitations \nfor investment fraud suits, which currently is too short. Instead of a \n1- to 3-year statute of limitation, we should give defrauded investors \n2 to 5 years. That's reasonable--and it would give victims more time to \nfile suit so that a guilty party does not dodge liability.\n  Finally, this bill wipes out joint and several liability--leaving \ncrime victims holding an empty bag and unable to get their money back.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric about the attack of the vulture lawyers--\npreying on corporations, stockbrokers, and accountants. But what about \nvulnerable investors?\n  Some unfounded lawsuits are filed. Some lawyers do make too much from \na suit--leaving defrauded investors too little. But, this massive \nbill--pushed through with such little examination, without a proper \nhearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to assess its impact on \nour judicial system--is not the answer.\n  Let us protect the small investor--not let white collar criminals go \nunpunished. If we pass this bill, mark my words, we will be back here \nin 2, 3, 4 years undoing it. There will be another Orange County--\nanother huge insider trading scandal--millions of defrauded Americans, \nparents, hard-working men and women--who will have no recourse and no \nhope for reimbursement if we let this bill become law.\n  There is a way to deal with the abuses in securities litigation. I am \na cosponsor of a bill introduced by Senators Bryan and Shelby, S. 667, \nthe Private Securities Enforcement and Improvements Act of 1995.\n  In response to the criticism that securities litigation suits are \ninitiated by professional plaintiffs, the Bryan-Shelby bill would \nrequire plaintiff class representatives to certify their complaints, \noutline their interest in the pending litigation, and list any \nsecurities suits they might have filed in the prior 12 months.\n  The Bryan-Shelby bill also would require that multiple securities \nclass actions brought against the same defendant be consolidated and \nthat a lead counsel be agreed upon by the various \n\n[[Page S9206]]\nplaintiffs, or appointed by the court if no such agreement can be \nreached.\n  I believe these new requirements for certification of complaints and \nthe new case management procedures would improve the securities \nlitigation process, without resorting to the extreme measures in the \nDodd-Domenici bill, which will shut the courthouse door to millions of \nvalid claims.\n  The Bryan-Shelby bill also includes a reasonable extension of the \nstatute of limitations for securities liability actions and would \nrestore liability for aiding and abetting if an accountant or lawyer \nknowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to another \nperson in violation of the securities laws.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators Sarbanes, Bryan, and \nBoxer, for leading the effort to improve the Dodd-Domenici bill. \nUnfortunately, however, we were only able to get a couple amendments \napproved.\n  I appreciate my colleagues support--on both sides of the aisle--for \nmy amendment that will maintain a civil RICO action against anyone who \nhas been criminally convicted of securities fraud, thereby tolling the \nstatute of limitations for such a RICO action until the final \ndisposition of the criminal case.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against S. 240. To supporters of this \nbill, I say, OK, you have the Nation's attention now. Let's go back to \nthe drawing board and draft a more reasonable approach based upon the \nBryan-Shelby bill to curb the relatively small number of frivolous \nsecurities lawsuits without dismantling the entire existing securities \nlitigation process.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, S. 240, the Securities Litigation Reform \nAct, is intended to deter frivolous securities litigation while \nprotecting the rights of investors to bring legitimate lawsuits. The \nsponsors of this legislation, arguing that opportunistic attorneys \noften file these lawsuits after precipitous reductions in stock prices, \nattempted to strike a delicate balance between these two competing \ninterests.\n  Unfortunately, the bill fails to strike that balance. The bill would \nmake it too difficult--if not impossible--for small investors to \nrecover losses resulting from securities fraud. S. 240 would establish \ncumbersome case-filing procedures designed to discourage litigation; \nshield from liability those who knowingly aid or abet fraudulent \nschemes; and limit too strictly the liability of those who make \nmisleading or false forward-looking projections of company performance.\n  While these provisions will deter frivolous lawsuits, they will also \ndiscourage meritorious ones. If the amendments offered by Senators \nSarbanes, Bryan, and Boxer had been accepted by the Senate, I perhaps \ncould have supported this bill. As it stands, however, this legislation \ngoes too far in protecting corporations and stockbrokers at the expense \nof small investors. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have reluctantly decided that I cannot \nvote in support of the version of S. 240 that is in front of us today. \nAs a cosponsor of S. 240, this was a difficult decision. But the \nchanges that have been made in this legislation make this a completely \ndifferent bill from the version I cosponsored. In my view, this version \nof S. 240 goes too far and will make it too difficult for innocent \ninvestors to recover in legitimate cases of securities fraud.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that we need to reform the \ncurrent securities litigation system. Too often when a stock drops \nsuddenly for reasons completely beyond the control of a corporation, \nthe corporation finds itself the subject of a so-called strike suit. \nThese strike suits border on legal extortion: The cost of defending the \nsuit and the risk of huge damages create a strong incentive to settle \nthe case even when the corporation has done nothing wrong. Moreover, \nthese suits have targeted not just the corporation whose stock has \ndropped, but also the accountants, lawyers and others who participated \nin the preparation of documents for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the public. These businesses, which often played only a \nmarginal role in the alleged fraud, can nonetheless be held fully \nliable. Finally, the current system does not serve investors well. In \ntoo many cases, lawyers walk away with millions of dollars in legal \nfees while the plaintiffs whose interests the lawyers are supposed to \nbe serving recover only a small portion of their losses.\n  In short, the current system does not work. It imposes a burden on \nentrepreneurial activity and impedes the efficient functioning of our \ncapital markets. As a result, all investors--and the economy as a \nwhole--suffer. That is why I cosponsored S. 240. I wanted to send a \nstrong signal that we need to reform the current system and put an end \nto frivolous, speculative lawsuits that serve little purpose but to \nenrich the lawyers who bring them.\n  At the same time, however, I fully recognize that there are \nlegitimate instances of securities fraud, and we must ensure that we \npreserve the rights of investors to seek redress in cases of true\n fraud. We should not protect Charles Keating, Ivan Boesky, or Michael \nMilken from the investors who lost their life savings as a result of \nsophisticated swindles. I believed, when I cosponsored S. 240, that it \nachieved this balance. And I was given assurances that--in a few areas \nwhere I thought the bill might go too far in curtailing the rights of \ninvestors--modifications would be made to ensure that legitimate suits \nwere fully protected.\n\n  Unfortunately, during the Banking Committee markup, S. 240 was \nsignificantly changed to the detriment of investors. As reported from \nthe committee, the delicate balance in the original bill was destroyed. \nInstead of a relatively narrow set of changes targeted directly at \nfrivolous strike suits, the bill that came to the Senate floor \ncontained radical changes that will make it far more difficult to bring \nany suit, including a legitimate suit where real fraud has occurred.\n  First, the new version of S. 240 contains a huge expansion of the \nsafe harbor for forward looking statements. S. 240 as introduced \ndirected the SEC to develop an expanded safe harbor to encourage \ncompanies to provide more information to the market on their expected \nfuture performance. Most observers expected this to result in a \nrelatively modest expansion of the safe harbor. In committee, this \nprovision was amended to provide a statutory safe harbor for forward \nlooking statements unless they are ``knowingly made with the purpose \nand actual intent of misleading investors.'' SEC Chairman Levitt has \nexpressed the view that this safe harbor will protect knowingly made \nfalse, misleading, and fraudulent statements. This will reduce \nconfidence in information and impede the efficiency of capital markets. \nThis is a significant, and potentially dangerous, change from the \nversion of S. 240 I cosponsored. It would make it extremely difficult \nto prosecute even the most outrageous of statements about expected \nfuture performance.\n  Second, the new version of S. 240 does not contain a necessary, \nmodest expansion of the statute of limitations in securities fraud \ncases. Pursuant to the Supreme Court's Lampf decision, the statute of \nlimitations in fraud cases is now 1 year from when the fraud was \ndiscovered but in no case longer than 3 years from the date the fraud \noccurred. S. 240 originally proposed to extend the statute of \nlimitations to 2 and 5 years because in sophisticated swindles it may \ntake longer than 1 and 3 years for a fraud to be sufficiently \nunderstood to bring suit. This was the most important unambiguously \npro-investor provision in the bill. However, during mark-up this \nprovision was deleted. This is a significant change; it will leave many \nplaintiffs with strong, legitimate complaints unable to bring suit if a \nfraud is uncovered too later for them to sue.\n  Third, the new version of the bill gives control of fraud suits to \nthe biggest investors, virtually excluding small investors from \nconsideration. Under the original bill, the court was required to \nappoint a plaintiff steering committee that held in aggregate at least \n5 percent of the securities involved or securities with a market value \nof $10 million, whichever is smaller, unless the judge decided a lower \nthreshold was appropriate. This formulation would have allowed a group \nof small investors to join together to control the lawsuit. But in \ncommittee this provision was dropped. In the new version, the court is \nrequired to appoint a single lead plaintiff, and there is a presumption \nthat the most adequate plaintiff will be the \n\n[[Page S9207]]\nclass member with the largest financial interest in the case, unless he \ncannot adequately represent the interests of the class. Unfortunately, \nin many cases the member with the biggest financial interest will be an \ninstitutional investor with interests, for example, holdings of stock \nin the corporation that are not subject to the suit or strong ties to \nthe board of directors, that may not mirror the interests of most other \nclass members. This provision could lead to significant litigation on \nwhether the presumed most adequate plaintiffs other interests \ndisqualify him and/or to settlements that do not always best serve the \ninterests of the majority of the class members.\n  Fourth, the new version of the bill for the first time imposes a cap \non the damages that an investor can recover. The provision limits \ndamages to no more than the difference between the purchase price of \nthe stock and the value of the security during the 90-day period after \ninformation correcting the fraudulent misstatement or omission is made \npublic. Although this may appear reasonable, it creates a strong \nincentive for the issuer to use the safe harbor for forward-looking \nstatements to puff the stock during this 90-day period and otherwise \nabuse the system by waiting to correct the misinformation until a \nstream of positive news can be released simultaneously.\n  Finally, the new version of S. 240 does not contain a provision \nrestoring liability for aiding and abetting a fraud. In 1994, the \nSupreme Court ruled that the securities statute does not cover private \nactions for aiding and abetting. The Chairman of the SEC has testified \nthat aiding and abetting liability should be restored. Although the \noriginal version of S. 240 similarly failed to address this issue, when \nI cosponsored S. 240 it was my understanding that this issue would be \naddressed before the bill came to the floor. However, the new version \nof S. 240 restores aiding and abetting liability only for individuals \nwho act knowingly. It does not fully restore liability for other \nparticipants in a fraud.\n  During floor debate, a series of amendments was offered to restore \nthe balance in the original bill. I voted for these amendments. \nUnfortunately, not one of these important changes was reversed. Thus, \nthe bill that we now have before us remains significantly different \nfrom the bill that I cosponsored. In its attempt to root out frivolous \nlawsuits, this version of the bill will make it far too difficult for \nsmall investors to prevail when they have been defrauded by \nunscrupulous Wall Street dealmakers. I cannot support this unbalanced \nversion of the bill.\n  It is my hope that the conferees will revisit these issues. We need \nsecurities litigation reform, and I would like to vote for a balanced \nconference report that fixes the many problems in the current system \nwithout creating new problems for small investors who have been fleeced \nby crooks on Wall Street.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I address my comments once again \nto the reservations I have regarding an important piece of legislation \nthat by my measuring is moving way too fast through this body, a piece \nof legislation that I believe may end up hurting legitimately aggrieved \ncitizens; a piece of legislation that, although I believe it is \nnecessary in some form and earnestly want to give it my support, I \nnonetheless find it difficult to support, given its present form. I am \nreferring, Mr. President, to S. 240.\n  Mr. President, I have heard the charges--about unethical lawyers \nlooking for deep pockets and hunting for a fast buck, about the \ntremendous number of meritless suits--some 300--that are filed and \nsettled each year regarding alleged securities fraud. I have had \nextensive discussions with Minnesota-based companies, many of them new \nhigh-technology firms, about the pressing need to plug the legal \nloopholes that allow companies to be intimidated by unethical \nattorneys. And I have heard the arguments of my respected colleagues \nthat this bill, S. 240, is the best way to stop such baseless strike \nsuits.\n  First, with regard to this problem of strike suits, Mr. President, I \ndo not think you will find anyone in this Chamber who believes in their \nheart that such lawsuits are in any way good for the country. Nobody is \narguing on behalf of such behavior. My cautious opposition to this \nbill--in its present form--should not hide the fact that I consider \nsuch actions to be the equivalent of blackmail, and detestable in the \nextreme.\n  But Mr. President, there are swindlers and fraudulent securities \nsetups out in the markets, and there are people who are legitimately \nhurt by such schemes. I have one report that in my State of Minnesota \nalone over the past decade, more than 25,000 Minnesotans have recovered \n$28\\1/2\\ million in money that was cheated out of them in stock and \nsecurities fraud; $28\\1/2\\ million, Mr. President, and that is just the \nmoney that was reportedly recovered. So it certainly would appear to me \nthat in addition to the real problem of the meritless strike suits, \nthere is another real problem--that of ongoing investment fraud.\n  The task of this bill in my view should be to balance these two \nneeds: To create tighter protections for honest companies who are \nforced to pay the equivalent of extortion to unethical attorneys, while \nmaintaining the protections that have existed for 60 years for \nlegitimately aggrieved investors.\n  Does this bill accomplish this delicate balancing act? In my view, \nno, it does not. It is in my view reckless, not because of how it \nhandles the problem of strike suits, but how it knocks down existing \nprotections for those who have had their savings cheated out of them. \nOne of my colleagues has in fact characterized this bill as addressing \n``recklessness''--and I must say that I agree that this bill does deal \nwith recklessness. But I must say that we part company on how and why \nwe reach those conclusions. It is not just the subject of this bill \nthat is recklessness--this bill itself is, by my measurement, reckless \nin how it turns back 60 years of protections that serve big and small \ninvestors alike.\n  On the surface I admit this bill appears to have very little to do \nwith the average American family. It appears to deal with high-rolling \nbond salespeople and securities attorneys and CPA's who live and die by \nthe smallest twists and turns of the financial markets. But scratch the \nsurface and who do you find under this bill? Hard-working honest \nAmerican families, that is who, Mr. President. After all, is it not \nretirement plans that fuel the economy? Isn't it the typical American \nfamily that has provided the capital needed by so many innovative \nstartup firms simply by investing their hard-earned savings in stocks \nand securities? Is it not this great majority of our country that with \n$1,000 here, $5,000 there, a pension fund over there, have built the \nmightiest success stories that make up the American landscape?\n  Of course it is. But now we are presented with this bill--a complex \npiece of legislation by anyone's accounting--that will take away some \nof the protections that have served these\n millions and millions of investors so well and for so long. Mr. \nPresident, I liken this bill to using a sledgehammer to cut a slice of \nbread: if a little reform of the law is good, then an all out attack on \nthe law must be better. I did not agree when we took a sledgehammer \napproach in the case of product liability reform, and I don't agree \nnow.\n\n  There are hundreds of strike suits filed each year--but there are \nalso thousands of legitimate cases of fraud as well. This bill should \nbalance the two; it should make necessary corrections it seems to me to \nplug up the legal loopholes that allow unethical lawyers to collect \nwhile retaining important, existing investor protections. But is this \nthe approach my colleagues have chosen? Do they propose to discreetly \nclose loopholes, or judiciously plug up the cracks that have allowed \nthe unethical attorneys to target big dollars? No, Mr. President, No, \nthey do not. Instead my colleagues would hammer away at time-tested \nprotections, saying in effect: ``No more. No more lawsuits. Unless you \nhave overwhelming evidence, unless you lost millions, unless you have a \nsophisticated understanding of securities law, unless you catch the \nmisdeed within a certain limited period, you can no longer sue to \nrecover the money from the swindlers and cheats who robbed it from \nyou.''\n  I am sure some of my colleagues would object to such a \ncharacterization of this bill--but, Mr. President, actions speak as \nloud as words. We have had many attempts on the floor to make this bill \nbetter, to more finely tailor \n\n[[Page S9208]]\nits language and scope to address the problem of strike suits. For \nexample, we had an amendment on the floor that would have extended the \nperiod in which wronged investors could file a suit against those who \ncommitted the fraud. That sounds like a good protection to me--and it \nwas an amendment that I supported. But did it pass? The answer is no. \nAnd let me emphasize: we have had numerous opportunities to amend this \nbill, make it better, more closely tailor it to the problems that \nexist, and I have supported those amendments. But Mr. President, those \namendments have been consistently rejected.\n  Under this bill, investors who bring a legal challenge run the risk \nof facing a court order to pay the entire court costs, thus \ndiscouraging many people from bringing suit who have been defrauded. \nThe bill also takes away the right to sue many of those who aid and \nabet in the fraud; effectively immunizing from private action lawyers, \naccountants, and countless others who may have assisted the primary \nwrongdoers who committee securities fraud.\n  Another example: This bill provides for extended immunity from \nprivate fraud liability for those corporations that release overly \noptimistic information when they have their first sale of stocks. This \nextended immunity does not protect investors; rather it is all but an \nopen invitation for crooked corporations and swindlers to promise the \nSun, Moon, and stars in their forward-looking statements, only then to \ntake the money and run once it becomes clear that the corporation will \nnever deliver what it promised. And those individuals, or private \npension funds, or counties that invested and lost money on such a \nbasis-too bad. Under this bill they are simply out of luck.\n  Individuals aren't the only ones who will be left with no protections \nunder this bill; counties and municipal governments and public \ninstitutions will have fewer protections as well. I have heard several \nreferences to Orange County, CA, made on the floor during debate, but \nOrange County is not the only one hurt by losses from derivatives \ninvestments. In Minnesota alone: Dakota County, $2.5 million lost; in \nChanhassen $4 million lost; the Minnesota Orchestral Association, $2 \nmillion lost; the University of Minnesota, $13-million lost; and Mr. \nPresident this is only a partial list. It is no wonder that groups like \nthe Municipal Treasurers Association, the National Association of \nCounty Treasurers and Finance Officers, and the National League of \nCities are but a few of the organizations opposing this bill as it is \ncurrently written.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the name of Charles Keating--perhaps one \nof the most famous of swindlers in recent memory--invoked many times on \nthe floor during this debate. Some people say that under this bill, \nthousands of people would never have been able to recover one thin dime \nfrom Mr. Keating. I have also heard some people say that claim is not \ntrue, and that this bill will not affect individuals' rights to collect \nwhat has been taken from them.\n  But Mr. President, the fact that we have so many great and respected \nlegal minds disagreeing so harshly over what this bill will actually do \nshould be the issue here. And until I, and the rest of my colleagues, \ncan be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that this bill will not hurt \nmiddle America, and will not swindle them out of their chance to \nprosecute the swindlers, there can be question. I cannot and will not \nsupport any measure that hurts those good, honest people who have \nentrusted us with their best interests.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I believe I bring a somewhat different \nperspective to the issue of securities than most other Members of this \nbody. Prior to coming to the U.S. Senate, I worked in the private \nsector. I co-founded a company with two others that today employs over \n20,000. After the company went public in 1961, I filed countless \nstatements with the SEC as its CEO. As the CEO, I believed it was \nimportant for investors to have as much information as possible.\n  Each year, I made it a practice to project earnings for the following \nyear. And if those projections needed modification due to changed \ncircumstances, I quickly went to the public to alert them to any \nrevision. This process had significant rewards because investor \nconfidence in my former company caused our stock, which is traded on \nthe New York Stock Exchange, to sell at among the highest price-\nearnings ratios of all listed securities on any exchange.\n  As I look back on that period, I know that I was in the forefront of \nCEO's who provided investors with forward-looking statements on my \ncompany's financial health. It made sense to me then. It makes sense to \nme now. I know many companies want to provide this information but do \nnot because they are concerned about their potential liability should \ntheir forecasts turn out to be off the mark. It is not in the public \ninterest for these companies to go out of business because of a lawsuit \nbased on a financial forecast, which despite the company's best \nefforts, later turns out to be inaccurate.\n  I remember how much the stock of biotech companies dropped when we \nwere discussing health care last year. Should those companies be held \naccountable for this drop? Of course not. We want to protect such \nfirms. But I believe this bill goes too far in the effort to do that; \nin fact, I believe the practical effect of this bill will be to \nimmunize certain fraudulent statements. This is just one example of the \nmany instances in which I believe the legislation is too extreme.\n  This is unfortunate because S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995, had the potential to be a good bill, perhaps a very \ngood bill. In my judgement, if a few key amendments had been adopted, \nthis legislation would have eliminated current abuses in existing law \nwithout sacrificing investor protections. But, those amendments were \nnot. As a result, the bill that will pass the Senate today and go to \nconference with the House will, I predict, undermine investor \nconfidence in our markets, chill meritorious suits, and leave investors \nexposed to fraud. I also predict that Congress will revisit this issue \nin the foreseeable future. I can only hope that the next Charles \nKeating, whose fraudulent conduct will be facilitated by this bill, \nwill not cost the taxpayers as much as the original.\n  Too often debate on this bill was reduced to accusations of special \ninterest favoritism. It is a shame that the proponents of this bill \nbelieved anyone who opposed this legislation was merely siding with the \ntrial lawyer bar. Likewise, the legitimate concerns of accountants and \nother deep pockets were downplayed by the opponents of this bill. Mr. \nPresident, I oppose S. 240, not because it might hurt trial lawyers and \nnot because I do not believe certain groups are being unfairly targeted \nas deep pockets, but because it is unfair to investors and because I do \nnot think it will serve as a deterrent to fraudulent behavior.\n  The sponsors of this legislation cite compelling anecdotal evidence \nof abuse by the so-called professional plaintiffs and their \nunscrupulous attorneys. I agree there are abusive securities class \nactions suits filed every year. I also agree that we need to protect \ncompanies, and even other shareholders, from these people. But in our \nzeal to tackle this problem, we should take care not to stifle \nlegitimate claims.\n  Amendments were offered that would have tempered the Senate bill's \noverreaction to the purported securities litigation boom. There were \namendments to: provide aiding-and-abetting liability in private implied \nactions; insert a safety net to ensure that small investors are able to \nfully recover their losses; extend the statute of limitations period on \nthese claims, thus making it more difficult for bad actors to hide \ntheir fraud; and an amendment I cosponsored with Senator Sarbanes that \nwould not have insulated fraudulent statements as a result of the \noverly broad safe harbor provision in the bill. All were defeated.\n  In opposing these amendments, the sponsors of the bill cited some of \nthe more egregious practices of professional plaintiffs and certain \nlawyers. What they do not mention is that this behavior would have been \ncurbed by noncontroversial provisions contained in S. 240, provisions \nnot affected by the amendments I mentioned above. These would include: \nprohibitions against referral fees and attorney conflicts of interest; \nrequirements that the share of the settlement awarded to the name \nplaintiffs be calculated in the same \n\n[[Page S9209]]\nmanner as the shares awarded to all other members of the class and that \nthe name plaintiff certify that he did not purchase the security at the \ndirection of his attorney; a prohibition against excessive attorneys' \nfees; and an assurance that all members of the class have access to \ninformation held by counsel of the name plaintiff.\n  I did not want to have to vote against a bill to curb frivolous \nsecurities lawsuits because I believe there are problems. I have met \nwith accountants and executives of high-technology companies and have \nheard about their legal nightmares. But I have also heard from the \ndirector of my State's bureau of securities, the North American \nSecurities Administrators Association, AARP, dozens of consumer groups, \nand some organizations with large pension funds.\n  Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience vote for a bill I believe \nwill insulate fraudulent conduct, prevent investors injured by fraud \nfrom fully recovering damages, and chill meritorious litigation. In our \nrush to reform the problems detailed by the sponsors of this bill, we \nhave overreacted.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 240, \nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, which the Senate approved \ntoday. This proposal has been introduced by Senators Domenici and Dodd \nyear after year without ever reaching the full Senate for \nconsideration. Finally, this year, the Senate debated and approved \nsecurities reform without substantial changes to the Domenici-Dodd \nbill, as reported by the Banking Committee.\n  Our's has become an increasingly litigious society. Opportunistic \nlawyers are prepared to spring into action with the least provocation. \nIn the case of securities fraud suits, this class of attorneys claims \nto have the interests of small investors in mind, but the level of \ncompensation they exact compared with the compensation received by \ntheir clients tells quite a different story.\n  As many as 300 securities fraud suits are filed annually. An \nastonishing 93 percent of these suits are resolved out of court, with \nan average settlement of more than $8 million each.\n  It is no accident that so many of these suits are settled out of \ncourt. That is one of the major problems addressed by S. 240. Under \ncurrent law, every defendant can be found jointly and severally \nliable--or liable for the entire settlement cost--regardless of the \nextent of the defendant's involvement. It has become the practice of \nsome lawyers to name as many deep pocket defendants as possible. \nFrequently, the fear of being held 100 percent responsible and the \nenormous cost of diverting substantial resources to defending against \nthese suits leads these defendants to settle. S. 240 applies \nproportionate liability, enabling the court to determine the extent of \na defendant's involvement and determining liability on the basis of \nthat involvement.\n  S. 240 seeks to reduce abusive practices by prohibiting brokers or \ndealers from receiving a referral fee from attorneys seeking clients \nfor class action suits; giving the court authority to determine whether \na conflict of interest exists if an attorney is also a shareholder; \nand, by prohibiting funds discharged by the SEC from being used for \nattorneys' fees.\n  It seeks to limit frivolous lawsuits by eliminating professional \nplaintiffs, prohibiting attorneys' fees from exceeding a reasonable \npercentage of damages awarded, and giving courts the authority to \nappoint lead plaintiff on the basis of greatest financial loss rather \nthan continuing the practice of naming lead attorneys based on who \nfiled the suit first.\n  I believe that we have approved a bill that will benefit shareholders \nand corporations alike. Shareholders will have more information on \nwhich to base their investments and corporations will be able to \noperate in an environment free of meritless lawsuits. I commend \nSenators Domenici and Dodd  for proposing this worthwhile legislation \nand Chairman D'Amato for moving it so swiftly through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today as the Senate comes to the conclusion \nof the debate over the Securities Litigation Reform Act, I state my \nsupport for this legislation. It has been a long process to achieve \nreform in this area and the Senate has worked for several years to \ncraft legislation which will adequately address the problems in the \nlaws which govern our securities industry without creating others. I \ncommend the efforts of those most directly involved, particularly my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Dodd, for their commitment and hard \nwork in bringing this bill to final passage.\n  The need for some type of reform in this area is universally \nacknowledged, even by those who have most vociferously opposed the \nversion of reform contained in the final bill. Indeed, the bill had 51 \ncosponsors, an indication of overwhelming consensus that congressional \naction is necessary to correct a glaring problem. Simply put, the \nsecurities industry has been plagued by abusive and frivolous lawsuits \nfor years. These lawsuits have been encouraged by a system that far too \noften does more to reward creative lawyers and undeserving plaintiffs \nthan it does to protect the integrity of the securities markets and \nlegitimate investors. The end result has been the unnecessary \nescalation of business costs as companies are forced to pay legal costs \nto defend against these meritless actions. In a growing number of \ncases, these escalated costs, combined with the chilling effect of the \nthreat of groundless litigation, have resulted in bankruptcies, \nreluctance to release pertinent investment information, and in many \ncases, the decision to forego the formation of startup enterprises \naltogether. The latter has particularly been the case for fledgling \nhigh-technology companies, the next generation of American industry. As \nwe strive to compete in the world marketplace, it becomes even more \nimperative that we work to discourage those aspects of our legal system \nwhich foster frivolous, costly, and unnecessary litigation.\n  I do not claim that this bill is perfect in all aspects. Indeed, some \n17 amendments were offered to the legislation as we considered on the \nSenate floor and I supported many of them. I share the concerns \nexpressed that as we rewrite our securities laws to eliminate abusive \nlawsuits, we must also protect the rights of legitimately wronged \ninvestors to have their day in court. Of particular concern are those \nsmall investors, many times senior citizens and those with stakes in \npension funds, who face formidable odds in bringing actions against \nlarge corporations. Accordingly, I voted for stronger protection \nagainst fraudulent and misleading statements by corporate executives as \nwell as for an alternative dispute mechanism which would have \ndiscouraged frivolous actions without the use of the courts. I also \nsupported giving even the smallest investor a voice in choosing who \nwould control suits brought on behalf of a large class of plaintiffs, \nan effort to ensure that everyone would be represented in legal \nactions, no matter how big or small. Unfortunately, these and other \nefforts to improve the bill were not supported by a majority of the \nSenate. However, even though these amendments did not succeed, the \nlegislation as a whole merited support for its work to reform our legal \nsystem in a constructive way to curb unnecessary lawsuits in our \nsecurities industry without removing adequate protection for those \nlegitimately harmed by fraud and wrongdoing.\n  Again, I commend the good work done by all involved with this \nlegislation. There are still significant differences with the House \nthat need to be worked out so I fear that we still have a way to go \nbefore the process of securities law reform is completed. With passage \ntoday, however, the Senate has taken an important step toward achieving \nthat goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, is agreed to, and \nthe clerk will read S. 240 for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread for the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 1058 is stricken, and the text of S. 240, as \namended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The clerk will read H.R. 1058 for the third time.\n  The bill was read for the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, at this stage of the debate I acknowledge that the die \nis cast and this bill will pass. I must say that I believe it is a \nterrible mistake.\n  This has not been about whether you are for curtailing frivolous \nlawsuits or not. There is no disagreement on that. The provisions that \ndeal with containing frivolous lawsuits I think enjoy a vast majority \nof our support, and certainly this Senator.\n  I have asked myself. Why are we doing this? Why are we undergoing all \nof this exercise? For the last 6 decades we have enjoyed the world's \nsafest securities markets. They are the envy of the world. Could it be \nbecause there is a litigation explosion? The facts belie that. In the \npast 20 years, the number of cases filed in class action lawsuits \nremain about between 290 and 315 a year. There are some 235,000 civil \nfilings each year. So that cannot be the reason. There are some 14,000 \ncompanies that have filings with the SEC. Each year only about 140 out \nof those 14,000 are brought in as party defendants in these class \naction cases.\n  Is it because there has been an inability to raise capital in our \nmarkets? In the past 20 years, the amount of capital raised has \nincreased by 58,000 percent. So it certainly cannot be that.\n  Mr. President, this is clearly--as I observed at the beginning--a \nTrojan horse that brings us to the floor of the U.S. Senate to shield a \nlarge number of people from liability for their misconduct. Under \nsecurities action no one who is simply negligent or grossly negligent \nis liable. So it is extremely difficult. What this has all been about, \nin my view, is to emasculate the private individual, the private \ninvestor, from securing relief and recover from investment fraud.\n  I have prepared a little chart here which I think indicates the \nnumber of hurdles that have to be surmounted in order to get to the \nfinish line. It will be more difficult to get these cases brought \nbecause of the limitations imposed. The shorter statute of limitations. \nThe surrender of control of the wealthiest plaintiff which in effect \nbecomes the lead plaintiff presumptively under this. The automatic \ndiscovery stage prevents the plaintiff from ascertaining what the state \nof mind is of the defendants who have perpetrated the fraud. The safe \nharbor provisions, that the distinguished Senator from Maryland has \ntalked about; aiders and abettors--they are home free. They do not have \nany liability at all. The RICO liability has been wiped out.\n  Ultimately, if you are able to perform a feat that even Edwin Moses \nwould have difficulty performing, and you get to the finish line, the \nprospect of recovery is greatly reduced because we have eliminated the \nconcept as between those who are guilty of reckless misconduct or \ntotally innocent. We are simply saying that those who are guilty of \nreckless misconduct only have proportionate liability, and the \nplaintiff, the investor who is damaged, does not recover the full \namount.\n  That overturns hundreds and hundreds of years of legal precedent. For \na social and economic policy that I just cannot comprehend as between \nthe innocent party and the wrongdoer whose conduct is at least \nreckless, we are saying give the reckless actor immunity from the suit. \nIn the case of the aider and abettor and in the other case where he may \nbe a primary violator, we simply say he or she is only liable for the \nproportionate share. That makes no sense.\n  In the 1980's, Congress enacted the infamous Garn-St Germain. Within \na decade, the savings and loan industry in America imploded and the \nAmerican taxpayer was asked to write a bill which constitutes hundreds \nof billions of dollars.\n  I forecast that, as a consequence of the enactment of this kind of \nlegislation, we are going to see innocent investors by the thousands \ndeprived of their day in court. Fifty major newspapers in America who \nhave looked at this issue have concluded that what we are about to do \nis a tragic mistake.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset, I acknowledge that this \nlegislation will pass this Chamber, but I believe that we will rue the \nday and that our markets will be less secure and what the proponents \nmay intend to accomplish will, indeed, have a countereffective result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the debates have been made. I remember \nthe comment by my colleague from Connecticut during the Whitewater \nhearings when he said everything that needs to be said has been said \nbut not everybody has said it. So I will try not to say too much about \nthis.\n  Contrary to those who say, gee, everything has been wonderful up \nuntil now, the facts clearly demonstrate that there has been a serious \nproblem. It has affected that portion of the stock market that most \nneeds the entrepreneurial thrust of venture capital, and this bill will \ncorrect it.\n  I made all of the arguments that I intend to make. I simply want to \nmake one additional observation. This problem has generated action in \nthe House of Representatives. Now it is generating action in the \nSenate. In my view, the Senate bill is more responsible than the House \nbill. I congratulate the authors of the bill, Senator Domenici and \nSenator Dodd, the chairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, in seeing \nto it that the Senate version is more responsible than the House \nversion. I look forward to working with them in a conference committee \nto see that the Senate approach be adopted in every possible \ncircumstance as there are differences between the Senate and the House.\n  These men have worked very hard, very responsibly and intelligently \non this bill, and I for one have been delighted to have had the \nopportunity to work with them. I commend the work product to the entire \nSenate and, if you will, to the President himself when it gets to him \nfor his ultimate signature.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me begin by thanking \nmy colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Bennett, and others who have been present in the Chamber here \nalmost for a week now. We considered 17 amendments and one motion to \ncommit on this bill.\n  Let me also express my appreciation to my colleague from Maryland, my \ncolleague from California, and my colleague from Nevada, all of whom \nhave been actively involved in this legislation, along with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, with a number of amendments that have been offered \nto this bill.\n  We have spent several years on this legislation. We have crossed the \nthreshold of whether or not this was an area of the law that needed \nrepair and significant repair. I would say to my colleagues that we can \nput behind us the days that we have rued, in a sense, the days when you \nended up with somewhere between 93 and 98 percent of these cases all \nbeing settled, never going to litigation because, frankly, the system \nwas designed in a way to produce settlements even when cases lack merit \nbecause of the outrageous costs involved. This was an area of the law \nwhere, frankly, a number of people had turned a profession into a \nbusiness, \n\n[[Page S9211]]\nand we had lost the essence of the practice of law in the area of \nsecurities litigation.\n  This is a piece of legislation that we think goes a long way to \nprotecting investors on all sides. It leaves that door very wide open \nfor legitimate plaintiffs to bring their cases. It also makes it \npossible for those legitimate defendants to make sure that they will \nend up paying the price that they are required to pay, where they do \nsomething wrong. But it also protects the innocent investor of those \nvery same companies from not being charged the cost of frivolous \nlawsuits and meritless litigation.\n  It is a technical area of the law but one that we think is going to \ndo a great deal in terms of making it possible particularly for these \nsmaller start-up companies, the bases of economic growth in the 21st \ncentury, the high-tech firms, the biotech firms, the ones that have the \ngreat volatility in the earliest stages of their development as \nindustries and businesses from being preyed upon by meritless \nlitigation.\n  There is still in the views of many, including this Senator, some \nlegitimate discussion about the area of safe harbor. I feel very \nstrongly that we should have a true safe harbor. My view is that in \nconference we are going to have to revisit the issue. We had a very \nclose vote on an amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland.\n  I would love to be able to tell all of my colleagues that I am \nentirely satisfied everything we have done is absolutely going to work. \nI do not know that. I do know this, that we have corrected a \nsignificant problem and we have plugged up pleadings that were so loose \nthat virtually almost any case that could be brought could lead to \nsignificant discovery, such as the situation where you had Peat Marwick \non a $15,000 contract ending up at $7 million in legal fees. We stop \nthe practice where you have Ratheon Corporation acquiring a firm and \nwithin 90 minutes of that announcement a lawsuit gets filed.\n  Those are the kinds of situations that were occurring, that we will \nhave cleaned up with this legislation that I hope we are about to pass.\n  Is it perfect in every aspect? Anyone who will tell you that cannot \nsay so with absolute certainty. This much we can say, that the previous \nsituation, the situation that exists today, is a mess and it needs and \ndemands to be cleaned up. And in this Senate bill we have moved great \nlengths toward achieving that goal.\n  Let me also underscore the comment made by the Senator from Utah. The \nHouse bill, in my view, goes way too far, way too far, and it is my \nfervent hope that we will not support the House-passed legislation.\n  Let me say here to my colleagues, as someone who has worked a long \ntime along with my colleague from New Mexico on this--and I use this \nopportunity--that efforts to weaken this Senate bill by the House are \ngoing to cause this Senator serious reservations about recommending to \nhis colleagues, if we come back with that, that it ought to be \nsupported.\n  We have a long way to go yet with this legislation before it is done, \nbut this is an opportunity for us to go on record to say the present \nsystem does not work; it needs to be changed.\n  We have made those changes here. For those reasons, I think the \nproduct we have produced is deserving of support. Again, it may not be \nperfect. We do not know that. Time will test that through the legal \nsystem of this country. But we think it does go a great way toward \nsolving the kinds of problems where lawsuits were filed right and left \nwithout the kind of adequate protections for investors and innocent \ndefendants.\n  For those reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 9 minutes and 55 \nseconds; the Senator from New York has 7 minutes and 16 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think perhaps the best analogy that \nwas used was by the Senator from Nevada earlier in this debate when he \nsaid what we have here is a Trojan horse moving forward under the \npennant of frivolous lawsuits, but hidden within the Trojan horse are a \nlot of problems. That is this legislation. This legislation goes too \nfar. I listened to my colleagues, and they get up and they talk about \nhorror stories. And I do not quarrel with those horror stories. I think \nwe need to bring those under control. And those of us on this side have \nconsistently made that point.\n  But this bill goes too far. It overreaches. It is excessive. As one \narticle said in U.S. News & World Report, ``Will Congress Condone \nFraud?'' And then it concludes saying that, ``The pendulum is swinging \nmuch too far,'' and says, ``Unfortunately, some major investor frauds \nmay have to take place before again it moves back toward the center.''\n  I want to avoid those major investor frauds. And that was what the \nwhole effort to try to amend this legislation was about over the last \nfew days.\n  Now, we are ignoring the advice of all of the regulators, Democrats \nand Republicans. The SEC, both under the former Chairman and under the \ncurrent Chairman of the SEC, the 50 State securities regulators, the \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, they have all come in. They \nhave all said, ``Yes, we want to get at the problem of frivolous \nlawsuits. Yes, there are reasonable ways to try to do it.'' Then they \nhave made the point that this bill goes too far.\n  Now, we tried to correct it. We tried to correct the safe harbor \nprovision, which is potentially one of the most dangerous features in \nthis legislation. We urged the Senate to leave that to the SEC. That is \nwhere it ought to be, with the experts. The Senate rejected that.\n  We then said, ``Well, at least let us get a proper standard.'' We \ncame very close on that issue, a vote of 48-50 with respect to getting \na standard that was a more reasonable standard and that would not \nshield, as the Chairman of the SEC told us, not shield willful fraud.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada has pointed out, under the \nproportionate liability provision, innocent investors who are defrauded \nare now going to bear the burden of their loss ahead of people who \nparticipated in the fraud. I want to repeat that. People who \nparticipated in the fraud will be shielded from bearing the full burden \nof the fraud, and that burden will be thrown upon the innocent \ninvestor.\n  We sought to extend the statute of limitations from 1 to 3 years to 2 \nto 5 years. There is a lot of concealment that goes on in these fraud \ncases. And if you talk to people who get caught up in it as victims, \nthey will tell you that often they cannot discover the fraud within a \n3-year period. The SEC, once they know about a fraud, takes 2 years to \nbring the action. This bill requires people to act within 1 year.\n  We tried to restore aiding and abetting. The aiders and abettors are \ndancing down the street right now with this legislation. They will go \nscot-free. It is not a question with aiders and abettors, whether it is \ngoing to be recklessness as a standard, or whether you are going to go \nto a higher standard than recklessness--actual knowledge, actual \nintent. There is no liability for aiders and abettors. None. It is \ngone. This bill will make it harder for defrauded investors to bring \nlegitimate suits and to recover their losses.\n  And I say to my colleagues, because a number have cosponsored this \nlegislation at the outset, the legislation which they cosponsored had \nin it two very important provisions that we tried to add by amendment \nthat are not in the bill before us. The original legislation extended \nthe statute of limitations. The original legislation extended this \nstatute of limitations so it took care of that particular provision. \nNow we have dropped that in this legislation that is before us.\n  And the original legislation sent the safe harbor issue, one of the \nmost difficult and complex issues to deal with, sent it to the SEC \nwhere, I submit to you, it ought to be. That is where that ought to be \nmade. Now they are trying to write the standard right in this bill.\n  So the original bill, which people cosponsored, took care of two of \nthe issues that we have argued on the floor \n\n[[Page S9212]]\nof the Senate over the last few days. Why would we want to make it more \ndifficult for defrauded investors to bring legitimate suits and make it \nmore difficult for them to recover their losses in an effort to get at \nfrivolous suits, which we support? This bill has gone so far, has swung \nthe pendulum so far over that it is going to penalize, in a significant \nway, legitimate investors.\n  Now, this is bad not just for the individual investor, but it is bad \nfor the country, it is bad for economic growth. Our markets, which are \nthe marvel of the world, depend upon the confidence of the investors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The confidence of the investor will be undermined by \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. Mr. \nPresident, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, let me \nstay here on the floor, even though I only have a few moments, it has \nbeen a pleasure working with him on this legislation. I first got \ninterested after I read some articles that led me to think this part of \nthe judicial system of America was not working. That is how I got \ninvolved. I read three or four articles. I could not believe what I was \nreading. I was naive enough to think since it was so patently wrong, \nall I had to do was work on the bill and get someone like Senator Dodd \nto help and it would all come through. I found that was not the case.\n  And the reason it is not the case is because this bill is bad for \nabout 90 lawyers in America. This bill is bad for about 90 lawyers in \nAmerica, not the plaintiff's bar--about 90 lawyers. And let me tell \nyou, Mr. President, they are rich lawyers, because look at this little \nchart. They file these kinds of lawsuits. And out of every dollar in \njudgments, verdicts or settlements--here is the dollar--the high side \nof what the investors get is 14 cents. In many cases it is not 14 cents \nit is half that.\n  Now, let me tell you, if you start with a system that does that and \nis monopolized by a group of barristers who 20 years ago or 25 or 30, \nwhen I was in law school, would have been found guilty of champerty. We \nlearned about two things you should never do, and one of them, my \nfriend from Georgia will remember, is commit champerty, which said you \nshould not promote unnecessary legislation that inures more to your \nbenefit as a lawyer than to your client's. This is the epitome of that. \nThey would not get through the door today.\n  The judges of yesteryear would say, ``Get rid of this kind of \nlawyer.'' So they are out there with gobs of money running \nadvertisements all over the country like they are for the investors. \nThey are 14 cents for the investor. They are 14 cents for the investor \nand 86 cents for themselves, the investigators who work for them, and \nall the other experts that they use.\n  Now, tell me you cannot fix that. If we could not fix it, I would \ngive up on the U.S. Senate and say we are going to leave this up to \nlawyers and their entrepreneurial minds. And we are stopping that.\n  Essentially, under this reform lawyers are going to represent a class \nof people, not a select plaintiff that they choose as pet plaintiffs. \nLawyers are going to be more responsible to the courts. Lawyers are \ngoing to have less fun running around getting facts.\n  And, Mr. President, clearly this bill is balanced.\n  Reform is supported by more than 19 major associations, 10 of the \nbiggest public pension funds, 12 State pension fund administrators and \nregulators, and hundreds of companies--the list reads like who is who \nin making America's economy great.\n  The bill Senator Dodd and I introduced has 51 cosponsors.\n  We heard a lot about Charles Keating. There is not a Senator in this \nbody that would protect Keating. This bill has nothing to do with \nKeating. His name is well known. This bill has a lot to do with slowing \ndown a group of entrepreneurial lawyers whose names are not well known.\n  The current system needs reform. It is a system that has given us \nmillions for lawyers and pennies for plaintiffs.\n  When Congress enacted our securities laws, the 1933 and 1934, the \nbasic foundation was disclosure of information and deterrence.\n  Congress did not by statute create the class action securities law \nsuit under 10b and rule 10b-5. The courts created them. However, in the \nlast decade, every significant Supreme case on the topic has scaled \ndown the scope of the 10b-5 class action cases. It shortened the \nstatute of limitations. It abolished aiding and abetting liability. The \nCourt also seemed to be inviting Congress to legislate in this area. \nToday we are taking that historic step.\n  This bill gives investors a better system 12 ways:\n  First, it puts investors with real financial interests, not lawyers \nin charge of the case.\n  It puts investors with real financial interests, not professional \nplaintiffs with one or two shares of stock in charge of the case. It \nincludes most adequate plaintiff; plaintiff certification; ban on bonus \npayments to pet plaintiffs; settlement term disclosure; attorney \ncompensation reform; sanctions for lawyers filing frivolous cases; \nrestrictions on secret settlements and attorneys' fees.\n  Second, it provides for notification to investors that a lawsuit has \nbeen filed so that all investors can decide if they really want to \nbring a lawsuit. It is likely that people trusted to manage pension \nfunds and mutual funds--institutional investors--will get more involved \n(most adequate plaintiff provision).\n  Third, it puts the lawyers and their clients on the same side \n(reforms that change economics of cases, proportionate liability, \nsettlement terms disclosure).\n  Fourth, it prohibits special side-deals where pet plaintiffs get an \nextra $10,000 or $15,000. It protects all investors, not just the \nlawyers' pet plaintiffs, so that settlements will be fair for all \ninvestors.\n  Fifth, it stops brokers from selling names of investors to lawyers.\n  Sixth, it creates an environment where CEO's can, and will talk about \ntheir predictions about the future without being sued. It gives \ninvestors a system with better disclosure of important information \n(safe harbor).\n  Seventh, it contains better disclosure of how much a shareholder \nmight get under a settlement and how much the lawyers will get so that \nshareholders can challenge excessive lawyers' fees.\n  Eighth, no more secret settlements where attorneys can keep their \nfees a secret (restrictions on settlements under seal).\n  Ninth, it limits amounts that attorneys can take off the top. It \nlimits attorneys' fees to a ``reasonable amount'' instead of confusing \ncalculations (attorney compensation reform, banning lodestar method of \ncalculating fees).\n  Tenth, it provides a uniform rule about what constitutes a legitimate \nlaw suit so that it will no longer matter where a case is filed. \nInvestors in Albuquerque will have the same rules as investors in New \nYork (pleading reform). It stops fishing expeditions where lawyers \ndemand thousands of company documents before the judge can decide if \nthe complaint is so sloppy that it should be dismissed on its face \n(discovery stay).\n  Eleventh, it will make merits matter so that strong cases recover \nmore than weak cases. It will make sure people committing fraud \ncompensate victims. It improves upon the current system so that victims \nwill recover more than six cents on the dollar.\n  Twelfth, by weeding out frivolous cases, it gives the lawyers and \njudges more time to do a good job in protecting investors in \nmeritorious cases. High-technology companies' executives can focus on \nrunning their companies and growing their businesses. Investors will \nget higher stock prices and bigger dividends.\n  S. 240 does exactly what Chairman Levitt said the system should do, \nprotect all investors--not just a few.\n \n[[Page S9213]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have inserted in the Record the numerous \norganizations that have real interests, like money managers who have \nhandled our money, who say this bill is a good bill.

We currently have a dues \n     paid membership of investment clubs and other groups \n     totalling more than 273,000 individual investors. NAIC has \n     been in operation since 1951 and our members are the direct \n     owners of shares in our nation's industry. We are a cross-\n     section of the nation's population including individuals from \n     every race, political persuasion and economic level.\n       Our purpose as an organization, is to help individuals \n     learn the benefits provided by being an owner of a business \n     and to learn how to do so successfully. Since our founding, \n     nearly 4 million people have taken our training programs and \n     a high percentage of our members enjoy an earnings rate on \n     their securities equal to or exceeding that of the S 500 \n     Index.\n       The current situation in the law permits and even \n     encourages the filing of lawsuits with very little merit \n     against corporations. The benefits derived from these suits \n     are going primarily to attorneys.\n       However, these payments are actually coming from the \n     pockets of serious, lifetime owners of the corporations like \n     our members.\n       These unmerited suits take corporate executives away from \n     the main task of running the business and building it for \n     their shareowners.\n       Even more importantly, the fear of these kinds of suits \n     causes executives to release less information about the \n     business to shareholders because of the fear that this could \n     lead to their being sued.\n       Our members devote about 25% of their investments to \n     smaller companies and many of \n\n[[Page S9214]]\n     these companies are high technology companies that have been a \n     particular target of attorneys filling these questionable \n     suits.\n       Again let me say that our members appreciate your interest \n     in solving these problems and thus helping the great mass of \n     the nation's investors by reducing the threat of a large and \n     mischievous expense.\n           Yours respectfully,\n                                                 Thomas E.

In making \n     investment decisions on behalf of these individuals our \n     success depends on both the integrity of the market and the \n     vitality of the American economy.\n       For these reasons, we are writing to applaud your \n     initiative in addressing the fundamental problems of the \n     securities fraud litigation system. We agree that the current \n     system is not protecting investors and needs reform. Under \n     the current system, defrauded investors are receiving too \n     little compensation, while plaintiffs' lawyers take the \n     lion's share of any settlement. Moreover, meritless \n     litigation costs companies millions of dollars--money that \n     could be generating greater profit for the company and higher \n     returns for investors. Finally, the fear of such meritless \n     litigation has caused many companies to minimize the amount \n     of information that they disclose--the opposite of what we \n     need to do our job effectively.\n       Thank you again for pursuing long overdue reforms on the \n     securities litigation system. We look forward to working with \n     you to make the system work for all investors.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mr. John J.

Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: I am writing you as Treasurer of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, in that capacity, as sole \n     Trustee of the state's largest public pension fund for state \n     teachers and employees. I would like to join with those \n     elected officials around the country who are urging your \n     committee to enact legislation to curtail the epidemic of \n     meritless securities legislation which has begun to have a \n     negative impact on the effectiveness and productivity of our \n     nation's businesses and the capital formation process itself.\n       The concern about, and the reaction to, meritless lawsuits \n     has caused industry, as well as accounting, law and insurance \n     companies, to increase their costs and price tags ultimately \n     paid by the consumer and the investing public, including a \n     large percentage of our retirees and pension holders. \n     Therefore, I urge your committee to enact legislation to \n     eliminate these well-known abuses to our legal system. In \n     doing so, I would urge the avoidance of ``lawyer bashing''. \n     Although there is a sizable portion of the bar that generates \n     and unduly profits from these meritless suits, the \n     overwhelming percentage of lawyers represent their profession \n     well and are constructive participants in our judicial \n     system. I also urge caution in establishing a ``losers pay'' \n     system to ensure that we do not preclude the middle class and \n     the poor from bringing meritorious causes of action before \n     our courts.\n       I am confident your committee will find a way to overhaul \n     the current securities litigation system and pass meaningful \n     legislation which will enhance the capital formation process \n     in our country and enure to the economic benefit of millions \n     of individuals and retirees who invest in corporate America \n     for their own security.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Joseph D. Malone,\n     Treasurer and Receiver General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    State of Ohio,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Treasurer,\n\n                                     Columbus, OH, March 10, 1995.\n     Senator Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairperson, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: As Treasurer of the State of Ohio, my \n     office regularly issues debt and purchases securities on \n     behalf of the people of the State of Ohio. In addition, my \n     office is designated by law as the custodian of the assets of \n     the State's pension funds. In the exercise of my \n     responsibilities, I have become concerned that securities \n     litigations, and the threat of securities litigation has \n     begun to negatively impact the capital formation process \n     essential to the economic growth for my state and the nation.\n       Under present law, attorneys have an incentive to file \n     unsubstantiated claims, because there are no penalties for \n     the filing of a meritless claim. Attorneys will file first \n     and then use the discovery process to see if there is any \n     merit to continuing the claim. In many cases, defendants have \n     settled even unsubstantiated claims because it is more cost \n     efficient to settle an unsubstantiated claim rather than to \n     defend a lawsuit.\n       Furthermore, the amount of damages that plaintiffs have \n     typically recovered represents only a percentage of their \n     initial claims; but the lawyers who bring the claim extract \n     substantial fees from any lawsuit filed. A system that was \n     intended to protect investors now primarily benefits their \n     lawyers.\n       The fear of meritless lawsuits has also caused many \n     companies to minimize the amount of information they disclose \n     to the public which is the opposite intent of the federal \n     securities laws. Moreover, the fear of meritless lawsuits has \n     caused accounting, law, and insurance firms to increase their \n     costs to clients, discontinue service in some cases, and \n     cause outside executives to refuse to serve on company's \n     board of directors.\n       Federal legislation is needed to restore the protections \n     that the 10B-5 action is supposed to provide and to eliminate \n     the abuses of the system. At a minimum, legislation should \n     address the liability scheme that rewards lawyers bringing \n     meritless lawsuits and reduce the costs that the system \n     imposes on the capital markets and business expansion.\n       Pension fund participants and other investors depend on the \n     integrity of the market and the prospects of the economy. The \n     current securities litigation system undermines both. I urge \n     the Congress to pass meaningful reform legislation to protect \n     the economic security of millions of individuals who invest \n     in the securities markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             J. Kenneth Blackwell,\n     Treasurer of State of Ohio.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  Treasurer of the\n\n\n                                            State of Illinois,\n\n                                  Springfield, IL, March 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: As the state official \n     responsible for safeguarding the investments of public \n     employees' pension funds, I am concerned about abuses in the \n     securities litigation system that threaten investors' \n     interests and impose unnecessary costs on the economy.\n       Abusive securities lawsuits are frequently filed on the \n     basis of little more than a drop in a company's stock price. \n     Enormous liability exposure and the onerous cost of mounting \n     a defense leave companies with little choice but to settle, \n     regardless of their culpability. Typically, plaintiffs \n     recover only a small percentage of their damages, while \n     lawyers extract substantial fees from the transactions. A \n     system that was intended to protect investors now primarily \n     benefits their lawyers.\n       Because shareholders are on both sides of this litigation, \n     it merely transfers wealth from one group of shareholders to \n     another. However, it wastes millions of dollars in company \n     resources for legal expenses and other transaction costs that \n     otherwise could be invested to yield higher returns for \n     company investors. In addition, the fear of meritless \n     litigation has caused many companies to minimize the amount \n     of information they disclose, precisely the opposite of what \n     investors need to invest safely and wisely.\n       Federal legislation is needed to restore the protections \n     that the 10b-5 action is supposed to provide and to eliminate \n     the abuses that plague the system. At a minimum, legislation \n     should address the liability scheme that rewards lawyers for \n     bringing abusive suits and reduce the cost that the system \n     imposes on the capital markets and business expansion.\n       Pension fund participants and other investors depend on the \n     integrity of the market and the prosperity of the economy. \n     The current securities litigation system undermines both. I \n     urge the Congress to pass meaningful reform legislation to \n     protect the economic security of the millions of individuals \n     who invest in the securities markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Judy Baar Topinka,\n     State Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         State of California, Department of Corporations, Office \n           of the Commissioner,\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, February 9, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 10--The Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n     Hon. Jack Fields,\n     Chairman, Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, \n         Committee on Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Fields: As Commissioner of Corporations, I am \n     responsible for the administration of the securities laws of \n     the State of California. Before being appointed Commissioner \n     of Corporations, I was an attorney in private practice \n     specializing in corporate transactions, including securities \n     offerings. It is an honor and privilege to present to you the \n     following views concerning H.R. 10, the Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act currently before your subcommittee.\n       I believe there is a compelling need to reform the current \n     system of securities litigation. The problem with the current \n     system is two-fold. First, the current system too often \n     promotes the filing of meritless claims. Perhaps more \n     importantly, the current system does not adequately serve the \n     interests it is designed to protect--the interests of \n     defrauded investors. Before I comment on particular \n     provisions of H.R. 10, I would like to provide some \n     background information with respect to this latter problem.\n       Defrauded Investors--Class Action Victims. At the January \n     19 Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee hearing, the \n     principal beneficiaries of the current system, class action \n     attorneys, were its strongest defenders. While it is not \n     surprising that the class action bar might put its interest \n     in the status quo ahead of the nation's interest in a dynamic \n     entrepreneurial economy, I have been concerned that, too \n     often, class action lawyers appear to put their interests \n     ahead of their clients'. The class action bar's handling of a \n     number of cases arising out of the Prudential limited \n     partnership scandal exemplifies this abuse of the current \n     system.\n       In the 1980s, Prudential Securities engaged in a widespread \n     pattern of sales abuses in its marketing of limited \n     partnership investments. To settle charges stemming from \n     these abuses,\n      Prudential pled guilty to criminal securities law violations \n     and entered into a comprehensive settlement with the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission and securities \n     regulators from 49 states. As part of this comprehensive \n     settlement, an independent arbitration process was \n     established to address aggrieved investors' claims. \n     According to the Independent Claims Administrator's \n     January 20, 1995 report, however, more than 100,000 claims \n     or parts of claims have been rejected because they had \n     been settled as part of a class action lawsuit. My office \n     has received letters from scores of investors in this \n     situation. Frequently, these investors didn't even know \n     that their claim was part of a class action settlement. \n     Now many feel they've been victimized twice--once by \n     Prudential and another time by the class action litigation \n     system ostensibly designed to protect their interests.\n       In the VMS Realty Partnership case, limited partnership \n     interests were sold to thousands of unsuitable investors, \n     often on the basis of materially misleading statements. A \n     class action suit based upon these abuses was brought by \n     Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach, the nation's largest \n     class action law firm. Despite the strong evidence of \n     securities law violations, this case was settled for less \n     than 8 cents on the dollar. While this may have represented a \n     significant recovery for the lawyers, it woefully undervalued \n     the investors' claims. Investors who opted out of the class \n     action settlement and are now participating in the \n     independent arbitration process are frequently receiving 100% \n     of their losses. In addition, these investors haven't had to \n     share their recovery with a lawyer ``representing their \n     interest.''\n       The Energy Income Limited Partnership case provides another \n     example of this type of abuse. Again, this case involved a \n     pattern of securities law violations, which Prudential \n     acknowledged when it pled guilty to criminal securities \n     violations. After some discovery, the lead class action \n     lawyers recommended that the court approve a $37 million cash \n     settlement. After a number of state securities regulators \n     strenuously objected, the judge deferred ruling on the \n     proposed settlement.\n       Because of the regulators' action, the total settlement \n     offer was ultimately increased more than three-fold to $120 \n     million. At the point, the class action lawyers affirmatively \n     fought my office's efforts to require that they clearly \n     explain to their clients what the settlement offer meant to \n     them--for good reason. Those investors who did not accept the \n     settlement and are now participating in the independent \n     arbitration process are frequently recovering 100% of their \n     losses. Investors who accepted the recommendation of ``their \n     lawyers'' and participated in the class action settlement, \n     have had to accept roughly 25-30 cents for each dollar of \n     loss.\n       These cases illustrate the flip-side of the abuses in the \n     current system of class action litigation; not only are bad \n     cases overvalued, but strong cases are too often undervalued.\n      While quick settlement of these cases may serve the lawyers' \n     interests, it frequently does not serve the interests of \n     the defrauded investors.\n       Provisions of H.R. 10. H.R. 10 effectively addresses many \n     of the current abuses of the securities class action \n     litigation system. As the following analysis of certain of \n     the provisions of H.R. 10 reflects, however, I would like to \n     respectfully submit several suggested changes for the \n     Subcommittee's consideration.\n\n\n          section 202. prevention of lawyer-driven litigation\n\n       Section 202 puts in place several much-needed safeguards \n     against certain abuses in the current system. It is important \n     that the prosecution of securities claims be directed by the \n     aggrieved investors, not by the lawyers. I would respectfully \n     suggest however, that Section 202(a) be revised to evidence a \n     strong preference for having a steering committee of \n     investors perform this function rather than an appointed \n     guardian ad litem. Those investors who are seeking to recover \n     their losses are, on balance, likely to have a more complete \n     commonality of views with the investor class than a court-\n     appointed third party.\n       Section 202(b) does address a particular problem associated \n     with class action settlements--woefully inadequate disclosure \n     of the settlement terms. The settlement notice that was sent \n     to investors in the Prudential Energy Income Limited \n     Partnership case illustrates this problem. While the notice \n     contained lengthy and complicated descriptions of the \n     procedural history of the case, the paragraph that described \n     the mechanism to determine what investors would receive in \n     the settlement was buried near the back of the notice. In \n     addition, the formula to calculate the settlement awards was \n     nearly incomprehensible to average investors. As I noted \n     earlier, the lead class action lawyers fought my office's \n     efforts to make the description of the settlement terms more \n     understandable to investors.\n       While Section 202(b) does provide some improvement over the \n     current system of disclosure, I would respectfully suggest \n     that it be amended to provide, at a minimum, that the amount \n     that an investor could expect to receive in the settlement, \n     on a per share or per unit basis, be prominently disclosed in \n     the settlement notice. Section 202(b) might also be amended \n     to require that the settlement notice be understandable to an \n     average investor and focus more attention on the substance of \n     the class action settlement, including the information now \n     called for in Section 202(b), and less attention on the \n     procedural history of the case.\n\n\n  section 203. prevention of abusive practices that foment litigation\n\n       One of the most egregious abuses of the current system of \n     class action securities litigation,\n      the professional plaintiff, is effectively addressed by the \n     elimination of bonus payments and limits on those \n     investors who can serve as class representatives. I do \n     have one suggested change, however. While it is important \n     that class action representatives have a meaningful \n     economic stake in the proceeding, I would respectfully \n     suggest that Section 21(k) of the Securities Exchange Act, \n     to be added by Section 203(a), be amended to reduce the \n     amount of required investment from $10,000 to $5,000. \n     While the amount of the minimum investment is admittedly a \n     judgment call, I encourage the Subcommittee to strike the \n     balance more in favor of the interests of small investors.\n       Under the current system, litigants are responsible for \n     their own attorneys' fees. This can present two problems. \n     Defendants in class action cases may feel coerced to settle a \n     frivolous case to avoid the often high costs of litigation. \n     In addition, the amount received by defrauded investors is \n     reduced by the attorneys' fees, and, as a result, investors \n     can never fully recover their losses. H.R. 10 addresses these \n     problems by requiring the loser in a securities litigation \n     case to pay the opposing side's legal fees in all cases.\n       While the solution offered by H.R. 10 should help weed out \n     frivolous claims and afford investors an opportunity to \n     receive full compensation for their losses, a strict loser-\n     pays rule could put a significant and unwarranted barrier to \n     investors, particularly small investors, seeking to recover \n     losses allegedly associated with the defendant's fraudulent \n     conduct. Putting too high a barrier to investors' claims \n     could also undermine the important role that private \n     securities litigation serves as an adjunct to governmental \n     enforcement of the securities laws.\n       To address this concern, I would respectfully recommend \n     that Section 21(m) be amended to require that the plaintiffs \n     be obligated to pay the defendant's legal fees in those cases \n     where (i) the case is dismissed on the pleadings or pursuant \n     to a defendant's motion for summary judgment or (ii) the \n     court otherwise finds at the end of the case that it was \n     substantially without merit.\n\n\n       section 204. Prevention of ``Fishing Expedition'' Lawsuits\n\n       One of the most problematic elements of class action \n     litigation is the prospect that a defendant who played a \n     small role in the alleged securities law violation could be \n     liable for the entire amount of investor losses. This \n     prospect can be among the most coercive elements of \n     securities litigation that compel so-called ``deep pocket'' \n     defendants to accept unfair settlement proposals. H.R. 10 \n     responds to this concern by requiring that plaintiffs show \n     that the defendants were guilty of actual fraud.\n       I am concerned, however, that this solution to the problem \n     associated with the rules of joint\n      and several liability goes too far. Such a knowing fraud \n     standard may encourage participants in the securities \n     offering process to put a premium on remaining ignorant of \n     the facts and undermine their commitment to do appropriate \n     due diligence. To \n\n[[Page S9216]]\n     avoid the unintended consequences associated with an absolute knowing \n     fraud standard, I would respectfully suggest that Section \n     204 be amended to entitle investors to hold defendants who \n     engaged in reckless conduct, not constituting knowing \n     fraud, proportionately liable for their losses. Defendants \n     who engaged in knowing fraud should remain jointly and \n     severally liable for all investor losses.\n       While I respectfully recommend that certain changes be made \n     to H.R. 10, I believe that H.R. 10 represents a significant \n     step forward to correct certain of the problems in the \n     current class action litigation system, and I want to urge \n     the Subcommittee to continue to proceed with this important \n     piece of legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Gary S.

I agree that the current \n     securities fraud litigation system is not protecting \n     investors and needs reform.\n       It is my understanding that the legislation was passed by \n     the House of Representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan \n     vote on March 8, 1995. Your support for these long overdue \n     reforms would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harlan E. Boyles,\n     State Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                Office of the State Treasurer,\n\n                                     Columbia, SC, April 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: As State Treasurer of South \n     Carolina, I am concerned that abusive and meritless \n     securities litigation inflicts tremendous harm on the capital \n     formation process that is vital to the economic growth of \n     South Carolina and the United States. Accordingly, I would \n     like to join with those elected officials nationwide who are \n     urging the Senate to pass meaningful reform legislation that \n     would discourage meritless litigation and thereby enhance the \n     capital formation process.\n       Under present law, attorneys have no disincentive to file \n     unsubstantiated claims, because there are no penalties for \n     filing such claims. Similarly, defendants are often pressured \n     to settle meritless claims by the staggering costs of \n     defending lawsuits in our overburdened courts.\n       Our nation's securities laws were enacted to protect \n     investors and to improve our capital markets. However, the \n     perverse incentive of attorneys to file meritless claims has \n     created the exact opposite of the intended effects of our \n     securities laws. Abusive lawsuits, triggered by a small group \n     of lawyers, inflict tremendous harm on our nation's financial \n     system and on the individuals and organizations drawn into \n     them.\n       Our securities system was structured to provide broad \n     disclosure of information to investors so they could make \n     informed decisions. But there is overwhelming evidence that \n     issuers of corporate securities filings include only limited \n     disclosure, influenced largely by the threat of lawsuits. \n     Additionally, lawyers, not investors, control the litigation \n     system and reap the lion's share of financial rewards.\n       Growth companies are the most critical sector of our \n     nation's economy as they provide the majority of new jobs. \n     Unfortunately, such companies are also the target of an \n     inordinate number of abusive lawsuits. These lawsuits \n     undermine the confidence of investors and produce a higher \n     cost of capital in the United States. This higher cost of \n     capital puts us at a disadvantage with foreign competitors \n     and harms workers, consumers, and investors.\n       Once again, I urge the Senate to pass meaningful reform \n     legislation to enhance our economic future and to protect the \n     investments of the State of South Carolina and those of \n     individual investors.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Richard Eckstrom,\n     State Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Delaware,\n\n\n                                    Office of State Treasurer,\n\n                                        Dover, DE, March 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: As Treasurer of the State of \n     Delaware, I have become concerned that abusive securities \n     litigation is negatively affecting the capital formation \n     process essential to the economic growth of my state and the \n     nation.\n       Problems with the current system have been well-documented \n     in Congressional hearings, academic studies, and by the \n     first-hand experiences of corporate executives and investors. \n     Abusive lawsuits--often triggered merely by a stock price \n     drop--and easy and inexpensive for plaintiffs' lawyers to \n     bring. Once a company is sued, they are forced to settle, \n     even if they are innocent, to avoid the high costs of \n     fighting a meritless lawsuit. Such abusive class action \n     litigation diverts corporate capital away from R, business \n     expansion and job creation. High-technology and other high-\n     growth companies are prime targets to these lawsuits, simply \n     because of the inherent volatility of their stock prices.\n       Investors are also being harmed by the current system as it \n     shortchanges people who have been victimized by real fraud. \n     Studies show that plaintiffs receive 14 cents for every \n     dollar of recoverable damages, at best, and a substantial \n     portion of the settlement fund usually goes to the \n     plaintiffs' attorneys. The plaintiffs' lawyers who specialize \n     in these cases profit from bringing as many cases as possible \n     and quickly settling them, regardless of the merits. Valid \n     claims are being undercompensated in the current system \n     because lawyers have less incentive to vigorously pursue \n     them.\n       Investors lost out in another way. Studies show that \n     abusive 10b-5 lawsuits are chilling voluntary corporate \n     disclosure of information that would be useful to investors. \n     A recent survey by the American Stock Exchange revealed that \n     75% of the corporate CEOs surveyed limit the information \n     disclosed to investors out of fear of meritless lawsuits.\n       Federal legislation is needed to restore the protection \n     that the 10b-5 action is supposed to provide while \n     eliminating the abuses in the current system. Meaningful \n     reform must include remedying the existing liability \n     structure that creates the incentive to bring and settle \n     meritless lawsuits. Legislation should also reduce the costs \n     that the system imposes on the capital markets and on \n     business and economic growth.\n       I urge Congress to pass securities litigation reform \n     legislation to protect the investments of my state and of the \n     millions of individual Americans who invest in the securities \n     markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Janet C. Rzewnicki,\n     State Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, April 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: As the Treasurer of the State of \n     Colorado, my office issues debt and purchases securities on \n     behalf of the people of the State of Colorado. With such \n     responsibility, I am concerned that securities litigation and \n     the threat of securities litigation are beginning to \n     negatively impact our nation's business by hindering the \n     capital formation process essential to the economic growth of \n     Colorado and the nation.\n       Under the present law, attorneys are given an incentive to \n     file unsubstantiated claims because there are no penalties \n     for filing meritless claims. Attorneys will file claims on \n     the basis of little more than a drop in a company's stock \n     prices and then, through discovery, will determine if there \n     is any merit to continuing the claim. Because of the \n     liability exposure and the tremendous cost of defending a \n     claim, companies are often left with no choice but to settle \n     the unsubstantiated suit.\n       Additionally, the plaintiffs typically recover only a small \n     percentage of their claim, as the lawyers extract large fees \n     for bringing the suit. A system that was intended to protect \n     investors now seems to benefit the lawyers.\n       The fear of meritless lawsuits has also caused many \n     companies to minimize the amount of information they disclose \n     to the public which is the exact opposite of the intent of \n     the federal securities laws. This fear has also caused \n     accounting and insurance firms to increase their costs to \n     clients, discontinue service in some cases, and cause outside \n     executives to refuse to serve on a company's board of \n     directors.\n       Federal legislation is needed to restore the protections \n     that the 10B-5 action is supposed to provide and to eliminate \n     the abuse of the system. At a minimum, legislation should \n     address the liability scheme that rewards lawyers for filing \n     meritless suits and reduce the costs that the system imposes \n     on the capital markets and business expansion.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Owens,\n     State Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Association of Private Pension\n\n\n                                            and Welfare Plans,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici and Dodd: On behalf of the \n     membership of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare \n     Plans (APPWP), I am writing to commend your efforts in \n     pursuing reform of the securities litigation system. The \n     APPWP is a national trade association for companies and \n     individuals concerned about federal legislation affecting all \n     aspects of the employee benefits system. The APPWP's members \n     represent the entire spectrum of the private pension and \n     employee benefits community: Fortune 500 companies, banks, \n     insurance companies, \n\n[[Page S9217]]\n     law, accounting, consulting, investment and actuarial firms. APPWP \n     members either sponsor directly or administer employee \n     benefit plans covering more than 100 million Americans.\n       Your initiative is necessary to address the critical \n     problems with today's securities litigation system. As you \n     have correctly noted, investors are ill-served by the present \n     system. Because issuers fear abusive litigation, they have \n     sharply curtailed the amount of information they are willing \n     to disclose, leaving investors without information essential \n     for intelligent decision making. To the detriment of \n     shareholders, abusive securities litigation distracts \n     companies from their principal tasks, discourages the \n     development of new businesses and inhibits sound risk-taking. \n     Finally, the existing litigation system encourages suit \n     regardless of merit and the cost forces defendants to settle \n     regardless of merit.\n       We support your efforts to change these skewed incentives, \n     to encourage voluntary disclosure by issuers of securities \n     and to transfer control of securities litigation from lawyers \n     to investors. We look forward to working with you to make \n     these reforms a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lynn D. Dudley,\n     Director of Retirement Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Legal Times, February 1995]\n\n                     Time To Wake the Sleeping Bear\n\n                            (By Nell Minow)\n\n       In January of this year, the U.S. District Court for the \n     Southern District of New York issued a decision dismissing a \n     group of shareholders class actions against the Philip Morris \n     Cos. The court noted that less than five hours after Philip \n     Morris announced that its 40-cents-per-package price \n     reduction on Marlboro cigarettes could reduce its operating \n     earnings by as much as 40 percent, the first class action was \n     filed.\n       The court further noted:\n       ``[The first action was filed] by a plaintiff who had \n     bought 60 shares of stock during the alleged class period. \n     Four more lawsuits were filed that day, and on the very next \n     business day . . . five additional lawsuits were commenced . \n     . .. I note that in the few hours counsel devoted to getting \n     the initial complaints to the courthouse, overlooked was the \n     fact that two of them contained identical allegations, \n     apparently lodged in counsel's computer memory of `fraud' \n     form complaints, that the defendants here engaged in conduct \n     `to create and prolong the illusion of [Philip Morris'] \n     success in the toy industry.'''\n       In other words, in the race to the courthouse, the \n     plaintiffs' lawyers had not even taken the time to do a \n     ``global search and replace'' on a previous complaint, \n     apparently against some toy company, to reflect the fact that \n     the product Philip Morris was reporting on so \n     ``fraudulently'' was actually cigarettes.\n       This demonstrates one-half of the problem in the current \n     system for shareholders litigation. Most shareholder lawsuits \n     are brought by people who care little, if at all, for \n     shareholders as a group. The plaintiffs and their lawyers \n     make grand statements about the integrity of the markets, but \n     the primary motivation--and the primary outcome--is their own \n     returns.\n       Typically, plaintiffs get a small award, and their lawyers \n     get a large one. These merit less suits are filed whenever \n     the stock performance is worse--or better--than the company \n     predicted, and then settled by insurance companies for too \n     much money (because insurers don't want to risk sending a \n     complicated case to the jury).\n       The other half of the problem is that cases with merit are \n     settled for too little or never brought at all. Because of \n     free-rider and collective-choice issues, along with conflicts \n     of interest, those shareholders with a meaningful stake have \n     not been heard from.\n       The state of shareholder litigation is reminiscent of a \n     line by William Butler Yeats: ``The best lack all conviction \n     and the worst are full of passionate intensity.'' The system \n     falls to protect shareholders from genuine abuses, but still \n     deters managers from disseminating useful and legitimate \n     information. The current proposals for securities litigation \n     reform--a Senate bill, S. 240, that is similar to one \n     introduced last year and a House bill, H.R. 10, that is part \n     of the Contract With America--do a better job with the first \n     half of the problem than with the second.\n       The current rules and procedures for securities class \n     actions and derivative actions were designed to overcome the \n     problem of collective choice. In certain cases, no one \n     shareholder can justify the time and expense necessary to \n     bring a lawsuit for only a pro rata share of the rewards. So \n     the procedures were established to create incentives for \n     participation in suits challenging fraudulent statements.\n       But the system fails to take into account the unusual \n     makeup of the class of potential securities plaintiffs. The \n     shareholder community is too diffuse, too diverse, and \n     subject to change too frequently to be addressed meaningfully \n     as a group.\n       More important, the disincentives for participation are \n     strong. Can we see the trustees of the IBM Corp.'s pension \n     fund joining, as plaintiffs, in a shareholder action against \n     the management of the General Motors Corp., no matter how \n     much is at stake?\n       Having created a system for filing suits that does not \n     eliminate the powerful disincentives for legitimate \n     plaintiffs, we are left with the tiny but highly prosperous \n     community of ``Wilmington filers.'' The ambulance chasers of \n     securities law, these people have made an industry out of \n     nuisance suits. Anthony Bonden described them like this in \n     the December 1989 issue of The American Lawyer (``The \n     Shareholder Suit Charade''):\n       ``Welcome to the plush and intimate confines of the \n     Delaware chancery court, home turf of the Wilmington filers, \n     the shareholder lawyers who sue any deal that moves. They are \n     the bottom scrapers of the M world, the Wall Street Journal \n     clippers with the mysterious professional plaintiffs. Racing \n     to the courthouse on the merest rumor of a deal, they file \n     triplicate copies of one another's suits--complaints that \n     themselves read like duplicates from every other case. They \n     are ``rapacious jackals,'' in the memorable words of Chicago \n     federal judge Charles Kocoras in 1982, ``whose declared \n     concern for the corporate well-being camouflages their \n     unwholesome appetite for corporate dollars.'' And they are \n     the ``pilgrams''--early settlers--litigators who never have \n     to prove their mettle in a trial.''\n       What we want is for shareholders with a meaningful stake to \n     file suit to enforce limits on corporate directors and \n     managers who have neglected or abused their obligation to be \n     candid about the company's status and prospects. We do not \n     want shareholders with microscopic stakes to file dozens, \n     even hundreds, of nuisance suits and to settle on terms that \n     benefit the plaintiffs a little, their lawyers a lot, and \n     their fellow shareholders not at all. We want to encourage \n     corporate communication about the company and its prospects, \n     but we want to discourage communication that is misleading or \n     fraudulent.\n       The proposals before Congress address these goals with the \n     following important and urgently needed reforms: The \n     Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law should not \n     apply to ordinary securities cases. Forward-looking \n     statements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, should have some ``safe harbor'' protection. \n     Plaintiffs should bear the burden of proving that the \n     defendant had ``actual knowledge'' that a statement was false \n     or that a relevant statement was omitted. And a stay of \n     discovery should be provided once a motion to dismiss, based \n     on the safe harbor for forward-looking information, has been \n     filed.\n       These measures will reduce the number of sloppy, race-to-\n     the-courthouse actions, like the ones filed against Philip \n     Morris, and put less pressure on insurers to settle. They \n     will also encourage use of alternate dispute resolution. \n     Indeed, the ADR provisions in the current bills should be \n     strengthened, perhaps even requiring referral to a certified \n     mediator with a background in securities law, who would \n     resolve as many issues as possible.\n       To reduce the conflicts of interest between plaintiffs and \n     their fellow shareholders, the proposals provide for \n     appointment of a guardian ad litem or a plaintiff steering \n     committee. This makes other aspects of the bills--including a \n     minimum requirement for stock ownership and a limit on the \n     number of actions a plaintiff can bring--unnecessary and \n     possibly counterproductive. As long as there is an \n     independent mechanism for ensuring that the interests of all \n     shareholders are met, the identity and the holdings of the \n     name plaintiff are unimportant. Indeed, an individual \n     shareholder may be an excellent representative of the group.\n       Litigation reform efforts in fields where corporations pay \n     big awards always raise the question of the English, or \n     ``loser pays,'' rule. The theory is that ``loser pays'' \n     discourages frivolous suits. But in this context, it is \n     unnecessary.\n       There are already sufficient penalties available for \n     frivolous suits. Furthermore, judges can penalize litigants \n     by refusing to approve attorney fees, as the U.S. District \n     Court in Maine did in a 1992 case, Weinberger, et al. v. \n     Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., et al.\n       Lawyers had filed suit on behalf of the shareholders of \n     Great Northern Nekoosa, a takeover target of the Georgia-\n     Pacific Corp. Since the ultimate deal was better for \n     shareholders than the proposal on the table at the time that \n     the suit was filed, the attorneys argued that they had made \n     an important contribution for which they deserved to be paid. \n     Georgia-Pacific agreed to pay them $2 million, subject to \n     what was expected to be routine approval by the court.\n       Instead, the court refused to allow any payment at all, \n     issuing a decision with detailed objections to almost every \n     item and calculation put forward to support the $2 million in \n     fees. The judge ruled that even had the law firms justified \n     their involvement, they had overbilled by 80 percent: \n     ``Exaggeration, rather than restraint, has been the watchword \n     of the plaintiff's counsel's entire exercise. . . . [Even a \n     Michelangelo should not charge Sistine Chapel rates for \n     painting a farmer's barn.''\n       Since the plaintiffs bar normally takes these shareholders \n     cases on a contingency basis, a decision like the one in the \n     Georgia-Pacific case is a powerful deterrent to frivolous and \n     unnecessary suits.\n       But just as we have to address the problem of too many bad \n     suits, we need to address the problem of too few good ones. \n     Institutional investors, including pension funds and money \n     managers, often ignore notices of shareholders suits. It is \n     almost unheard of for them to file one. The ``loser pay'' \n     rule will only make this problem worse.\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\n       On the contrary, to encourage large shareholders to take on \n     the task--and the commercial risk--of filing suit against \n     major corporations, we may need to compensate them for the \n     time and resources they expend. A steering committee, as in \n     bankruptcy cases, could review such awards.\n       The Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over ERISA \n     and Taft-Hartley pension funds, has already raised the \n     consciousness of the pension-fund community about its \n     obligations with regard to proxy voting. The department could \n     do the same with regard to shareholder litigation. Along with \n     the other agencies that have jurisdiction over institutional \n     investors--the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, and the \n     banking agencies--the Labor Department should establish a \n     standard for evaluating a potential suit as one would any \n     other asset.\n       To produce real reform--by encouraging suits brought to \n     hold management's feet to the fire and discouraging suits \n     brought to line the pockets of plaintiffs and their lawyers--\n     institutional investors must be persuaded to share the burden \n     of bringing shareholder litigation. When the system does not \n     provide adequate incentive for them to protect their own \n     interests and those of their fellow shareholders, it is \n     institutional investors and their beneficiaries whom the \n     system has failed the most.\n   Testimony of Maryellen Andersen, Investor and Corporate Relations \n  Director, Connecticut Retirement & Trust Funds and Treasurer of the \n     Council of Institutional Investors, Before the Senate Banking \n                 Securities Subcommittee, July 21, 1993\n\n       Good morning. My Washington advisor ordered me not to start \n     by telling you who I am and who I represent. She says you \n     already know, or you wouldn't have invited me. She also says \n     it is silly to read a string of titles and numbers, and it \n     puts everyone to sleep.\n       So I won't read you a string of titles. But I think it is \n     critical to emphasize that if there is any constituency here \n     today that has every reason to get the securities litigation \n     system right, and no reason to want to skew the system to \n     favor anyone, it is the constituency I represent.\n       This is the constituency. I am here representing the public \n     employees and retirees of the state of Connecticut. As some \n     of you know, the state pension system invests over $9.54 \n     billion dollars on behalf of over 140,000 employees and \n     beneficiaries. I am also the Treasurer of the Council of \n     Institutional Investors, whose members invest over $600 \n     billion on behalf of many more millions of union, public, and \n     other corporate employees and beneficiaries.\n       Why do we care about this legislation? We care because we \n     are the largest shareholders in America. We are ones who are \n     hurt if a system allows someone to force us to spend huge \n     sums of money in legal costs by merely paying ten dollars and \n     filing a meritless cookie cutter complaint against a company \n     or its accountants when that plaintiff is disappointed in his \n     or her investment. Our pensions and our jobs depend on our \n     employment by and investment in our companies. If we saddle \n     our companies with big and unproductive costs that other \n     companies in other countries do not\n      pay, we cannot be surprised if our jobs and raises begin to \n     disappear and our pensions come up short as the population \n     ages.\n       But we are also the shareholders who want to preserve our \n     ability to sue when it is appropriate. We are the \n     shareholders who are benefitted if the SEC or private parties \n     bring appropriate law suits that police our markets and care \n     for millions of individual investors who might not otherwise \n     be able to protect themselves.\n       Let me emphasize this point. As the largest shareholders in \n     most companies, we are the ones who have the most to gain \n     from meritorious securities litigation. The awards directly \n     and positively affect our returns. So, besides the general \n     value that meritorious lawsuits have for keeping our markets \n     clean, they have direct immediate financial value to us. We \n     certainly, therefore would be foolish to advocate any change \n     that would discourage the proper enforcement of our \n     securities laws.\n       However, we are also both the employees and taxpayers who \n     depend on corporate employers and a corporate tax base, and \n     we are the millions of individual consumers of corporate \n     goods and services. In both of these roles we are the ones \n     who pay the cost of all corporate litigation, meritorious and \n     otherwise. We pay by not getting raises, we pay by higher \n     prices, we pay through lower shareholder returns. You must \n     remember, in other words, that whenever you see a deserving \n     plaintiff awarded, we are the ones paying the price. We are \n     also the ones paying the settlements when the lawsuits are \n     frivolous. And we are the ones paying the huge lawyers' fees. \n     Since the Council of Institutional Investors' average retiree \n     makes only $552 a month, we feel we are pretty needy and \n     deserving too.\n       In short, we are the ones who are hurt if the system \n     doesn't work right or efficiently, and we are the ones who \n     stand to benefit most if it does.\n       And, with all due respect to the other parties present, I \n     believe we are the ones with both the interest and the \n     expertise necessary to address these issues and come up with \n     solutions that are genuinely in the public interest.\n       What, then, do we think? I think most of us feel that \n     despite all the strong language and political blood letting \n     that this legislation has produced; there is reason to \n     believe the system isn't yet working right.\n       There is still major disagreement about whether there are a \n     huge number or a small number of frivolous securities strike \n     suits filed. There is disagreement about whether the recent \n     growth in the number of these suits is temporary or \n     permanent. But whether the number is large or small, and \n     whether the problem is temporarily worse than usual or not, \n     the problem is one to be addressed: it is in our collective \n     interest to look for ways to reduce or eliminate any \n     frivolous or inefficient efforts to use our legal system and \n     our private markets like a shareholder lottery.\n       There are also still major disagreements about the size and \n     utility of the legal, administrative, settlement, and lost \n     opportunity costs generated by the present system. But we all \n     know that because of the tremendous number of these cases the \n     costs are very significant. It is in our collective interest \n     to look for ways to reduce these costs and insure that every \n     dollar spent is spent as efficiently as possible and is as \n     likely as possible to go to innocent victims, affected \n     shareholders, and public administrative costs, not on \n     individuals whose wealth depends on generating lawsuits more-\n     or-less regardless of merit.\n       So I am here to offer to work with those who have every \n     interest in getting this matter right--with labor, with the \n     business community, with other investors, and with you and \n     the SEC--to offer up our best effort at identifying and \n     addressing securities litigation reform to protect our jobs \n     and our pensions.\n       I am not here to endorse this specific piece of legislation \n     or to pretend to be an expert on the intricacies of this bill \n     or this issue more generally. I am not an accountant or a \n     securities lawyer--my Washington advisor says this makes me \n     ``a civilian.'' But one needn't be an expert to realize the \n     importance of this issue and to conclude that this issue must \n     be addressed to ensure that the system protects us as \n     investors, employees, retirees, and citizens.\n       I close by repeating my offer to have the Council work with \n     you, the SEC, labor, and business to try to reach \n     constructive solutions to this and other litigation-related \n     problems.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from New York for yielding. And I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nSenator from California, who has been such a powerful advocate \nthroughout this debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member so much. Since \npeople are thanking people for working with them on this, I just have \nto say what an honor it has been to take this issue to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate with two of my role models, frankly, Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Bryan. I have been so honored to be part of this team because \nwhen we started, we were really laughed at in some ways saying, ``Well \nyou'll never get any votes for anything.'' By God, we actually won a \ncouple of amendments.\n  We came close to fixing the safe harbor provision. I think we have \nshown with tenacity that we can make our points, and I am going to try \nto do that in the last couple of minutes.\n  Why do we need securities laws in the first place? Clearly, it is to \nprotect the average investor. There are so many tears being shed here \nfor corporate directors, and, by the way, most of them are wonderful, \nhonorable, decent people in the community and they help the engine of \neconomic growth, but I have not seen any tears shed on the other side \nfor the victims of securities fraud.\n  I hear bashing of lawyers, that is in. Sure, bash, bash, that is the \npolitics of the nineties. Every time we put up an amendment, bash the \nlawyers, beat the amendment.\n  But what we are about is saying get rid of the frivolous lawsuits, \nbut do not give fast-moving insiders and others a chance to make a \nquick buck at the expense of the small investor.\n  I am going to tell you what some of the press have said about this \nbill relating to S. 240. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch: ``Don't protect \nsecurities fraud.'' That is what they think this bill does.\n  Contra Costa Times: ``Why would any Member of Congress vote to \nprotect those involved in fraud at the expense of investors?'' \n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  Seattle Post-Intelligencer: ``The legislation is opposed by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the Government Finance Officers, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, and the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association.''\n  ``S. 240 is bad news for investors. It would tie victims in legal \nknots while immunizing white-collar crooks against having to pay for \ntheir misdeeds.'' The Raleigh, NC, News and Observer.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer: ``A crook is a crook, and S. 240 would \nrelax penalties for many stock crooks.''\n  And then we have Jane Bryant Quinn of Newsweek: ``S. 240 makes it \neasier for corporations and stockbrokers to mislead investors.''\n  The Seattle Times: ``This legislation has proceeded almost unnoticed \nbecause it is hideously complicated.''\n  It is so complicated it is bad for the average investor. I hope we \nwill register a ``no'' vote on this final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have heard a lot said about this bill. \nI want to first commend Senators Domenici and Dodd for their \nstewardship. Senator Domenici outlined how he detected a system that \nwas more interested in making huge profits for lawyers and not give a \nwhit about the so-called victims. In many cases, there were no victims \nuntil the small investors, people who had invested in companies that \nthese lawsuits were manufactured against, became the victims.\n  Let me tell you about the people who brought these suits. About 30 \npercent of these suits were brought by one law firm--by one law firm. \nThey went out and they hired their plaintiffs. Sixty-five plaintiffs \nappeared in two cases, 12 plaintiffs appeared in three cases, 3 \nplaintiffs appeared in four cases. They appeared to get their bonuses, \n$10,000, $15,000, $20,000--and by allowing their names to be used these \nplaintiffs allow the lawyers to race to the courthouse.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does. It ends the use of professional \nplaintiffs. I have not heard anybody say anything about that. It forces \nlawyers to work for real clients. We say the pension funds, the little \nguys who have invested in them, they should select who the lawyers are.\n  This bill will empower courts to weed out frivolous cases. It gives \ndefendants the leverage to fight cases when they did nothing wrong. Now \nthey cannot fight, they have to surrender, otherwise they are hit for \nmillions of dollars in costs or damages, so even if you win you lose.\n  S. 240 will require accountants to report fraud to authorities. \nNobody says anything about that. It gives the SEC the ability to go \nafter bad guys, a power which they do not have today.\n  It will get more information to investors by making it so that people \ncan make projections without being sued. It is a good bill, and it is \nlong overdue. We would rectify a terrible situation that exists at the \npresent time by passing this bill.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of S. 240. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill having been \nread the third time, the question is, Shall the bill, H.R. 1058, as \namended, pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BOND (when his name was called). Present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nto amend the title.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 240 be \nplaced back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few seconds \nto thank a very dedicated staff. Laura Unger, for the dedicated job she \nhas done in a very complex bill--really, without her work, not only \nduring the process on the floor but in committee, we would not have had \nthis legislation. And our staff director, Howard Menell.\n  Let me also say it was a pleasure working with the ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, handling a complex piece of legislation like this \nwith a divergence of opinions. I think we demonstrated the process can \nwork when people are willing to work at it in good will.\n  Notwithstanding differences of opinion, I could not ask, I think, for \nfairer debate, et cetera, as we tried to keep this moving. So I thank \nmy colleagues. And certainly Senator Domenici and Senator Dodd did an \nexcellent job on this bill, bringing it to the point we could bring it \nto the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to reciprocate to the \nchairman of the committee with respect to his sentiments. I point out, \nI think this legislation was considered in a way that I would hope all \nlegislation can be considered. We had opening statements. Then we moved \nfrom opening statements to taking up amendments. We considered the \namendments seriatim, we had good debate on the amendments, voted on the \namendments, then we had closing statements, and then we went to final \npassage of the bill.\n  So I hope Members will agree, I know a number of Members I talked to \nfelt we had a good consideration of it. People had a chance to express \ntheir points of view. We resolved them and moved forward.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for his effort to construct a \nfair framework in which to address this legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I want to acknowledge in particular the \nstaff work of Mitchell Feuer, Andy Vermilye, and Brian McTigue, all of \nwhom worked indefatigably on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill. I think \nthey did demonstrate we can have an orderly debate and not waste any \ntime. I do not remember there being very many quorum calls. It took a \nwhile, but it is a very important piece of legislation, and I want to \ncomment both the managers and also my good friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator D'Amato. I think this is probably his first major \nbill as chairman. I think he has done an outstanding job and I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Everybody has had a chance to debate. Nobody was shut off. There were \nnot any cloture motions filed. There was not any time wasted. In fact, \nI was home last night watching on C-SPAN when you were all up here--\nwatching you on C-SPAN, watching you debating until 9, 9:30, 10 \no'clock. I commend the managers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield for a question? Does it \nlook better to watch it on C-SPAN than to watch it in person?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is better because you are further away. It was very \ninteresting. The Senator from Pennsylvania was speaking and the Senator \nfrom Utah was answering. It was fairly quiet up here. It was fairly \nquiet at home, too, at 10 o'clock at night.\n  In any event, I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation, too, \nand members of the staff on each side and others who participated in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe majority leader and his compliments for both managers of the bill \njust passed.\n  This is not an easy piece of legislation, both because of its \ncomplexity as well as its controversy. But I must say that our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have certainly acted in a very \nresponsible manner. We have had a good debate. As the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland has said on a number of occasions, it is a debate \nthat I think bears even closer watch and closer consideration as we go \nthrough the final stages of passage of this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I particularly want to single out the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, the ranking member, for his extraordinary work in leading our \ncaucus in this effort and in sharing, as he has, his very valuable \ninsights on a number of the ramifications of the bill and the \namendments pending. He did an outstanding job and I deeply appreciate \nhis leadership in this regard.\n  Let me also commend my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for his advocacy of the legislation. \nWhile we differed on many of the issues pertaining to the bill, he, \ntoo, ought to be commended for the way with which he conducted this \ndebate.\n  This has been a good debate. I appreciate very much the cooperation \nof the Republican leadership in ensuring that all Senators have the \nopportunity to present their amendments and to be heard as completely \nas they were heard, now, over the last several days.\n  I hope, now, as we turn to the budget conference report, that \ncolleagues will use the time available to us, beginning at noon, to \npresent their views. We will have 10 hours of debate. It is very \nimportant that we utilize this time as efficiently and as appropriately \nas we can. So I encourage colleagues on this side of the aisle to come \nto the floor beginning at noon to make their remarks and to utilize the \nopportunities that we will have over the course of the next several \nhours to express ourselves on this budget resolution.\n  So, again Mr. President, I commend our managers on the bill just \npassed, and hope we can have a good debate on the budget conference \nreport beginning at noon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9199-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--BUDGET CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, many years ago I sponsored an amendment \ndealing with our aid to Pakistan, and it has been a thorn in the side \nof our relationship with Pakistan. It ultimately involved the delivery \nof several F-16's. I had recently proposed a solution to that problem, \na resolution of that problem, to the President of the United States.\n  As my colleagues know, I have held a special interest in South Asia \nfor a number of years. I have the highest admiration for the character \nof the South Asian people as they strive to better their conditions.\n  The singular tragedy of South Asia has been war--the reality of \nconflicts past and the fear of future bloodshed. Pakistan and India \nhave fought three wars since independence in 1947. Tension still \nremains high.\n  What was once a conventional military standoff has now become more \nominous. Both sides can assemble nuclear weapons. Both sides are \nstriving to obtain modern delivery systems, such as ballistic missiles \nand aircraft. Just last week, the New York Times and Defense News \nreported that in the past 3 months, Pakistan has received from \nCommunist China key components that could be used in M-11 ballistic \nmissiles. Without question, a nuclear war between India and Pakistan \nwould be cataclysmic. The names of the perpetrators, and their \naccessories, would be cursed for a millennium.\n  To its credit, Mr. President, the U.S. Senate consistently has taken \nthe initiative to promote peace and stability in South Asia--the core \nof that leadership has been the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A \ndecade ago, the committee--under the chairmanship of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar]--decided to use the leverage of \nour aid to Pakistan to try to keep it from going nuclear. Just as \nimportant, the committee also decided that should Pakistan choose a \nnuclear option, we would not condone its action through United States \naid.\n  Mr. President, those were the key reasons why the U.S. Congress \nadopted the so-called Pressler amendment 10 years ago. It was the right \nthing to do. President Ronald Reagan agreed. So did the Government of \nPakistan at that time. I believe the Pressler amendment is needed now \nmore than ever. To the extent that the current administration and this \nCongress chooses to back away from that standard, the prospects for \nregional instability and war are increased accordingly. Unfortunately, \nsome have called for a myriad of modifications to the Pressler \namendment, ranging from one-time waivers to outright repeal.\n  Mr. President, I have a more in-depth analysis of the Pressler \namendment, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In summary, any unilateral attempt to weaken or modify \nthe Pressler amendment for whatever reason--whether it be for economic \nassistance, or drug or terrorism control--would not be in the best \ninterest of our more critical nuclear non-proliferation goals. I urge \nmy colleagues to study this extended analysis before the Senate \nconsiders the foreign aid authorization bill later this year.\n  Today, however, I would like to discuss the initiative I offered to \nthe committee 1 month ago--a new, constructive initiative that will \nmake a significant contribution toward achieving a number of our \nforeign policy goals.\n  As my colleagues well know, in 1990, President Bush could no longer \ncertify, under the terms of the Pressler amendment, that Pakistan did \nnot possess a nuclear explosive device. As a result, 28 F-16 aircraft \nordered by Pakistan could not be delivered. Today, those planes remain \nundelivered. Of these 28, 11 were sold on a foreign military sales \nbasis--paid for up-front by the American taxpayer. The remaining 17 \nwere paid for by Pakistan for about $650 million.\n  Let me be clear: I will oppose any attempt to waive the Pressler \namendment to allow for Pakistan to take delivery of these aircraft. My \nrationale is simple: F-16's are capable of carrying a nuclear payload. \nIt would be contrary to the spirit and letter of our Nation's nuclear \nnon-proliferation policy for this Congress to allow Pakistan to take \npossession of nuclear delivery vehicles under any condition short of \ncurrent law.\n  Doing so would have grave implications. Delivery of the F-16's could \nspark an unprecedented, destabilizing arms buildup in South Asia. This \nis not in the best interests of the people of the region. I would hope \nthat no Member of Congress would want his or her fingerprints on any \nproposal that would spark such an unfortunate turn of events.\n  I recognize this leaves the United States in a quandary--a quandary \nthat I hope we can eliminate. To do so, Mr. President, please allow me \nto turn our attention to the South China Sea, where the Communist \nChinese military machine is on the march.\n  Taiwan continues to be threatened with an increasing level of \nintimidating military exercises by Communist China. In addition, the \nPhilippine Government is the victim of Chinese aggression in the \nSpratley Islands. The Philippines and the other surrounding countries \nin the region are concerned that this increased activity by the Chinese \nmilitary is a prelude to an outright attempt to gain control over the \nSouth China Sea.\n  Three points about the Philippines are worth mentioning:\n  First, the Philippines is the democratic country in Asia with the \nweakest military. Its government needs modern planes and naval craft. \nSecond, the Philippines has a security treaty with the United States. \nThe Philippine people are our allies.\n  Third, the U.S. Senate--through the leadership of former Foreign \nRelations Committee Chairman Lugar and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry--was instrumental in bringing democracy back \nto the Philippines in 1986. We must not turn our back on them now.\n  My initiative is very simple. First, we arrange for the immediate \ndelivery to the Philippines, on a FMS basis, of 11 F-16's of the 28 \nheld up by the Pressler amendment--the ones already paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  At the same time, I recommended last month that we open negotiations \nwith Taiwan on the immediate delivery of the remaining 17 aircraft. \nTaiwan already is purchasing 150 of the same model F-16 but the \ndelivery date is not until June 1997.\n  At the time of my announcement, I sent letters to President Clinton, \nPhilippine President Ramos and President Lee of the Republic of China, \ndetailing my initiative. Last week, President Clinton responded to my \nproposal, stating that he was open to a third-party sale if it met \ncertain areas of concern. First, the President said that a third-party \ntransfer must serve our national interest. I agree. In fact, my \ninitiative produces a number of winners:\n  For Pakistan, the F-16 issue goes away as an irritant in its \nrelations with the United States. For India, 28 nuclear delivery \nvehicles do not show up on her border, and that is something I feel \nvery concerned about. I think if these F-16's went to Pakistan, it \nwould accelerate the arms race there. I feel strongly we should be \nfriends with both India and Pakistan. Both countries have done a great \ndeal with us and for us.\n  I see in the long range a trading partnership with both countries, \nand friendship. But also this will help us with Taiwan.\n  Taiwan can, for a price, close its 2-year window of vulnerability to \nmodern Russian aircraft in the hands of Chinese pilots. Finally, the \nPhilippines can get the air defense it needs.\n  By this initiative, a number of American foreign policy goals would \nbe furthered: lower tensions in South Asia, maintenance of a strong \nnuclear nonproliferation policy, and an enhanced deterrent capability \nof two democratic, nonnuclear powers in Asia. At home, American \naerospace would have new markets, and the American taxpayer would \nreceive a measurable enhancement of our global security for almost no \ncost.\n  Second, the President stated that we would need to consider the \nreturn to Pakistan of the military equipment \n\n[[Page S9228]]\nother than the F-16's for which it has paid. Frankly, I believe we must \nstudy this option carefully. I would oppose the return of any military \nequipment to Pakistan that would serve to undermine our nuclear non-\nproliferation goals, and add to the current instability in the region. \nWe should not limit the third-party sale option just to the F-16's \nexclusively.\n  Third, the President noted that a third party sale may not be \nsatisfactory to Pakistan if it does not receive most, if not all, of \nthe funds they originally paid to the United States Government for the \naircraft. As I stated last month, if the Congress opts to use any of \nthe funds raised from my initiative to compensate Pakistan for the \npreviously paid F-16's, I would not object. However, I would hope that \nfull compensation is not made a condition by the President for pursuing \na third party sale. As it stands right now, I believe it would be \ndifficult to convince Congress to either authorize the delivery of the \nF-16's to Pakistan, or appropriate the full amount paid by Pakistan. My \ninitiative provides the Government of Pakistan the first real \nopportunity to gain some compensation in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my letter to President \nClinton dated May 23, 1995, and his response dated June 22, be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased the President remains open \nto a possible third party sale. Frankly, I believe that is his only \noption. Let me state for the record that the Republic of China is open \nto my proposal. I also received a very positive initial response from \nrepresentatives of the Philippine Government.\n  This initiative is simple but bold. I hope my colleagues will join \nwith me in urging the administration to make this initiative their own. \nI stand ready to do my part to reach a solution that serves our \nnational interest--first and foremost being the preservation of a \ntough, sound nuclear nonproliferation policy.\n  Mr. President, last month, I had the opportunity to testify before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and present this idea. I am glad that \nthe President has responded favorably. But much remains to be done to \nwork out this agreement.\n  This has been a difficult matter to approach because in regard to the \namendment that was passed in the 1980's, one could say that Pakistan \npurchased these planes with their eyes open, so to speak. They knew, on \nthe one hand, of the existence of our law that said we would not \ncontinue aid if they developed a nuclear bomb. And, very frankly, they \nwere not being candid in what they told the then Vice President and \nPresident George Bush about their nuclear program.\n  So if you take it from that point of view strictly, when the \nPakistanis got into this thing, they had full knowledge of what they \nwere doing back home in terms of developing a nuclear bomb. They knew \nour law said what it said, and they moved forward with this purchase \nwhich would have been in violation.\n  So we could say, ``Well, let us just let them be, that they made a \nbad deal, and they paid the price.'' On the other hand, there has been \na great distinction in Pakistan. The military people have not always \ntold the civilian government what is going on, very frankly. And the \ncivilian government has engaged in some perhaps unwise decisions based \non bad information. That is really Pakistan's problem, I suppose.\n  But, as the years have gone by, I see an opportunity to get these F-\n16's to Taiwan, which needs them to counterbalance China, and to the \nPhilippines, which is a longtime ally of ours.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  In Defense of the Pressler Amendment\n\n\n                  What the Pressler Amendment Requires\n\n       The Pressler Amendment requires Pakistan to satisfy two \n     conditions before it is eligible to receive U.S. foreign \n     assistance, including US military equipment or technology. \n     Aid may be provided in any fiscal year only if the President \n     has certified in that year that Pakistan (a) ``does not \n     possess'' a nuclear explosive device and (b) that the \n     proposed assistance ``will reduce significantly'' the risk of \n     possession.\n\n\n              Common Criticisms of the Pressler Amendment\n\n       Critics of the Pressler Amendment have alleged that this \n     legislation: (1) is unfair and discriminatory; (2) is not \n     effective; (3) is counterproductive; (4) penalizes Pakistan \n     when it has not even assembled, deployed, or tested weapons; \n     (5) is inflexible; (6) inhibits US encouragement of a free \n     market in Pakistan; (7) hurts US economic competitiveness; \n     (8) sets back US human rights initiatives; (9) interferes \n     with US counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics efforts; and \n     (10) fosters anti-Americanism in Pakistan.\n       Not one of these criticisms holds up to responsible \n     analysis. The criticisms reveal more about the critics \n     themselves than about any real shortcomings in the \n     legislation. In particular, these criticisms reflect: (1) a \n     profound misunderstanding of the purposes of the Pressler \n     Amendment, (2) a flagrant case of historical amnesia; (3) a \n     cynical fatalism about the inevitability of proliferation; \n     (4) an ignorance of the regional, global, and US national \n     security consequences of a Pakistani bomb; (5) the \n     susceptibility of the legislative process to special interest \n     lobbying; (6) the triumpth of slogans over analysis as a \n     basis of policy; (7) an utterly bizarre conception of what \n     constitutes a ``friend'' of the United States; (8) a \n     distorted perspective on US national priorities; (9) a \n     preference for the management rather than the prevention of \n     proliferation; and (10) a compulsive desire to channel even \n     more taxpayer dollars into unproductive pursuits.\n\n\n                    Rebuttals to Specific Criticisms\n\n                    1. ``Unfair and Discriminatory''\n\n       Between 1981 and 1990, Pakistan gave the US government both \n     formal and informal assurances about the peaceful nature of \n     its nuclear program, the level of enrichment of its uranium, \n     foreign nuclear procurements, cooperation with China, and \n     other such issues relating to nonproliferation issues--in \n     each case, Pakistan broke its word.\n       It is not unfair for America to defend its interests by \n     punishing those who violate their commitments to us.\n       On eight occasions, Congress authorized special waivers of \n     US nonproliferation laws to permit aid to continue to flow to \n     Pakistan. To this day, Pakistan is the only country ever to \n     have received (or required) a waiver of the Glenn/Symington \n     sanctions in order to qualify for US aid. It is true that \n     America engaged in discrimination, but this was \n     discrimination on behalf of Pakistan and against all other \n     countries that played by the rules.\n       How can Pakistan simultaneously condemn the country-\n     specific discrimination in the Pressler Amendment without \n     also condemning the country-specific discrimination that \n     authorized such aid?\n       Pakistan is not the only country to be mentioned by name in \n     the context of nonproliferation sanctions--for years, Iraq, \n     Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Cuba have been designated for \n     special controls and sanctions.\n       US relations with India also have been affected by a \n     variety of US nonproliferation laws. Because of India's \n     unsafeguarded nuclear program, there is no US/Indian \n     agreement for nuclear cooperation; US military cooperation \n     with India is negligible; and the US will not export certain \n     forms of missile equipment and technology to India and other \n     goods related to weapons of mass destruction. Though \n     sanctions under Glenn/Symington have not been invoked against \n     India, it is because India, unlike Pakistan, has not violated \n     that law.\n\n                          2. ``Not effective''\n\n       US policy throughout the 1980s asserted that US aid was an \n     effective way to lure Pakistan away from the bomb--yet \n     Pakistan made its most significant nuclear achievements \n     precisely when US aid was flowing at its highest levels.\n       The Pressler Amendment sanctions accomplished what $5 \n     billion in US economic and military aid failed to \n     accomplish--it led Pakistan to stop producing highly-enriched \n     uranium.\n       The Pressler Amendment succeeded in enabling the \n     continuation of US efforts to drive the Soviets out of \n     Afghanistan while not sacrificing a bottom-line US nuclear \n     nonproliferation objective: nonpossession. If it were not for \n     this compromise, aid could have been terminated in 1985.\n       The Pressler Amendment was then and remains now a statement \n     of the priority that America attaches to nonproliferation as \n     a goal of policy.\n       The Pressler Amendment has unquestionably made Pakistan--\n     especially its air force, army, and navy--pay for its \n     misguided decisions to pursue the bomb. Indeed, if Pakistan \n     once again qualifies for US aid, it will no doubt be \n     Pakistan's military that will stand to benefit the most from \n     the new aid. This gives Pakistan a tangible incentive to \n     satisfy the certification terms under Pressler.\n\n                        3. ``Counterproductive''\n\n       Though the sanctions have undoubtedly weakened Pakistan's \n     military capabilities, there is no evidence that the \n     sanctions have ``driven'' Pakistan to rely more upon nuclear \n     deterrence as a national defense strategy.\n       Pakistan's decisions to stop producing highly-enriched \n     uranium, not to test, and not to assemble or deploy nuclear \n     weapons hardly suggests a policy of increased reliance on a \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n       The US denial of technology and aid has slowed down \n     Pakistan's bomb-making potential, a long-standing goal of US \n     nonproliferation policy.\n       Though Pakistan still has a nuclear weapons-capability and \n     is still cooperating with China on the bomb, these activities \n     were not ``caused by'' the Pressler Amendment. Pakistan was \n     seeking this capability and engaging in this cooperation with \n     China well before the Pressler Amendment came into existence.\n       For a truly counterproductive policy, one must look to the \n     1980s, when US taxpayers shelled out $5 billion in aid that \n     was supposed to appease Pakistan's nuclear ambitions . . . \n     aid that coincided Pakistan's acquisition of the bomb. Today, \n     critics of the Pressler Amendment are arguing that more US \n     taxpayer money should be channeled down that drain.\n\n               4. ``No assembly, deployment, or testing''\n\n       Pakistan's decisions not to assemble, deploy, or test have \n     very little to do with the flow of US aid.\n       The US nuclear arsenal in the 1950s was stored in separate \n     components: was the US a non-nuclear-weapon state as a \n     result?\n       Even the State Department concedes that a country can still \n     possess the bomb even if it has not yet actually assembled \n     one.\n       Pakistan's position is that it does not ``possess'' the \n     bomb because it has not assembled the requisite materials. By \n     this logic, Pakistan could acquire a nuclear arsenal with \n     hundreds of weapons simply by not tightening down the last \n     screw on the casing of each bomb.\n       Pakistan's new emphasis on the issue of assembling is just \n     another chapter of Pakistan's long history of dissembling \n     about its bomb.\n       It is widely believed that Pakistan got a pre-tested bomb \n     design from China. Why would Pakistan want to or need to test \n     a pre-tested design?\n       Pakistan has very limited supplies of bomb-usable nuclear \n     material. Why should it waste such precious material on an \n     unnecessary test?\n       Why should Pakistan engage in a test that would only give \n     India an excuse to commence a regional nuclear arms race that \n     Pakistan could never win?\n       If Pakistan's nuclear program is, as its government claims, \n     devoted entirely to peaceful purposes, how can it claim that \n     it has ``kept components separate'' and not ``assembled'' the \n     bomb? What would it have to assemble if its program were \n     peaceful? If its program is so peaceful, why does it refuse \n     to agree to international inspections independent of what \n     India does?\n\n                           5. ``Inflexible''\n       Supporters of the Pressler Amendment make no apologies to \n     the charge that the law has been ``inflexible,'' assuming a \n     normal dictionary definition of this term: ``of an unyielding \n     temper, purpose, will, etc.'' The alternative of passive \n     accommodation has little attraction to supporters of \n     nonproliferation.\n       Even with the so-called ``inflexible'' label, the following \n     activities take place: (a) the US still issues licenses to \n     export commercial munitions and spare parts to Pakistan, \n     including spares for Pakistan's nuclear-weapons delivery \n     vehicle, the F-16; (b) US military visits and joint training \n     exercises continue to take place; (c) US aid with respect to \n     agriculture, counter-terrorism, nutrition, population \n     control, literacy, advancement of women, health and medicine, \n     environmental protection, disaster relief, and many other \n     areas can continue to flow to Pakistan via nongovernmental \n     organizations; (d) the Export-Import Bank also has extended \n     loans, grants, and guarantees to Pakistan; (e) PL-480 \n     agricultural aid continues; (f) arms control verification \n     assistance continues (a seismic station); (g) millions of \n     dollars of aid in the ``pipeline'' as of October 1990 was \n     allowed to flow to Pakistan; (h) cooperation on peace keeping \n     is continuing; and (i) Pakistan continues to receive billions \n     of dollars in development assistance via multilateral lending \n     agencies.\n       Pakistan used almost $200 million in FMS credits to fund \n     the purchase of 11 F-16's between FY 1989 and 1993, of which \n     about $150 million were used after the Pressler sanctions \n     were invoked.\n       The US continues to review and approve licenses of dual-use \n     technology to Pakistan.\n       All the above hardly suggest that the Pressler Amendment \n     has been unduly inflexible.\n\n                           6. ``Free Market''\n\n       Pakistan has a long way to go before it has a free market \n     and the Pressler Amendment is hardly to blame.\n       A recent Heritage Foundation worldwide review characterized \n     Pakistan's economy as ``Mostly Not Free.'' The report found \n     that Pakistan has a ``very high level of protectionism.''\n       The only market that is truly free in Pakistan is its black \n     market.\n       Free markets are an important US interest, but not an end \n     in themselves--they need to be weighed against other US \n     interests, especially national security, defense, and \n     nonproliferation objectives. Encouraging a free market in \n     weapons of mass destruction should not be high on America's \n     list of priorities.\n\n                7. ``Hurts US Economic Competitiveness''\n\n       The US has exported hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     defense goods to Pakistan since the Pressler Amendment came \n     into effect.\n       In 1994, the Commerce Department approved $96 million in \n     exports of dual-use goods to Pakistan, about triple the \n     amount approved in each of the three previous years.\n       Total US exports to Pakistan still come to less than $1 \n     billion. Even if all of this trade was lost, it would have no \n     effect whatsoever upon the US national trade balance or US \n     economic competitiveness. By comparison,\n      US exports worldwide in 1994 were worth well over a half \n     trillion dollars.\n\n               8. ``Sets Back Human Rights Initiatives''\n\n       Congress has expressly authorized the transfer of \n     assistance to Pakistan via nongovernmental groups to advance \n     the cause of human rights (as indeed several other non-\n     military causes).\n       Despite some modest improvements since the days of General \n     Zia, the Pakistani government continues to repress the human \n     rights of Pakistani citizens, as most recently documented \n     both by the State Department's annual human rights report and \n     a recent global survey by Amnesty International.\n       The US experience in Iran should have taught us to beware \n     of cultivating cozy relationships with a repressive \n     government.\n\n 9. ``Interferes with Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Narcotics Efforts''\n\n       Congress has expressly authorized the transfer of \n     assistance to Pakistan via nongovernmental groups to \n     terrorism and narcotics trafficking.\n       Widespread terrorism and narcotics trafficking persists in \n     Pakistan.\n       Pakistan's recent cooperation with the US in apprehending \n     terrorists indicates that the Pressler Amendment is no \n     insuperable obstacle to such cooperation.\n\n                    10. ``Fosters Anti-Americanism''\n\n       Anti-Americanism was not born in Pakistan with the \n     enactment of the Pressler Amendment--it predated the \n     amendment and has causes far beyond a nuclear dispute between \n     the US and Pakistan.\n       America opposes the global spread of nuclear weapons: it \n     should come as no surprise to witness leaders of governments \n     that are secretly building bombs encouraging anti-\n     Americanism.\n       America seeks to defend its national interests, not to win \n     popularity contests. As President Clinton stated on October \n     18, 1994: ``There is nothing more important to our security \n     and to the world's stability than preventing the spread of \n     nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n     U.S. Aid Policies and Pakistan's Bomb: What Were We Trying to \n                              Accomplish?\n\n       Letters to Congress from Presidents Reagan and Bush, 1985 \n     to 1989, required under sec. 620E(e) of Foreign Assistance \n     Act (Pressler Amendment):\n       ``The proposed United States assistance program for \n     Pakistan remains extremely important in reducing the risk \n     that Pakistan will develop and ultimately possess such a \n     device. I am convinced that our security relationship and \n     assistance program are the most effective means available for \n     us to dissuade Pakistan from acquiring nuclear explosive \n     devices. Our assistance program is designed to help Pakistan \n     address its substantial and legitimate security needs, \n     thereby both reducing incentives and creating disincentives \n     for Pakistani acquisition of nuclear explosives.''--President \n     George Bush, 10/5/89; President Ronald Reagan, 11/18/88; 12/\n     17/87; 10/27/86; and 11/25/85.\n       President George Bush, letter to Congress (addressed to J. \n     Danforth Quayle as President of the Senate), 12 April 1991, \n     urging abandonment of Pressler certification requirement:\n       ``. . .my intention is to send the strongest possible \n     message to Pakistan and other potential proliferators that \n     nonproliferation is among the highest priorities of my \n     Administration's foreign policy, irrespective of whether such \n     a policy is required by law.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989:\n       ``None of the F-16's Pakistan already owns or is about to \n     purchase is configured for nuclear delivery . . . a Pakistan \n     with a credible conventional deterrent will be less motivated \n     to purchase a nuclear weapons capability.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989:\n       ``Finally, we believe that past and continued American \n     support for Pakistan's conventional defense reduces the \n     likelihood that Pakistan will feel compelled to cross the \n     nuclear threshold.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Peck, testimony \n     before House subcommittee, 17 February 1988:\n       ``We believe that the improvements in Pakistan's \n     conventional military forces made possible by U.S. assistance \n     and the U.S. security commitment our aid program symbolizes \n     have had a significant influence on Pakistan's decision to \n     forego the acquisition of nuclear weapons.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 22 October 1987:\n       ``We have made it clear that Pakistan must show restraint \n     in its nuclear program if it expects us to continue providing \n     security assistance.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, testimony \n     before Senate subcommittee, 18 March 1987:\n       ``Our assistance relationship is designed to advance both \n     our non-proliferation and our \n\n[[Page S9230]]\n     strategic objectives relating to Afghanistan. Development of a close \n     and reliable security partnership with Pakistan gives \n     Pakistan an alternative to nuclear weapons to meet its \n     legitimate security needs and strengthens our influence on \n     Pakistan's nuclear decision making. Shifting to a policy of \n     threats and public ultimata would in our view decrease, not \n     increase our ability to continue to make a contribution to \n     preventing a nuclear arms race in South Asia. Undermining the \n     credibility of the security relationship with the U.S. would \n     itself create incentives for Pakistan to ignore our concerns \n     and push forward in the direction of nuclear weapons \n     acquisition.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Howard Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 6 February 1984:\n       ``The assistance program also contributes to U.S. nuclear \n     non-proliferation goals. We believe strongly that a program \n     of support which enhances Pakistan's sense of security helps \n     remove the principal underlying incentive for the acquisition \n     of a nuclear weapons capability. The Government of Pakistan \n     understands our deep concern over this issue. We have made \n     clear that the relationship between our two countries, and \n     the program of military and economic assistance on which it \n     rests, are ultimately inconsistent with Pakistan's \n     development of a nuclear explosives device. President Zia has \n     stated publicly that Pakistan will not manufacture a nuclear \n     explosives device.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 1 November 1983:\n       ``By helping friendly nations to address legitimate \n     security concerns, we seek to reduce incentives for the \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons. The provision of security \n     assistance and the sale of military equipment can be major \n     components of efforts along these lines. Development of \n     security ties to the U.S. can strengthen a country's \n     confidence in its ability to defend itself without nuclear \n     weapons. At the same time, the existence of such a \n     relationship enhances our credibility when we seek to \n     persuade that country to forego [sic] nuclear arms . . . We \n     believe that strengthening Pakistan's conventional military \n     capability serves a number of important U.S. interests, \n     including non-proliferation. At the same time, we have made \n     clear to the government of Pakistan that efforts to acquire \n     nuclear explosives would jeopardize our security assistance \n     program.''\n       Statement by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Harry \n     Marshall, 12 September 1983, before International Nuclear Law \n     Association, San Francisco:\n       ``U.S. assistance has permitted Pakistan to strengthen its \n     conventional defensive capability. This serves to bolster its \n     stability and thus reduce its motivation for acquiring \n     nuclear explosives.''\n       President Ronald Reagan, report to Congress pursuant to \n     sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1982--\n       ``Steps were taken to strengthen the U.S. security \n     relationship with Pakistan with the objective of addressing \n     that country's security needs and thereby reducing any \n     motivation for acquiring nuclear explosives.''\n       President Ronald Reagan, report to Congress pursuant to \n     sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1981--\n       ``Military assistance by the United States and the \n     establishment of a new security relationship with Pakistan \n     should help to counteract its possible motivations toward \n     acquiring nuclear weapons. . . . Moreover, help from the \n     United States in strengthening Pakistan's conventional \n     military capabilities would offer the best available means \n     for counteracting possible motivations toward acquiring \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State James Malone, address before \n     Atomic Industrial Forum, San Francisco, 1 December 1981.\n       ``We believe that this assistance--which is in the \n     strategic interest of the United States--will make a \n     significant contribution to the well-being and security of \n     Pakistan and that it will be recognized as such by that \n     government. We also believe that, for this reason, it offers \n     the best prospect of deterring the Pakistanis from proceeding \n     with the testing or acquisition of nuclear explosives.\n       Undersecretary of State James Buckley, testimony before \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 November 1981:\n       ``We believe that a program of support which provides \n     Pakistan with a continuing relationship with a significant \n     security partner and enhances its sense of security may help \n     remove the principal underlying incentive for the acquisition \n     of a nuclear weapons capability. With such a relationship in \n     place we are hopeful that over time we will be able to \n     persuade Pakistan that the pursuit of a weapons capability is \n     neither necessary to its security nor in its broader interest \n     as an important member of the world community.''\n       Testimony of Undersecretary of State, James Buckley, in \n     response to question from Sen.

Two of those goals are the maintenance \n     of peace and stability in South Asia and the deterrence of \n     aggression in East Asia. Such an opportunity is at hand.\n       The inability of the President since October 1, 1990, to \n     make the necessary certification under section 620E(e) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to the nuclear \n     activities of Pakistan) has prevented the delivery of twenty-\n     eight F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. Since F-16s in American \n     service are nuclear delivery vehicles, the possibility that \n     these aircraft might yet be delivered to Pakistan has raised \n     enormous concern in neighboring India. At the same time, our \n     inability to transfer the aircraft is an irritant in our \n     relations with Pakistan. For now, the aircraft in question \n     are in storage in Arizona.\n       In East Asia, both the Republic of China on Taiwan and the \n     Philippines have been the victims of aggression from the \n     People's Republic of China. In the case of the former, it's \n     military exercises designed to intimidate; in the latter it's \n     the actual take over of Philippine territory in the South \n     China Sea.\n       To serve as a deterrent for aggression across the Taiwan \n     Straits, Taiwan has ordered 150 American F-16 aircraft. \n     However, these aircraft will not begin to arrive in Taiwan \n     until June of 1997 suggesting that there may be a ``window of \n     opportunity'' for conflict. With regard to the Philippines, a \n     combination of historical factors and the need to devote \n     defense resources to opposing internal subversion has led to \n     a severe lack of external defense capability.\n       Considering the twenty-eight F-16 aircraft in storage, it \n     appears that eleven of them were to be delivered to Pakistan \n     under the United States Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. \n     Essentially, they were paid for already by the American \n     taxpayer. The remaining seventeen aircraft were paid for by \n     Pakistan.\n       Therefore, I recommend that the Administration open \n     negotiations with the Governments of the Philippines and the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan for the transfer of the aircraft. \n     Eleven of the aircraft could be transferred to the \n     Philippines on an FMS basis and the remaining seventeen could \n     be the subject of negotiations for payment with Taiwan. If a \n     decision is made to return to Pakistan some or all of the \n     money collected, I would not object.\n       If this initiative were carried out, it would directly \n     further American foreign policy goals in South and East Asia, \n     respectively. In South Asia tensions would be reduced as \n     twenty-eight potential nuclear delivery vehicles would be \n     removed from the region. In East Asia the military strength \n     of our friends and allies would be enhanced significantly and \n     a clear signal would be sent regarding our determination to \n     oppose aggression.\n       This initiative is simple but it requires a bold \n     imagination for execution. I hope that you will join with me \n     in putting it into effect and making a significant \n     contribution to our national security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for writing to me about the \n     opportunity before us to resolve the F-16 issue with \n     Pakistan. I appreciate your initiative and hope some new \n     thinking will help create a consensus between the \n     Administration and Congress for a satisfactory solution.\n       As you know, when I met with Prime Minister Bhutto in \n     April, I told her I would explore with Congress the options \n     for returning either the F-16s and equipment or the funds \n     Pakistan had paid. The proposal to sell the planes and return \n     the funds is one possibility if we can resolve some areas of \n     concern. First, we must determine that the transfer of this \n     equipment to third parties would be in our national interest. \n     Second, we would need to be prepared to return to Pakistan \n     the equipment other than F-16s for which it has paid. We \n     would need to work with Congress on the necessary authorities \n     to do so. Third, such a proposal may make this solution less \n     than satisfactory for the Government of Pakistan if it \n     results in the return to Pakistan of significantly less money \n     then they originally paid for the aircraft.\n       Again, let me say that a solution accepted by Congress and \n     by Pakistan will clear the way for a more serious discussion \n     of the critical nonproliferation issues that concern us all. \n     It will also help to improve the atmosphere in our bilateral \n     relations and thus advance other U.S. interests in the \n     region.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9227-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9231-S9232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       MILITARY BUILDUP IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on a totally separate subject, I have \nbeen concerned about the military buildup by China. I cannot understand \nwho China views as its enemy. I cannot understand why China is not only \nbuilding up its nuclear arsenal, but also proliferating ballistic \nmissile technology to countries like Iran and Pakistan. China should be \nconcerned about the \n\n[[Page S9232]]\npotential for a nuclear arms race by Islamic nations in South Asia and \nthe Middle East. Indeed, if that does occur, if Iran does join the \nnuclear club, Israel will certainly react.\n  So the point I am making is I think the President can use my \ninitiative not just to solve one of our foreign policy problems as it \nrelates to Pakistan. He can use it to show our continued friendship \nwith Taiwan. Taiwan is a democracy and a growing economic power in the \nPacific. Taiwan usually is on our side 100 percent, even though we do \nnot treat its leaders that way when they come here. Our relationship \nwith Taiwan is one of the ironies of history.\n  My initiative sends a signal to the Chinese that we are going to be \ntough in that region and we will look after our allies, and that \nincludes the Philippines, which would also get eleven of the F-16's \nunder my initiative.\n  As I said earlier, my initiative is a bold step, but it is a partial \nsolution. It is a step forward. I am glad that President Clinton has \napparently begun to embrace this concept, to explore with these \ncountries to see if we can get the F-16's out to Taiwan and the \nPhilippines. Again, it is an initiative that can get some money back to \nPakistan, although I would not necessarily guarantee full compensation \nbecause frankly, Pakistan had their eyes open when they went into this \ndeal. Further, the Government of Pakistan was not being candid with the \nPresident of the United States at that time about what was going on in \ntheir nuclear program.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak on the subject of \nMedicare.\n  There has been much unjustified criticism of the Republican budget \nplan by the Democrats. As my colleagues know, we will be voting in this \nChamber possibly tomorrow night on the budget of the United States for \nthe next 7 years, the basic outline. And for the first time in nearly \nthree decades, we are moving toward a balanced budget by the year 2002. \nI am proud of this great achievement.\n  This is the toughest budget since I have been a Member of Congress. \nIt is tough, it is sound and it is right. If we can pass it in the \nHouse and in the Senate, it will be the first time in a long time that \nwe have gone in the other direction--the right direction. Finally we \nwill start to pay our bills as they become due.\n  Up to this point, we have been going in the wrong direction--of \nrunaway spending and the build up of a huge Federal debt.\n  Included in the budget plan are reductions in the rate of growth in \nMedicare. I want all senior citizens to understand this budget. I am a \nchampion of senior citizens. My mother is a senior citizen living in \nSioux Falls. In fact, I will be one someday in the not too far future. \nSo I am concerned about this subject. My goal is to save Medicare for \nour seniors. This budget saves Medicare. This budget will provide \nsenior citizens with stability.\n  The present rate of increase of Medicare is about 10 percent a year. \nIt is growing too fast, and if left alone, it will go bankrupt by the \nyear 2002. This budget slows the rate of increase to about 7.2 percent. \nThus, Medicare is still going to grow, but it is not going to grow \nquite as fast. We are slowing the growth to save the program from \noverheating and breaking down altogether.\n  How do we get the savings? It comes from streamlining some of the \nnational administration. It comes from certain cost control reforms, \nand so forth.\n  Americans should not be misled about what we are doing here. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans agree that Medicare is going to go bankrupt \nunless somebody steps forward with a plan to save it. So I would say to \nmy liberal friends, what is your plan? The Republicans have a solvent \nplan. The Domenici-Dole plan in the Senate will save Medicare. We have \nto save Medicare.\n  Let me say a word or two about some of the other areas. This budget \ntakes an across-the-board approach. I know every group that has a stake \nin the Federal budget will feel it. But I would say to farmers, \nranchers, small businessmen, students, and others, that lower interest \nrates are one of your main concerns. Students, for example, pay back \ntheir loans at the going rate of interest after they have graduated \nfrom college. To the students of America, I say that one of the \ngreatest threats to your economic security is, the massive Federal \ndebt. That debt keeps interest rates high, forcing students to pay \ntheir college loans back at high interest rates. We are going to have \nhigh interest rates if we do not do something about the size of our \ndeficit.\n  A third area of concern here is inflation and the soundness of our \nmonetary system internationally. If we continue to build up the huge \nFederal debt, we also will be building up the specter of high \ninflation, high interest rates, and a currency that is not respected in \nthe world, a currency that is weak, and a currency that will eventually \nbe overtaken by the German mark or the Japanese yen.\n  So, Mr. President, as we engage in this debate on the budget for the \nnext 2 days and as we vote on it here in the Senate tomorrow evening, \nlet us remember that we are trying to save Medicare. We are trying to \nsave our economy for our children--an economy with lower interest \nrates, a solvent dollar, and low taxes.\n  We are going to have many eloquent speeches in this Chamber about how \nthe Federal Government is taking away money from here and taking away \nmoney from there. But if the Federal Government does not have any money \nto give, it ultimately has to take that money back either through \ninflation, high interest rates, and higher taxes, which will lead to \nall types of economic suffering.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, my concern here is to explain why I \nwill be voting for the Dole-Domenici approach. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it. We will have to fight off false charges that we are \nagainst senior citizens or that we are against farmers or we are \nagainst workers. That is not true. We are for them. This is an historic \nbudget plan for all Americans. Everyone agrees the alternative is \nbankruptcy, the loss of the Medicare Program, and economic chaos. We \nare going to save our budget. We are going to save Medicare. We are \ngoing to save our economy. We are going to save our children's future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in voting for the Dole-Domenici \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to argue again for lifting the \nillegal and what I believe to be immoral arms embargo against the \nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Actually, Mr. President, we \nshould not even be in a position today of having to lift an embargo. In \nApril 1992, when the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized \ninternationally and granted admission to the United Nations, it \nautomatically became covered by article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which \ngrants every State the elemental right of self-defense.\n  Inexplicably, however, the Bush administration was asleep at the \nswitch \n\n[[Page S9233]]\nand failed to act to abrogate the illegal embargo.\n  For 3 years, Mr. President, I have repeatedly advocated lifting this \nunfair and illegal embargo. I would prefer that the timing of the lift \nbe responsive to the wishes of the Bosnian Government which, after all, \nis the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party is literally fighting for \nits life.\n  Not only am I frustrated and angry at the current situation, I am \nalso disturbed that our country, which has been the beacon of hope to \nfreedom-loving people around the world, should even be contemplating \nrefusing to give the Bosnians the tools with which to defend \nthemselves.\n  How much more, Mr. President, do the Bosnians have to suffer? They \nhave been invaded across an international border by troops equipped and \nassisted by the fourth largest army in Europe. Against the Bosnian \nSerbs with sophisticated, modern weapons including planes, tanks, \nrocket launchers, and heavy artillery, the Bosnian Government forces \nhave fought with small arms and dogged determination. Although recently \nthey have been able to capture a few heavy weapons, and reportedly have \nbeen covertly supplied with modest defense weaponry, the Bosnian \nGovernment forces are still vastly underarmed compared to the Serbian \naggressors.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat the phrase that I just used: Serbian \naggressors. There is no moral equivalence in this conflict. The \nGovernment of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the \nsuccessor states of the former Yugoslavia, gave absolutely no \nprovocation to the Bosnian Serbs, who have torn this small country \napart.\n  On the contrary, in 1991 and early 1992, while Serbs and Croats were \nfighting in neighboring Croatia, the Bosnian Government strove to \nretain the multireligious and multiethnic fabric of its own State. But \nunscrupulous demagogic politicians like Milosevic in Serbia and \nKaradzic in Bosnia, in order to implement their vicious racist \nideology, exploited fears and successfully widened existing religious \nand socioeconomic divisions. From this incitement came the centrally \nplanned murder, rape, and vile ethnic cleansing that have so revolted \nthe civilized world.\n  Mr. President, let us not tolerate criminals cynically wrapping \nthemselves in religious garb. The Bosnian Serbs' behavior has \nabsolutely nothing to do with Orthodox Christianity. French President \nJacques Chirac forcefully made this point at a dinner of European Union \nleaders when he reportedly rebuked the President of Greece, an \napologist for the Bosnian Serbs. He said, ``Don't speak to me about any \nreligious war,'' Chirac said. ``These are people without any faith, \nwithout any sense of law. They are terrorists.''\n  Yet somehow Western European statesmen have criticized the Bosnian \nGovernment forces and chastised them for trying to break the blockades \nof Sarajevo and Bihac. Imagine the impertinence, Mr. President. \nSarajevo has been blockaded for 38 months, more than 3 years. Its long-\nsuffering population has been shelled and sniped at, and denied water, \nfood, medicine, electricity, and gas. Mr. President, they literally \nstring blankets and sheets across the narrow streets of the old parts \nof Sarajevo. When I was first there, I thought it was an unusual way of \ndrying their laundry. I asked, ``why are they hanging sheets and \nblankets there?'' I was told that they are hanging there for only one \nreason--to thwart the Bosnian Serbs from sniping at Moslem, Croatian, \nand Bosnian Serb children. That is why they are there. No one denies \nthis. Sniping at children is the Bosnian Serbs' calculated plan, which \nthey carry out nearly every day.\n  Senator Dole and I went to visit a hospital in Sarajevo. The only \npeople there were children from ages 6 to 20 who were the victims of \nsniper fire--not random fire, not what they are doing with random \nshelling--sniper fire. So there is, in fact, a campaign of terror going \non. And so here you have Sarajevo and Bihac, Sarajevo blockaded for 38 \nmonths, shelled and sniped at, the target of terrorist activities.\n  And so now, when outgunned Bosnian Government forces try to break the \nsiege, which contravenes the U.N. resolution, not to mention basic \nhuman rights, what is the reaction of the most advanced industrialized \ndemocracies?\n  Well, Mr. President, in mid-June, we got a taste of their reaction at \nthe G-7 summit in Halifax. The world's wealthiest nations, the United \nStates included, called upon all parties, even those who have been \nunder siege for 38 months, to display the greatest restraint. Is that \nnot nice? This callous declaration surely set a new standard for \narrogance, for blaming the victim.\n  I would ask the well-fed gentlemen of the G-7 if they could look into \nthe face of an undernourished, weakened Sarajevo mother who gets shot \nat, literally shot at, while running to fetch a plastic jug of water \nfor her children, and tell her that her government's army should \ndisplay the greatest restraint.\n  Mr. Akashi, a great world citizen, a top U.N. diplomat in the \nBalkans, in deliberate violation of his own organization's declaration, \nannounced on June 9 that UNPROFOR, the U.N. protective forces, \nhenceforth would act only if the Bosnian Serbs agreed. Keep in mind \nthat the Bosnian Serbs have Sarajevo, Bihac, and other cities under \nsiege.\n  Mothers literally cannot go to get water because all the water has \nbeen cut off. The gas and electricity has been cut off. So they go to a \npublic fountain, a spring, and are shot at, murdered cold-bloodedly--in \ncold blood. And Akashi says on June 9, that by the way, we, the U.N. \nforces, will take no action on any matter unless we first check with \nthe snipers, the Bosnian Serbs.\n  Now, is that not wonderful? Is that not wonderful? But if the Bosnian \nSerbs do not agree, then the United Nations will not act. What is the \nBosnian Government, having been criticized for trying to break the \nsiege, supposed to do? They are under siege--no water, no food, no \nelectricity, in a campaign to kill their children. And their government \nis told not to act unless the United Nations first talks to the Bosnian \nSerbs.\n  Well, Mr. President, the criticism of the Bosnian army for attacking \nto break the siege would be laughable if it were not so utterly \ngrotesque. Nonetheless, some West European governments have criticized \nthe United States for our advocacy of the victimized Bosnian Moslems.\n  Perhaps the following piece of counterfactual analysis might be \nhelpful to our friends in London and Paris.\n  What if, Mr. President, a Moslem-dominated Bosnia and Herzegovina had \nattacked a peaceful, Orthodox Christian Serbia, carried out barbaric \natrocities against Orthodox Serbian civilians, and then proudly \nannounced that its policy of so-called ethnic cleansing had been \nsuccessful--would Christian Europe then be sitting idly by, conjuring \nup excuse after excuse for not halting the cruel and cowardly \naggression? I think the answer is self-evident.\n  Bigotry, sad to say, spreads more easily than tolerance. So we must \nnot allow ourselves to fall into the trap of labeling all Serbs--in \nBosnia, Serbia, or elsewhere--as racists. Nearly 200,000 Serbs, \nsometimes referred to as the forgotten Serbs, continue to live in the \nterritory under the control of the Bosnian Government.\n  When I first visited Bosnia several years ago, I met with the Council \nof Leadership of the Bosnian Government, four of whom were Serbs. The \narmy was 28-percent Serbian. It was a multiethnic country--the army and \nthe Bosnian Government made up of Serbs, Croats, and Moslems, all of \nwhom were Bosnians.\n  So I want to make it clear that not all the Serbs, by any stretch of \nthe imagination, in fact, are like the aggressors.\n  I might add that when I visited Belgrade over 2 years ago and met \nwith a group of about 75 leaders from business, academia, and other \nwalks of life, including the press, two things were clear: First, the \nvast majority of the people living in Serbia did not know the truth. \nSecond, if they did they would not support either the ethnic cleansing \nby the Bosnian Serbs or the actions taken by their own government. I \nfelt they did not support what Karadzic was suggesting. But all they \nhad was a totally government-controlled television outlet, like the old \nCommunist days in Yugoslavia. So all they saw on the news were Bosnian \nSerb children being slaughtered and even hung up on racks like \nchickens. All pure propaganda, not true. The world acknowledges this \nnow. \n\n[[Page S9234]]\nMilosevic did it to enrage his population, to play on centuries-old \nfears and divisions, and it worked. But the vast majority of the \nSerbian people are good, honorable, and decent, but they do not know \nthe truth.\n  In the Government-controlled portion of Bosnia, there is an organized \nBosnian Serb political opposition to Mr. Karadzic and his fellow thugs \nin Pale. There are many Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats serving in the \narmy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Government army's deputy \nchief of staff who is a Bosnian Serb.\n  Indeed, there are thousands of decent, moral Serbs in Sarajevo, \nBelgrade, and elsewhere whose personal values rise above the primitive, \nprovincial racism of Karadzic, Milosevic, and company.\n  Despite the almost unbelievable privations endured by Sarajevans, the \nBosnian capital's Moslem, Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish citizens are \nstill living together, hoping against hope that their sophisticated \ncity can receive the basics--food, water, and medicine--currently \ndenied them by the Serbian bullies in the hills who cowardly snipe at \ntheir children and indiscriminately lob shells at innocent civilians.\n  I have already outlined the legal basis and moral imperative for \ngiving the Bosnian Government the means to defend itself. Now I would \nlike to address the tactical arguments often given against lifting the \narms embargo.\n  Some critics assert that the Bosnian Serbs would react by overrunning \nthe eastern enclaves of Srebrenica, Gorazde, and Zepa. I would remind \nthose critics, first of all, that the Serbs have been attacking Gorazde \nfor weeks without success. More importantly, the U.N. Security Council \nhas called for defense of the safe areas with air power, if necessary, \nand with vigorous American leadership, NATO could do so.\n  A second criticism is that lifting the arms embargo would induce \nUNPROFOR to pull out. But I regret to say, Mr. President, that UNPROFOR \ntroops have become the world's most expensive hostages and have ceased \nto be able to carry out their mandate. UNPROFOR has publicly abandoned \nits attempt to protect Sarajevo from bombardment of heavy artillery. On \nJune 17, a U.N. spokesman admitted: ``The policy of weapons-collection \npoints has now been abandoned.''\n  Moreover, the United Nations is manifestly unwilling to honor its \ncommitment to use all necessary means--that is what the U.N. resolution \nsays--all necessary means to bring supplies to the desperate civilian \npopulations of Sarajevo, Bihac, and the eastern enclaves.\n  Mr. President, UNPROFOR is now mainly in the business of protecting \nitself, which I do not blame it for doing, but that is all it does. It \nhas outlived its usefulness and should be withdrawn, independent of \nwhether or not we lift the arms embargo.\n  Another frequently heard criticism of lifting the arms embargo \nunilaterally is that it would cause a rift in NATO. Mr. President, in \ncase anyone is not looking, there is already a rift in NATO, and it is \ngoing to get bigger as the American people think over why we spend $110 \nbillion a year, every year, for NATO. For what purpose? For what \npurpose? If they cannot affect events in Bosnia, for what purpose are \nour American taxpayers spending $110 billion a year?\n  Mr. President, I step back to no man or woman in this Senate in being \na supporter of NATO. I respectfully suggest that I have been one of its \nstrongest advocates for more than 20 years. But it seems to me that if \nwe do not move and do something, NATO will be split and fractured more \nthan by our unilaterally lifting an arms embargo.\n  NATO will be signing its own death warrant by a continuation of its \nineffectual response in Bosnia, hobbled as it is by incomprehensible \nU.N.-controlled rules of engagement.\n  Some critics claim that lifting the arms embargo would automatically \nlead to spreading of the conflict to other parts of the Balkans. Mr. \nPresident, this assertion flies in the face of the facts by ignoring \nthe example of the deterrence policy already employed by the United \nStates on Serbia's southern border.\n  There, an outstanding success story of the Clinton administration's \nBalkan policy has been the sending of several hundred American troops \nto join the Nordic U.N. contingent in the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia. Combined with our warning to Milosevic not to even dream of \nattacking, this action--not the existence of the arms embargo--is what \nhas kept Belgrade's hands off the fledgling Macedonian State.\n  He knows we mean it there and he has not moved. We should extend the \nwarning to Milosevic that any intervention of his army in the conflict \nin Bosnia, either to aid the Bosnian Serbs after the lifting of the \nembargo or to harass the evacuation of UNPROFOR troops, would result in \nmassive, disproportionate retaliation against Serbia proper.\n  Finally, some opponents of lifting the embargo foresee a dire \nprecedent for unilateral embargo-breaking elsewhere, such as those \ncurrently in effect against Iraq and Libya.\n  The line goes, ``If we unilaterally lift the arms embargo against \nBosnia, won't our allies lift the arms embargo against Iraq and \nLibya?'' But surely, Mr. President, one can point out even to the most \ndisingenuous foreign politician that there is a world of difference \nbetween sanctions against Bosnia, the victim of international \naggression, on the one hand, and an embargo against Iraq, a notorious \ninternational aggressor, on the other hand. We can and should use our \nconsiderable leverage against countries who would threaten deliberately \nto ignore this obvious and fundamental distinction.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, in actuality, opponents of lifting the \nillegal arms embargo against Bosnia ignore a much more ominous \nprecedent than breaking the U.N. sanctions.\n  The geostrategic reality of the future is that the primary danger to \npeace will much more likely come, not from nuclear missiles, but from \nregional crises, often in the form of ethnic conflicts and oppression \nof minorities.\n  In that context, therefore, the more dangerous precedent would be to \nreward an aggressor for his cold-blooded invasion, vile ethnic \ncleansing, murder, rape, pillage, and starvation by blockade. Europe, \nunfortunately, has other potential Milosevics and Karadzics. That is \nthe sad reality to which we must adjust as we prepare to enter the 21st \ncentury. That, Mr. President, is not feel-good idealism. It is nuts-\nand-bolts realpolitik, and we should begin to practice it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9232-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 OFF-SHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS DRILLING\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, most people know about the famous sport \nthat was born during the late 19th century in Massachusetts. The sport \nwas basketball, and its birthplace was Springfield. But what many may \nnot know is that Massachusetts also gave birth to another outstanding \ngame during that same era.\n  In 1895, William G. Morgan, the physical fitness director of the YMCA \nin Holyoke, invented a sport that he regarded as a cousin of badminton \nand called mintonette. Today, it is known as volleyball, and this year \nit is celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n  Just as the slams of Dee Brown and the no-look passes of Sherman \nDouglas for the Celtics today bear no resemblance to the basketball \nplayed beneath the peach baskets of the 19th century, the hard-hitting \nand fast pace that characterize volleyball today are a far cry from \nMorgan's invention.\n  He initially developed it for his noon businessmen's fitness class. \nHe wanted a game that was less strenuous than basketball, that did not \nrequire physical contact, but that would still provide excellent \nexercise. Morgan's game was originally played indoors, with a soccer \nball stripped of its leather cover. The rules were a conglomeration of \nregulations adapted from basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. \nThe net was 6 feet high, compared to the standard 8 feet today, and \nplayers could hit the ball as many times as necessary to return it. A \ngame consisted of nine three-out innings, like baseball. A ball hitting \nthe floor more than once was an out.\n  For a time, the Holyoke YMCA was volleyball's only home. But when \nplayers began to take the game outdoors, its popularity soared. Nets \nstarted appearing on playgrounds and beaches throughout Massachusetts \nand surrounding areas. In 1916,\n the YMCA and the NCAA jointly issued a new set of rules similar to \nthose in use today.\n\n  At that time, there were 200,000 players of the still mostly American \ngame. But when U.S. soldiers introduced volleyball to Europe during the \nFirst World War, the game began to spread to other countries, and it \nspread even more rapidly during the Second World War.\n  In 1947, the International Federation of Volleyball was created with \n13 charter members. That number has now grown to 180. By the time \nvolleyball became an official Olympic sport in 1964, teams from Europe \nand Asia were often dominant. Japan had developed a power game that \nlater spread across the globe, and Soviet bloc nations frequently \nprevailed in international competitions.\n  In the 1970's, the United States built state-of-the-art training \ncenters, in a major effort to recapture our own game. The result was \nthe Los Angeles miracle of 1984. The American men's team had been \nranked 19th in the world, and hadn't even qualified for the games since \n1968. In 1984, it surprised and delighted the Long Beach Arena crowd by \ndefeating Brazil in straight games to win the gold medal. Millions of \nAmericans watched on television and shared in the glory of that magical \nnight, leading to a rebirth of the sport throughout the Nation. America \nhad finally caught up to our own game. Led by Steve Timmons and Karch \nKiraly, the American team played an extremely exciting brand of \nvolleyball and dominated the sport. At those same Olympics, the U.S. \nwomen's team also shined, winning a silver medal.\n  A large part of the game's rebirth in America has been on the beach, \nwhere professional beach volleyball is rapidly gaining popularity. One \nof the stars of the beach game is Massachusetts native Karolyn Kirby.\n  Kirby, from Brookline, grew up as a sports lover, cheering on the \nCeltics, Red Sox, and Bruins. In high school, she excelled in \nvolleyball. She was a star collegiate player indoors, earning All-\nAmerica designation at both Utah State and the University of Kentucky.\n  After college, she took up the outdoor game, and is now the world's \nbest female beach volleyball player. She has been the No. 1 player on \nthe Women's Professional Volleyball Tour since 1990, and she has won or \nshared the tour's MVP crown four times. She is also the world's No. 1-\nranked beach player and will likely represent the United States in 1996 \nwhen beach volleyball becomes a full medal sport at the Olympics.\n  What makes volleyball such a popular sport is that it can be played \nat all skill levels and by all ages. Forty million Americans now play, \nmaking it one of the top 10 participatory sports in the Nation. Most of \nthose 40 million citizens may not be adept at the bump-set-spike play, \nbut they enjoy the game immensely, because it brings families and \nfriends together in backyards, parks, playgrounds, and beaches \nthroughout the Nation.\n  To commemorate this auspicious 100th anniversary, the men's Division \nI championship was held in Springfield in May, and was won by UCLA. The \nwomen's Division I championship is scheduled for December at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts.\n  In October, the women's Division III title finals will be played at \nMount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and in conjunction with that event, \nnew members will be inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame at \nHeritage State Park in Holyoke.\n  In addition, more than 250 men's and women's teams gathered for an \ninternational volleyball celebration from May 27 to June 3 at Westover \nAir Force Base in Massachusetts. The occasion was the annual USA \nVolleyball Indoor Open Championships, and for the first time in the \nevent's 67-year history, teams from around the world participated.\n  Massachusetts is extremely proud of this aspect of its heritage, and \nI welcome this opportunity to commend all those who have made \nvolleyball such a positive addition to the life of our Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9235-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, which long \nago soared into the stratosphere, is like the weather--everybody talks \nabout it but scarcely anybody had undertaken the responsibility to \ntrying to do anything about it. That is, not until following the \nelections last November.\n  When the new 104th Congress convened in January, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives approved a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.

Mr. President, it has been said that each man's death \ndiminishes us all. Certainly all who knew him have felt a loss due to \nthe recent passing of Charles ``Chick'' Reynolds.\n  A reporter of outstanding experience and qualifications, ``Chick'' \nReynolds began his career in stenotype reporting in 1949, when he was \nemployed by the Department of Defense.\n  In 1950, he went to work for the Alderson Reporting Co. here in \nWashington, where he continued until 1971, at which time he opened his \nown stenographic reporting firm. In 1974, he was \n\n[[Page S9236]]\nappointed an official reporter with the Senate Official Reporters of \nDebates serving in that capacity until he became Chief Reporter in \n1988.\n  When ``Chick'' Reynolds was a working stenotype reporter, he was \nconsidered one of the fastest and most accurate in the country. He \nreported on Federal agency hearings and on various committees in both \nthe House and the Senate, including the Joseph McCarthy and Jimmy Hoffa \nhearings on Capitol Hill. He was assigned to cover the White House \nduring the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations, and was in the \nPresidential motorcade on that tragic day when President Kennedy was \nassassinated in 1963.\n  ``Chick'' Reynolds served the Senate and the Nation with distinction \nfor 21 years, and only discontinued that service when ill-health forced \nhim to do so earlier this year. His was an outstanding career, but, the \nrecounting of one's career successes can never completely give the \nwhole measure of a man.\n  By all accounts, ``Chick'' Reynolds in both his private and \nprofessional lives was an eminently decent human being, with great \naffection for his wife, Lucille, and a fine sense of humor. He was fond \nof saying that he took Lucille everywhere he went so that he would \nnever have to kiss her goodbye. He liked to tell a story about one \nsultry evening when he was stuck in traffic on route 95 with the \nwindows rolled down because of a faulty air conditioner. His only \npassenger, his cat, suddenly decided that it was too hot in the car, \nand leaped out of the window. ``Chick'' pulled over immediately and \nspent some time frantically searching for the cat in the heat and \ncongestion. He did not want to go home to Lucille without that cat.\n  ``Chick'' Reynolds was a man to whom his fellow employees could \ncontinually look for counsel and instruction, always given with humor \nand genuine concern. Those who worked with him are indeed fortunate to \nhave been so close to this very special life. ``Chick'' will not be \nforgotten by his colleagues in the Senate. The institution has been \ndiminished by his passing. His great competence and his institutional \nmemory and comprehension are not easily replaced in a world now more \ninterested in speed than in considered contemplation and mature \njudgment. ``Chick'' Reynolds was surely sui generis, one of a kind, in \na world often far too short on wisdom and experience.\n  I extend my sincere regret and deep condolences to his family, and \nmost especially to his beloved Lucille. He is gone. But, the lives \n``Chick'' Reynolds touched and the difference he made through his \nservice here, and through the force of his warm and magnanimous \npersonality will remain. The Senate and all who knew him are measurably \nbetter for the life and example of Charles ``Chick'' Reynolds.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9235-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be a period for debate on House \nConcurrent Resolution 67, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from the State of Missouri, \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, is the pending business before the \nSenate the concurrent budget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a period for debate on the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that we have decided to take 4 hours \ntoday, equally divided, and Senator Exon might have other Senators who \nwant to speak during his 2 hours.\n  Mr. EXON. I advise the Chair that the answer to that is yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to Senators--particularly \nto those who are conferees and, in addition, those on the Budget \nCommittee, all of them--I am not sure they knew we were going to be on \nthis at noon today. Perhaps they thought it would be later, or perhaps \neven some might have thought tomorrow. I ask that they come to the \nfloor, or call us if they would like some time. I would like as many of \nthem who like to speak to do so. We will have some time tomorrow. I \nunderstand three of them want to speak today. This is my invitation to \nthem so that we can arrange the time.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, the fiscal year 1996 concurrent \nbudget resolution conference agreement, which will be before the Senate \nshortly, represents, in my opinion, a very historic step in bringing \nthe Federal budget under control, bringing it to balance in 7 years by \nslowing the growth in Federal spending.\n  This blueprint that has been crafted is one which, first and \nforemost, reaches a balance by the year 2002 and does that by \nratcheting down the deficit to a balance in 2002. It does that by \nreducing expenditures of the Federal Government. There are no other \nitems making up that reduction and ratcheting down those deficits, \nother than reducing the amount of Government spending.\n  This provides, in addition, up to $245 billion in tax relief. But I \nwant to repeat what we have spoken about so often in the Senate--that \nrelief comes only when we have achieved a balanced budget by adopting \nthis resolution with mandatory caps on the expenditures of appropriated \naccounts, with one set of caps for defense and one set for all the rest \nof the expenditures that occur annually, called ``appropriated \naccounts''; and then when we present from the respective committees to \nthe Budget Committee the reconciliation bill, which will accommodate \nand respond to the instructions given by this resolution, and once they \nare in the hands of the Budget Committee here and in the House, we will \nhave them evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nauthenticator, the neutral group, chosen by most, and only a couple of \nyears ago chosen officially before the American people by the President \nof the United States, as the real authenticator, which would have no \nsmoke and mirrors, which would be objective--we will ask that entity to \nevaluate our performance. If the caps are enforced--and we intend to \nenforce them--and that bill called ``reconciliation''--a strange name, \nbut I guess the best way to say it is that it reconciles the laws of \nthe country with the budget resolution, thus, it is called \nreconciliation. That big package will address the issues of Medicare, \nMedicaid, and many other entitlements, and it will attempt to make \nMedicare solvent for the next 10 to 12 years, instead of leaving it on \na spend-out that would yield to bankruptcy within 6 to 7 years. They \nwill not have enough money to pay their bills in 6 to 7 years. So when \nthat event occurs, and it is certified by that authenticator, then we \nwill tell the American people and the U.S. Congress that we have a \nbalanced budget.\n  At that point in time, what will happen is the $245 billion will be \nreleased to the Finance Committee in the Senate and its counterpart in \nthe Ways and Means Committee in the House, and they will proceed. While \nwe remain the custodians of the reconciliation bill, we are holding it, \nthey will produce the tax bill after they have debates in their \ncommittee, and they will send that tax bill to the Budget Committee, \nwho will then be the guardian of both and bring both to the floor. One \nwill not be passed without the other. We will pass the big \nreconciliation bill, which the authenticator will say gets you to \nbalance; and then, Mr. President, the American people should know that \ntax cuts cannot get you out of balance. That is part of the mandate. \nThe tax cuts cannot, in the last year, the seventh year, be bigger than \nthe economic dividend which created a surplus in that last year. It is \naround $50 billion. So if some wonder whether the tax cuts are going to \ndeny the people of this country a balanced budget, it will not. \n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  The deficits in each of the previous years will be a little higher \nthan we thought they would be as the bill left the U.S. Senate, because \nwe have to accommodate to $75 billion--not $245 billion, but to $75 \nbillion more than we had accounted for in our budget. Those will be \nspread back across by way of increased deficits annually. But in the \nfinal year you will be in balance.\n  So we believe it is an exciting time, an exciting event to speak \nabout today, to speak about tomorrow, and then to ask the U.S. Senate \nto vote yes or no. I am very hopeful that the vote will be more than 50 \nvoting for it. I believe that is going to be the case, which means it \nwill pass.\n  It will do a lot of good things for America. First of all, it \ndemonstrates a commitment to keep our promise to the American people \nthat we will, working together with them, enact a balanced budget for \nthe American people.\n  It also is an answer to many--most of whom are on that side of the \naisle--who said we do not need a constitutional balanced budget to get \na balanced budget.\n  Saying, over and over, ``Just do it. Take the action that you must.'' \nWe took it seriously. In 7 years, we produce that kind of budget.\n  From this Senator's standpoint, there is probably no event on the \ndomestic side, in the past three or four decades, that is more \nimportant to the future of America and more indicative that we are \nchanging directions, than this budget resolution. It is the framework \nto change the fiscal policy of America, and to change the way the \nFederal Government operates with and toward the sovereign States and \nthe people of the country.\n  There should, when it is implemented, be less Government here. I \nbelieve the American people have been saying they want less Government \nhere. It will say, ``You have more power at the State level.'' It will \nsay, ``We are giving you more power over programs we have held both the \npurse strings and the power over.''\n  It is a vote of confidence in the Governors and legislators of \nAmerica who are closer to the people than we are, and who are capable \nof modifying and melding programs so that they do not fall prey to the \none-shoe-fits-all philosophy. That if there is one program with one \ndefinition, and one set of strings, it must be good for all Americans \nand for all States. It will change that premise of Government.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, there is no question that we cannot get \nthere unless we reform and alter and make better the programs of health \ncare that America as a United States Government manages or funds, or \noperates. We will do that.\n  We will reform Medicaid and Medicare--at least our committees will--\nin response to this instruction of this budget resolution, requiring \nthat they reconcile the law. I will talk about that in a little while.\n  In addition, sometimes we forget that of all our responsibilities, \nthere is only one that we do alone and that the sovereign States do not \ndo and we do not ask them to. That is our national defense. I assume \nwhen we come here as Senators and take the oath that we pledge our \nsupport to our Constitution and our Nation, but I think it is obvious \nthat we are, at the minimum, committing ourselves to the national \ndefense.\n  So we take care of the national defense here, also. Before we are \nfinished with our presentation, for those who say we have raised \ndefense spending while we have reduced spending in certain social \nprograms--in particular, the entitlements--we will show the American \npeople that, truly, defense, when we are finished with our 7 years, \nwill not have grown, but of a steady starting point, will have come \ndown by $17 billion--$17 billion less than 1995. So, while it comes \ndown, contrary to what is being said by some, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nother entitlements will go up. Medicare itself will go up by 252 \nbillions of dollars--not down--up. Medicaid will go up by about $180 \nbillion cumulative over the 7 years--not down--up.\n  I would like to go on with a few other summaries and a few \ndefinitions. Then at the appointed time I will yield to Senator Exon, \nand from my side of the aisle, since we have half the time, fellow \nRepublicans, I would like some Senators to use some of this time this \nafternoon, 15 or 20 minutes, by each Senator genuinely interested.\n  Let me give Senators Webster's definition of the word ``compromise.'' \nThe third definition of compromise in this source dictionary ``is \nsomething midway between other things in quality, effect and \ncriteria,'' et cetera.\n  Compromise is something our Founding Fathers envisioned. Clearly, \nthis conference agreement before the Senate today is a compromise. Let \nme suggest from my standpoint, the Senator who chaired the Budget \nCommittee that got it started out, that put the package together, I \ntruly believe this is an excellent package and a very solid compromise \nthat will serve our people well.\n  Clearly, the House did not get everything it wants in its 5-year \nblueprint for America; nor did we. Balance is achieved in 7 years by, \nfirst, reducing the rate of growth in total spending.\n  Let me give a few numbers and ways to look at that. Total Federal \nspending grows from $1.5 trillion in 1995 to $1.875 trillion in 2002. \nThe average growth rate, Mr. President, will be 3 percent a year. When \nit goes from $1.5 trillion to $1.875--almost $1.9 trillion--it will \ngrow at 3 percent. The Federal deficit would grow next year to nearly \n$200 billion if we do not adopt and enforce this resolution. Mr. \nPresident, $200 billion without the changes in policy which will reduce \nthat to $170 billion. Thereafter, it will decline to a surplus of $7 \nbillion in the year 2002.\n  The total deficit reduction over the next 7 years will reach almost \n$900 billion. Everyone should understand that reduction occurs while \nthe budget is still growing. It is a reduction in the amount of growth \nby $900 billion, including the interest we will save.\n  The tax reductions that are contemplated, we should understand very \nclearly, and every Member of the Senate should, first, there is nothing \nin this budget resolution that will tell our Finance Committee, the \ntax-writing committee, what taxes they should reduce. There is nothing \nin any budget resolution adopted under the laws of this land that can \ntell a committee precisely what their finished product will be.\n  I cannot stand here and say that I am clairvoyant enough or \nunderstand the mind of the Finance Committee so well that this $245 \nbillion, if they use it, will yield certain tax cuts. What I can say, \nunequivocally, that those reductions cannot and will not occur until \nthe committees of this Senate have first met their spending reduction \ninstructions.\n  Let me repeat: The tax reductions that we speak to, which I have \nalluded to in terms of how we constrain them so as to assure balance, \ncannot occur and will not occur unless the committees of the U.S. \nSenate--from the Agriculture to the Labor Committee, to the Finance \nCommittee, to Government Operations, to Energy and others--until they \nreconcile the law and change it pursuant to this instruction to save \nthe money, there will not be any opportunity for our Finance Committee \nof the U.S. Senate to pursue a tax bill.\n  Once that certification occurs--and I have explained that heretofore. \nLet me do it again. There will be, flowing from the Budget Committee to \nthe Finance Committee, an allowable of $245 billion, $170 billion of \nwhich, Mr. President, is the economic dividend which we are entitled to \nfor having reached balance.\n They will then proceed to write a tax bill, and they must have \nsufficient votes to get it done. And when they put it in the \nreconciliation bill in our hands, as custodians of both they will need \n51 votes of the floor of the Senate also.\n\n  So in a very real sense, the Senate of the United States will decide \nwhat tax cuts there will be in this $245 billion allowed. And Senators \nwill have a very big input into it. Ultimately, once again we will have \nto go meet with the House, who will do their job, and we will have to \nsee what the product is.\n  Cumbersome it is. Unpredictable, with certainty today--even as short \na time as 3 months from now we cannot predict, because committees will \ndo their will. But we have come as close as we have ever come to \nputting an enforceable blueprint before the committees of this Senate. \nAnd the only thing they have to decide: Do you want to be part of \nbalancing the budget or not? And if you do, you have to do what you \n\n[[Page S9238]]\nhave been told to do. And I am not telling them what to do. When this \nvote occurs tomorrow, and a majority of this Senate says aye, the \nSenate is telling them what to do.\n  There is no other way under current procedures to get that job done. \nYou could never bring those bills here without a budget resolution \nbecause they would be debated forever, amendable forever, and Americans \nwould be waiting until God knows when for a balanced budget. So, while \nit is not nice to tell committees you have 2\\1/2\\ months or 3, because \nthe date they must produce is September 22, they will produce it and \nsend it over to the Budget Committee for interpretation.\n  I am certain most of the discussion in opposition to this budget \nresolution will say it is too quick, not quite the right time, this \neconomy is perhaps not as robust as it was 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Let me say \nto everybody watching and all our Senators, for those who do not want \nto balance the budget of the United States it is never the right time \nto balance it. For, if you are on the up side of the business cycle, \nwith a buoyant 4 percent growth, there will be those who say it is not \nthe right time because we do not want to put any damper on that. Let us \nlet that great economy go on. If you do it in the middle of the \nbusiness cycle there will be those saying, oh, no, do not do that. It \nis too close to coming down. And if you wait until now, when you we \nhave had a rather robust recovery for a rather prolonged time, there \nwill be those saying do not do it now. We need to make sure the economy \ncontinues on.\n  But to all of those critics, I remind you that if a balanced budget \nis not worth something to our children and to the future and to \nopportunity for the future, then we ought not be doing it. But if it \nis, we ought to do it, for it has a bigger positive effect in our \neconomic lives and the lives of our children than the temporariness of \nan up or down in the business cycle.\n  But, did you hear how much we are reducing the deficit in the first \nyear? We are reducing it by $30 billion. It would have been $200 \nbillion. We will get it down to $170. To anyone who wants to criticize \nthis on the basis that it is bad for the economy, then let them say \nthat a $30 billion reduction could harm an economy of almost $6 \ntrillion.\n  I am also certain that there will be those who will say we should not \nreform Medicare. We should not do that as fast as we are doing it. And \nwe will hurt people. And some will even say we are cutting Medicare.\n  Let me suggest, Medicare is going to grow from $158 billion to $244 \nbillion as an annual expenditure of Medicare by the year 2002. It will \ngrow at an annual average rate of 6.4 percent. The total Medicare \nspending over the next 7 years will top $1.6 trillion. Medicare is \nborderline solvent. It will not have money to pay its bills in 6 or 7 \nyears. By the changes we are asking, the reforms we are asking, it will \nbe made solvent and will be there for our seniors.\n  One last observation that should not go unnoticed. Per capita \nexpenditures on Medicare will increase from $4,900 per recipient to \n$6,700 per recipient by the year 2002. Relative to what I perceive to \nbe an unsustainable current spending path, the conference agreement \nreduces Medicare spending from that expected amount, which I do not \nbelieve was sustainable, and reduces it by $270 billion.\n  I will talk about Medicaid in due course, defense and nondefense \nspending. But, obviously, at this point I have given to the U.S. Senate \nand those concerned and observing at least an overview of why we are \ndoing what we are doing.\n  I close with just my own pledge and my own feelings on this day about \nthis event. Mr. President, fellow Senators, the time has come for adult \nAmericans leading this country to produce a Government plan that no \nlonger asks our children and grandchildren to pay our bills. The time \nhas come for us to say enough is enough. No more burden on our children \nto pay for the deficit spending of today. Sooner or later we must do it \nfor the general good of our country and for the specific well-being of \nour children and grandchildren. And I stand ready to support what we \nare suggesting and recommending because I believe the better good and \nthe broader and more basic good for our country will come from us being \nresponsible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time I might need off \ntime on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to start out by congratulating my \ngood friend, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, for the remarks he has just made.\n  I say to Senator Domenici, the remarks I will make in the next few \nmoments are certainly not intended directly at him. I have the highest \nregard for him, his ability, and, generally speaking, I would subscribe \nwholeheartedly to the road he just outlined to get from here to there \nwith regard to a balanced budget.\n  I worked with Senator Domenici on the Budget Committee since I came \nhere 17 years ago. He is a principled individual. He worked very hard \nto put this budget together. Unfortunately, we were not able to see eye \nto eye. I would simply say to my friend from New Mexico that the main \ndisagreement here, as he understands fully, is not the goal that I \nthink we both want, a balanced budget, but--and there has been \nconsiderable discussion and debate--which will continue--the roads or \nthe paths we follow to get from here to there.\n  I think in summation, before I begin my remarks, I just wanted to say \nthat he is the Republican leader and I am the Democratic leader. When \nwe have this kind of democracy in action we are entitled to the \nmajority view, we are entitled to the minority view. I simply say, I \ncongratulate him for what he has done. I hope we could work together in \nthe future.\n  But certainly, as he knows full well, the events of the last few \nmonths have not made it possible for us to join forces as I hoped, \nearlier, we might be able to. That is not his fault and it is not mine. \nThat is the system under which we operate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first say I am very gratified by \nthe remarks, and I appreciate them. Frankly, I must say the feeling is \nmutual. I did not feel very good when I heard the Senator was not going \nto be around here very long, that he decided to go home and retire. I \nthink he has done an excellent job for his people and for this great \ncountry. I am very sorry we do not have a budget we both can stand up \nhere and say we are for.\n  I am quite sure that in many of the difficulties, many of the exact \nissues, the Senator from Nebraska and I would be on the same boat, he \nand I, traveling down that stream, trying to get to ``Balanceville,'' I \nguess I would say. We are not there this year. I know the Senator will \nhope for us the best in our journey. We will try to get there. If the \nSenator from Nebraska cannot help us now, perhaps he might later on \nwhen the President chooses to make it more difficult for us.\n  Maybe the Senator--who knows--might be in one of those meetings to \nsee what we can do.\n  I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend. I appreciate his very generous remarks. \nWe have been on different sides on many issues. In 1993, when we passed \nthe first great deficit reduction bill in history offered by the \nPresident, while I thought that my friend and colleague from New Mexico \nprobably agreed with many of the thrusts of the President's initiative, \nhe still was not able to support it.\n  I have reviewed some of the statements that he made in opposition to \nthe President's measure which received not one single Republican vote \nin either the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives. With that \nthought in mind, I have gone through the remarks that I am about to \nmake and hope that Senator Domenici and others might not, in a year or \ntwo, be able to point back and say Exon said this and it did not turn \nout that way.\n  I will simply say that we do get carried away with rhetoric from time \nto time. I am going to try to be straightforward about this and explain \nmy position, and the general Democratic position with regard to what we \nthink is \n\n[[Page S9239]]\nan unfair, very troubled, very bumpy road, especially with regard to \nour senior citizens, our veterans, rural America, and others not so \nfortunately situated financially.\n  Mr. President, today we bring down the curtain on the first act of \nthis budget drama that has been unfolding since February. And I hope I \ncan bring a little Nebraska common sense to the sound and fury that has \nswirled around this budget.\n  Contrary to what we may read in the papers or see on television, the \nbudget we are debating should not be about Presidential politics. It is \nnot about the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.\n  This budget is about 100 million American households. It is about the \n250 million Americans who are looking to us to make the right decisions \nabout this budget. That is not the province of any person or party.\n  I am glad the President has become engaged in this landmark debate on \nhow to balance the budget. The American people want to see cooperation \nbetween the two parties. They crave rational and civil discourse and \nmeaningful dialog. They hope that we will take the best ideas--\nregardless of party--and forge a tough new alloy from these different \nmetals.\n  Unfortanately, my Republican colleagues have a different view. They \nbelieve that their budget is so pure, so sacred, so perfect that it \ncannot be touched by those of us on this side of the aisle.\n  I am reminded of a story that Will Rogers told. It seems that a woman \nconfessed to her priest that she was guilty of the sin of pride. She \nsaid, ``When I look in the mirror, I think I'm beautiful.'' The priest \nsaid, ``That's not a sin. That's a mistake!''\n  And so it is with this Republican budget. The Republicans may think \nso, but their budget has not improved with time. It has not turned into \na dazzling butterfly. It is a mistake on a colossal scale.\n  At the opening of the conference on the budget, I predicted that the \nSenate budget would deteriorate. I wish that I had been wrong, but with \neach violent lurch forward, this budget gets meaner and uglier. The \nall-Republican conference merely twisted the knife.\n  And that is the story of Republican priorities throughout this \nbudget: From bad to worse--from worse to worst.\n  Were the Medicare cuts softened to ease the pain on the elderly? No, \nthey are worse--$14 billion worse, bringing the total Medicare cuts to \n$270 billion. That is the largest cut in Medicare history coming from \nthe self-proclaimed saviors of Medicare. Hit men is more like it.\n  What about Medicaid? Was there any attempt to help the elderly, \ndisabled and the children who rely on this health safety net? Not a \nchance in this Republican budget. Medicaid was slashed by an additional \n$7 billion, bringing the cuts to a staggering $182 billion over 7 \nyears.\n  What about rural America, already reeling from the $11.9 billion in \ncuts in the Senate budget? This new budget heaps on further abuse with \nan additional $1.4 billion in agriculture cuts bringing the total \ndamage to $13.3 billion.\n  And what about the tax cut? What about the so-called economic \ndividend we heard so much about on the Senate floor in May? It was the \nonce and future tax cut. It was the tax cut that was not a tax cut, in \nthe parlance of my friends across the aisle.\n  Thank goodness, we can finally end that charade. We can dispense with \nthe play-acting. There is a tax cut in this conference agreement. It is \na whopping $245 billion tax cut--$75 billion more than the Senate \neconomic bonus and it is on page 32 of the conference report. That is \nwhere the Senate Republicans accommodate the Contract With America. \n``Caved in'' would be a more accurate description.\n  We know how the Republicans will pay for the $245 billion tax cut. \nThey pay for it by strip mining Medicare and Medicaid. They pay for it \nby gouging education, job training, and the earned income tax credit. \nThey pay for it by flailing rural America.\n  Of course, we do not have any firm details on the tax cut itself.\n   That will be up to the tax-writing committees, as Senator Domenici \nindicated. But I think we can venture a good guess at what will be in \nthis witches' brew. The conference agreement is the vessel for the \nContract With America and it's filled to the brim with tax cuts, \nprimarily for the wealthy.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal reported that the $245 billion Republican tax \ncut could include such goodies for America's wealthiest as a $64 \nbillion capital gains tax revision and a $500-per-child tax credit for \nfamilies making up to $200,000 per year--key provisions of the Contract \nWith America.\n  The sense-of-the-Congress resolution, sponsored by Senator Boxer, \nthat stated that 90 percent of the tax benefits should go to working \nfamilies making under $100,000 was changed beyond recognition. It was \ngutted in conference to drop the $100,000 cut-off. It was totally \nrewritten to conform with the Contract With America.\n  House conservatives are threatening to derail the reconciliation bill \nunless it meets their far-right litmus test. Representative Phil \nBurton, leader of the so-called Conservative Action Team, told the \nJournal, and I quote, ``It is imperative that it''--the child tax \ncredit--``be kept at $200,000.''\n House Ways and Means Chairman Archer said, and I quote, ``I'm not \ngoing to go back and do another tax bill.'' And why should he when the \nSenate Republicans are waving the white flag to the Speaker of Newt \nGingrich's, army.\n\n  Mr. President, families making $200,000 a year do not need any \nlargesse from the Federal Government. It is astonishing that at a time \nwhen we are asking for a helping hand for our elderly, our students, \nand middle-income Americans, we are giving a handout to the wealthy. It \nis obscene that my Republican colleagues are contemplating tax cuts for \nfamilies making six figures. Is this mainstream America, Mr. President? \nI emphasize that. I think the Republicans are not so much concerned \nabout mainstream America as they would have you believe. My Republican \nfriends talk much about it. I can simply sum up by saying it certainly \nis not mainstream Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, the most confusing part of the tax cut package is that \nit costs $245 billion, but it is supposedly financed with an economic \nbonus of only $170 billion. Anyone can tell you that is $75 billion \nshort.\n  Republican leaders have gone to great pains to explain this sleight \nof hand by focusing on the net effects of the cut and the bonus in the \nyear 2002. In that year, the economic bonus will be $50 billion, the \nCBO says. The Republican package will thus be restricted to $50 billion \nas well for that year. In preceding years, however, the cost of the tax \npackage will exceed--will exceed, Mr. President--the savings from the \neconomic bonus by a significant margin. I underline that. In the \npreceding years, the costs of the tax package will exceed the savings \nfrom the economic bonus by a significant margin.\n  Despite the differences in the cost, the Republicans claim that the \n$245 billion tax cut can be included in the budget without compromising \nthe goal of zero deficits in the last year.\n  In order for all of this to pan out, spending cuts in programs like \nMedicare and Medicaid once again will have to be used to finance the \nadditional costs. This is coming from the party that claims it is \n``saving'' Medicare. For Medicare, any more of these kinds of \n``savings'' will assure that there will not be anything left for the \nprogram.\n  My Republican colleagues are not only short $75 billion to pay for \ntheir tax cut, they are also short on explanations. They are not \nexplaining to the American people that the extra $75 billion in tax \ncuts would result in higher debt service and, in turn, higher \ndeficits--up to $100 billion--for the years leading up to the magic \nbalanced budget year of 2002, and that, in turn, would cause higher \ndebt service costs for those intervening years. Mr. President, that is \nclear.\n  I mentioned earlier that this budget is about American people, and so \nit is. I want to take a few minutes to get beneath the shiny surface of \nthis budget that is all glitter and glut for the wealthiest. Nowhere do \nwe see this more than in Medicare and Medicaid. The Republicans now \nsiphon off $275 billion from Medicare to help pay for their tax cut. \nThat means the average Medicare beneficiary will pay $3,345 more over \nthe next 7 years in out-of-\n\n[[Page S9240]]\npocket costs--$860 more alone in the year 2002.\n  The $182 billion in Medicare cuts is especially harsh on the elderly, \nthe disabled and children. Average Federal and State spending would be \nreduced by nearly 30 percent by the year 2002, and of the children \ncovered by Medicare, more than half live in working families.\n  Mr. President, under the Republican budget, the States would be \nforced to roll back the number of people served. I estimate that 8 \nmillion people, including children, could fall through the safety net \nby the year 2002. As many as 2.9 million seniors and disabled, \nincluding children, could lose access to long-term care.\n  From day one of this budget, I have expressed my deepest concern \nabout the betrayal of rural America. Rural America has been sold out. \nRural America became a popular fall guy for this Republican budget. \nWhat is particularly galling to this Senator is that agriculture is \nbeing asked to take such a whack once again. It is totally out of all \nproportion to other cuts in the budget.\n  Where is fairness in this budget? Farm program cuts in the Republican \nbudget represent 20 to 25 percent in spending reductions over the next \n5 years.\n  Agriculture Secretary Glickman warns, and I quote, ``Cuts in spending \nof this magnitude could be especially burdensome on those farming areas \nthat specialize in the production of target price commodities and could \nreduce producer payments, incomes, and their ability to borrow.''\n  The Republican budget does not stop with these programs. It wraps its \nfingers around and squeezes the life from numerous programs vital to \nAmericans. The earned-income tax credit was high on their hit list. The \nEITC, as it is commonly called, is a refundable tax credit for working \nfamilies. It helps families get off and stay off welfare by boosting \nthe value of low-wage jobs.\n  While the conference report folds EITC changes into the overall \nsavings for welfare reform, the description suggests that the far more \ndraconian Senate-passed cuts are assured. If enacted, these provisions \nwould result in tax increases--that is right, Mr. President, tax \nincreases--for more than 14 million families. Families with two or more \nchildren would be the hardest hit, losing $305 in 1996 alone. More than \n72,000 Nebraska families will lose $110 million in benefits under this \nproposal over the next 7 years. They would experience an average tax \nincrease of $230 in 1996 alone. Families with two children would lose \n$290 in 1996.\n  Mr. President, do not tell me that there are no tax increases in the \nRepublican budget because they are there and they are real.\n  The Republicans are just as shortsighted about job training. The \nconference cut job training by 20 percent. That means that by the year \n2002, 1.3 million fewer disadvantaged youths will be able to \nparticipate in the summer jobs programs. That also means that nearly \n1.3 million fewer dislocated workers could be assisted in their efforts \nto return to productive employment.\n  Mr. President, let us look, too, at education. The Republican budget \nmakes scandalous cuts in one of the greatest investments our Nation can \nmake.\n  Let us start at the beginning with Head Start. Under the Republican \nbudget, preschool children from disadvantaged backgrounds could be \ndenied this critical service that prepares them to succeed in school.\n Even if Head Start was funded at the current level of the current law, \nover 350,000 children would be denied services over the next 7 years \nbecause the population of eligible children will continue to grow.\n\n  The same is true with title I, education for the disadvantaged. Under \nthe conference agreement, up to 2 million children from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds could be denied funding to help them improve basic math and \nreading skills. And that is even if title I programs were funded at the \ncurrent levels.\n  We have also heard a lot about the hit on student loans. The \nconference agreement assumes elimination of the in-school interest \nsubsidy for 500,000 graduates and professional students. This would \ncost an average graduate student between $3,000 and $6,600 more in \ninterest payments over the life of his or her loan.\n  However, do not for one second believe that this is the full extent \nof the cut. Eliminating this subsidy for graduate students does not \naccount for the full $10 billion cut required by the conference \nagreement. All students, including undergraduates, could be required to \npay hundreds of dollars more for loans in the form of higher upfront \nfees or loss of the grace period that currently prevents interest from \naccruing on loans until 6 months after graduation.\n  Under the conference agreement, the 3.7 million college students \nreceiving Pell grants--30,000 of them in Nebraska alone--could lose the \nvalue of these grants and see them cut dramatically. Even if Pell \ngrants were funded at current levels, their value would decrease by \nnearly 40 percent by the year 2002 simply because of inflation. And \nstudent population will continue to grow over this time. Nearly half of \nall of the Pell grant recipients have annual incomes of less than \n$10,000 a year. Fairness, Mr. President? I think not.\n  I also want to touch briefly on impacted aid. Under this Republican \nbudget, Nebraska school districts, with large amounts of Federal land \nwithin their boundaries, could see their operating budget shrink to \nunacceptable levels.\n  The level of funding for veterans programs and the cuts therein are \nan abomination. For example, the cut in VA medical funding will result \nin the cancellation of approximately 74 projects. These are projects \nwhich are needed for the VA to meet current community health care \ndelivery standards. Our veterans deserve better than this Republican \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I could go through this budget function by function \nand line by line and program by program and prove how it hurts ordinary \nAmericans and hurts them badly. That is what is often lost in these \nbudget debates--the human factor. We speak in baselines. We speak in \nacronyms. We do not speak in terms that put a face to the budget. And I \nhave been able to partially do that today in these remarks.\n  In conclusion, let me say that the face that is reflected in the \nRepublican budget is not one of mainstream America. It is not the face \nof our elderly. It is not the face of our children. It is not the face \nof our middle class or our veterans or our working poor. It is not the \nface of rural America. And as one from rural America, I can assure you \nbeyond any question that it is not the face of rural America.\n  The face reflected in this Republican budget is one for the \nprivileged few, the wealthiest among us who do not have to worry about \nMedicare or job training or college tuition loans or crop prices or the \nstate of care at the local Veterans Administration hospital. They are \nnot being asked to make the sacrifice.\n  The others are the ones that are being asked to make this sacrifice, \nall for the good of the wealthiest citizens of America. They are the \nones, the wealthiest, who will benefit most from this package with a \n$250 billion unfair tax cut. From the beginning of this budget process \nI have stated that the only way to balance the budget is through shared \nsacrifice. The only way to balance the budget is through \nbipartisanship. But for the past 6 months my Republican colleagues have \nworn blinders. They have seen only their core constituency. They have \nseen only their own party, which has veered dramatically to the right.\n  If the Republicans insist on maintaining their narrow version, they \ndo so at their own peril and the peril for mainstream America. The \nstage has been set for a confrontation between the Republican Congress \nand the Democratic White House. I have called it a train wreck. That is \nan apt description.\n  However, if the Republicans open their eyes, they will see there is \nan alternative, one that will get us to the same destination and \nwithout the chaos of a Government held hostage to politics.\n  That alternative is called bipartisanship. I tell my Republican \nfriends, meet us halfway, and we will create a budget that is not only \na balanced one, but represents the whole citizenry of this great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there has been an informal agreement \n\n\n[[Page S9241]]\nthat we could go next to Senator Kennedy. And, if acceptable, I would \nyield to him whatever time he might need. And then following that, it \nwould be two Republican Senators in a row, after the two Democrats, \nmyself and Senator Kennedy.\n  In furtherance of that agreement, and if there is no objection, I \nyield 15 minutes or such additional time as he might need to my friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to say at the \noutset how much all of us appreciate the good efforts of our friend and \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and Senator Exon in trying \nto help chart responsible expenditures for our national endeavors. And \nI want to thank, in particular, the Senator from Nebraska for an \nextraordinary statement. He clearly understands these issues in fiscal \nterms. But I think, most importantly, he understands them in human \nterms. This afternoon he explained very eloquently to the Senate and to \nthe American people the impact of these budget recommendations on the \nfamilies of our great country. And I want to build on his excellent \npresentation.\n  In looking at a budget, we have to consider the bottom line in terms \nof the expenditures, but we also have to consider what the real impact \non the families of this country is going to be. When we talk about \nhaving ``fair sacrifice'' and ``shared sacrifice,'' it is only fair to \ntry to review, in some detail, exactly where the belt-tightening is \ngoing to come. And when we look over, as the Senator from Nebraska has \npointed out, the total expenditures, we find out that it does come down \nparticularly hard on the working families of this country, and it comes \ndown particularly hard on the children of those working families, those \nthat go on to our fine State schools and colleges across the country \nand those that go into the schools that enhance students' academic \nachievement and accomplishments. In addition, the burden falls on the \nmen and women who have been a part of our great national economy and \nnational life over a period of many years and now are experiencing, and \nshould experience, the glories of old age with a degree of security in \nMedicare. Moreover, the burden falls on those who, out of necessity, \nare being attended to with the coverage of Medicaid.\n  Of the extraordinary cuts that we are going to be facing in the \nMedicaid program, two-thirds of the cuts are going to be from home care \nfor the very frail and the neediest, the poorest of Americans. SSI is \ncovered within that chunk, and the rest is in the coverage of some 18 \nmillion children. These are poor children. We are going to see \nsignificant cuts in the coverage of poor children. Half of those poor \nchildren have working parents. This gives us some idea of where the \nburdens are going to fall.\n  So it seems to me, Mr. President, as we review this budget, that \nthere is going to be a significant burden placed on the Medicare for \nelderly people who have built this country, sacrificed for their \nchildren, and made America the strong country that it is.\n  In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, there is also a slash in the \neducation programs that the Senator from Nebraska already discussed. \nThere will be a significant slash in college opportunities. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska talked about the reduction in assistance for graduate \nstudents who receive loans. These students are now able to defer those \nloans until they get out of graduate school. We call that the in-school \ninterest rate. The fact is, those who are going to the graduate schools \nwill pay for it, as well as those in the colleges.\n  Every family should know that students will not be able to defer \ncollege loan interest while they are still in school. This ought to be \na wake-up call for every family that is making $75,000 a year or less. \nEighty-eight percent of all of the college loan programs go to families \nthat are making $75,000 a year or less. Well, I have news about what \nthis means for your family. After 10 hours of debate on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, and after this legislation is passed, it is going to \nmean that your children, if they are fortunate enough to get a student \nloan, are going to pay one-third more--from $3,500 to $4,500 more--for \nthat student loan program. Obviously, the amount rises even higher in \nrelation to the size of the loan.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska also pointed out, there is a slash in \nwages for working families. There will be $21 billion in tax benefits \nfor tax expenditures over the next 7 years of this program. But, the \nmen and women who will have a tax increase are those individuals who \nare making $26,000 a year or less. That is why I think it is only fair, \nwhen we look at what this budget means, to do what the Senator from \nNebraska has done, to see who it is going to impact adversely.\n  There will be an adverse impact, as the Senator from Nebraska has \npointed out and the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, on working \nfamilies who are making $26,000 or less a year. We have news for you: \nYour taxes are going up. Taxes will not go up if you are in the very \nwealthy incomes of this country, but they are going up for working \nfamilies, and it is going to mean less in take-home pay for the worker.\n  It is not surprising to me, Mr. President, that this budget would \ncome out this way, because the Republicans have resisted any increase \nin the minimum wage to make work pay. They have failed to say to men \nand women who are prepared to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear, that you will not live in poverty, which has been an age-old \ncommitment since the late 1930's under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  We have opposition to increasing the minimum wage to make it a \nlivable one. We have an assault on the Davis-Bacon families who are \naveraging $27,000 a year to try to cut their wages. And now we have, on \nthe measure that is before us, the $21 billion burden in taxes that is \ngoing to be on the working families of this country. When we look over \nhere at this chart, we see that this proposal asks our seniors, the \nvery young, those going to college, the working families--all \nAmericans--if they are prepared to tighten their belts if they need to \nbecause we have a shared responsibility for our national interest that \nis what is called for in the name of our national interest. Why are we \ndoing it?\n  The answer is right over here on this chart. It is to pay for the \n$245 billion of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals in this \ncountry. This is what we are asking workers: ``Tighten your belts.''\n  This is what we are saying to those who want to go to college--the 88 \npercent of those who get student assistance who come from families \nmaking $75,000 a year or less: ``You are going to have your belt \ntightened; you are going to pay anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 more \nover the life of your indebtedness.'' We are going to undermine higher \neducation programs.\n  We are saying to families that we are going to penalize 350,000 to \n500,000 young children who will not be able to go to a Head Start \nProgram. We are going to exclude the 2 million American children who \notherwise would qualify for programs that assist the economically \ndistressed under the Title I program. We are going to slash the School-\nto-Work Program that was enacted and had strong bipartisan support in \nthe Congress last year.\n  Finally, we are saying to our senior citizens over the period of \nthese next 7 years, ``You are going to pay a cumulative total of some \n$3,200 out-of-pocket more with this Republican budget,'' if we are \ngoing to have shared cuts in Medicare between the provider and between \nthe beneficiary. If you are a family on Social Security and retired, \nyou will pay a cumulative total of $6,400. The average income for those \nfamilies is only about $17,000.\n  Make no mistake about it, we will hear a lot of talk about a billion \ndollars here and a billion dollars there. What I am talking about here \nis who it is going to hit. For what? To pay for these tax cuts for the \nrich.\n  Finally, I would have thought--I am about to yield to my friend from \nMaryland--at least out of a sense of some decency, that the Budget \nCommittee would have come returned to the floor and said, ``I know we \nhave voted on the billionaires tax cut.'' What is the billionaires tax \ncut? It is the provision that exists in the IRS that says, effectively, \nthat if you have made hundreds of millions of dollars over the past \nyears, you renounce your citizenship, \n\n[[Page S9242]]\ntake citizenship overseas, and say, ``Goodbye, America,'' and become a \nmodern-day Benedict Arnold, you can take all of your accumulations of \nwealth and not pay any taxes. That is wrong.\n  We have already overwhelmingly voted on that issue. I would have \nthought that the Budget Committee, returning from conference would have \nsaid--and the House has gone on record on this--we are serious enough \nto indicate we are going to close that loophole, so that we are not \ngoing to have so many cuts in Medicare, education, or wages for working \nfamilies. But it is not in there, I say to my friends. All that stands \nin there are the provisions which will provide some $245 billion for \ntax benefits that will go to the wealthiest individuals.\n  If you read, as I am sure the Senator from Maryland has, the Senate \nbudget closely, you will notice that a measure passed the Senate that \nsaid that 90 percent of any tax would go to working families under \n$100,000 a year. I do not know whether the Senator from Maryland \nnoticed, in reading through the budget, but the conference eliminated \nthe $100,000--eliminated the $100,000. We know what is going on. We \nknow who they want to benefit. It is the wealthiest individuals.\n  Why? When the Senate passes something so overwhelmingly that says \nthat 90 percent of the tax benefits is going to go to those working \nfamilies that earn under $100,000, and it comes back from conference \nsaying it will go to working families, but they take off the $100,000, \nwhat does that say? I can tell you what it says to this Senator. It \nsays, ``You are right; when we get our chance to cut the $245 billion, \nwho is going to get it? It is going to pay for the tax cuts for the \nrich.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is what this is about. That is basically what we \nare talking about in these 10 hours prior to the time the Senate is \ngoing to vote, and it is going to be something that every family in \nthis country should pay attention to.\n  They should pay attention today. They should pay attention tomorrow. \nThey should pay attention to when these measures are put before the \nCongress in real terms, in terms of the cuts on appropriations and in \nterms of reflecting the budgets over the period of these next several \nweeks. If the American people want us to go on that path, then they \nshould be urging all of us to vote ``yes.''\n  However, if the American people say, ``Hey, wait a minute, wait a \nminute, wait a minute. Cuts in education, cuts in our Medicare, raising \nthe taxes for working people--for tax cuts for the wealthiest \nindividuals? That is not what last fall was about.'' It certainly was \nnot about that in my State of Massachusetts, and it was not about that \nin the State of Maryland. Maybe it was in some other part of this \ncountry. But that is not what the people of my State elected me to see \ndone--cutting education, cutting college opportunities, cutting wages \nfor working families, and slamming it to the retirees so that we can \nget tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.\n  (Mr. FAIRCLOTH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield for a question, I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts--because I know that there will be an effort \nto defend this budget resolution on the basis that it is going to \nbalance the budget over a 7-year period--if they did not provide $245 \nbillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, is it not the case that we could \nreduce the slashes in these programs by $245 billion and still have a \nbalanced budget?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. In real terms, it \nwould say to those 18 million children--effectively a quarter of all of \nthe children in this country that are covered by the Medicaid Program--\nand, it would say to the 5 to 7 million of those that are going to lose \nany kind of coverage under this Medicaid cut, that you still will have \nsome coverage. What it would say to those children, half of whom are \nthe sons and daughters of working families that are trying to make it \nin the United States of America, is that they would not lose their \ncoverage. And what it would say to the frailest senior citizens, the \nones absolutely dependent upon the Medicaid Program in so many \ninstances, that they will receive assistance, and so forth. The Senator \nis correct. If we could take that $245 billion and say that we are not \ngoing to have those kinds of cuts in the Medicaid Program, we would say \nto those seniors and to those children that they are important and we \nare not going to balance the budget by cutting support for their \nsignificant needs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further. This is an extremely \nimportant point. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the very \neffective way in which he has made the point. People must understand \nthat the very deep cuts in these programs that are so important to \nthem--Medicare for our senior citizens, educational assistance in order \nto send our young people to college, and the earned income tax credit \nfor working families--that these very deep cuts being made in those \nprograms in this budget resolution are not solely in order to balance \nthe budget. Those deep cuts are being made in order to provide $245 \nbillion that will be given in tax cuts for the people at the top end of \nthe income scale.\n  There is a direct connection between the Senator's two charts, and it \nmust be understood. A senior citizen must understand that the Medicare \ncuts to which they are going to be subjected are much more severe and \nmuch deeper in order to create a pot of money with which to give a tax \ncut to the very people at the top end of the income scale. This is a \nvery important point because senior citizens are going to be told that \nthis is necessary in order to balance the budget, and balancing the \nbudget is a good thing for them. But cuts of this magnitude are not \nnecessary to balance the budget.\n  So the issue that is posed by this budget resolution is the simple \nquestion: Is it more important for America that people with six-figure \nincomes, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, should get a tax cut and a \nsenior citizen should suffer a reduction in their Medicare benefits? Is \nit more important to give a tax break to those at the very top of the \nincome scale and deny a young person the opportunity to go to college? \nThat is the question that is being framed by the priorities that are \noutlined in this budget resolution. These deep cuts are not being made \nto balance the budget; $245 billion of those deep cuts are not to \nbalance the budget; they are to give a tax break to the wealthiest \npeople in the country.\n  I defy anyone to explain to me the fairness and the rationale of \ndoing that. As the Senator from Massachusetts has so eloquently stated, \nyou are going to have young people wanting to go to college who are \ngoing to find doing so much more difficult because of this resolution. \nI ask the Senator, has the forgiveness of interest on the money people \nborrow to go to college while they are in school been eliminated by \nthis budget resolution?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, effectively, it will mean that the in-school \ninterest which was deferred until after college and after graduate \nschool, that provision will effectively be wiped out. You recover \napproximately $3 billion to recover the in-school interest for graduate \nstudents. Under the mandate in the Republican budget, the only way you \ncan make the other money up is to require those young people, the day \nafter they get that loan, when they are going to school, to start off \nrepaying it immediately.\n  Let me comment about that and I will yield further. The fact of the \nmatter is that a year ago, even 2 years ago, when we were considering \nthe direct loan program in higher education, our Republican friends \nasked us over here on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, ``After \nthe graduation date, should we not give the students 6 months to be \nable to find a job so they do not take that first job just to pay back \nloans?'' It did make sense, and we had a strong bipartisan coalition in \nsupport of it. We overwhelmingly passed an amendment to give the \ncollege student or graduate student a very short period of time, 6 to 9 \nmonths to get that first job, deferring payment of loans during that \ntime. And it made sense from an actuarial point of view. You are \ndemonstrating, when that young person has the 6 to 9 months, by and \nlarge they get a better job and it is easier to pay back the loans. \nThat is \n\n[[Page S9243]]\nthe history of the payback of the student loan program. So, now we are \ngoing in just the opposite direction.\n  Our Republican colleagues persist in suggesting that this budget \neliminates the in-school interest subsidy for graduate students only. \nBut the numbers do not add up. This budget requires savings of $10.8 \nbillion over 7 years from student loan accounts.\n  But eliminating the in-school interest subsidy for graduate students \nsaves only $3 billion over 7 years, according to the official CBO \nnumbers that govern this budget. That leaves the budget $7 billion \nshort in the student loan accounts alone.\n  Where will that $7 billion come from in this Republican budget? It \nwill come from the nation's students one way or another. Either the \nRepublicans will eliminate the in-school interest subsidy for \nundergraduates as well as graduates. That would save the required $10 \nbillion. Or students will be asked to give up the other benefits that \nwe have fought to secure for them--on a bipartisan basis--over the last \n5 years. They will no longer have the 6-month grace period in which to \nfind a job before they have to start paying back loans. That would save \n$3 billion. Or they will face higher up-front loan fees and interest \nrates. That would save another $3\\1/2\\ billion.\n  The bottom line is that this budget assumes a $10 billion cut in \nstudent loan accounts, and the graduate student subsidy accounts for \nless than one third of that amount. It is bad enough that the \nRepublicans have designed a budget that taxes students to pay for tax \ncuts for the rich. It's worse that they insist on hiding the ball about \nthe true impact of these cuts on the Nation's students.\n  It is important to note also that the student loan cuts are only a \nportion of the total education cuts contained in this misguided budget. \nThis Republican budget contains the largest education cuts in U.S. \nhistory. It eliminates one-third of the Federal investment in education \nby the year 2002, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. The \nspecific cuts are as follows:\n\n\n                              COLLEGE AID\n\n  Cuts $30 billion in Federal aid to college students over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Half of all college students receive Federal financial aid.\n  Seventy-five percent of all student aid comes from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Increases personal debt for students with subsidized loans by 20 to \n48 percent by eliminating the in-school interest subsidy.\n  Affects up to 4 million students a year.\n  Undergraduate students who borrow the maximum of $17,125 will pay an \nextra $4,920.\n  Reduces Pell grants for individual students by 40 percent by the year \n2002, or terminates Pell grants altogether for over 1 million students \nper year, even assuming a freeze at 1995 levels.\n  Could increase up-front student loan fees by 25 percent, raise \ninterest rates on student loans, or eliminate the grace period for \nstudents to defer payment on loans after graduation.\n\n\n                               SCHOOL AID\n\n  Elementary and Secondary Education Act: Cuts funding for improving \nmath and reading skills to 2 million children; reduces funding for \n60,000 schools.\n  Safe and drug free schools and communities: Cuts over $1 billion in \nantidrug and antiviolence programs serving 39 million students in 94 \npercent of the Nation's school districts.\n  Head Start: Denies preschool education to between 350,000 and 550,000 \nchildren.\n  Special education: Eliminates $5 billion in Federal support for \nspecial education services for 5.5 million students with disabilities.\n  Goals 2000: Denies assistance to 47 States and more than 3000 school \ndistricts helping students to achieve higher education standards.\n  School-to-work: Cuts $5.3 billion from initiatives to improve job \nskills for up to 12 million students through local partnerships of \nbusinesses, schools, and community colleges.\n  Technology: Eliminates Federal initiatives to develop and provide \neducational technology for the classroom through collaboration with \nprivate funders.\n  Now, that you have heard the facts, I would like to ask the Senator a \nquestion as to whether or not he would agree with me. We will hear \nthese eloquent statements about how this glidepath for the country is \nmoving us toward a balanced budget and that it is necessary for these \ncollege students to pay 30 percent more on their student loans, see a \nfurther reduction in the value of the Pell grants which go to the \nneediest children--a 40-percent reduction in that program over the life \nof this budget. We are going to see the indebtedness of the young \npeople of this country increase dramatically.\n  Would the Senator from Maryland tell me how he would be able to \nconvince the students in the State of Maryland who get a student loan \nprogram, how he would be able to convince them and say that what we are \ndoing to you is increasing your indebtedness so we will have a balanced \nbudget so that your future would be better off? Is there any logic to \nthat rationale? I do not see it.\n  I do not see how we say to the young people, going back to the point \nof the Senator from Maryland, that we are taking the savings and \nputting it toward a tax cut for the rich. We are trying to say to the \nyoung people going to schools and colleges, ``Pass this and your future \nwill be more secure.'' Someone better tell the college students they \nwill pay 30 percent more for their loans. And the value of their Pell \ngrant will be 40 percent less, meaning they have to borrow more. How \nare they better?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Some of them will not get an education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The fact is some are on the edge now, and they need the \nforgiveness of the interest while they are in school in order to be \nable to pay their tuition.\n  What we have done now is knocked some students out of even getting an \neducation. The ones who are able to go on will assume an even heavier \nburden.\n  I know an argument that will be made. They will say to the young \npeople, ``We will be reducing the deficit over time and that is a \ndesirable thing for you.'' I will not quarrel with that.\n  The fact of the matter is that these programs are being cut an \nadditional one-quarter of $1 trillion, $250 billion, in order to give \ntax cuts to the people at the top end of the income scale.\n  If we did not do that, if we did not give the tax cuts, we would have \n$250 billion with which we could ease the deep cuts that are being made \nin these programs. Our young people would have a much greater chance to \nget an education.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is not the loan program we are \ntalking about, the Stafford loan program--is that what it is called?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, named after one of the very important education \nleaders from the State of Vermont, who happened to be a Republican.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A Republican; just to prove the point that in the past \nthere was very strong bipartisan support for this program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  I think it is important for these families to understand something \nelse. That is, what has been happening in the States. So often around \nhere we say we can cut student loans because the States will make up \nthe difference. I can say that the cost of tuition in my own State of \nMassachusetts--for our State schools and colleges--has the second-\nhighest tuition rates of any State in the country, if we include the \ntuition and fees. Of course, there are different ways of calculating \nit.\n  When we talk about what a family is paying out, what both the \nstudents and their parents are having to do, we have seen a significant \nreduction, over $350 million less, in State appropriations in support \nour higher education system. I daresay that has been happening in many, \nmany States.\n  It is important for families that care about the education of their \nyoung to recognize that when we do this today there is not any \nindication--maybe in some States, but by and large, the past record is \nnot encouraging--that States will be making up the difference and \nassisting those needy students.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Maryland a question. I can remember not \nlong ago, probably in the last 8 or 9 years, when the tuition for the \nUniversity of Massachusetts in Boston was \n\n[[Page S9244]]\n$800. They raised it to $950. About 12 percent of all the student \napplications went down with that $150 increase. This happened because \n85 percent of the students that go to University of Massachusetts in \nBoston had parents that never went to college and 85 percent of the \nstudents that went there already worked 25 hours a week or more.\n  These are kids trying to get an education. Hard working, recognizing \nthe importance of education being their opportunity--150 bucks makes a \nbig difference--and we are talking to these students about hundreds, \nthousands of dollars of increased indebtedness to them.\n  We are talking about what happens in those schools and colleges--I \nknow that the Senator from Maryland pays attention to what happens in \nhis State and education policy there, generally--but does the Senator \nnot agree with me that $200 or $300 increases in tuition is big money?\n  When we ask the families to take on indebtedness, when they are \npaying a mortgage, and when we force them to pay for other things--for \nexample, in the greater Boston area we have seen dramatic increases in \nthe water rate to pay for unfunded Federal programs to help clean up \nthe clean water --the families turn to us and say, ``Look, we have had \nit up to here. What are you doing to us? Why are you cutting back in \nterms of our children's future, our family's future.'' I wonder whether \nthe Senator from Maryland does not find similar stories in his own \nState.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator, we \nare experiencing exactly the same problem in Maryland. The Governor of \nmy State has indicated clearly that there is no way that the State can \ncompensate for these cuts. So the cuts will actually fall on our young \npeople who are trying to get an education.\n  The critical question before the Senate is, when we balance the \nbudget, how will we go about doing it? What priorities are we going to \nset? Who will feel the impact of the affect of this balancing effort?\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out very clearly in his \nchart, this plan cuts education, it cuts Medicare, it cuts nutrition \nprograms, it slashes important investments in our Nation's future, it \nraises taxes on working people by the impact on the earned income tax \ncredit. So the children, the elderly, and working families, are asked \nto bear the brunt of this deficit reduction. And then the conference \nagreement provides for large tax decreases for the very wealthy.\n  We must put those two things together. In effect, what is happening \nin this resolution is we are slashing all these programs for people who \nneed them, in order to give a large tax break to the wealthy--not in \norder to balance the budget. If we did not give the large tax break, we \nwould have $250 billion less in these severe cuts, and the budget would \nstill be balanced.\n  It is not a matter of balancing the budget. It is a matter of \nslashing these important programs, in order to give large tax cuts to \nthe very wealthy.\n  I defy anyone with any reasonable sense of priorities to tell me why \nsomeone making $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a year, should get a tax \ncut, and a young person trying to get to college should now have to pay \ninterest on their college loan while they are in school and not \nworking. Or why a very wealthy person should get a tax cut, and a \nsenior citizen on Medicare who is fighting to find the means to provide \nfor their health care needs is going to experience a decrease in their \nmedical services. That is the sense of priorities that is contained in \nthis concurrent resolution, which has been made far worse in the \nconference than when it left the Senate. The budget was bad enough when \nit left the Senate. Now it has been made worse. The cuts in the student \nloans have been doubled in the conference.\n  This sense of priorities that is in this budget resolution is a \ndisaster for America.\n  I very much hope it will be rejected.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say finally, because the hour has moved \non and there are others who wish to speak, the final bottom line of \nwhat the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, it is not just older \npeople, it is not just students, it is not just some workers, it is \nAmerica's working families.\n  This all comes together. It all comes together for working families. \nIt is their children that are going to be paying more out for the \nloans. It is their parents who are going to be paying out more for \ntheir copayments, deductibles, and for other payments that Medicare \nwill not cover.\n  It is their families, their immediate families, that will find their \ntaxes rising higher, if they are making less than $26,000, than they \notherwise would have. It is their schools that will not get those \nincentive grants to enhance their academic achievement. It is their \nchildren in those schools that will be denied the violence and drug \nabuse prevention programs, to try to help those young people resist the \nappeals of violence and substance abuse.\n  This is what this issue is really about. This Republican budget is \nhistoric indeed. It is an historic attack on American working families, \nsenior citizens, children, families, and veterans, brought to us by the \nsame Republican Party whose policies created the huge budget deficits \nof the 1980's.\n  The Republican budget takes the bad bill passed by the Senate and \nmakes it worse: Greater tax breaks for the rich, deeper cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid, even heavier burdens for families struggling to \neducate their children. Americans will be paying a higher price for the \nimpact of this budget well into the next century if these harsh cuts \never actually become law.\n  But, these cuts will not become law if Democrats have anything to say \nabout it. The Republican budget deal being rammed through Congress is \nveto bait. It is even worse than the misguided version passed earlier \nby the Senate. Splitting the difference between the extreme Senate \nversion and the even more extreme House version is a hold-your-nose \ncompromise that is beginning to smell already. The Medicare cuts are \nextreme by any standard. These cuts are far deeper than any cuts that \ncould conceivably be justified by any need to keep Medicare solvent. \nThe Republican argument on the insolvency of Medicare is a sham.\n  Mr. President, I hope this measure will not be accepted. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from the \nState of Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized by the manager on this \nside to yield myself such time as I may take. I point out the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, under the previous order, is the next to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. President, do you remember that wonderful phrase that a few years \nago was turned into the title of a movie, ``Only In America,'' an \nexpression of awe and wonder? Mr. President, I think we have to \nrephrase it as a question of stunned disbelief. Only among Democrats, \nonly among the few left on that side of the aisle who, as liberals, \nworship at the shrine of an ever-increasing Government, only among \nthose who debate against this budget resolution is a $300-billion-plus \nincrease in what this country will spend on Medicare described not as a \ncut but a slash.\n  Mr. President, if this budget resolution passes, not only will we \npreserve a Medicare system which otherwise will go bankrupt, we will \nspend more than $300 billion in increased Government support of \nMedicare in the next 7 years. Yet these last two Senators speak of cuts \nand slashes, deserting of our commitments.\n  The increase in Medicaid during that period of time will be almost \nhalf as much. It is also described as a cut, as a slash. Only among \nliberal Democrats, Mr. President, only among liberal Democrats is a \nmodest reduction in a check coming to an individual from the Government \ndescribed as a tax increase. But that is the way we mistranslate for \nthe American people. If your welfare payment goes down, that is a tax \nhike by their description. Only among Democrats, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, they are right about this. This is perhaps the most \nsignificant budget resolution to be passed by the Congress of the \nUnited States since we instituted the concept of budget resolutions. \nWhy? Because this is the first one that gives a real and enforceable \npromise that the budget will be balanced. It is the goal of this \nprocess to end the time, the decades during which Members of Congress \nspend the people's money and send the bills to their children and to \ntheir grandchildren. That is not a policy for our \n\n[[Page S9245]]\nfuture, for those children and for those grandchildren. We propose to \nend that era.\n  Why? Because borrowing, year after year, $200 billion more than we \ncan repay, eats into our ability to invest in our own future. It drives \nup interest rates and drives up job opportunities for the very people \nour opponents, in defending the status quo and defending those \ndeficits, claim to be supporting but are actually oppressing. Even the \npromise in this budget resolution, if appropriately enforced, gives us \na dividend of $170 billion for the public sector in lower interest \nrates on the debt we have, and in increased tax collections from a more \nvibrant economy which has created more jobs. And it gives far more than \nthat to the people whom we are here to serve.\n  Granted, on the part of the manager of this bill for the Democrats \nand some of his colleagues, there is lip service given to the idea of a \nbalanced budget, someday, long in the future--but not now and not in \nthis way. Always in some different way.\n  The President of the United States, when he was a candidate, told us \nhe would pass a balanced budget. He claimed 2 years ago to have reduced \nour budget deficit which he did almost entirely by increasing taxes on \nthe American people and then is surprised this year when the tax bill \ncomes due and at the very time it comes due, because money is taken out \nof our pockets, we have a pause, a dip in our own economy--a possible \nrecession caused by those tax increases.\n  Earlier this year, the President was not interested in a balanced \nbudget at all. More recently, he has come to feel it is appropriate. \nBut not now and not in this way and not with valid figures.\n  We say it is time. The time is now and this is the way. Some of us \nwill say, as we often do in many bills here: This bill is not perfect, \nbut it is the best we can come up with. Mr. President, I guess I do not \nthink it is perfect. It is not exactly what I would have written or the \ndirection I would have gone. But that is absolutely irrelevant. There \nare 100 of us here in this body, each with a different point of view, \nand none of us with an absolute certainty as to what perfection is. But \nwhat this is is the reaching toward a goal. Perfection is not our goal, \na balanced budget is. This budget will lead us to that point and in \ndoing so, will allow more money to remain in the pockets of the \nAmerican people, will create more jobs for them, will lower the \ninterest rates on their homes and, not at all incidentally, lower the \ninterest rates on those student loans we have heard so much about--\nundoubtedly by considerably more than whatever the changes in those \nloan policies may well be. A balanced budget is a concrete goal. A \nbalanced budget is what we will reach if we pass and enforce this \nbudget resolution.\n  In doing so, yes, Mr. President, we will lower taxes on the American \npeople. Only over there on that side of the aisle, Mr. President, is a \n$500 family tax credit for any person who makes enough money to pay \n$500 in income taxes described as a tax break for the rich. Only over \nthere is someone who pays any income tax at all and gets a break under \nthis proposal--rich.\n  The people whom we serve will be surprised to learn how many of the \nwealthy there are who presumably are on the dole of these tax \nreductions. And I guess, Mr. President, that is the single worst \nelement of this proposal from the point of view of those who love the \nstatus quo and love the Government we have today. The thought that an \nAmerican--any American--might possibly be allowed to keep any \nadditional amount of what they earn is the worst possible policy from \ntheir point of view because they believe the Government ought to be \nspending that money, and we do not. That is the difference between us.\n  Mr. President, this is a budget resolution that will build America. \nAnd this is a budget resolution which I must say is a tribute to the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nNew Mexico's inestimable gift to the U.S. Senate, my friend, the friend \nof the Presiding Officer, who, with a tremendous commitment to the \nfuture of this country and a patience which I know that I could not \nmatch and a willingness to listen to different points of view, both \nreasonable and unreasonable but never abandoning the goal of a better \nAmerica, an America which stops sending its bills to its future, has \nled us to a budget resolution which will reach that goal.\n  I want to say in conclusion, Mr. President, that I hope this budget \nresolution passes with a large majority. But large or small, it will \nmake for a better country, and its passage will be a magnificent \ntribute to its author, the senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Gregg is going to \nfollow with his remarks for as long as he wants to and then we have \nanother Senator on our side ready. We will go back and forth. I will \nhave to leave the floor for a little while.\n  I say to Senator Gorton, let me just thank you for those remarks. I \nappreciate them. I want to say frankly to the U.S. Senate, while \neveryone will be here to participate in this victory, that our system \nputs a special burden and a special responsibility on committees. And \nevery now and then a committee has an opportunity to do something very, \nvery sensational, or fall back into a quagmire of making excuses, or \nlet us do it like we have always done it. But this Budget Committee is \nmade up of a group of veterans and a group of newcomers, two of whom \nare on the floor, Senator Gorton is here, and Senator Gregg is here. \nThey did an excellent job. I mean they did not flinch. They voted for \ntough, tough things because they had a goal and they wanted to achieve \nit.\n  I want to thank Senator Gorton for his participation, as well as all \nthe other members.\n  Let me say to Senator Gregg that I asked him early on to head a task \nforce on the toughest part of this budget. How do we fix in some \nmeaningful way the rampant growth of entitlements led by the two health \ncare programs, but not exclusively. And he worked for well over 2 \nmonths with exciting ideas, and difficult challenges. You came up with \nsome very, very rational reasons, and we followed them ever since.\n  So I thank him for that. I am sure the Senate looks forward to his \nremarks. He has a wonderful way of showing what reality is instead of \nletting those who would be against everything show it their way. I hope \nthe Senate and the people pay attention to his analysis today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his very generous comments, and join the Senator from \nWashington in exalting the efforts of the Senator from New Mexico who \nhas for the first time in 25 years been able to put this country on the \nright track. Passing a balanced budget resolution is an amazing event. \nBut, more importantly than that--and I know that this is what the \nSenator from New Mexico has kept his energies focused on in this area, \nand has kept us all focused on the goal--it is a great gift to our \nchildren and to the next generation. The Senator from New Mexico has a \nfew, and also has a few grandchildren.\n  It was because of his concern about their future and the fact that he \nhas been for many years fighting the battle of making sure that we do \nnot pass on to our children and our grandchildren a Nation which is \nbankrupt, that he has kept this committee and this Congress focused on \nthe end line. The end line is to produce a budget which gets to \nbalance, and as a result reduces the burden of debt which we are \npassing on to our children.\n  So, once we pass this budget--which I am sure we will--and once we \ninstitute its recommendations, it will be a tremendous gift, which \nreally will have been because of the author of and the wrapper of, and \nwhich we will be passing on to our children as a result of his efforts. \nI thank the Senator from New Mexico for having given us all this \nleadership in this area.\n  I also would like to pick up on a comment that was made by the \nSenator from Washington because he is a pretty astute observer of this. \nHe sort of alluded to the fact that we just heard a presentation from \nthe Senator from Massachussetts and the Senator from \n\n[[Page S9246]]\nMaryland which essentially said, if you would argue it properly, they \nwere presenting the philosophy of the liberal approach to Government, \nsort of the philosophers of the left, so to say. It is their belief \nthat Government must always grow and must always expand.\n  I think their real outrage comes from the fact that we are \ncontracting the size of Government. We are saying that really it cannot \nbe allowed to constantly grow and expand beyond the ability to pay for \nit. And that as we contract the size of Government we are going to \nreturn some of the benefit of the contraction in the size of \nGovernment, or at least its rate of growth--we are never going to \nactually downsize it, but the rate of growth--return some of the \nbenefit of that to the people through a tax break. It is sort of like \nprying money out of the hand of someone who is at the door of death, \nthe liberal philosophy being at the door of death in my opinion, to try \nto get them to give any money back to the American people through tax \ncuts.\n  That is what we are proposing. Think about it in the context of what \nthese tax cuts are. They represent two-tenths of 1 percent of the total \nspending that the Federal Government will undertake over the 7-year \nperiod. We are going to spend $12 trillion over the next 7 years. We \nare talking about cutting taxes $245 billion. Yet, you would think that \nwe were exercising a scorched earth policy against the actions of the \nGovernment by instituting that sort of really rather minuscule return \nto the American people of their benefit. Is this going to flow to the \nwealthy in America? First off, the resolution says it is not. The \nresolution says the tax cuts shall flow to the working people of \nAmerica. And that is pretty obvious.\n  We are talking about primarily the biggest tax cut being a benefit \nfor the working families, people with kids; a $500 tax credit to people \nwith kids. Now, sure, a lot of wealthy Americans have kids. A lot of \nmiddle-class Americans have kids. A lot of lower-income Americans have \nkids. I suspect if you were to line all those kids up and put them on a \nscale, you would find that the number of kids of the middle class and \nworking Americans far exceed by a factor of millions, I suspect, the \nnumber of kids of the wealthy Americans.\n  So, by definition, the vast majority of this tax cut is going to flow \nto just plain working American families that have children. That is \nwhere it is going. And is it such an outrage to take two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the spending that is going to occur over the next 7 years \nand say we are going to rebate it to you, the American people? Well, it \nis, if you are a liberal, because, basically, if you are a liberal, you \nbelieve you own that money, and you should not give it up. We own it, \nif you look at it from a liberal prospective.\n We should design the programs to tell you how to run your family.\n\n  Well, what we are saying is let us let the American people have the \nmoney and manage their own families a little bit, have a little bit \nmore money to manage their own families rather than have the Federal \nGovernment tell them how to run their families and how the money will \nbe spent. This whole tax cut issue is really a lot of smoke from the \nother side both on substance and I think on policy also.\n  I wanted to focus a little bit today on some other issues because we \nhave heard a lot about how we are slashing and cutting Medicare and \nMedicaid and we are raising defense spending, and I have not heard too \nmany numbers that have defended that in real terms because they cannot, \nif you look at the numbers.\n  The fact is that if you take a freeze baseline--I think that is the \nonly way to do it honestly--you say what are we spending today on \nMedicare; what are we spending today on Medicaid; what are we spending \ntoday on defense. Let us say it was $100 today. Two years from now, are \nwe going to be spending $102 on these programs, or are we going to be \nspending $98 on these programs?\n  That is an honest way of evaluating whether or not spending is going \nup or coming down. None of this current services baseline, none of this \nassumption baseline. It is what you actually take out and put on the \ntable in the way of dollars for these programs. That is what counts for \nwhether or not it goes up or it goes down.\n  If you look at those numbers--like everybody else in this \ninstitution, I only function now with charts--you will see that over \nthe 7-year period, Medicare spending, off the current baseline of a \nfreeze, which would be $176 billion, goes up $349 billion. That is new \ndollars that we will be spending on Medicare over the next 7 years over \nwhat is being spent this year.\n  Medicaid spending under this budget goes up $149 billion over the \nnext 7 years over what we are spending this year. Defense spending goes \ndown--this number happens to be wrong; it has been reestimated--$13 \nbillion over the 7-year period.\n  So this representation that we are somehow slashing Medicare, \nslashing Medicaid, in order to raise defense spending is absolutely \nfalse. There is no other word for it. It is false. The fact is Medicare \nand Medicaid spending are going up, and this chart shows it in a bar \ngraph. This is how much Medicare spending goes up. This is how much \nMedicaid spending goes up. And as you can see, it is a very sizable \nportion. Medicare spending is going up almost--well, better than twice \nMedicaid spending, but Medicaid spending is going up better than 149 \ntimes what defense spending is going up because defense spending is not \ngoing up; it is going down. And so let us have a little integrity \naround here when we start talking these numbers.\n  Some other numbers that I think are important are how these spending \nfactors that we undertake over the next 7 years relate to the past 7 \nyears, because we have heard a lot about how we are cutting Medicare, \nwe are cutting Medicaid, and we are increasing defense.\n  Well, if you look at it in relationship to the last 7 years, defense \nspending was $2.02 trillion over the last 7 years. Over the next 7 \nyears, it is going to be $1.88 trillion. We will spend less on defense \nover the next 7 years than we spent on defense in the prior 7 years.\n  Remember, there is no adjustment for inflation in here. That means \ndefense is going down in hard dollars. It means defense is going down, \nif you look at it in inflationary dollars, even more. So defense is \ngoing down in comparison to the last 7 years.\n  If you look at Medicaid spending and compare it to the last 7 years, \nover the last 7 years we spent $445 billion in Medicaid. Over the next \n7 years we are going to spend $772 billion on Medicaid, almost twice \nthe amount of money we spent in the last 7 years. So we are \ndramatically increasing the amount we are spending on Medicaid.\n  If you look at Medicare, Medicare spending over the last 7 years was \n$923 billion. If you look at it over the next 7 years, we are going to \nspend $1.6 trillion or 73 percent more than we spent in the prior 7-\nyear period.\n  How can you define that as a cut? There must be some new math that I \ndid not learn when I was in school that you get if you go to certain \nschools in this country which could define an increase of 73 percent as \na cut. Not only is it not a cut, it is a substantial increase.\n  Why are we doing this in the Medicare accounts? I think we have to \nunderstand that this budget resolution accomplishes a couple of very \nsignificant public policy events.\n  No. 1, of course, is it balances the budget for the first time in 25 \nyears, which is absolutely critical to our children. We hear a lot of \ntalk about children and concern for the children. I do not think there \nis any question that everybody in this institution is genuinely \nconcerned about our children and their future and how we address them. \nBut I cannot think of a single thing that is more important relative to \nour children's future than to be able to give them the opportunity to \nhave a prosperous lifestyle. And whether or not you have a prosperous \nlifestyle depends on how much debt you have to pay.\n  It works that way in your home. If you run up a big debt and you have \nto pay it off, you are basically going to have a lot of trouble doing \nthat. You are going to have to work hard, and you are probably going to \nwork longer hours and you are probably going to find that you are able \nto keep less because you are paying off a big debt. This country is \npassing a big debt on to its kids, and unless we get this budget under \ncontrol, it will get a lot bigger. \n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\n  So the most significant thing this resolution does is it improves the \nopportunity for our children to have a decent and prosperous lifestyle, \nand that, I believe, is the largest gift of all, as I said earlier, and \nwill far outweigh some of the negatives that were alleged will occur \nfrom the other side, which I do not agree to anyway. But even if you \naccepted them on face value, they are far outweighed by the positive of \nbalancing this budget for our children's future.\n  Second, what this budget does is that, in driving this Government to \nbe fiscally responsible and managed in a way that we can afford it, we \nare taking a hard look at all the major programs that are in this \ninstitution. And a lot of them were created with good intentions, but \nthey have not worked. The classic example, of course, is welfare. No \nprogram has had a more disastrous track record than welfare considering \nthe amount of money that has been spent on it. I am sure there are more \ndisastrous programs, but in relationship to the amount of dollars spent \non it, it would be hard to find.\n  The fact is what this budget does is assumes that we are going to \ntake the welfare system and improve it substantially, basically by \nputting it back in the control of the States that have the imagination \nand flexibility and the originality to create new and aggressive \nprograms, and the Governors are excited about the opportunity. I can \ntell you, as a former Governor, they will deliver a heck of a lot more \ndollars to the recipients that need it by having flexibility than by \nhaving a huge bureaucracy on their back. So we are going to reorganize \nwelfare.\n  We are also going to take a hard look at the other entitlement \nprograms, all of them, but the one entitlement program that needs the \nmost scrutiny because it is the most sensitive and it is the most \ncritical right now is Medicare, because the trustees of the Medicare \ntrust fund--and this is not a Republican group; in fact, four of the \nsix trustees are members of this administration, including the \nSecretary of HHS and the Secretary of the Treasury--the trustees of the \nMedicare trust fund have said that if something is not done to correct \nthe fundamental financial situation or imbalance of the trust fund, it \nwill go bankrupt in the year 2002.\n  This is a chart that reflects that. This is where we are today, and \nthis is where it goes--bankruptcy in 2002 for the trust fund.\n  What are the practical implications of that? The practical \nimplications are that there will be no insurance program for seniors in \nthe year 2002. And so what does this budget proposal put forward? It \nputs forward ways in which we can effectively address that issue and \nbring under control the rate of growth of the Medicare trust fund so \nthat we can afford it, and so that it will exist and work well for our \nseniors.\n  It does not assume that seniors will get less care. It actually \nassumes that seniors will get more care. They will get more care \nbecause we will give them more options; we will give them more choices. \nAnd in the process, we will, hopefully, move them from a fee-for-\nservice system into fixed-cost systems which can deliver high quality \ncare but for costs which are predictable.\n  Are we talking about cutting the Medicare trust fund to do this or \ncutting Medicare spending to do this? No. As I mentioned earlier, we \nare talking about increasing it rather dramatically, $345 billion of \nincrease over the 7 years.\n And what does that work out in this inflation factor? It works out to \nthe fact that today the Medicare spending is growing at 10.5 percent.\n\n  What we are talking about in this resolution is accomplishing a rate \nof growth that is basically 6.4 percent. Mr. President, 6.4-percent \nrate of growth. That is what we are assuming for the Medicare spending \nunder this resolution. Is that a cut? Only if you function under the \nliberal new math. Under any reasonable math, even moderate math, a 6.4-\npercent annual increase is still an increase in spending and it a very \nsubstantial increase in spending. In fact, it represents twice the rate \nof growth of inflation. That is the commitment we made in this budget. \nAnd it is a significant commitment to our senior citizens, and it will, \nwe believe, produce a budget which will be in balance.\n  Now, there has been some discussion about a couple other issues I \nwanted to touch on quickly. That is the education issue. There is a \nrepresentation, if you were to listen to the earlier colloquy between \nthe Senators from Maryland and Massachusetts, that all students \neverywhere will be impacted adversely by this resolution. Well, I think \nmaybe they are not up to speed on what the resolution does.\n  The resolution does say that graduate students will be impacted, but \nundergraduate students will continue to have their programs and have \nthem pretty much the way they are today. Graduate students, yes. They \nwill be asked to pay the cost of interest on their loans after they \ngraduate from graduate school. Their interest on their loans will \naccrue while they are in graduate school, which they do not now.\n  What does that mean? Well, it basically means John and Mary Jones \nworking at the local diner, 60 hours a week to try to make ends meet, \nwill no longer have to subsidize the guy who is going to law school and \nhis graduate loan and the interest on that graduate loan. It means that \nlawyers, in fact, they will still be subsidizing them to some degree \nbut that person going to law school will, when they get out of law \nschool, because their earning capacity will be significantly increased, \nbe required to pay the burden of the interest that was accrued on that \nloan. I think that is fairly reasonable.\n  Yes, we should maintain the programs for undergraduates. I believe \nthey should keep undergraduates free from the interest cost during the \nperiod they are in school. But for graduates, I can see no legitimate \nreason for not requiring them once they get out of graduate school, \nwhere they have increased their earning capacity dramatically, to pay \nback that interest. Because, after all, if we do not do that, what we \nare basically doing is transferring to our wealthiest Americans, the \ngraduate students, from our moderate- and middle-income Americans' tax \ndollars, something that there appears to be outrage about over the tax \ncut. It does not clone that direction as mentioned earlier. But it \nseems to be acceptable relative to graduate students from that side of \nthe aisle, this income transfer, from hard-working Americans to people \nwho are clearly going to be quite wealthy once they get out of the \ngraduate schools, whether it is law school or medical school or \nwhatever.\n  So that is, I think, a bit of a specious argument to begin with. But \nsecond it is specious because it ignores probably the most underlying \npositive event which this balanced budget amendment is going to \ngenerate for all Americans, not just for the Federal Government; that \nis, the fact that all the economists that have looked at this, \nincluding CBO, have said if we put in place a budget which balances the \nFederal budget over the next 7 years and does it in real numbers, with \nreal terms, as this one does, that there will be a drop in the interest \nrates in this country of 2 percent. A 2-percent drop in interest rates \nis a huge benefit to homeowners, to people who are borrowing on their \ncredit cards, people who are buying cars, and equally people who are \ngoing to graduate school. And I suspect just that the percent drop will \nmore than pay for the cost of incurring the interest in later years or \nwill certainly pick up a significant proportion.\n  So, I do not find this argument to be very persuasive. Good politics, \nwhich unfortunately appears to be a big part of this debate, but not \npersuasive on the facts as is the argument that there is a Medicare cut \nhere which is maybe good politics but is inaccurate and clearly not \ntrue on the facts.\n  Now, the President presented a budget in this process also. The \nPresident has presented a number of budgets. The first budget was out \nof balance by $200 billion a year or $1.2 trillion over 5 years. And \nthen he came forward and presented a second budget, just a little while \nago. And that unfortunately came forward, scored by his own folks on \nthe basis of his own numbers, something that he said he would not do, \nnot scored by CBO. And when it was scored by CBO it turned out that \nbudget was also out of balance by about $200 billion a year for \nessentially as far as the eye could see. \n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\n  But I want to congratulate the President. I think he has stepped on \nthe playing field, finally. We have had a second effort here in June. \nAnd basically he has gotten involved in the process where he was not \nbefore. His first budget was clearly a walkaway from the budget \nprocess. Sort of a Pontius Pilot approach to the budget, just washing \nhis hands of it. But this budget is not what he presented. Granted, CBO \nhas scored it as a budget which does not get to balance. But when it \nwas sent up it was sent up with some very basic assumptions which I \nthink are good assumptions and good intentions.\n  First, he has agreed we need to get to a balanced budget. His \ntimeframe is 10 years. Ours is 7. I was interested in the Senator from \nMassachusetts's discussion of this issue. I was thinking that if we \nwere to accept the President's budget, the Senator from Massachusetts \nwould have been here--I am sorry I did not have a chance to ask him \nthis--would have been here for 45 years before we get to a balanced \nbudget, if I calculate right, since 1965. In any event, it is a long \nway away, but at least we agree it is a balanced budget.\n  Second, he has stated that we need Medicaid and Medicare reform. That \nis important. Because you cannot get to a balanced budget unless you \naddress the issue of Medicaid and Medicare spending.\n  Third, he has agreed we need welfare reform. He not only agrees to \nit, he was the primary mover in this area. I give him credit for coming \nout early and aggressively to do something in the area of welfare \nreform, and hopefully we can accomplish it. So those are three areas of \nagreement.\n  Fourth, he has agreed that other entitlement programs have to be \naddressed and discretionary spending has to be addressed and in the \nbudget he sent up he had some good numbers in those areas.\n  And fifth, he has proposed a tax cut. Less than what is in this \nbudget but still a tax cut so it recognizes the need to flow dollars \nback to the people as we address this issue of balancing the budget.\n  So, on five major points, five major points, we are basically in \nagreement, and the question comes down to dollars and timing. I think \nthere is an area for significant action here.\n  For example, in the Medicare, for all the slashing and cutting that \nwe are alleged to do from Members on that side of the aisle in the \nMedicare accounts, I would point out if you compare the President's \nnumber to our number, in outlays--that is really the only honest way to \ndo it--you take out all the assumptions, and the President's number is \nonly $11 billion off from our number each year in a program that is \nspending hundreds of billions of dollars. Not really a very significant \ndifference in the sense of coming to agreement. Significant difference? \nYes. But a difference which is clearly manageable--Mr. President--$11 \nbillion on accounts which spend hundreds of billions of dollars. So the \nPresident's numbers and our numbers are pretty close.\n  On Medicaid it is even closer. The President's outlay numbers are \nonly $9 billion different from ours. On some of the other entitlements, \nwelfare, for example, $10 billion of difference from ours. Those are \nnumbers that are very close. And I think they are numbers that can be \nresolved. And so the President has come forward with a budget which \nbasically agrees philosophically with five of the points we have been \nraising: First, you need to get to balance; second, you need to address \nMedicare and Medicaid; third, you need welfare reform; fourth, you need \nto address the other entitlements in discretionary accounts; and, \nfifth, you need a tax cut. Which is what our budget does.\n  And then his numbers in the key accounts, which are the entitlements \naccounts, are clearly in striking distance of our own numbers. So it \nseems to me there is an opportunity there for significant action to \nreach accommodation and reach agreement. Which brings me back to my \noriginal premise, which is that this budget is a no-nonsense, make-\nsense budget about how we get to balance and delivers to our children \nthe opportunity to have a country which has some prosperity and hope \nfor them.\n  The President, from his presentation, appears to also understand the \nneed for that. I hope that the Members on the other side of the aisle \nwould agree with the President's view and agree\n that these goals are what are needed and agree that these numbers are \nplaces he can start, because as we go over to the appropriations and \nreconciliation process, maybe we can reach the accommodations necessary \nto deliver to our children this gift which is so critical, a balanced \nbudget.\n\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I give 15 minutes of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, and I \nthank my colleagues.\n  Let me first say that a balanced budget should be our goal. In fact, \nI offered an alternative budget resolution during debate on the budget \nin the Senate that balanced the budget, and did so by 2004, without \ncounting Social Security surpluses, and did so with a different set of \npriorities contained in the budget before us today.\n  I think it is fair to say that the Republican budget resolution \nbefore us today is a fraud. Over and over, we have heard it stated on \nthe floor of the Senate and in the news media that they have balanced \nthe budget. Apparently, nobody has bothered to look at the budget \nresolution, because if you look at the budget resolution, you find out \nthey have not balanced the budget. Here it is. Here is the conference \nreport that we are debating today, and on page 3 of conference report, \nunder ``Deficits,'' it says:\n\n       For purposes of the enforcement of this resolution, the \n     amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n\n  And we go to the year 2002, in which they are claiming they have \nbalanced the budget. Do you know what one finds? It is the dirty little \nsecret of this budget. There is not a zero by ``deficits'' in the year \n2002. That is what we would have if they balanced the budget. It does \nnot say zero. It says the deficit in fiscal year 2002 is $108.4 \nbillion. That is not a balanced budget. That is not within hailing \ndistance of a balanced budget. That is a budget that is not anywhere \nclose to balancing, a $108 billion deficit in the year 2002.\n  How is it the Republicans claim they have balanced the budget? They \nclaim it because they are looting and raiding the Social Security trust \nfunds of every dime of surplus that is in those accounts. That is their \nplan. That is what they have in mind for America, to take every penny, \nevery dime of the Social Security surplus, more than $600 billion over \nthe next 7 years, take it all, spend it on other things, use it to give \ntax cuts to the wealthiest among us. That is the plan that is before \nus. It is a giant fraud. It is a huge hoax. That is what is before the \nAmerican people today.\n  This is the biggest transfer-of-wealth scheme ever in the history of \nthis country. They are going out there and taking money from people \nfrom their payroll taxes--and by the way, 73 percent of the American \npeople pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes--and \nthey are taking that money from them on the promise that it will be \nused to fund their Social Security retirement.\n  That is not what they are doing. They are taking that money and they \nare spending every dime of the Social Security surpluses. Just in the \nyear 2002, they are taking $108 billion of Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses. They are using that to spend on other parts of the budget, \nand they are using it to give giant tax breaks to the wealthiest among \nus. That is their plan.\n  If the American people are hoodwinked on this one, at some point they \nwill find the bill coming due, because last year the Entitlements \nCommission told us precisely what will happen if such a plan goes \nforward. We will face either an 85-percent tax increase or a 50-percent \ncut in benefits in order to fund those entitlement programs, because it \ndoes not add up.\n  Mr. President, this Republican budget is a monument to misguided \npriorities. It is unfair and just plain wrong. There are draconian \nreductions in Medicare, Medicaid, education, agriculture, \n\n[[Page S9249]]\nand public investments that benefit average Americans. And why? So they \ncan give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.\n  This budget, make no mistake, is a return to trickle-down economics. \nIt gives the wealthy a massive tax reduction and asks the middle class \nto pay the bill. One middle-class program after another is reduced in \norder to finance a tax break for those that have the most.\n  For example, the Republicans are reducing Medicare $270 billion over \nthis 7-year period; Medicaid by $182 billion. Make no mistake, rural \nhospitals all across America will close. I have dozens of such \nhospitals in my State. I have talked to the administrators. I have \nasked them the effect of these budget plans, and they have said to me, \n``Senator, we will close our doors. We will have no option.''\n  Our Republican friends say they are for welfare reform, they want \npeople to work. They are right about that, people should work. But with \nthe budget cuts that they have outlined, people will not be working. \nThe Congressional Budget Office told the Finance Committee, under the \nSenate Republican plan that 44 of the 50 States in this country will \nnot have a work requirement. They will not be able to have a work \nrequirement. They will be better off taking a 5-percent penalty and not \nhaving any work requirement in 44 of the 50 States of this country \nbecause there will not be enough funds for child care and for job \ntraining. What a fraud, but the wealthy will get their tax cut.\n  The Republicans take domestic spending, spending in this country on \ninfrastructure, spending on education, spending on research and \ndevelopment--the very things that are critical to our future--and they \ncut those $190 billion below a hard freeze.\n  In the budget plan I offered, we froze those programs for 7 years. \nTheir program cuts $190 billion below a freeze, tough, harsh cuts in \neducation, in infrastructure and research, in the things that matter to \nthe future of our country, but the wealthy will get their tax cut.\n  The Republican budget agreement also makes draconian and drastic cuts \nin agriculture programs. Many people do not understand agriculture \noutside of the heartland of the country. But I tell you, our farmers \nwork every day competing not only against the French farmer and the \nGerman farmer, but against the French Government and the German \nGovernment, and this budget signals unilateral disarmament; we are \ngoing to give up in this trade battle; we are going to leave that \nplaying field to our European competitors; and we are going to back \naway from one more market where the United States has been dominant; we \nare going to raise the white flag of surrender in this trade battle and \ngive up these agricultural markets.\n  Make no mistake, that is precisely what is going to happen under this \nplan.\n  Middle-class program after middle-class program will be devastated, \nbut the wealthy will get their tax cut. Those priorities do not make \nsense, and they certainly do not benefit the middle class. The tax cuts \nthat our friends have in mind are tax cuts that benefit \ndisproportionately those who are the wealthiest among us.\n  This chart shows an analysis of the House plan. We do not yet have \nthe Senate plan. The House plan is very clear in terms of who benefits \nfrom the Republican tax bill. If you are a family of four earning over \n$200,000 a year, you get an $11,000 tax break. If you are a family of \nfour earning $30,000 a year, you get $124. That is 100 times as much to \nthe family of four earning $200,000 as to the family of four earning \n$30,000. That is the Republican idea of targeting tax relief: Give the \ncrumbs to the middle class; give the cake to the wealthy. That is the \nRepublican plan that is before us today.\n  This budget resolution is nothing more than a repeat of the failed \ntrickle-down economics of the 1980's. We learned a lesson in the 1980's \nthat some have forgotten. We learned then that wealth does not trickle \ndown, it gets sucked up. That is precisely what the plan before us \ntoday will do: Big bucks for the big guys and crumbs for the middle \nclass. That is the plan that is before us.\n  I say to my colleagues and friends that if these policies are \nenacted, we will witness an even larger redistribution of wealth than \nthe one that took place in the early 1980's. I remind my colleagues \nwhat happened. From 1983 to 1989, the last time the Republicans had \ncontrol, this is what happened to growth in financial wealth in this \ncountry. The top 1 percent got 66 percent of the increased wealth in \nthat period--the top 1 percent got 66 percent of the increased wealth. \nThe bottom 80 percent--the vast majority of the people in this \ncountry--went backward. They saw their wealth reduced by 3 percent.\n  Mr. President, the Republican commentator, Kevin Phillips, had an \ninteresting comment on National Public Radio several weeks ago. He \nsaid:\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis . . . \n     we'd be talking about shared sacrifice, with business, Wall \n     Street, and the rich--the people who have the big money--\n     making the biggest sacrifice. Instead, the richest 1 or 2 \n     percent--far from making sacrifices--actually get new \n     benefits and tax reductions.\n\n  That is the plan that is before us--an enormous transfer of wealth, \nfrom the middle class and the lower income people to those who are the \nhighest on the income scale in this country. That is not fair, that is \nnot right, and that is not an economic plan for the future of America.\n  During Senate debate on the budget resolution, I and a number of my \ncolleagues offered an alternative balanced budget, one that balanced \nthe budget by the year 2004, without counting Social Security \nsurpluses. And we had much different priorities. Yes, we reduced the \nrate of increase in Medicare and Medicaid, because that must be done--\nbut not in the draconian fashion contained in this budget resolution.\n  We also had reductions in the rate of growth for nutrition programs, \nand others--but not the draconian reductions that we see here. We were \nable to do that by going to the wealthiest among us and asking them to \nparticipate in a plan to restore America's fiscal health. Shared \nsacrifice; everybody has to play a part. That is the American way. That \nis the way we ought to do what needs to be done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota will yield for \na question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate it. I have been watching some of the \ndiscussion. I have noticed several Members of the majority side nearly \nbreaking their arms patting themselves on the back in the last hour or \nso because they say they have brought a balanced budget to the floor of \nthe Senate. I noticed in the press conference at which they unveiled \nit, they said they kept their promise, ergo, a balanced budget. I \nnotice the press reported that they had brought a balanced budget to \nthe floor of the Senate. Then I notice on page 3 of the document before \nthe Senate, the very chart that I think the Senator from North Dakota \nhas, Senator Conrad, where it says ``deficits,'' it appears they have \nbeen patting themselves on the back too soon.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is saying, is he not, that there are no \nbalanced budgets in 2002? In fact, this budget resolution would leave a \ndeficit of $108 billion in the year 2002; is that correct? And, if so, \nwhy is everybody patting themselves on the back and claiming that the \nbudget is in balance if on page 3 it says it is not in balance, that it \nis $108 billion short of balance in the year 2002?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. I think they are hoping \nnobody actually reads the document. So far, they have been wildly \nsuccessful in that. The news media have not bothered to read the source \ndocument either. If they do, they will see under ``deficits'' in the \nyear 2002, it does not say zero; it does not say they have reached a \nbalanced budget. It shows a deficit of $108 billion in the year 2002. \nThat is because they have looted every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus trust funds during this period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from North \nDakota has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we will yield to the Republican side \nnow, despite the fact that we had only \n\n[[Page S9250]]\none Democrat speak after two Republicans in a row. But we have a \ndistinguished friend on the other side, Senator Grassley from Iowa, who \nwishes to speak. I now yield so that the Senator can use some of his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do not want to engage the Senator from \nNorth Dakota because I want to make my remarks and run to a meeting \nthat I have to have. But I want to make this point in his presence, and \nwe can argue about it at a later time. What he said I am not going to \nsay is inaccurate because he has the documentation for what he said. \nBut he spoke about our document and our claim of a balanced budget as \nbeing a fraud on the American people. We can accept that judgment if he \nis willing to say that if we had the President's document as a final \ndocument before this body to pass as the budget resolution for this \nyear, with the claim that the President balanced it in the year 2005, \nwhich is 3 years longer than ours, the Senator from North Dakota would \nhave to say that the President's budget is a fraud on the American \npeople, because the document that we have before this body, that we \ncorrectly claim will balance the budget by the year 2002, uses exactly \nthe same accounting procedure that has been used in this body by both \nRepublicans and by Democrats when they were in the majority. It would \nalso be used by the President of the United States in saying he had a \nbalanced budget.\n  The President would use the same approach that we used. The fact of \nthe matter is that our document is not a fraud. Our document balances \nthe budget by the year 2002. And except for the fact that the President \nof the United States uses OMB numbers instead of CBO projections for \nthe future, I would have to say that the President balances the budget \nby the year 2005. Therefore, the President's document is not a fraud \nand our document is not a fraud.\n  I hope that if the Senator from North Dakota is going to say that the \nway we do business and account for the balance is a fraud, he would be \nwilling to say that the way the President of the United States did it \nas well was fraudulent. But the fact is that we are balancing the \nbudget. We are balancing the budget because the United States people \nhave finally sent a very clear message to the Congress of the United \nStates that it is morally wrong for this generation to live high on the \nhog and to let our children and grandchildren pick up the bill.\n  Now, most of the debate behind the desire to have a balanced budget \nin this body is going to be based solely upon the public policy that it \nis good economics to have a balanced budget. And I agree with those \nstatements. But I think that the main reason we should balance the \nbudget is because for one generation we had anything we want through \nthe Federal budget because of the bottomless pit of borrowing and that \nis not right.\n I do not believe it was ever right.\n\n  Obviously, it got into the thinking of public servants that there was \nnothing wrong with one generation living off future generations.\n  We are finally going to be able to put our house in order so that \nafter the year 2002, we are going to be able to pay our own way. Then \nfuture generations can have a better life. They will not be saddled \nwith the high interest and the high debt. If we did not change business \nas usual in this country on fiscal policy, future generations would be \nfacing tax rates in the high 80 percent to pay for the debt that we \nhave loaded on them.\n  If any Member wonders whether or not we can have a great future \nwithout borrowing to the extent to which we borrow, $4.9 trillion, just \nthink, for the first 165-year history of our country, except for the \nyears you classify as war years, our forefathers were able to show \nsurpluses in budgets of the Federal Government 3 out of 4 years.\n  So the economic philosophy that has come to dominate public \npolicymaking in Washington, DC, that somehow we had to have a deficit \nto have prosperity, that does not square with the practice of our \nforefathers who lived within their income and still built a strong, \nviable economy and a society that was strong.\n  The moral arguments for this budget are very, very strong, I think \nthe overriding reason for victory that the balanced budget brings.\n  One other comment that is somewhat a reaction to what has been said \non the other side of the aisle about the tax cuts, most importantly \nabout the hogwash of the tax cuts going to the wealthy. I think they \nexpress those points of view because there is not an appreciation of \nwhat $500 per child in the pockets of middle-class Americans can do for \nthe families of America and what it can do for the economy.\n  Maybe there is not an appreciation by the limousine liberals of \nAmerica of what $500 means to a family because the philosophy on the \nother side of the aisle, quite frankly, is that somehow all the \nresources of this country belong to the Government, that we let, \nsomehow out of the goodness of our heart, a certain amount of money be \ngiven by the Government to the families.\n  That is all wrong. Everything belongs to the families and the workers \nof America. Under our constitutional system, people might give up some \nof their resources to Government through taxes to exercise certain \nfunctions that can be done by Government for the good of all of \nsociety.\n  In the last 30 or 40 years, the concept of tax expenditures has crept \ninto our policymaking here in Washington. We say that the deduction for \nchildren is a tax expenditure. We say that the tax deduction for \ninterest on home mortgage is a tax expenditure. We say this or that \nwhich you can subtract from your income tax is a tax expenditure.\n  Well, a tax expenditure implies that Government owns all the \nresources of this Nation and we might expend some of the money back to \nthe families to keep.\n  We can complain about high taxes and $500 tax credits for families on \nthe other side of the aisle very easily when you start with the concept \nthat every penny made by the working families of America in this \ncountry belongs to the Government and Government is going to let the \nfamilies keep something. That turns good reasoning on its head.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, accept the premise that all the \nresources of this country belong to the families and the workers of \nAmerica and that we, Government, ought to only take from those families \nwhat is legitimately needed to exercise the legitimate functions of \nGovernment.\n  That is why on the other side of the aisle they can make light of and \nmaybe even make fun of a $500 tax credit per child.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his hard \nwork in reaching this budget compromise. I want to say it this way so \nthe American people out there, cynical about one person any place in \nAmerican society maybe can make a difference--and I believe one person \ncan make a difference. I believe that any one person, any place, \nregardless of their station in American life, can make a difference if \nthey want to. Our society and our system of government allows that to \nhappen. And each person that says they cannot make a difference \nbelittles their contributions that they can make and underestimates \ntheir contribution that they can make to American society.\n  That is true in this body, as well. One person can sometimes make a \ndifference. I think that Senator Pete Domenici's desire to have a sound \nfiscal policy for this country and to work to a balanced budget has \nmade a difference, just because of the single individual of Senator \nDomenici. I think I can hold him up as an example, when people are \ncynical about an individual in Congress making a difference, that we \nare going to have a balanced budget in the year 2002 because of 1 \nperson out of 535 in this Congress. Maybe I ought to say at least of \nthe 100 Members of the Senate, because Senator Domenici of New Mexico, \nchairman of the Budget Committee, made a difference.\n  I suppose, as the Senator from Washington said about an hour ago, \neverybody cannot have everything that they want in a balanced budget. \nYou can have everything you want when you can borrow unlimited amounts \nof money to pay for it. But the principle of a balanced budget, for the \nfirst time \n\n[[Page S9251]]\nin a generation, dictates that you cannot have all your desires. It \ndictates the establishment of priorities within Government. It also \ndictates that every Member of this body cannot have everything they \nwant in a budget.\n  I, too, like the Senator from Washington, can find parts of this \nconference report that maybe I do not like. But we cannot lose sight of \nits singular accomplishment that it balances the budget in 7 years.\n  This balanced budget will mean that our children and grandchildren \nwill have a better tomorrow. This resolution will also help working \nfamilies today with lower interest rates and better wages because of \nthe increased productivity that is going to come from it.\n  It is for these reasons that I intend to vote for this conference \nreport.\n  While the Congress has produced a balanced budget for the benefit of \nour children, I want to note by contrast, that the administration has \nstill failed to provide a plan to achieve balance.\n  Last week I spoke on the floor, urging the administration to provide \nthe additional spending cuts necessary for their new budget proposal to \nachieve balance. And I urged them to do what the President said he was \ngoing to do in February 1993 in his first budget resolution, to use the \nCongressional Budget Office's economic projections.\n  As is well known, CBO has stated that President Clinton's budget \nproposal--that is the second one this year--provides a deficit of $210 \nbillion in the year 2002, the year that Congress' budget resolution \ngets into balance, the Republican budget resolution gets our budget in \nbalance.\n  And in the year 2005, the President's budget will still have a $209 \nbillion deficit.\n  I am very pleased that leaders on the other side of the aisle have \nalready come forward, urging their President to provide for more \nspending cuts and to use CBO's economic projections so his budget will \nhave integrity and so it will actually be in balance.\n  Monday's Wall Street Journal quotes the minority leader as saying \nthat President Clinton must find hundreds of billions of dollars in \nmore spending cuts. And in the Washington Times that same day, the \nminority leader is quoted as saying the White House will comply with \nCBO estimates.\n  Another Democratic Senator is quoted in the Washington Times as \nsaying, ``They cooked the numbers. The President needs to get back to \nthe CBO numbers.''\n  I am glad to see Members on the other side of the aisle agree that \nthe administration must use CBO estimates and must provide hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in more spending cuts. This is necessary if the \nWhite House is going to have any credibility in efforts to achieve a \nbalanced budget.\n  Now the ball is once again in the White House court. I strongly \nencourage the administration not to punt the ball for a third time. The \nAmerican people do not want their President to abdicate leadership on \nthe budget. They are glad he is in the ballgame now, but we want him in \nthe ballgame playing as a full member of the team.\n  This budget we have before us preserves Medicare. Medicare would \notherwise be bankrupt in the year 2002. I am glad the President \nrecognizes in his budget that Medicare would be bankrupt by the year \n2002, and he proposes slower growth of Medicare as we propose slower \ngrowth of Medicare. And even with slower growth, it is still going to \ngrow at 7 percent. Even at slower growth the per capita expenditure for \nMedicare is going to go up from $4,900 today to $6,500 in the year \n2002. We are going to be spending $1.7 trillion on Medicare. We are \ngoing to have Medicare still be one of the biggest, if not the biggest \nprograms in the Federal budget. Medicare will not go bankrupt under \nthis budget.\n  Agriculture is going to do very well under this budget. I thank the \nchairman for helping us in the Senate hold a strong line on the \nSenate's figures for agriculture. I think this conference report \nrepresents a real victory for agriculture because the House was going \nto cut agriculture $17 billion for 7 years. Normally, splitting the \ndifference we would have been cutting more than $14 billion. Our \nfigures will be at $13 billion, just above the Senate's \nrecommendations, and the conference retained the sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage that only 20 percent of the savings required of the \nAgriculture Committee should be realized from farm programs.\n  No one will benefit more from this effort to balance the budget than \nour family farmers. Because of the intense amount of capital that it \ntakes to be a family farmer and because, especially among young \nfarmers, so much of this capital is borrowed, lower interest rates will \nbe of enormous benefit to this capital-intensive industry. Lower \ninterest rates will result from a balanced budget.\n  The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, which is a \ncombination of the University of Missouri and Iowa State University, \nanalyzed the impact on the farm economy of a balanced budget. In a \npreliminary estimate, this organization took the CBO estimates of \nreduced interest rates that would be realized from a balanced budget \nand said it would translate into a $2.5 billion increase in farm income \nin the year 2002.\n  Finally, on the subject of taxes, this conference report assumes $245 \nbillion in tax cuts for the American people, especially working \nfamilies. I am particularly pleased that under this budget resolution \nthere can be no tax cuts until after CBO has certified that the budget \ndoes get to balance.\n  We all know we have a credibility problem with the American people \nwhen we talk about balancing the budget and cutting taxes at the same \ntime. But we overcome that problem with the American people because \nthis resolution will ensure that we have done the hard work first, that \nwe have actually cut the necessary spending that it takes to achieve a \nbalanced budget. It will be an enforceable reconciliation package. And \nthen it will be scored by the Congressional Budget Office so we know \nthere are x number of dollars available for a tax cut and that the tax \ncut is paid for and we do not cut taxes until that is done. That \nprotects us from the usual traditional use of smoke and mirrors that \nare too often used, and never gets us to our targeted deficit \nreduction.\n  When it comes to tax cuts, as a member of the Finance Committee I \nstate categorically I do not agree with the House of Representatives \nthat we should give middle-income tax cuts to families up to $200,000. \nAs a member of the Finance Committee, I will be working to have that be \ncapped at $100,000. But there is no question that families will greatly \nbenefit from being able to retain more of their income. Families will \nbe able to use those resources for their children's education, their \nchildren's health, their children's nutrition. Let the families make \nthe decision, not big Government make the decision on where this money \nshould be spent. Because I am confident that families will make the \nbetter choice.\n  One last note on taxes. I want to make a brief comment about a small, \nvery small but very important part of this budget resolution. I am very \npleased that the House agreed to join the Senate in rejecting the off-\nbudget funding for the Internal Revenue Service. The off-budget funding \nwas proposed by the administration to provide for approximately 6,000 \nmore IRS agents. The Senate last month, by a vote of 58 to 42, and it \nwas a bipartisan vote, rejected this off-budget funding for the \nInternal Revenue Service. By rejecting this off-budget funding gimmick \nthe Congress showed, first, that we would not engage in smoke and \nmirrors budgeting to achieve balance and, second, by eliminating this \noff-budget funding for IRS, we showed the American people that this \nCongress is committed to getting big Government off their back. The IRS \nhas more than sufficient resources to do its job. It does not need the \nthousands more agents knocking on taxpayers' doors, as proposed by the \nadministration.\n  This was a small but important victory for the taxpayers. It is a \nsymbol that this new Congress did get a message from the last November \nelection that Americans want to see a smaller, less intrusive \nGovernment. In this regard, again, this could not have been done \nwithout the help of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici. His dogged work in ensuring that this off-budget funding for \nthe IRS was eliminated made that possible.\n  This victory would not have been possible, then, without his \ndetermined support. I want to close by saying this \n\n[[Page S9252]]\nis truly a historic vote. I did not think I would see the day when we \nwould have a credible budget conference report that would get us to \nbalance, either in my public service or in my lifetime. By adopting \nthis conference report we take the necessary steps to put our fiscal \nhouse in order and provide the benefits of a balanced budget to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  We all tell our children and grandchildren that it is good and \nimportant to have dreams and hopes. This budget will help our children \nand grandchildren make these dreams and hopes come true.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished occupant of \nthe chair.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget before us purports to solve our \ndeficit problem in 7 years. However, it will not do the job. For one \nthing, the budget claims balance by using billions of dollars in the \nSocial Security trust fund. In some ironic way that is almost a joke \nbecause no company, no corporation--and I come with some experience \nhaving been the CEO of a major American corporation, the one that I \nhelped build with a couple of other young fellows--none of them would \ndare propose to show their balance sheets, or their financial \nstatement, as having been balanced using the company's pension fund.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I allow myself up to 20 minutes or such \ntime less than that which I care to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Senator's right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, no corporation would dare use the \npension fund that does not belong to them as a line on their financial \nstatement suggesting that in fact they have had a pretty good year. \nThat would amount to absolute fraud. And I think any chairman or \npresident of a company who signs such a statement, the financial \nofficer, could be accused and charged with fraud, and could be charged \nwith violation of the accounting rules that apply to public companies.\n  Meanwhile, my Republican colleagues claim that they are going to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, but only by using billions of dollars in \nthe Social Security trust fund that are reserved for senior citizens, \nthe beneficiaries. I hope they will not break their arms patting \nthemselves on the back about this.\n  In any case, Mr. President, there is a much larger question involved \nin this debate. And that question is Whose side are you on?\n  Those on the Republican side of the aisle are on the side of high-\nincome people with lots of assets. And so it is not surprising that \nthey advocate a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  They claim it will help the economy. I think it was at one point \ncalled trickle down. Trickle down was something like--I know this is a \nplay on words--trickle-dee trickle-dum. But the fact is that trickle \ndown economics did not work.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, we Democrats are here to represent ordinary \nAmericans. The people who work every day, trying to provide for their \nfamilies, trying to buy a home, a roof over their heads, trying to \nsupply an education for their children, trying to reserve funds for \ntheir older age, or trying to help a parent. These people will not \nbenefit by a tax cut to the rich.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans justify their budget by talking about \ndebt. But there is a lot of confusion about debt.\n  Debt is a recognized and an acceptable aspect of personal and \nbusiness life in this country. Show me a company, any company of size, \na company doing $50 million a year, $100 million a year, probably a lot \nsmaller than that, that does not have debt on its books, and I will \nshow you a private company owned by perhaps one individual. But assume \nas soon as you get other owners in the business, public companies and \nso forth, it goes almost without saying that they need debt, that they \nneed to borrow to expand, to invest in the future, to invest in \nresearch, product development, and marketing. That is the way it is.\n  What is the dream of the average American family? The largest asset \nthat most Americans have is their home. And I do not know anybody, \nmiddle income, modest income, or rich, that buys a home for cash. They \ngo to the bank or they go to a lending institution. They say, ``Lend me \nmoney based on my collateral; the brick and mortar that was used to \nbuild my house, the piece of property that I own.'' And for many, \nthroughout their lifetime of work, the largest asset that they acquire \nis their home or the equity in their home at such time as they dispose \nof it.\n  So it has to be with government at times. And we ought not to make \nphony comparisons of government to business or government to \nindividuals. You hear the argument that American families balance their \nbudget, so why not government. That is phony. Everybody knows that. \nEvery American family lives like every American business conducts \nitself. They borrow money. It is part of our system.\n  Yet we should try to balance the operating budget. And there is no \nquestion that we need to do much more to cut wasteful spending and move \nin that direction.\n  There may be some disagreement about the date, whether it is the year \n2002 or the year 2005. But both Democrats and Republicans share the \noverall goal.\n  The question is how do we get there and who pays the ultimate price? \nWhose side are you on?\n  We have heard our friends on the other side claim that they are not \ncutting Medicare, or that they are simply cutting into the growth of \nMedicare. The fact of the matter is that when you take $270 billion out \nof Medicare over the next 7 years, with the huge growth in the number \nof beneficiaries, and rising medical costs, that money goes for less \nper person than it would otherwise. These cuts in Medicare will mean a \ncut of over $3,300 per individual, almost $7,000 per couple, over the \nnext 7 years. And that is a lot of money for the average family. As a \nmatter of fact, the average senior citizen today pays 20 percent of his \nor her income in out-of-pocket health care costs.\n  We are talking about people whose incomes at best are modest. \nSeventy-five percent of Medicare recipients have incomes under $25,000 \na year; 35 percent have incomes under $10,000 a year. But we are \ntalking about an average increase for those folks of $3,300 per person, \nor roughly almost $7,000 for a senior couple.\n  Student loans--it is going to cost students $3,000 more over the \nperiod of a student loan. And the question is, who is going to be \ndeprived of the opportunity to go to college?\n  Mr. President, I have heard lots of personal stories about our \ncolleagues. There are some illustrious, distinguished careers that were \nbuilt among people here in this body with relatively modest starts. And \nI was one of those people. I came from a family where my mother was \nwidowed at age 36. I was 18 and had already enlisted in the Army to do \nwhat I had to in World War II. There was no money in that household--\nnothing. The modest allotment that I sent home was small. It helped my \nmother. She worked hard to take care of my sister and herself and to \nmaintain the small apartment that they lived in.\n  When I got out of the service, I was 22. I wanted to go to college \nand was accepted to a fine university. Were it not for the GI bill, Mr. \nPresident, I do not know which way my career would have gone. But I \ncreated a business. I am actually a member of the hall of fame of an \nindustry, the information processing industry, for what is called my \npioneering efforts in building the service side of the computer \nbusiness today larger than the hardware side of the computer business. \nA company I helped found with two other fellows today employees over \n20,000 people. It is a wonderful story about America and the success \nthat can be achieved here from three poor kids, and I was one of them. \nThe other two are brothers.\n  It was the GI bill that sent me to Columbia University. Without that \nI never would have known which turn to take in the road, very frankly. \nBut with that assistance from the Government, I made a contribution. It \nis an industry that employs over a million people today, and I take \nsome measure of the credit for having helped create \n\n[[Page S9253]]\nthe notion that you could buy computer services outside of your \ncompany; you did not have to own the hardware and you did not have to \nhave the programmers, the technicians; you could do it--all because I \ngot a start from my Government.\n  My father during the Depression years was humiliated by the fact that \nhe had to work under a WPA program. It was a very unpleasant \nexperience. But my father knew even more than his dignity, he had to \nhave a week's pay and he had to put some food on the table, and he had \nto maintain the respectability that he had as head of the household. So \nhe took a Government program job. It was not long, but it was \nnecessary.\n  So here we have education, employment. If only my father had health \ninsurance during the year of his sickness when my mother worked behind \nthe counter of a luncheonette so she could pay doctor bills and \nadminister to him at the same time.\n  So here we have a picture of America, Mr. President. What kind of a \ncountry are we? Is our mission primarily to cut taxes for the wealthy \nor is our mission here to build citizenry in the proudest way possible, \nto make patriots out of people because they love their country, because \ntheir country does something for them? And if it takes us a couple of \nyears more to eliminate a budget deficit, so it shall be. Because the \nprice of not doing it could be detrimental to our country for decades \nto come.\n  We go to the 21st century with the heaviest competition that this \ncountry has ever seen, whether it is from the European Union, 350 \nmillion people strong, or from the Pacific rim where energy is just \nboiling and people want to take our markets and take our products and \ntake our opportunity. We can avoid being in that competition very \nclearly by not educating our people, by not training them, by not \npenetrating those markets, by eliminating Government's assistance in \nhelping to get to those markets. We can do those things. In this case, \na penny saved is liable to be a dollar lost.\n  So we have to do this with some sense of compassion, with some sense \nof mission about what our democracy is like.\n  And yet, in this budget, we are going to take away the earned-income \ntax credit for modest families. We are going to make students pay more \nto get their loans. And we are going to cut Medicare benefits.\n  But we are going to take care of our friends who are in the high side \nof the income strata. We are going to make sure that they get their tax \ncut. I think it is ridiculous.\n  The people who are looking at this placard have to ask themselves the \nquestion: Whose side are you on? Where are we going to go? Are we going \nto be a Government that provides energy and seed money and \nencouragement for people to develop, or are we going to say, no, no, \nno, you have to live without these things and if the child does not \nhave sufficient nutrition, so be it. And if the child does not have an \neducation and goes to prison, we will build enough prisons. But will we \nbuild enough pride in our citizenry? That is the question.\n  So we are here with a conference report today that says we are going \nto give out 245 billion dollars' worth of tax cuts, but we are going to \ntake $270 billion out of Medicare and $182 billion out of Medicaid.\n  Medicaid. My goodness, I live in a State that has the second- or \nthird-highest per capita income in the country, New Jersey, but we also \nhave the paradox of some of America's poorest cities in our midst. And \nthose cities and other urban areas, where incomes are not high, very \noften are totally dependent on Medicaid to carry the hospitals that \nwill serve the needs of children. But we are going to say we are going \nto cut that because we are saving money. Yes, we are saving over here. \nWe are going to give some to those rich guys over there, but we are \nsaving money. And so those children will not get treated. And what kind \nof respect will they have for themselves, their families or their \ncountry if they have not enough to eat and not enough health care? Not \nmuch, I can tell you. They will find other ways to satisfy their basic \nneeds.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And so, Madam President, the debate will go on and we \nwill have different perspectives, but the one thing that will ring \nthrough this debate loudly and clearly in my view is: Whose side are \nyou on? The Democrats believe that people in modest income levels, \npeople in the middle class may need that extra little push to help them \nmove their families along so that they can move up the social and \neconomic ladder. And our friends on the other side will say, no, no, \nno, we are not going to spend money on those silly programs like child \nnutrition and day care and those kinds of things. No, we have to give \ntax cuts to the rich so that they can perhaps let something trickle \ndown for others.\n  I do not believe that is what America wants. It will be interesting \nto see how the American public receives this debate.\n  And with that, Madam President, I am prepared to yield.\n  Madam President, the next speaker is ordered from the Republican \nside, and they will allot their time as they see fit.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. I yield myself whatever time I may \ntake--I believe 15 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, last November, voters sent 11 new Members to the \nSenate. I believe all of us came to Congress dedicated to keeping the \npromises we made in our campaigns, and specifically we promised to end \nbusiness as usual and to replace the old equation here in Washington of \nhigher taxes and more Government with smaller Government and the goal \nof letting people keep more of what they earn.\n  Central to our campaign was a commitment to end 25 years of deficit \nspending here in the Congress.\n  Today, the Senate is debating a budget resolution which delivers on \nthose promises. First and foremost, this resolution balances the \nFederal budget over the next 7 years. It does so by slowing the growth \nof Federal spending from 5 percent a year to 3 percent a year. In \ndollars, that means Federal spending will continue to grow from $1.6 \ntrillion next year to $1.9 trillion in the year 2002.\n  Now some, of course, have argued that we moved too fast. But the \nfacts are quite simple. If we do not take action now, America will face \nan economic crisis far greater than any this Nation has ever confronted \nbefore. Here is why.\n  If Washington keeps spending money the way it has for the last \nquarter of a century, the Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt in 7 \nyears. In 15 years spending on entitlements and interest payments on \nthe national debt alone will equal all tax revenues. That means not $1 \nfor national defense, law enforcement, education, job training, \nveterans programs and so on, unless we run up even higher deficits in \nthe future, deficits at levels we have never previously contemplated.\n  Most importantly, unless the actions we begin in Congress are enacted \nand signed by the President, a child born this year, 1995, would during \ntheir lifetime pay $187,000 in Federal taxes, not in total, but just to \ncover their share of interest on the national debt that already exists \nand will accumulate during their lifetimes.\n  By adopting this budget we can avoid fiscal disaster and begin the \nprocess of removing the mountain of debt from the backs of our \nchildren. Moreover, balancing the budget also sets the stage for an era \nof lower interest rates, accompanied by expanded job creation and a \nhigher standard of living. Balancing the budget will result in \nsignificantly lower interest rates, which means that the average \nhomeowner can save up to $500 per month on their mortgage. In addition, \nthe GAO reports that balancing the budget could produce real income \ngrowth of up to 36 percent by the year 2020. For families and children \nthen, balancing the budget means more than just reducing public debt, \nit means keeping a roof over their heads, putting food on their table, \ngoing to better schools and financing retirement. It means a brighter \nfuture.\n  How do we get there? We get to a balanced budget by setting \npriorities and making tough decisions. We get to a \n\n[[Page S9254]]\nbalanced budget by keeping our promises, promises to eliminate wasteful \nspending, to evolve programs to the States and control growth of \nentitlements and provide taxpayers with some badly needed relief.\n  First, this resolution trims the fat off of the Government and does \nso by eliminating unnecessary agencies, consolidating duplicative \nprograms and privatizing those functions that are better served by the \nprivate sector.\n  The resolution includes the elimination of almost 150 departments, \nadministrations, agencies, commissions, committees, boards and \ncouncils--everything from the Board of Tea Experts to the Department of \nCommerce. It also assumes the privatization of entities like the naval \npetroleum reserve and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation and the Alaska \nPower Marketing Administration, all of which provides services which \nare better left to the private sector.\n  Finally, this resolution consolidates duplicative programs to make \nthe Government less cumbersome and more efficient. And all these \nreforms save the American taxpayer $190 billion over the next 7 years.\n  This budget also devolves powers to State and local governments. \nDuring my campaign I promised the people of Michigan to return the \noperation of various Government functions back to the State, where \nGovernor Engler and our legislature are out front on important issues \nlike reforming welfare, Medicaid and education. I know Governors from \nother States are equally as innovative.\n  This budget takes advantage of the tremendous talent outside the \nbeltway by utilizing block grants to replace the hundreds of Federal \nwelfare, housing and education programs. These block grants, which in \nmany committees are already moving forward on a bipartisan basis, will \nprovide the Governors with the resources and the freedom they need to \ncarry out such reforms.\n  Another promise I made to the people in Michigan was to work to \ncontrol the growth of Federal entitlement programs. The need for this \nreform was made apparent in February when the Medicare trustees \nannounced the trust fund will be insolvent 7 years from now. The \ntrustees concluded that the HI program is severely out of financial \nbalance and that the trustees believe that the Congress must take \ntimely action to establish long-term financial stability for the \nprogram. This budget embraces this call to act by addressing both the \nshort- and the long-term insolvency of Medicare programs.\n  First, it allows Medicare to continue to grow at a 6.4 percent rate \nper year. This reform enables Medicare to pass the trustee short-term \nsolvency test while still growing at twice the rate of inflation.\n  Second, the resolution includes a call for a special commission to \naddress the long-term stability questions facing Medicare and to advise \nCongress on how to keep Medicare's promise for future generations. \nPresident Clinton's most recent budget endorses this approach by \nadvocating similar reforms.\n  Now, we have heard a lot during the debate on this budget when it \nfirst came before us, and we heard already today, and I am sure \ntomorrow we will hear issues raised as to whether or not we should do \nthese things with regard to entitlement programs and Medicare in \nparticular, whether or not we can limit the growth to twice the rate of \ninflation. And the claims will be made that this is impossible to do \nsimply because, if we did this at the current rate of growth, the \ncurrent rate of inflation in health care programs, it will have this, \nthat or the other effect. All these horror stories we heard suggests it \nis impossible to change any system in this country.\n  That is certainly not the case, at least based on the recent evidence \nwe have seen in the health care area. What we have seen is that in the \nprivate sector the inflationary health care has been dramatically \nreduced as corporate America, small business America, as families in \nAmerica have addressed these growth problems by finding innovative ways \nto deal with health care and health insurance costs, by engaging in \nmore preventive medicine and joining managed care facilities, by \nfinding other alternatives to simply assuming that the rate of \ninflation can never change. I think it can. I think on a bipartisan \nbasis we can, while providing the same level of service, limit the rate \nof growth of Medicare to the types of percentage that are contained in \nthis budget resolution.\n  Another central promise of my campaign was to fight for tax relief \nfor America's families and businesses. Federal, State, and local taxes \ntoday combine to take almost 40 percent of every American's dollar that \nthey earn. The tax burden on American families has increased by 300 \npercent over the past 40 years. Our Tax Code is excessive and it is \noften arbitrary and too often it chokes innovation and job creation.\n  In my campaign, I promised the people of Michigan to support much-\nneeded tax relief, like the $500 per child family tax credit, which we \nhave talked about already and will continue to discuss in this body. \nThis budget delivers on those promises by providing $245 billion in \nrelief over the next 7 years. Under this resolution when spending has \nbeen cut and a balanced budget is ensured, $245 billion is made \navailable to the Finance Committee for legislation providing family tax \nrelief and incentives to stimulate savings and investment. And we need \nthose incentives. Recent economic indicators suggest the economy may be \nslowing down. If slower growth is on the horizon, then we need to do \nmore than just focus on spending. Slower economic growth endangers our \ncommon goal of a balanced budget in the year 2002. According to the OMB \na 1-percent slower economic growth rate translates into $150 billion in \nhigher deficits over the next 5 years. By including real incentives for \ninvestment and savings, we can help stimulate the economy and ensure \nthat revenues keep pace with projections.\n  A good example of how this can work, I think, was embodied in Jack \nKemp's original enterprise zone proposal. In these zones lower taxes on \ncapital would encourage businesses and employers to go into \neconomically depressed areas, spurring economic growth and job \ncreation. The primary benefits of these zones go to the residents of \nthe zones themselves as their neighborhood is given a much-needed \nboost. And within the next few weeks I plan to introduce a bill that \nwould supercharge the current empowerment zones with powerful savings \nand investment tax incentives such as those that have been previously \noutlined in enterprise zone bills to try to create that kind of job \ncreation.\n  By including a tax cut in the budget, we are opening the door for tax \nreforms like enterprise zones, family tax credits, and other incentives \nfor savings and investment. These tax cuts in turn will increase--grow, \ncreate jobs, improve savings and ultimately improve the standard of \nliving for most Americans. I intend to work with the Finance Committee \nto provide Americans with a profamily, progrowth tax cut this year.\n  Madam President, 2 weeks ago Bill Clinton sent to Congress a proposal \nthat embraces the central themes of this Republican budget.\n It cuts spending. It limits the growth of entitlements, and it \nprovides Americans with relief from excessive Federal taxes. In short \nand in many ways, the President's budget alternative vindicates \nRepublican efforts to balance the budget. While the plan falls short of \nits goals, which has been quantified by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, I still think it is a good start in the right direction. I also \nhope that the President now will support other Republican efforts to \ncreate jobs and strengthen our economy, and I look forward to working \nwith the administration to do so.\n\n  Madam President, this budget resolution takes a historic step toward \nbalancing the budget by slowing the growth of Government and returning \npower to the States. It is a credit to Senator Domenici and to the \nmembers of the Budget Committee and to the leadership, I think, that we \nhave set this goal and stuck with it.\n  As is the case, I know, with the President and many others in this \nChamber, there are parts of this budget resolution that I wish were \ndifferent. There is an area, for example, in the student loan area \nwhere I wish it were different, closer to something that I had worked \nout before.\n  But I think it does an extraordinarily good job of ordering \npriorities and reaching the commonly held objective of bringing the \nbudget into balance, \n\n[[Page S9255]]\nand it is the reason that I strongly support what we are attempting to \ndo today and tomorrow.\n  The question before Congress is not just about dollars and cents, \nrevenues and outlays. The question confronting us is whether this will \nbe the first generation of Americans that fails to pass on to our \nchildren as much freedom and opportunity as we inherited from our \nparents. Like many other new Republicans in Congress, I ran for the \nSenate promising to fight for an agenda that would guarantee my \nchildren and their generation more freedom and opportunity. This \nbudget, I think, keeps those promises, because it guarantees that the \nfreedoms and opportunities for future generations are greater than \never. I look forward to working with the President and, hopefully, \ncongressional Democrats to get this job done.\n  We heard earlier today numerous people comment on the implications of \nthis budget. The previous speaker was quite eloquent in trying to \noutline his view of America and where he thought this budget would take \nus. He talked about his family and their experiences in this country. I \nwould just like to close by talking about my family.\n  My grandparents were all immigrants. They came to this country about \na century ago in search of freedom. None of the four could speak \nEnglish. Probably cumulatively the four had about $5 in resources when \nthey got here. But they came to this country because they wanted to \nlive in a country that was free and they wanted their kids and their \ngrandchildren and future generations of their family to live in a \nnation that was free.\n  They did not come here seeking a nation for the purpose of finding a \nplace where there were great Government benefits. They believed in \ntheir own capacities to do things, and they wanted a place where they \nwould have a chance to enjoy the freedom to do the things they want.\n  My parents were very hard-working folks. Neither of them had a \ncollege education. They were not really well educated, in fact, but \nthey cared an awfully lot about their children and they wanted my \nsisters and me to have a little more opportunity than they did.\n  My dad worked for almost 20 years as a UAW member on an assembly line \nin Lansing, MI, in an Oldsmobile factory, and he and my mom had a small \nbusiness after that. They worked very hard, 6, sometimes 7 days a week, \nto give my sisters and me a chance to have the other part of the \nAmerican dream--freedom and opportunity.\n  I think what they envisioned for my generation and what I think they \nall wanted for my children's generation was a chance to grow up in a \nnation that provided these opportunities. I sincerely believe that if \nwe burden the next generations with an ever-increasing amount of debt, \nwe will not pass on the kind of freedom that my grandparents came to \nthis country to find and that my parents tried to pass on to my sisters \nand to me.\n  I just will close by saying this. We heard a lot of talk about \ncompassion and which party has the ability to provide it and what this \nbudget will do. But just remember, Madam President, that in this \nbudget, we will be spending over the 7-year period involved something \nin the vicinity of $12 trillion of taxpayers' money, of moneys sent to \nus by hard-working people across this country. We are a very \ncompassionate Nation, I think, and we are spending most of those \ndollars in one way or another on programs which benefit people who are \nless fortunate.\n  So I think we are a compassionate Nation. If we continue to provide \nthe people with the freedoms and the incentives to pursue their \nentrepreneurial instincts and pursue the kind of opportunity my \ngrandparents came to this country to find, we will get the job done.\n  I cannot imagine, in a nation that does as much, how we can ever get \nto the floor and suggest we are not compassionate, our programs are not \neffective. I think this budget allows us to continue providing support \nfor people who are truly needy but, at the same time, make it possible \nfor people to enjoy the freedom and opportunities in America.\n  So I strongly support what we have done and look forward to working \nto adopt this resolution.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am struck sometimes, in listening to \nthe discussion on the floor of the Senate, by some Members of the \nSenate who think that it is always intrusive to ask someone in this \ncountry to pay taxes; that it is, after all, their money and they \nshould not be required to send it, and the only reason the Congress \nasks them to send it is so the Congress can squander it on one thing or \nanother.\n  The fact is, in our country, we do a lot of things together. When we \ndo things together, there is an obligation for all of us to pay for \nit--educating our kids, building our roads, paying for our police and \nfire protection, and providing for the common defense of our country. \nThat is what we must do in our country, and all of us have an \nobligation to pay for some of that. And we do that through taxes.\n  None of us enjoys it, perhaps, but I happen to consider the taxes I \npay a good investment in my children's education. I am pleased I do. I \nhappen to consider the taxes that I pay something that I am proud to do \nto support the men and women, for example, who serve in our Armed \nForces and risk their lives in defense of this country's liberty and \nfreedom. So I think we ought to talk about what is it that makes a good \ncountry and what are our obligations to each other and to our country.\n  About 6 months ago, I went to Dulles Airport to meet an airplane. I \nhad about a month or two prior to that been watching television and saw \non television a young woman in Bosnia whose parents had been killed, \nwho had been critically wounded herself, and who lay in a hospital for \nsome long while. Her brother, in the same attack that killed her \nparents and critically wounded her, was miraculously spared, and he was \nable to come to the United States. She, on the other hand, when she \nrecovered from her wounds, after laying in critical condition, having \nlost her parents and then her brother having been taken from her, was \nliving in a single room with a candle trying to study, despondent over \nlosing her family.\n  I decided I was going to see if I could help this young woman \nsomehow, and I did. She came to the United States, and I picked her up \nat Dulles Airport and reunited her with her brother. Coincidentally, \nthis happened 1 year to the day after my daughter had died.\n  I was thinking on the way to the airport to meet this young woman \nfrom Bosnia who had suffered from such tragedy a lot of things that \nwere very emotional for me, because we could not do much to save my \ndaughter, and yet I thought perhaps I was helping some other young \nwoman start a new life. I felt at least in some ways maybe there was \nsome opportunity to reach out.\n  Her plane arrived and she got off the plane and was overcome with \nemotion as she met her brother, whom she never expected again to see. \nShe cried and was extraordinarily emotional. When we were talking after \nthis, she said to me, ``It was only something I barely was able to \ndream about, that I might some day ever come to the United States of \nAmerica. You don't have any idea what this means to someone to be able \nto come to the United States of America. We view the United States as a \nland of opportunity, as a place where opportunity exists to live a good \nlife and live in peace and live in freedom.''\n  I thought to myself, when she said that through her tears, that all \nof us in this Chamber, I think, and probably all of us in this country \nfrom time to time, take too much of this country for granted. If by \nchance we are able to hear from others what this country means to them, \nwe can understand again what our great grandparents and grandparents \nand our parents helped build in this country.\n It is a pretty remarkable, special, unusual place. This is a \nsuperpower, a world economic leader. It did not start that way. But \nbecause of genius in people, because of a free market capitalist \nsystem, because of businesses that took risks, and, yes, even because \nof Governments that did \n\n[[Page S9256]]\nthings and invested the taxpayers' money and also provided opportunity, \nthis country has progressed. We led the way.\n\n  We, as we moved along, decided there is a right way and a wrong way \nto do things. The captains of industry in the turn of the century were \nproducing tainted meat with rat poison. Upton Sinclair wrote his book \nabout how they killed rats by lacing the bread with arsenic. He said \nthey would shove the bread and rats down the chute and it would get \nmixed in and they would produce a mystery meat that would end up on the \nshelf. We decided we did not want to eat tainted meat.\n  We also decided we did not want to pollute our air. In the last 20 \nyears, we are using twice as much energy and we have cleaner air. Is it \nbecause the captains of industry said we are going to spend money to \nclean up emissions? No, it is because people here in the Senate and \nacross the way in the House said there is a right way and a wrong way \nto do things. We said we were going to require less pollution. Yes, it \nwill cost a little more. But we have cleaner air now than we had 20 \nyears ago, and we have cleaner water than we had 20 years ago.\n  Is it a nuisance to comply with all of that? I suppose so. Is it good \nfor our kids to leave this country in better shape? You bet it is. The \nGovernment provided leadership and did the right thing. We have to \nprovide the leadership in fiscal policy as well. Do we not have to \nbalance the Federal budget? You bet. There is no question about that. \nThere ought not to be one scintilla of debate on the floor of the \nSenate on the question of whether we should put our fiscal house in \norder. The question is not whether we should, the question is how. \nThere is a right and a wrong way to do that as well.\n  The Federal budget represents our priorities. One hundred years from \nnow they can look at the budget and figure out what the people in this \ncountry thought was important to them. They can determine that just by \nlooking at what they decided to spend money on. I know it is easy to \ncriticize. I do not mean to be critical. As has been said, ``Any \njackass can kick a barn door down, but it takes a carpenter to build \none.'' Yet, I must be critical of the priorities in the budget. I think \nthey are wrong.\n  I want to balance the budget. I have supported initiatives to do so. \nBut I do not think we ought to make it harder for kids to go to \ncollege. That is what this budget does. I do not think we should do it \nby deciding that health care is going to be more expensive for the poor \nand elderly. We do not advance the economic interests of this country \nwhen we decide a poor child at school should not be entitled to a hot \nlunch, but the richest Americans are entitled to a tax cut. That does \nnot make sense for this country.\n  This is a debate about priorities. I have been watching people break \ntheir arms patting themselves on the back today for a balanced budget. \nI only observe that if you take this document that is on every single \ndesk in the Senate and turn to page three, look at the heading called \ndeficits, and look at the year 2002, you will see that in the year \n2002, on this majority party budget deficit document, it says the \nbudget is not in balance. It is, in fact, a $108 billion deficit.\n  I have a standing offer of $1,000 of Senator Rockefeller's money--\nbecause he has a little more than the rest of us, so he would provide \n$1,000 of his money to anyone--to any Member of the Senate or any \njournalist who would demonstrate to us that this budget is in balance. \nI made that offer 24 hours ago, and nobody has taken the $1,000 dollars \nyet, and nobody will, largely because this budget is not in balance. \nEverybody in this Chamber knows it. Yet, they are spending most of \ntheir time complimenting themselves on doing something they have not \ndone. That might be fun for them and might eat up some of their time, \nand it might even convince some people it is in balance. But those who \nhave taken simple arithmetic and who can read page numbers can simply \ngo to page 3 and understand that it is not in balance.\n  Again, I say, about priorities, that the priorities here are not the \nright priorities. We can, should, and will debate the priorities. And, \nin my judgment, it is investing in our children's education. It is in \nbalancing the budget, but doing so in a way that spends money that is \nproductive, that yields investments.\n  If I have 1 or 2 minutes left, I want to tell a story I have told \nbefore. It represents what I think is the future of this country. The \noldest Member of Congress, when I came here, was Claude Pepper. I went \nto his office to meet him. Behind his desk were two pictures on the \nwall. One was of Orville and Wilbur Wright taking their first flight. \nYou know, it was autographed. That is how old Claude was. It said, ``To \nCongressman Pepper with deep admiration.'' He came to Congress in the \n1930's and was still here in the 1980's. Beneath the autographed \npicture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making their first flight was a \npicture of Neil Armstrong standing on the Moon.\n  What was it in that relatively short period of decades that produced \npeople that went from the ground to the air to the Moon? Education and \ngenius. It was massive amounts of education in our country, allowing \npeople to become the best they can be--engineers, scientists, and more. \nIt was not just going to the Moon; it was progressing in so many other \nareas. Why? Because we made the right investments. We understood the \nright priorities.\n  The right priorities, in my judgment, are this country's children. \nThis budget short-changes America's children. Someone once said that \n100 years from now your income will not matter, or how big your house \nwas, but the world might be a different place because you were \nimportant in the life of a child.\n  The question for us about priorities is: Will we pass a budget that \nis important in the lives of America's children? If we will, it will \nnot be this one because its priorities are wrong. We can do much \nbetter, and will, if we reject this budget, reject the tax cuts for the \nrich, reject more money for defense, and invest more in America's kids, \nand make sure we take care of the things that are important in this \ncountry.\n  I yield back the entire balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I rise today in support of the budget \nagreement. I want to congratulate Senator Domenici. I want to \ncongratulate Congressman Kasich. It is very seldom in American politics \nthat you get an opportunity to vote for a big bill--a budget in this \ncase--that takes a step toward fundamentally changing the way our \nGovernment does its business.\n  I am not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of budgeting. I \nam not saying that this budget in and of itself is going to \nfundamentally change the future of America. But I am saying that it is \nan important step in the right direction. It is clearly the most \ndramatic and important budget that we have adopted in the U.S. Congress \nsince 1981.\n  I believe that the American people will be beneficiaries of this \nbudget. And it is not perfect, from my point of view. I think we could \nhave cut spending more. I think we could have let working people keep \nmore of what they earned. I think we could have done more to change \nfundamentally American Government. The bottom-line truth is that this \nis a dramatic change in policy, and I think everybody who has had \nanything to do with this budget can be proud of what they have done.\n  Let me set in perspective what we are doing here today. We are \nwriting, over a 7-year period, a binding budget that, if enforced over \nthat 7-year period, will balance the Federal budget. That is something \nthat we have not done since 1969.\n  The important thing to note about this budget is that we are not \npromising to do things in the future that will balance the budget. What \nwe are doing in this budget, and in the follow-on legislation that we \nwill adopt this year, is we are making changes now that will, over the \nnext 7 years, if the economy stays roughly as we now anticipate it will \nstay, in a modest recovery mode, balance the Federal budget and will, \nfor the first time in over a quarter-century, mean that the Federal \nGovernment is living within its means. That is a very important change \nin public policy. What did it take to achieve this change?\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to \ntalk about deep cuts, about denying benefits, but let me try to set \nthat in perspective. \n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\n  Since 1950, Federal spending has grown, on average, about 7\\1/2\\ \npercent a year. Federal spending since 1950 has grown 2.5 times as fast \nas family income has grown.\n  An interesting number is, that if the family budget since 1950 had \ngrown as fast as the Federal budget has grown, and if the Federal \nbudget had grown as fast as the budget of the average family in America \nhas grown, the average income of working families in America today \nwould be almost $130,000 a year and the Federal Government would be \none-third the size it is today.\n  Given a choice between the America we have and that America, I would \ntake the America of higher family income and smaller government.\n  What we are doing in this budget is limiting the growth of Federal \nspending to no more than 3 percent a year, each year, for the next 7 \nyears.\n  Now I know we have many people on the other side who will say, well, \nafter having grown at 7\\1/2\\ percent a year for 40 years that to limit \nthe growth to 3 percent a year is going to decimate Government \nprograms.\n  I would just like to remind my colleagues that every day in America, \nbusinesses make tougher decisions than that just to keep their doors \nopen. Every day in America, families make far tougher decisions than \nthat in dealing with the real world problems that families in America \nface every single day.\n  The difference is that families and businesses live in the real world \nin America where you have to make tough choices. Our Government has not \nlived in the real world for the past 40 years. I think we can take a \nlittle pride in the fact that this budget is a major step toward \nbringing our Government in Washington back into the real world that \neverybody else lives in.\n  Under the old budget, under the Clinton budget, the Federal \nGovernment over the next 7 years would have spent $13 trillion. Under \nthis budget, we are still going to spend $12 trillion. We are talking \nabout spending roughly $1 trillion less than we would have spent.\n  But we are talking about more than simply controlling the growth of \nGovernment. We are talking about something that I fought for in the \nSenate. I offered an amendment to cut spending further so we could let \nworking families keep more of what they earn. That amendment was not \nsuccessful. But I am very proud of the fact that the conference \naccepted, basically, a variant of the House language that allows \nworking families to keep more of what they earned.\n  In 1950, the average family with two little children in America sent \n$1 out of every $50 it earned to Washington, DC. Today that average \nfamily with two children is sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to \nWashington, DC.\n  I do not think there are many people in America that believe that \nWashington is doing a better job of spending that family's money than \nthat family would do if we let them keep more of what they earn, to \ninvest in their own children, in their own family, in their own \nbusiness.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we are making a major step in this \nbudget that is going to let us enact a $500 tax credit per child so \nthat families can spend more of their own money on their own children \non their own future.\n  In our tax cut, we call for a cut in the capital gains tax rate. I \nknow the President says if you cut tax rates, rich people will exploit \nthe situation. They will invest their money. If they are successful \nthey will earn profits.\n  Welcome to America. That is how our system works. We want to \nencourage more people to invest money. I do not understand a country \nand a Government and people who love jobs but hate people who create \nthem. I do not understand all this class warfare that we are always \ndebating about. If we want people to invest money, we have to provide \nincentives to people who have money. Those are basically people who \nhave been successful.\n  What a different world our President is from than the world I am \nfrom. When I was growing up and we rode by the nicest house in town, \nnever once did my mama point her finger out and say, ``We ought to tax \nthose people, and give us their money.'' My mother always pointed her \nfinger out and said, ``If you work hard and you make good grades, you \ncan have a house like that.'' I like my mama's America a lot better \nthan I like Bill Clinton's America.\n  I am proud of the fact that in our budget we provide incentives for \npeople to invest their money to create jobs and growth and opportunity \nso that other Americans can get their foot on the bottom rung of the \neconomic ladder and climb up and begin to create success for \nthemselves, their family, and their country.\n  This tax cut that we are talking about in this bill sounds like a \nsmall amount of money in Washington, DC, $500 per child. Many have \nsaid, well, it is not enough money to make any difference. Well, to a \ntwo-child family in Texas, that is $1,000. And $1,000 is real money. \nThe fact that $1,000 is not real money in Washington, DC, tells more \nabout the problems in Washington, DC, than it does about anything else.\n  The tax credit for children that we contemplate in our budget will \nmean that a family with four children, that makes $35,000 a year, will \nbe taken off the income tax rolls. A family with two children that \nearns $45,000 a year, if we go on now and adopt the tax cut that goes \nwith this budget, will see its income taxes cut by one-fourth.\n  This will mean that working families can keep more of their own money \nto invest in education, in housing, in nutrition. The President, in \ncriticizing our budget, says this budget cuts spending on children. \nThis is not a debate about how much money we spend on children, but it \nis certainly a debate about who will do the spending.\n  President Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do the \nspending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government \nand we know the family. We know the difference.\n  We believe that letting families keep more of what they earn to \ninvest in their own children will mean that they will do a better job \nand they will be richer and freer and happier.\n  When we concluded the debate on this budget, I was concerned that we \nwere not going to fulfill the promises that Republicans made in the \ncampaign.\n  We promised the American people three things if they made Republicans \nthe majority: No. 1, we would balance the budget; No. 2, we would let \nworking families keep more of what they earn; No. 3, we would provide \nincentives for economic growth. I am proud of the fact that in this \nfinal budget we are balancing the budget over a 7-year period. We are \nletting families keep more of what they earn. We are providing \nincentives for economic growth.\n  Promises made, promises kept. That is something that there has not \nbeen enough of in Washington, DC. I am very proud to have been part of \nan effort where we have fulfilled our promises and where we are, in \nfact, beginning to change the way our Government does its business. I \nserved in the House and in the Senate. I have never had an opportunity \nto vote for a budget that if fully enforced, under realistic \nassumptions, would do the job of balancing the Federal budget. I am \nvery proud that I am going to have an opportunity to cast my vote for \nthis budget. It may very well be that 2 years from now or 4 years from \nnow we will have to go back and make an adjustment. It may very well be \nthat we will have to reduce the growth in spending further at some \npoint to get the job done. I am certainly willing to do that.\n  The important thing today is--and I think every Member of the Senate, \nwhether they vote for this budget or not, can be proud of the fact--\nthat we have written a budget that is a fundamental change. This budget \nwould never have been written had the 1994 elections not been held, had \nthere not been a fundamental change in the makeup and control of \nCongress.\n  But we are writing, today, a budget that under realistic assumptions \nwill balance the budget over the next 7 years. It represents a change \nin policy. It represents the fulfillment of a commitment that we have \nmade to the American people. I think every person who is privileged to \nserve in the Senate today can be proud of the fact that this budget \ndoes what the American people wanted done, change the way we do \nbusiness in Washington.\n  It does not complete the job. In and of it itself today, it does not \nbalance the budget. But it lays the foundation for a 7-year program \nthat if we stay with it, if we are willing to make \n\n[[Page S9258]]\nchanges when things go wrong--and they inevitably go wrong--with modest \nadjustments over the next 7 years, we can guarantee the American people \nthat we will balance the Federal budget, and if things go well, we can \ndo it without further action.\n  I think that is a tremendous achievement. I am very proud to have \nplayed a small role in it. I congratulate Senator Domenici. I \ncongratulate Members of the House and Senate. And I am delighted to \nhave an opportunity to cast a vote for this budget.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, there is credit to be spread around. And \nthere is blame to be spread around, for the deficit and where we are. I \nthought Senator Dorgan's remarks earlier were right on target. It is \nwhy I am proud to have him as a Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  The Republicans, and I specifically commend Senator Domenici, deserve \ncredit for having the target of balancing the budget. The Democrats, on \nthe other hand, I think, have the right priorities, and the priorities \nthat we are offered in this budget are not the priorities that the \nNation needs.\n  I add that I would feel much better about this if we had a balanced \nbudget amendment. I would feel better because we would have interest at \nleast 1 percent lower and that means, over a 7-year period, $170 \nbillion to spend on things that are needed in this country. And the \nirony is that some of the groups that fought the balanced budget \namendment are now having their programs hurt because we do not have a \nbalanced budget amendment. We need it also because our history is that \nwhen we adopt a program like this we keep it for about 2 years, as in \nGramm-Rudman--which I voted for--and then it becomes too politically \nawkward, and we lose it.\n  What is wrong in terms of the priorities that we have? For national \ndefense, we increase spending. We already are spending more than the \nnext eight countries in the world combined. If you go back to the 1973 \ndefense budget and add the inflation factor, we end up spending more \nmoney in fiscal year 1996 than we did in fiscal year 1973, and the \nBerlin Wall has fallen. You would never guess it, looking at the \nbudget. In 1973, we had troops in Vietnam. In 1973, we had almost twice \nas many troops in Europe. In 1973, we were building up our nuclear \narsenal. Now we are buying, including buying weapons the Defense \nDepartment says we do not need--B-2 bombers. They tell us it is a white \nelephant, yet we are going to go ahead, I assume. We will have a vote \non it, not with my vote, but we will go ahead and have B-2 bombers. We \nare going to spend $59.8 billion in an increase over where we are right \nnow on national defense.\n  International affairs, foreign aid. I recognize it is not popular. \nBut among the industrial nations of the world, do you know where we are \nin terms of percentage of our budget that we spend on foreign aid? We \nare dead last. And the great threat today is not a military threat. I \nwant a strong military, but the great threat is instability. And we are \nsaying in our budget we want to keep that military option as the \ngreater option to the economic option. It does not make sense.\n  What other nations today worry about is, frankly, not whether we have \nthe equipment technology and the manpower to respond. The question is \nwhether we have the backbone in the administration, in Congress, in the \nAmerican people, not in our Armed Forces. Cutting back foreign aid, \nthough it is politically popular, it is extremely shortsighted.\n  Education? I commend the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from \nMaine, for her amendment which added money back in for education. Yet, \nthis budget cuts back education a total of $67 billion. Every study--\nconservative, liberal, you name it--says what we ought to be doing for \nthe future of our country is we ought to be investing more in \neducation. Yet this budget does the opposite.\n  Medicaid? We hear a lot of Medicare. I agree with my colleagues who \nmake the speeches on Medicare. But frankly, I am more concerned about \nMedicaid because Medicaid is poor people. When we reduce the spending \non Medicaid $182 billion, let us keep in mind, half the people on \nMedicaid are children, poor children. Would the people of the United \nStates want us to cut back on that? I do not think so.\n  Tax cuts? I disagree with the Republicans. I disagree with the \nDemocrats on tax cuts. I do not think we ought to be having tax cuts \nwhen we have deficits. Would I like a tax cut? Of course. We all like \ntax cuts. But if I give myself a tax cut, I know I am hurting the \nfuture of my three grandchildren. Faced with that option, the American \npeople do not want a tax cut. Yet, both political parties are \npandering--that is what we are doing, pandering--on the tax cut. The \nSenate, assuming that you had interest reduction, would have given a \n$170 billion tax cut; the House, $345 billion; the conference is $245 \nbillion. Are we better off applying that to the deficit or applying it \nto education? I think, very clearly, the Nation would be much ahead if \nwe applied it to the deficit or to education.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have printed in the \nRecord a column by Robert Samuelson that appeared in the Washington \nPost called ``Macho Tax Cuts,'' and a New York Times editorial, ``The \nRich Get Richer Faster.''\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMacho Tax Cuts: Don't Believe It, They're Actually Tiny and Undesirable\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       Among Republicans, cutting taxes has always been macho. \n     Writing recently in the Wall Street Journal, House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich said the case for tax cuts rests on the ``key \n     principle'' of the Contract With America, which is: ``The \n     American government's money does not belong to the American \n     government. That money belongs to Americans, and it's time to \n     give Americans some of their own money back.'' It will surely \n     surprise most Americans to know that, once they've paid their \n     taxes, the money still belongs to them. But if so, why be \n     timid? Give all of it back. End taxation. Period.\n       The silliness of this rhetoric emphasizes the \n     undesirability of instant tax cuts. Taxes are the price of \n     government; they shouldn't be cut unless the budget is in \n     surplus. The populist pap that tax money belongs to ``the \n     people'' is simply the latest of many pretexts, advanced by \n     both parties, to prolong budget deficits. The money belongs \n     to ``the people'' until ``the people'' divert it to \n     government for purposes that, presumably, serve their needs. \n     If Americans want lower taxes, they'll have to ordain smaller \n     government.\n       These arguments are now relevant because, in the current \n     House-Senate conference to write a budget, tax cuts loom as \n     the largest disagreement. Between 1996 and 2002, the House \n     would cut taxes by $354 billion; the Senate would reduce \n     taxes only if balancing the budget provides extra revenues \n     through faster economic growth. The tax cuts taint otherwise \n     courageous budget proposals. Although the Republicans' plans \n     can be faulted on details, they broach the critical--often \n     unpopular--choices that must be faced to control spending and \n     deficits.\n       By contrast, the instant tax cuts feed the illusion that \n     people don't have to pay for government. It is, ironically, \n     the House Republicans who best discredit this false logic. In \n     a new book (``Restoring the Dream: The Bold New Plan by House \n     Republicans''), they call a balanced budget a ``moral \n     imperative'' to avoid burdening ``our children and our \n     children's children'' with a huge federal debt. If so, what's \n     the excuse for adding $354 billion to that debt, which under \n     the House plan would grow to $4.5 trillion in 2002, up from \n     $3.6 trillion in 1995?\n       One possible excuse is that Americans need to be bribed, \n     via lower taxes, to accept unpleasant spending cuts. Although \n     this is plausible, some public-opinion surveys actually \n     suggest just the opposite. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal \n     poll asked respondents to select priorities: Deficit \n     reduction (54 percent) ranked ahead of tax cuts (37 percent). \n     A CBS/New York Times poll similarly asked respondents to \n     choose deficit reduction or tax cuts: 56 percent picked lower \n     deficits and 40 percent lower taxes.\n       Mostly, the tax cuts indulge partisan symbolism--``hey \n     look, we shrunk government.'' In fact, this is highly \n     misleading, because the tax cuts would be tiny. They would \n     average about 3.8 percent for individuals and families, \n     estimates the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 2002 the \n     federal tax burden would be 18.2 percent of our economy's \n     output (gross domestic product), says the House Budget \n     Committee. If taxes weren't cut, the tax burden would be only \n     18.8 percent of GDP. (Indeed, the tax burden has been highly \n     stable since World War II. It averaged 17.6 percent of GDP in \n     the 1950s and 19 percent in the 1980s.)\n       The $354 billion of tax cuts are so small because, in the \n     same seven-year period, federal spending would total about \n     $12 trillion. For many Americans, the tax cuts would be \n     trivial or nonexistent. There's a $500 tax credit \n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\n     for each child under 18 in families with less than $200,000; \n     but that wouldn't affect 77 percent of taxpayers, says the \n     Joint Committee. There's modest relief (up to a $145 credit) \n     of the so-called marriage penalty, but that would apply to \n     only about 11 percent of taxpayers.\n       The obvious danger is the tax cuts could prevent a balanced \n     budget. The House plan rests on optimistic assumptions. \n     Economic growth is expected to rise and interest rates to \n     fall. They might not. Spending on Medicare--federal health \n     insurance for the elderly--is assumed to slow sharply. Even \n     if (a big if) legislation is passed to curb Medicare, the \n     desired savings might no materialize. Health spending has \n     routinely resisted precise forecasting.\n       The drive for lower taxes may also impel unwise spending \n     cuts. Defense is the federal government's first \n     responsibility. Is it adequately financed? Maybe not. It \n     would be virtually frozen for seven years with little \n     adjustment for inflation. In 2002, defense spending ($280 \n     billion under the House plan) would be about $45 billion \n     below the present ``base line.'' Republicans would also \n     transfer, via block grants, welfare, Medicaid and, possibly, \n     some food programs to states. But if block grants are set too \n     low, states will have to raise taxes or cut services sharply.\n       It is imprudent to cut taxes before the consequences of \n     these policies are better understood. Finally, tax cuts are \n     simply unfair before the budget is balanced. Until then, they \n     would mainly represent a transfer from the poor (whose \n     benefits are cut) to the well-to-do. About half the tax cut \n     of the House bill would go to the eighth of taxpayers making \n     more than $75,000 a year, who also pay about half the taxes. \n     Naturally, these people tend to vote Republican while the \n     poor don't.\n       The politics are straightforward, but in a cynical age, \n     they may not be shrewd. By and large, Americans see through \n     rhetorical ruses. If tax cuts are passed, people will \n     ultimately grasp that they don't amount to much. They will \n     feel (correctly) misused, especially if deficits persist. The \n     dilemma for House Republicans is that, having made an \n     unprincipled promise to cut taxes, they cannot change without \n     seeming to break their word. But it is better to admit a \n     mistake than to perpetuate it.\n       A balanced budget aims to restore discipline to \n     government--to revive traditional notions that choices must \n     be made, that people must pay for what they get and that \n     government must live within limits. Such discipline is not \n     just an accounting exercise. It is also a moral code. It \n     takes government seriously and seeks not only to eliminate \n     what it can't (or shouldn't) do but also to improve what it \n     should (and can) do. A lot of Republicans aren't there yet; \n     they're too busy, in Tarzan fashion, thumping their chests \n     and screaming: ``Me Tax Cutter.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 1995]\n\n                       The Rich Get Richer Faster\n\n       The gap between rich and poor is vast in the United \n     States--and recent studies show it growing faster here than \n     anywhere else in the West. The trend is largely the result of \n     technological forces at work around the world. But the United \n     States Government has done little to ameliorate the problem. \n     Indeed, if the Republicans get their way on the budget, the \n     Government will make a troubling trend measurably worse.\n       Some inequality is necessary if society wants to reward \n     investors for taking risks and individuals for working hard \n     and well. But excessive inequality can break the spirit of \n     those trapped in society's cellar--and exacerbate social \n     tensions.\n       After years of little change, inequality exploded in \n     America starting in the 1970's. According to Prof. Edward \n     Wolff of New York University, three-quarters of the income \n     gains during the 1980's and 100 percent of the increased \n     wealth went to the top 20 percent of families.\n       The richest 1 percent of households control about 40 \n     percent of the nation's wealth--twice as much as the figure \n     in Britain, which has the greatest inequality in Western \n     Europe. In Germany, high-wage families earn about 2.5 times \n     as much as low-wage workers; the number has been falling. In \n     America the figure is above 4 times, and rising.\n       Interpreting these trends requires caution. Inequality rose \n     here in the 1980's in part because the United States created \n     far more jobs--many low-paid--than did Western Europe. Low-\n     paying jobs are better than no jobs. Rising inequality in the \n     United States has also been caused in substantial part by \n     middle-class families that moved up the income ladder, \n     opening a gap with those below them.\n       About half of Americans move a substantial distance up or \n     down the income ladder over a typical five-year period. In a \n     mobile society, where workers rotate among high- and low-\n     earning jobs, earnings gaps are less frightening because any \n     given job would be less entrapping.\n       But mobility has offset none of the increased inequality in \n     income. Studies at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University \n     show that mobility in America is not higher than in Germany. \n     Nor does mobility here appear to be higher today than it was \n     in the early 1970's.\n       The best guess about the factor behind burgeoning \n     inequality is technology; the wage gap between high- and low-\n     skilled workers in America doubled during the 1980's. College \n     graduates used to earn about 30 percent more than high school \n     graduates, but now earn 60 percent more. Prof. Sheldon \n     Danziger of the University of Michigan estimates that trends \n     in private pay rates explain about 85 percent of recent \n     increases in inequality; Reagan-Bush tax cuts for the rich \n     and spending cuts for the poor explain much of the other 15 \n     percent.\n       But even if government is not the main actor, it could be \n     part of the solution. Changes in the Canadian economy during \n     the 1980's also hit hard at low-wage workers. But there the \n     Government stepped in to keep poverty rates on a downward \n     path. In the United States, poverty rose.\n       House Republicans are now pushing the Federal budget in the \n     wrong direction. At a time when employers are crying out for \n     well-educated workers, the G.O.P. proposes to cut back money \n     for training and educational assistance. America needs better \n     Head Start, primary and secondary education. It needs to \n     train high school dropouts and welfare mothers. The G.O.P. \n     policy would leave the untrained stranded. That would harm \n     the nation's long-term productivity--and further distort an \n     increasingly tilted economy.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, the goal of balancing the budget is \nnoble. I applaud that. I joined the Republicans when that vote was \nestablished in the Budget Committee. I went over and voted with the \nRepublicans for that. The priorities that we have in this budget, \nhowever, are wrong. I think we will have to reexamine this as we move \ninto reconciliation, as we move ahead. I will be here a year and a \nhalf. Within a year after I get out of this body, we will be shifting \naway from this goal unless we change the priorities. I think the goal \nis one we ought to be fighting for, and I hope we will shift the \npriorities.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have how much time remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 4 minutes and 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if someone on this side wants to take the \ntime now, fine. Otherwise, I will yield that remaining time. I yield \nthe time that remains to the Senator from Washington, and I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to yield an additional 4 minutes to \nthe Senator from Washington from the 6 hours remaining under the \nstatute on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is not clear from that when my colleague would want \nthat time. Does he want that time tonight?\n  Mr. SIMON. Now. We are talking about yielding 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have been asked by the Republican leader--you have 4 \nminutes. We have 2 minutes. Is that correct? The Senator can yield that \n4 minutes to her right now. Or he can wait and do a bigger package.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator from Washington indicates she would like to \nwait and take it a little later then.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Republican leader is here. If the leader would not \nmind, I have 2 minutes in which I would like to respond. Then we will \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes left. I will take it \nnow. I understand the other side will yield back this time, and we will \ngive the floor to the Republican leader at that time.\n  Mr. President, I think perhaps with all of the things said on that \nside of the aisle, I would like to make two points. It has always been \na problem with bodies such as this, legislative bodies in which \neverybody seems to be for the same idea, everybody seems to say we want \nto get to the same place. But the difficulty is to get them to go to \nthat place following the same path, to decide they want to do some \ntough things and to concede and compromise along the way.\n  So, Mr. President, I did not expect this U.S. Senate to unanimously \nagree on a balanced budget and then say we were doing it the right way. \nSo Americans should understand that is the way it is always done in \nbodies such as this. Everybody agrees on some principles, but how you \nget there only Senators can decide.\n  Second, the question has been asked on whose side is this budget or \nwhose side are we on? Mr. President, I say to the Senator and to the \nAmerican people, this budget is a budget for all Americans. We do not \nbelieve we want to pick and choose. We want a budget that is good for \nour country, we want a budget that is good for Americans, and we want a \nbudget that is good for our \n\n[[Page S9260]]\nchildren and for our grandchildren and children not yet born. We are \nconvinced we cannot spend on the programs that are currently part of \nAmerica at the same level, and give everybody everything they are \ngetting under current programs, and be a budget that is good for all \nAmericans, because the debt will continue, the interest rates will go \nup. And what it all boils down to it is that Americans will pay in the \nend with less of an economy, less good jobs, and less opportunities.\n  So I answer the question posed on that side of the aisle with a great \ndeal of pride, that this budget is good for America and the people of \nAmerica. We are not picking and choosing. We are producing a budget \nthat will make America a better place for everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this conference \nreport.\n  When Senator Domenici's budget resolution passed the Senate, I said \nit was a good accountant's budget. That is, it had the right bottom \nline, and it made some tough choices by eliminating Cabinet Departments \nand reducing spending. But in the end, it failed the test of priorities \nand values.\n  It cut Medicare service by $256 billion, which would reduce the \nessential Medicare health services for older Americans by nearly a \nquarter and place intense financial pressure on their children. And it \nweakened our future prospects by cutting education severely.\n  At the same time, the Senate budget left in place wasteful Federal \nprojects like courthouses, foreign spending like the so-called TV \nMarti, and luxury items like space telescopes. At the same time, it \nprovided a large tax cut whose benefits went primarily to wealthy \nindividuals and corporations rather than middle-income Americans.\n  So I voted against it. But I hoped that with some changes in these \npriorities areas it could be made acceptable.\n  Unfortunately, the opposite has happened.\n  Medicare will be cut by an additional $14 billion, threatening the \nwell-being of Montana's 125,000 senior citizens and the survival of \nMontana's rural hospitals.\n  Support for agriculture will decline by an additional $1.4 billion to \na total of $13.3 billion over 7 years. Per farm, that means \nagricultural supports will fall by $1,000 every year for the next 7 \nyears. And with 85 percent of American farms grossing under $100,000 \nper year, we will see a severe cut in income all over rural America.\n  Education will be reduced by $10 billion, meaning our children will \nbe less able to compete with our trade rivals abroad.\n  And wealthy people will get $75 billion more in tax breaks, which \ncomes directly from senior citizens, rural hospitals, agricultural \nproducers, and investment in education.\n  Finally, it is no longer a good accountant's budget. Senator \nDomenici's sober projections have been replaced by unrealistic rosy \nscenario assumptions about growth, interest rates, and so on. It is far \nless likely to lead to a balanced budget.\n  So this budget is significantly worse than the version the Senate \nvoted on last month. It is less disciplined. Less far-sighted. And more \ndamaging to senior citizens, rural America, and our future.\n  I oppose it, and I urge the conference committee to go back to the \ndrawing board and start over.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to reserve that \ntime for later in the debate without further charging to this side of \nthe aisle.\n  How much time is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five seconds.\n  Mr. DOLE. Five seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will yield that back.\n  [Laughter]\n  Mr. EXON. We do not yield ours back at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9236-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9260-S9261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been conferring throughout the day \nwith the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. I think we \nhave an arrangement that will satisfy most of our colleagues on both \nthe budget and regulatory reform and the program for the remainder of \nthe week.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 118, S. 343, the regulatory reform bill, \nand we have 1 hour of debate on S. 343 commencing as soon as we obtain \nthe consent.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject, but simply to clarify what I understand to be the \ncircumstances.\n  Senator Dole, the majority leader, and I have been talking about the \nopportunity for Senators to discuss the issue of regulatory reform and \nto do it in the context of S. 343 for the next hour. Then it would be \nour assumption that we could go back to it again sometime tomorrow and \ndiscuss it further. But it is also our understanding that there will \nnot be any amendments offered during this time, to accommodate the \neffort that is now underway on both sides in good faith off the floor \nto try to continue to work through some of the disagreements that may \ncontinue to exist with regard to the draft that Senator Dole and \nSenator Johnston and others have been working on.\n  It is with that understanding that I think this would be a very good \napproach and would offer no objection at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  There has been some progress. There have been a number of meetings. I \nam not certain whether either one of us can stand here and predict that \neverything is going to be worked out. I would guess the odds are that \nprobably not everything is worked out. But we had a bipartisan press \nconference today. We think there is an opportunity here for a \nbipartisan improvement. We may reach a point where we have to say, OK, \nwe will offer amendments and have the debate, up or down, and then \nproceed with the bill in that fashion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just clarify the majority leader's \nunderstanding as I have stated it, is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that between now and 5 p.m. we debate S. 343, \nand that the time be equally divided and then we go back to the budget \nresolution, and all time consumed this evening be subtracted from the \nstatutory time limitation on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. So, for the information of all Senators, there will be no \nfurther votes today. When the Senate completes its business this \nevening it will stand in recess until 9 a.m. on Thursday June 29, 1995; \nfollowing the prayer, the leaders' time will be reserved, and there \nwill be a period for the transaction of routine morning business not to \nextend beyond the hour of 10:30 a.m.\n  As I understand, there will be a Democratic caucus in the morning at \n9:30. So, I think there are requests for morning business. Then perhaps \nfollowing that caucus the two leaders would have further conversation. \nHopefully, we could proceed again for a period of time on S. 343, \nregulatory reform.\n  Then also, depending on the House action on the budget conference \nreport, we could eat up more time than the 10 hours. We now have 6 \nhours remaining on the budget, as I understand it.\n  So there will be no more votes tonight. We will try to accommodate \nmany of our colleagues who must travel long distances and who would \nlike to depart tomorrow evening. It is our hope that we could work that \nout. There may be a rescissions package. I understand it is still in \nnegotiation with the White House, with Senator \n\n[[Page S9261]]\nHatfield and Senator Byrd on this side and their House counterparts. If \nthat can be done, I hope we can get an agreement on the Senate side \nthat we do it by consent. Otherwise, it would be open to amendment and \nwe would be here for days. But I believe that if the White House, the \nPresident, and bipartisan leaders on appropriations can agree on a \npackage, perhaps we could obtain consent to do that. If we had to do \nthat Friday morning, perhaps we could do it without a vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That would be my hope as well. We have a lot of Senators \nwe are trying to accommodate. This is an important effort. It has been \nunder way now for a couple of weeks. We are so close, it would be nice \nto finish it and be convinced that it is our best product. Indeed, I \nthink it would be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I again thank the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle.\n  Mr. President, today we begin consideration of regulatory reform, one \nof the most important and fundamental reforms that this Congress will \naddress. No doubt about it, the American people are fed up with a \nregulatory state that is out of control. That was one of the messages \nthe American people delivered last November.\n  The regulatory state has become so pervasive that it lies on our \neconomy like a blanket, stifling innovation, and killing infant \nindustries and small businesses before they get off the ground. \nAlthough the Federal Government has a department for just about \neverything else, it does not have a department of lost opportunities. \nAnd that is what this is all about--getting the Government off the \nbacks of the American people; and letting them have an honest \nopportunity to succeed, for example, when they open a small business.\n  I want to note at the outset that the reforms before us are the \nproduct of over a decade of bipartisan work. The first major attempt at \nregulatory reform took place here in the Senate in 1982, when we passed \nS. 1080 unanimously. S. 1080 itself grew out of a bill I introduced in \n1981, again with bipartisan support.\n  S. 1080 contained sweeping revisions of the Administrative Procedures \nAct. Most of those revisions are included in the bill before us.\n  S. 1080 imposed a requirement that major rules be subjected to cots-\nbenefit analyses. The structure of the cost-benefit analyses in the \nbill we consider today closely follow those in S. 1080.\n  S. 1080 required judicial review of cost-benefit analyses in order to \nprovide meaningful enforcement. The bill before us does the same.\n  I have provided this brief history for two reasons. First, there are \nmany Senators still in this body on both sides of the aisle who \nsupported S. 1080 in 1982. And, second, there has been a concerted \nattempt by those who defend the status quo to ignore that history and \nact as if the bill under consideration today was a radically new \napproach with little thought for the consequences. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Every President since President Nixon, including President Clinton, \nhas issued an Executive order that imposed such requirements on \nagencies, though Executive orders are necessarily limited in scope and \ncannot provide for court enforcement, the bill we consider today draws \non two decades of agency experience with those Executive orders.\n  This bill is also the product of four major committees. I want to \nespecially commend the chairmen of those committees, Senators Hatch, \nRoth, Murkowski, and Bond, and their members for their hard work. This \nbill is the product of negotiations with the Clinton administration, \nand Democrat colleagues. From the beginning, it has had bipartisan \nsupport. I especially want to commend Senator Heflin for his leadership \nin working on the bill in the Judiciary Committee. And, finally, the \ntext of the bill we consider today is the product of weeks of work with \nSenator Johnston who has long championed reforms in risk assessment in \nthis body.\n  Given this history and broad bipartisan support, it might be \nsurprising that regulatory reform has been met with often strident \nopposition.\n  But this bill is about fundamental change--needed change--and those \nwho defend the status quo will fight it tooth and nail. Apparently, \nthey will do so without even pretending to read the legislation.\n  Let me be clear: These reforms will not place at risk human health or \nsafety or protection of the environment.\n  I understand that Ralph Nader and Joan Claybrooke are out running ads \nin part of the country that Senator Dole, the majority leader, is for \ndirty meat, for unhealthy meat. So we have a lot of these incredible \nstatements being made, but they have nothing to do with this bill.\n  And the bill before us makes this explicit in any number of \nprovisions. Those who argue otherwise should stop trying to scare \npeople and take the time to actually read the bill.\n  What opponents of regulatory reform really mean, but are embarrassed \nto admit, is that they believe that strong laws must always mean the \nmost costly laws. Now, they will not say that of course. No, they will \npay lip service to common sense. But as soon as you actually propose a \nway to consider costs and benefits, they switch subjects and accuse \nreformers of endangering human health and safety. I doubt anyone \noutside Washington, DC, who has to deal with regulations in their daily \nlives really believes that line anymore.\n  Mr. President, I have enough faith in our ingenuity to believe that \nwe can find better, smarter ways to achieve otherwise worthwhile goals.\n  Nor--as opponents of reform would phrase it--is this a debate about \nplacing a value on human life. The bill makes clear that there are \noften nonquantifiable benefits, and that an agency decisionmaker may \nwell have to make judgments that are not subject to quantification. \nWhat the bill demands is accountability, by insisting that the \ndecisionmaker articulate the basis for these judgments on the record. \nThe principles of judging risks and weighing costs and benefits are \nrational and widely used in our daily lives. What is unacceptable is to \nallow Government agencies to avoid these types of judgments when \nenacting regulations that impose huge costs on our economy.\n  These reforms are about limited government. For too long, \ndecisionmakers in Washington, DC, have acted as though bigger \ngovernment--taking more of our taxes and savings, and suppressing \nindividual initiative--could exist without more coercion and more \nrules. But that is wrong. For 40 years, the number and scope of \nregulations have skyrocketed out of control. The costs and annoyances \nof regulations have grown unbearable. And what is worse: We have not \neven attempted to use common sense in order to determine whether the \ncosts are worth it.\n  These reforms are about accountability. Open government. Forcing the \nGovernment to tell the rest of us why it chooses to regulate a certain \nway, and making it defend its choice. This aspect of regulatory reform \nis not often discussed, but I would argue that it may be the most \nimportant of all.\n  It has often been remarked by historians that the decline of great \ncivilizations--such as ancient Rome--is typically marked by an \noverabundance of bureaucracy that relied on secret, often \ncontradictory, rules. Eventually, the entire regulatory structure \nbrings progress to a standstill and it collapses of its own weight. It \nis no accident that we described complex, inscrutable procedures as \nbyzantine.\n  Mr. President, we are a long way from reaching that point certainly. \nBut we should understand that this is a battle that we will fight again \nand again. I, for one, intend to win this battle. The reforms we take \nup today are a giant step forward for common sense and our great \ncountry.\n  So I am pleased that we are on the bill. I thank my colleagues on the \nother side for not objecting to moving to the bill. We will have a \nbrief debate today. We will have a longer debate tomorrow and probably \nsome debate on Friday of this week. Hopefully, when we return from the \nJuly 4 recess, we will be able to finish this bill in the week \nfollowing the recess, because I think it is probably the most important \nlegislation we will have considered so far this year.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Senator from Utah to be \nin charge of the time on this side. I guess Senator Johnston will be in \ncharge of the time on that side.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, today we begin the debate on one of the most important \npieces of legislation this Congress will address this year: the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. This is a bill that will \nchange the way the Government does business.\n  It is high time that we respond to the American people's loud and \nclear demands that government become smaller and more streamlined--\ntheir demand \n\n[[Page S9281]]\nthat government become more responsive. It is high time that we realize \njust who is working for whom.\n  The fact that government often takes forever to carry out its \nfunctions; spends a fortune in doing so; at best inconveniences \ncitizens in the process; and yet still does not seem to get the job \ndone properly, is reason enough for this legislation.\n  It is high time that Congress acted to require government to act in a \ntimely, sensible, and rational manner.\n  If this bill becomes law, the Federal bureaucrats will, from now on, \nhave to prove to America that their regulations do more good than harm \nto society.\n  I submit that nothing could be more basic to our democracy and to our \nfederal system of government than the notion that the Federal \nGovernment should only act when it helps people and when its actions \nare justified. That is just plain common sense, and that is what this \nbill is about.\n  This bill forces the Federal bureaucracy to justify the costs of the \nrules and regulations that it places on hard-working Americans.\n\n\n                         i. the need for reform\n\n  I do not disagree that there is a need for some government \nregulation. Unfortunately, under the current system, there is little \nnotion of restraint or balance in the way that government agencies \noperate. The Federal bureaucracy has become bloated, inefficient, and \nwasteful. Excessive, needless government regulation is running rampant. \nIt has done tremendous damage to our economy, and it continues to do so \nevery year.\n\n\n                             a. statistics\n\n  The bottom line is that American people pay for this bureaucracy \nseveral times over.\n  First, of course, they have to pay for the salaries and other \nexpenses for the Federal agencies to operate. These direct \nexpenditures, of course, figure in to our budget. To the extent that \nsuch expenditures are not offset by cuts elsewhere, the cost of \nmaintaining the Federal bureaucracy adds to the national deficit and to \nthe national debt, which is already at about $18,500 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America.\n  Second, there are the hidden costs of complying with all this \nregulation. The American people have to pay to comply with the \nregulations the bureaucracy churns out. It has been estimated that \ncomplying with Federal regulation costs the average American family \n$4,000 a year. [The Heritage Foundation, citing Jonathan Adler, \n``Regulated . . . out of this world'', the Washington Times, June 3, \n1992].\n  And that is the low estimate. If you include indirect costs--such as \nincreased prices for goods and services because sellers are passing on \nsome of their regulatory burden to buyers--some estimates run as high \nas $8,000 to $17,000 a year. [William Laffer, the Heritage Foundation].\n  That is staggering, particularly when compared with the average \nannual income tax of $5,491 [IRS, 1992]. The costs of regulation are \noperating as a hidden tax on the system. Not only should that tax be \ncut, but the agencies should be made accountable so that the American \npeople know what they are paying and what they are getting.\n  Third, these costs have indirect consequences and impose opportunity \ncosts. It has been estimated that the costs of Federal regulation have \nreduced the total output of the Nation, the GDP, by nearly 6 percent. \n[Thomas Hopkins, ``Costs of Regulation: Filling the Gaps,'' citing a \nstudy by Hazilla and Kopp]. How does this happen?\n  It is simple enough. When businesses have to devote resources to \nmeeting a Federal directive, alternative--and more productive--uses of \nthose resources cannot be made. That means that the economy is slower, \nand jobs are lost because of regulatory excesses.\n  Mr. President, the status quo is simply unacceptable. Federal \nregulation is stifling the American Dream. It used to be said that \nAmerica was the land of opportunity, where the streets were paved with \ngold. Today, the streets are paved with redtape.\n\n\n                              b. examples\n\n  Where regulation is doing its jobs and is helping society, there is \nno problem. The supporters of beneficial regulations have nothing to \nfear from this bill. But, too often regulations not only fail to do the \njob, but also they are downright dumb. Those are the regulations that \nthis bill seeks to eliminate.\n  For example, there is a regulatory requirement that drive-through \ncash machines must be equipped with Braille pads. Now, how many blind \nAmericans are driving cars to drive-through ATMs? [The Heritge \nFoundation, citing Insight which was quoting TCF Bank Savings of \nMinneapolis Chairman William Cooper]. That type of regulation is simply \nridiculous on its face.\n  In another instance, a rancher was fined $4,000 for killing a grizzly \nbear that had eaten his sheep previously and was attacking him. [The \nHeritage Foundation, citing a Wall Street Journal article by Ike \nScrugg, dated June 23, 1993].\n  What is worse is that excessive regulations have often thwarted the \nvery ends those regulations seek to further. Take the case of the \nAbyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. That church struggled for 4 years \nto get approval for a Head Start Program in a newly renovated building. \nMost of those 4 long years was spent arguing with Federal bureaucrats \nconcerning the dimensions of rooms.\n  Now, we do not want Head Start Programs in unsafe facilities. I agree \nwith that. But, where is the common sense here? What exactly are we \ntrying to do? Provide early childhood educational opportunities for \nlow-income children? Or, keep regulators busy with their tape measures? \nClearly, we failed at the former and were a great success in the \nlatter. An entire generation of head starters were unable to \nparticipate in that valuable program.\n  This is really a shameful waste of resources that could have been \nprovided by this church in Harlem for the benefit of neighborhood \nchildren.\n  A representative from the church complained about the \nunresponsiveness of the people in Washington.\n  All the bureaucrats wanted to tell her, she said, was what could not \nbe done rather than what could be done. She said that when she told \nthem that they were talking about pieces of paper, and she was talking \nabout children, they did not seem to care. [``The Death of Common \nSense.''].\n  Mr. President, I believe this particular example is an excellent \nillustration of how our regulatory system has gone haywire. It is hard \nto believe that regulators do not care about children and their access \nto Head Start or any other kind of service.\n  But, this example clearly shows that our regulatory policy has become \nmore concerned with process than with outcomes. It has become so\n obessed with the objective that room size not deviate an inch from the \nFederal standard that it has completely lost sight of what Head Start \nis supposed to accomplish.\n\n  I have to believe that similar examples of form over substance exist \nat the Department of Labor, the EPA, the Interior Department, and just \nabout every other Federal agency.\n  Regulation has also reached deep into our smallest businesses. Take \nthe case of Dutch Noteboom. Mr. Noteboom is 72 years old and has owned \na small meat-packing plant in Springfield, OR, for 33 years.\n  Despite the fact that Mr. Noteboom employs only four people, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has one full-time inspector on his premises. \nAnother inspector spends over half his time there. This level of \nattention is astonishing and must be extremely costly.\n  Mr. Noteboom says that he is swimming in paperwork, and that he does \nnot even know a tenth of the rules. He says, ``You should see all these \nUSDA manuals.'' [``The Death of Common Sense''].\n  Well, I have seen some of the Government's manuals and regulations \nand they are shocking in their length and complexity.\n  Consider, for example, the Federal regulations on the sale of \ncabbage. Now, the Gettysburg Address is 286 words in length, and the \nDeclaration of Independence contain 1,322 words. But Government \nregulations on the sale of cabbage total an eye-popping 26,911 words. \n[Heritage, citing a letter from Congressman McIntosh to Grover \nNorquist].\n  I am frankly wondering just how much there is to restrict about the \nsale of cabbage that would justify nearly 27,000 words. I had my staff \ndo a quick \n\n[[Page S9282]]\ncalculation: 27,000 words is approximately the same length as the \nFederalist Papers Nos. 1 through 15. We have transformed regulatory \ncompliance into an industry all by itself. We have gone from simple \nrules that reasonable people could understand and comply with to a Code \nof Federal Regulations that by itself takes up a whole wall of shelf \nspace--not counting other agency guidance and field memos. We forget \nhow fast is mount up.\n  Could I ask how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield 1 more minute to me, and the rest of my time \nto Senator Roth, after Senator Johnston finishes.\n  Since 27,000 words is approximately the same length as the Federalist \npapers Nos. 1 through 15, how can there be any question that we have \ngone too far?\n  Mr. President, Mr. Noteboom's story highlights another major mutation \nof U.S. regulatory policy.\n  I can go on and on, but the point I am making is this: They are \ntaking away our properties, our private properties, and interfering \nwith small business. They are hurting people and stopping kids from \ngetting the care they need. And, frankly, it is all because of \nridiculous regulations in large part written by people who are not \nthinking about what is best for the American people and what is cost \nefficient in doing so. This bill will make a terrific difference. It \nwill make our bureaucrats better and make us better. And, frankly, it \nis high time we did it.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Kansas, our \nmajority leader, and also my good friend and colleague from Louisiana, \nwho both worked long and hard to get together, and a whole raft of \nothers. I will put their names in the Record by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Robert Simon be given \nthe privilege of the floor for the pendency of S. 343 and any votes \nthereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hatch, \nas well as Senator Dole, and their staffs, and Senator Roth, and others \non the other side of the aisle, for making this bill and the \nnegotiation on it thus far a true bipartisan effort.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill was, indeed, the product of last \nCongress' risk assessment legislation, which I sponsored, as well as S. \n1020, which dealt with regulatory reform from earlier in the 1980's. \nSince that time, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Dole, and I, worked together over a period of some 10 hours--\nexcuse me--12 hours of direct negotiation in working out what we called \nthe Dole-Johnston draft, discussion draft. Since that was filed in the \nRecord, we have spent an additional--or at least I have spent 20 hours \nin negotiation with both Republicans and Democrats, seeking to work out \nthe problems in that draft.\n  All of our problems have not yet been worked out. But if I may give \nmy colleagues and others the state of play on it, I think the mood is \nthere, the will is there, and I think eventually substantial agreement \ncan be arrived at, dealing with nine major points:\n  First, judicial review. The argument about judicial review is now not \nabout the principle, it is about the language. I believe our language \nachieves the result. We will continue to listen, but I believe it \nachieves the result that everyone wishes.\n  Supermandate has been eliminated from the bill. I believe that is \nalso clear. And both sides agree that underlying statutes are not \nsuperseded. Whatever the requirements of the Clean Air Act are, for \nexample, are still in place. And we believe that the language of the \ndraft now reflects that. We are willing to work further to clarify \nthat--not to clarify, but to reassure Senators that that is so.\n  With respect to decisional criteria, Mr. President, I believe that \nfrom our side of the aisle the language now in the draft fully gives \nthe discretion to the agencies that we wish.\n  I call attention of my colleagues to the language of section 624, \nwhich states certain requirements, such as the benefits rule to justify \nthe cost. But it goes on to say that if scientific, technical, or \neconomic uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to the health or \nsafety of the environment identified by the agency in the rulemaking \nrecord make a more costly alternative that achieves the objective of \nthe statute appropriate and in the public interest, and the agency head \nprovides an explanation of that, that they may chose the more costly \nalternative.\n  Mr. President, we will listen to further elucidation on this.\n  But it seems to me that this is a complete victory for those on our \nside of the aisle who have always said the difficulty with risk \nassessment is sometimes scientific uncertainty, where scientists do not \nagree in some areas, where the data is uncertain or where you have \nvalues that are nonquantifiable by their nature, such as the value of \nlife, the value of good health, the value of environment, the value of \nclean air which are, by their nature, nonquantifiable.\n  As I say, the theme, the idea is there, and I believe is clear. But \nto the extent it is not, we are certainly willing to negotiate, I \nbelieve, on both sides of the aisle. The question, again, is not \nwhether to grant discretion for these things, but rather the question \nis how best to phrase the language.\n  With respect to petition, appeal on that petition, sunset, \nconsolidation, we believe, Mr. President, that we now have complete \nagreement on that. It covers the issue of agency overload, and we will \nsoon be filing in the Record language that will reflect that agreement. \nAnything, of course, is subject to further wordsmithing, but we believe \nboth Democrats and Republicans have arrived at a decision in that very \ndifficult area.\n  With respect to effective date, I hope we can come to agreement on \nthat. On the Democratic side, we do not want to have to go back and \nredo regulations which have, in some cases, been 2 or 3 years in the \nmaking. On the Republican side, the concern has been that they do not \nwant to have a flood of new regulations come in at the last minute to \nescape the requirements of this bill. I believe effective date can be \nappropriately worked out and pick some date such as July 1 of this \nyear.\n  With respect to threshold, I believe the threshold should be 100 \nmillion, and 50 million is now in the bill. I believe also that is a \ndoable thing. My prediction is that we will end up agreeing on 100 \nmillion with some language with respect to small business because small \nbusiness has really been a concern here. At least I am in good hopes we \ncan agree on that.\n  I hope we can agree to drop Superfund at some point. Not that anybody \nthinks a process of risk assessment should not be applicable to \nSuperfund, it should definitely be applicable to Superfund, but we \nbelieve that is best done by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, working their will against special requirements of the \nSuperfund site. To put it in this bill, I believe, would be very \ndifficult.\n  With respect to toxic release inventory, the language now in the \nDole-Johnston draft, I believe, can be much improved. It, in turn, was \nan improvement over the Judiciary Committee draft. Frankly, we are \nwaiting for some kind of improvement language that we hope will solve \nthis problem.\n  Toxic release inventory is a high-profile issue, but I believe, in \nterms of importance of the issue, it is clearly one of the lesser \nissues in this bill and should not stand in our way of getting a bill.\n  The final point I have has to do with the Delaney rule. We greatly \nimprove the Judiciary Committee draft on the Delaney rule. The language \nnow in the Dole-Johnston draft says that an administrator or an agency \nhead cannot fail to license a chemical if it has negligible or \ninsignificant foreseeable risk to human health resulting from its \nintended use. It seems to me that this ought to be the standard. It is \na good standard. I have heard no defense of keeping the Delaney rule as \nit is, and I submit that the votes will be on the floor to change the \nDelaney rule.\n  Our request is that those who think the standard we have in this \ndraft is not appropriate should come up with \n\n[[Page S9283]]\nalternative language which we are happy to consider. We have given \nnotice of consideration of alternative language now for a week or two, \nand I have not yet received it. So I urge people who want that to be \nreconsidered to please submit language.\n  The point I am making, Mr. President, is that the most difficult \nthings about this bill--things like decisional criteria, judicial \nreview, supermandate--have been agreed upon in principle, and the \nproblem now is to determine language that carries out the principle.\n  We all understand that language and wordsmithing in this area is very \nimportant, is crucial, is critical, and we will continue to negotiate \nto seek very precise language that carries this out, and we solicit \nthat from both sides of the aisle.\n  But, Mr. President, frankly, given the attitudes on both sides of the \naisle, I believe it is going to be possible to come to those \nagreements, not with all Senators. We are not going to get 100 votes, \nbut I believe that there is a real possibility for a broad consensus, \nand I am happy to be part of the group that is putting together what I \nconsider to be the most important bill in this field that has ever been \nenacted by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes 51 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana for the constructive role he has \nplayed in the effort to bring the two sides together. Like him, I am \noptimistic that we are going to be able to fashion legislation that \nwill satisfy the large majority on both sides of the aisle.\n  I, frankly, can think of no legislation of more critical importance, \nboth from the standpoint of enforcement of the legislation or statutes \non the books, but also from getting a better bang for the taxpayers' \nbuck. So, again, I congratulate and thank the distinguished Senator for \nhis contribution.\n  Mr. President, today marks a milestone in the effort to build a \nsmarter, more effective regulatory process. From all quarters, \nAmericans are calling for change from the often overbearing and \ncounterproductive regulatory monolithic that has grown out of control \nthese past couple of decades. President Clinton has admitted that many \nregulations, regulations that are costing our Nation billions of \ndollars, are bad regulations.\n  George McGovern has described in brilliant detail how overbearing \nregulations put him out of business when all he was trying to fulfill \nwas the dream of being an entrepreneur of owning his own New England \ninn.\n  Economists are telling us that Federal regulations are costing our \nhouseholds some $6,000 annually, costing our country about $600 billion \na year, and this at a time when our policies must be those that make \nour Nation competitive abroad, economically secure at home and \nconfident within our families.\n  Financial costs are not the only burden. As we move further into the \ninformation age, the old adage, ``Time is money,'' rings truer than \never before. Time alone is becoming one of America's most vital \neconomic resources. In a competitive world of instant information, a \nworld where time is measured in cyberseconds, businesses, \nentrepreneurs, service providers, researchers, scientists, farmers, and \nothers must be able to accelerate their response time in providing \ntheir services and bringing new products to market.\n  In our age of information, time is often the difference between \nprofit and loss. But today, Federal regulations, like cholesterol \nclogging a vital artery, not only slow down the process but often \ndisrupts it. Well over 5 billion hours--I repeat--well over 5 billion \nhours a year are spent by our private sector just trying to meet \ngovernment paperwork demands.\n  The legislation we are considering today, S. 343, the comprehensive \nregulatory reform act of 1995, is a real and workable solution to the \nproblems being expressed on both sides of the aisle. That is why I am \nsupporting this legislation. It is the most comprehensive reform of the \nregulatory process since the enactment of the Administrative Procedure \nAct of 1946. Since then, efforts to reform Federal regulations have \nbeen like a man trying to save himself by running up the aisle in the \nopposite direction on a runaway train. What this legislation does, Mr. \nPresident, is get that runaway train under control and places it back \non the right track.\n  This legislation substantially changes the requirements for the \nissuance of Federal regulations. It requires regulators to directly \nconsider whether the benefits of a new regulation would justify its \ncost. Regulators who want to issue environmental and health and safety \nregulation regulations under this legislation have to make realistic \nestimates of the risks to be addressed. They have to disclose to the \npublic any assumptions they make to measure the risk.\n  The bill encourages agencies to set priorities to achieve the \ngreatest overall risk reduction at the least cost. More generally, this \nbill requires agencies to review existing regulations, to be sensitive \nto the cumulative regulatory burden, and to select the most cost \neffective, market-driven method feasible.\n  This, Mr. President, is smarter regulation. Smarter regulation \nbenefits us all--our farmers, our businesses of all sizes; it benefits \nState and local government, and, most important, it benefits the \nconsumer, the wage earner, the taxpayer, and the family.\n  I support this legislation because it is a reform of Federal \nregulations, not a rollback. And the distinction is extremely \nimportant. I am an environmentalist and honored to be called an \nenvironmentalist. On this floor, I have fought many battles to stop \nocean dumping and incineration, to preserve the northern coastal plain \nof Alaska, to protect forests and precious wildlife. I can say with \npride that Federal regulations have made our air cleaner. They have \nmade our water purer, and they have improved conditions in our cities, \nlakes, and along our shores.\n  Regulation in itself is not bad. The problem is that the huge \nregulatory enterprise, like that runaway train, has gained so much \ninertia these past few decades that it is posing a real and dangerous \nthreat to our future. What we are looking for is balance, and this \nlegislation provides that balance. It will restore common sense to the \nregulatory process.\n  This legislation helps us achieve necessary regulation in the most \nflexible and cost-effective way possible. We have learned with \nexperience that regulations often have been more costly and less \neffective than they could have been. This legislation addresses that \nproblem by making Government more efficient, more effective. I believe, \nas best they can, regulators should issue regulations whose benefits \njustify their cost. I believe that a fair, commonsense test requiring \nthat the benefits of a regulation justify its cost should be consistent \nwith environmentalism, not contrary to it.\n  Environmentalists and conservationists have long recognized that we \nlive in a world of limited resources. In this vein, we must use those \nlimited resources to achieve the greatest benefit at the least cost. \nThis is absolutely consistent with our objectives.\n  Throughout my career, Mr. President, I have advocated reducing \nGovernment waste and inefficiency. I have led efforts to reduce waste \nin Government procurement practices, particularly in defense contracts. \nAt the time, some critics suggested that I was undermining support for \na strong military. How could I support a strong military, they asked, \nif I challenged the practices of the Department of Defense? The answer \nwas simple. I pushed for reform to make the Department of Defense work \nbetter, reform to make it more efficient and effective in carrying out \nits mission. And toward this end, we have been successful. Our reform \nof the procurement process improved the department. DOD was \nstrengthened as precious resources were spared to be used much more \nefficiently and effectively.\n  In the same way, as a committed environmentalist, I want to reduce \nthe inefficiency of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as \nother Federal \n\n[[Page S9284]]\nagencies that serve the public interest. Some critics suggest that we \ncannot support strong cost benefit analysis, and the Dole-Johnston \ncompromise bill requires and still favors protecting the environment, \nhealth and safety, but these critics are wrong. Without effective \nregulatory reform, the EPA and other agencies will not carry out their \nmission in an efficient and effective manner.\n  Mr. President, this legislation simply requires commonsense in the \nregulatory process. We should require no less. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this commonsense legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio, with the understanding that he will yield some time to Senator \nLevin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 13 minutes \ntotal remaining.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I hope that when the press writes about \nwhat happened on the floor today, they get away from the idea that this \nis the ultimate in confrontation, which seems to be what the questions \nlead to when we go out of the Chamber--talking about regulatory \nreform--because, today, I would hope the message would go out that we \nare united in the Senate of the United States, Democrat and Republican, \non one thing: we need regulatory reform.\n  Sometimes we get strident here and give people the wrong impression. \nBut we have a need for regulatory reform, and that is felt by those who \nhave been negotiating on the particulars of this legislation over the \npast several days. So the importance of regulatory reform is well \nunderstood, and we all share in a devotion to what we are trying to do \nhere.\n  I think a lot of people wonder why we have regulations and rules. We \nneed to remember that we pass laws here on the Senate floor, in the \nCongress, that are signed by the President requiring agencies to issue \nrules. After we pass laws, rules and regulations written by the \nagencies become applicable in every community across this country.\n  I say to those listening that your children today, your family today, \ncan have milk that is safe because of rules and regulations. You can \neat food that is safe. You do not have to worry about it, because of \nrules and regulations to ensure safety to public health. \nTransportation, whether by air, bus, or plane, comes under certain \nrules and regulations that let your family travel safely.\n  The problem is that we have gone too far in some of these matters \nwith some rules, and some regulation writers have been overzealous.\n  So we have come full circle in needing to put a rein on some of the \nrules and regulations. We need to set up new processes for making sure \nthat we do not get into the quagmires of where we do not use common \nsense. Some of them are ridiculous. We can all cite anecdotal evidence.\n  On the Governmental Affairs Committee, we started working on what was \nlandmark regulatory reform, doing a study back in 1977. This issue is \nnot something that is brand new. Through the years, we dealt with OMB \nand OIRA, and it has been an open process.\n  While I was chair of the committee, we had a number of hearings, and \nthis year, Senator Roth, our chairman this year, has had four hearings \non our bill, S. 291. We took a bipartisan and deliberative approach to \nit and voted that bill out of committee, unanimously, 15-0. Republicans \nand Democrats united together.\n  Any bill must have a balance. On the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nI believe we achieved that balance. I would like to run through very \nbriefly some of the central issues for regulatory reform in the limited \ntime I have here today.\n  My approach, and the approach taken by our committee, on regulatory \nreform is the following: First, agencies should be required to perform \nrisk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for all major rules; second, \ncost-benefit analysis should inform agency decisionmaking, but it \nshould not override other statutory rulemaking criteria; third, risk \nassessment requirements should apply only to major risk assessments, \nand these requirements must not be overly prescriptive; fourth, \nagencies should review existing rules, but the reviews should not be \ndictated by special interests; fifth, Government accountability \nrequires sunshine in the regulatory review process; sixth, judicial \nreview should be available to ensure the final agency rules are based \non adequate analysis; it should not be a lawyer's dream with unending \nways for special interest to bog down agencies with litigation; \nseventh, regulatory reform should not be the fix for every special \ninterest.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana mentioned a number of \nthe areas that are still in contention with this legislation. While we \nwill have to work these issues out, we are all united in the need for \nregulatory reform.\n  The decision criteria: Will it be least cost, or will it be the cost \neffectiveness? Judicial reform has yet to be ironed out completely. Can \nwe get a threshold of $100 million? How about the petition process, the \nsunset, special interest additions? These are issues we still need to \nwork together on. We have yet to iron out exactly how we do these \nthings.\n  Mr. President, any bill on the subject of regulatory reform to be \ndeserving of support must pass a test. This test is twofold. I close \nwith this: No. 1, does the bill provide for reasonable, logical, \nappropriate changes to regulatory procedures that eliminate unnecessary \nburdens on businesses and individuals? No. 2, at the same time, does \nthe bill maintain the ability to protect the health, the safety, and \nthe environment of the American people?\n  Now, that is a dual test that is very simple, and one we need to keep \nin mind as we debate this legislation. If the answer is ``yes,'' to \nboth questions, the bill should be supported. Any bill that relieves \nregulatory burdens but threatens the protections for the American \npeople in health or safety or environment should be opposed.\n  I will come back to this test many times when we debate regulatory \nreform the rest of this week and after the Fourth of July break.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana for yielding time. I yield the \nbalance of my time to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me commend all those involved in this effort. It is a \nvery complicated effort, and most importantly perhaps, an essential and \nbipartisan effort. It has been that way from the beginning. I hope it \nstays that way throughout this process.\n  The original bill which was introduced was flawed. It did not achieve \nboth goals we need to achieve, which is regulatory reform, to make this \nprocess more responsive to cost, to allow Members to review rules. We \nall, I hope, want to do that.\n  We all, I hope, want cost effective rules. We all, I hope, want to \ntry to protect some basic health, safety, and environmental concerns. \nAnd I think we all believe that we can achieve all of that.\n  The original bill which was introduced in the bill that is now \npending had some real limitations in those regards. The Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator leader, the majority leader, and people on \nboth sides of the aisle worked to come up with a substitute. I think \nthey made some significant progress. They should be commended for it.\n  After that happened, there were a number of deficiencies that were \npointed out by various people--the Senator from Louisiana and others \nwho were open to the process of considering suggestions to improve \ntheir product--and we have made some significant progress in our \nprivate discussions to improve the so-called Dole-Johnston substitute.\n  Right now, assuming that the language is agreed upon, even though we \nhave only reached two or three of the key nine issues, there has been \nsome significant changes in that draft, which I think most of the \npeople that have been involved in these negotiations, say represent \nimprovements.\n  Now, there are still some outstanding issues. For instance, the \nmajority leader and others have said ``We don't want a supermandate.'' \nThis bill is intended to supplement and not to supersede.\n  Some have raised the question, what happens if the material in this \nbill, which is intended to supplement, conflicts with what it is \nintended not to supersede. Then what? \n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\n  We are assured that the underlying legislation governs. Some have \nsaid ``Why don't we just simply say that?'' The answer has been, \n``There is no need to because there is no conflict,'' yet the concern \nremains, and we are trying to figure out language which will address \nthe concern of those who want to be sure that what the Republican \nleader says is the intent, the majority leader says is the intent--that \nthere not be a supermandate, in fact, implemented in this bill.\n  We made some real progress in the so-called petitions area. Before \nthis progress was made, I am afraid we were going to substitute a \njudicial quagmire for what is already a complicated regulatory process.\n  Nobody is benefited if we throw to the drowning folks who are \ndrowning in regulations another bucket of water. What they need is a \nlifeline, not another complicating superstructure of judicial \nconsideration.\n  That is what I am afraid we were about to do in the so-called \npetition area, until we had some very fruitful discussions, which have \nnow, I think, reached a point where we can hope to avoid adding a \njudicial superstructure of huge complication to a regulatory process.\n  Mr. President, I am glad that these discussions are going to \ncontinue. I want to commend, particularly, Senator Glenn, Senator Roth, \nothers on the Governmental Affairs Committee who have worked on the \nGovernmental Affairs bill which contained so many elements of the bill \nwhich we are going to consider during the days that we do consider \nregulatory reform.\n  We need regulatory reform. We must have cost benefit analysis. We \nneed risk assessment. But we also need to be sure that what we are \nachieving protects, in a sensible way, the environment and the health \nand the safety of the people of the United States.\n  Some people say, ``Why don't you just have the cheapest regulation \nautomatically?'' Well, the answer is because the cheapest may not be \nthe most cost effective. Just like the cheapest pair of shoes is not \nthe sensible pair of shoes. The cheapest car is not the best car to \nbuy, or else we would all be driving Yugos.\n  We need cost-benefit analysis, but that assumes that something which \nis slightly more costly might have huge benefits, and in that case we \nsurely want to be able to consider the cost effectiveness of the \nregulation and not be required to always go with what is the cheapest, \nbecause that may not be the most cost effective.\n  I think there is kind of an understanding, almost a consensus that \nthat is correct; that we do not want to be driven always to the \ncheapest, that a marginal increase might be sensible and might achieve \nsome great benefits and that ought to be permitted under this process.\n  Let me close by again commending my colleagues on Governmental \nAffairs, Senators Glenn and Roth and others; the majority leader and \nSenator Daschle have been critical in this, Senator Johnston, Senator \nHatch, and others--so many who have been involved in getting us where \nwe are today. We are making progress. I hope that progress will be \nallowed to continue and will not be thwarted in any way that is \ninconsistent with what our common goal is.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized. All \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nproceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle who have been involved in this negotiation, particularly \nSenator Levin, Senator Glenn, Senator Biden, Senator Baucus, Senator \nKerrey, and Senator Lautenberg especially, who have contributed so much \nin bringing the draft up to where it is now.\n  As I say, it is not a done deal yet in terms of satisfying everyone's \nconcerns, but it is much, much closer to that than when the Judiciary \nCommittee bill started out.\n  Mr. President, I am advised it is the majority leader's intention \nFriday afternoon to withdraw the committee amendments to S. 343 and \nsend the substitute to the desk. That substitute is, in effect, the \nDole-Johnston discussion draft filed a few days ago, which is being \nsupplemented by the agreement identified by myself and Senator Levin, \nand with other modifications which we have worked on during these \nhours.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record tonight, \nwhen submitted to the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 33, beginning with line 5, strike all through the \n     end of the bill and insert the following:\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I understand that will be the pending \nbusiness when the Senate returns from recess. In the meantime, we will \ncontinue to discuss this package with our colleagues and, hopefully, \nwill be able to arrive at further modifications along the lines we have \ntalked about. I believe those negotiations will happen tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, there was a \nunanimous-consent agreement that had been entered into previously \nbetween Senator Dole and Senator Daschle. Is there any intent in what \nthe Senator from Louisiana has just said to modify in any way the \nprevious unanimous-consent agreement that had been entered into?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, the only unanimous consent I asked is that when \nthis draft is prepared, that it be printed in the Record for notice. \n\n[[Page S9296]]\n\n  The majority leader, I was just informed, will ask on tomorrow \nafternoon--I did not ask unanimous consent but I was just advised that \nhe would ask for permission to withdraw the committee amendments to S. \n343 and send a substitute to the desk.\n  I am not asking that be done. I was just giving the Senate notice \nbecause his staff just gave me that notice. I wanted to make the Senate \naware of that.\n  I hope tomorrow we can reassure Senators on matters, or change that \nwhich needs to be changed, and get a very broad consensus bill so when \nwe come back after the recess we will have a bill that passes \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, I said a moment ago Senator Dole intended to put in \nthe substitute tomorrow afternoon. I meant on Friday afternoon, because \nthat is what he meant. I wanted to give my colleagues notice of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9261-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9296-S9304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume debate on the conference report to House Concurrent \nResolution 67, the budget resolution for fiscal year 1996.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to voice my strong \nsupport for the budget conference report, which I believe is a historic \ndocument that looks forward and not back; one that promises freedom, \nnot Government servitude; and one that delivers hope and not despair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes, go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we are going to be on this \nresolution for 1 hour now; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not an hour to end the debate, or to \nbegin debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will be going back and forth? I ask the Senator, how \nmuch time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. GRAMS. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, talking about the budget, this historic \nbudget is a budget unlike any other approved by Congress in more than a \nquarter of a century because, not only does it balance the budget \nwithin 7 years without raising taxes, it actually cuts taxes for \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  It marks the first time since 1969 that Congress has committed itself \nto a balanced budget, and reflects the change demanded by the voters in \nNovember: Get government off our backs and out of our back pockets.\n  Mr. President, our budget resolution provides $245 billion in tax \nrelief, making it the largest tax refund in history.\n  I am proud that the centerpiece of the tax relief package will be the \n$500 per-child tax credit originally proposed by me and my very good \nfriend from Indiana, Senator Coats, in our families-first legislation, \nand by Representative Tim Hutchinson in the House.\n  Along with my freshman colleague, Senator Abraham, and the leadership \nof Senator Dole, we have ensured that this Senate goes on record \nsupporting middle-class tax relief, and incentives to stimulate \nsavings, investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n  And, Mr. President, this tax relief could not have come at a better \ntime.\n  Government has become a looming presence in the lives of the American \npeople, mostly through the encouragement of Congress.\n  Each year, the people are asked to turn more and more \nresponsibilities over to the Federal Government--for Government \nregulation, for Government support.\n  From the time they get up in the morning till the time they go to bed \nat night, there are very few aspects of daily American life that are \nnot touched by the hand of government.\n  So government has been forced to grow just to keep up.\n  Consider that government spending at the Federal State, and local \nlevels has jumped from less than 12 percent of national income in the \n1930's to more than 42 percent today.\n  And the burden for keeping these ever-ballooning bureaucracies in \noperation has fallen on the taxpayers, of course--through more and \nhigher taxes.\n  As a sign of just how big the Federal Government has grown--and how \nthe number of tax dollars sent to Washington have grown right along \nwith it--look what has happened to the IRS.\n  Today, it has an annual operating budget in excess of $7.5 billion. \nIf it were a private company, its gross receipts--more than $1 \ntrillion--would put it at the top of the Fortune 500 list.\n  All that--just by processing tax dollars.\n  Most middle-class American families pay more in Federal taxes than \nthey spend for food, clothing, and shelter combined.\n  Families with children are now the lowest after-tax income group in \nAmerica--below elderly households, below single persons, below families \nwithout children.\n  Since 1948, when Americans paid just 22 cents per dollar of their \npersonal income in taxes, the Gallup organization has asked Americans \nwhat they think about the taxes they pay.\n  That first year, 57 percent of the people said yes, taxes are too \nhigh. Today, nearly 50 cents of every dollar earned by middle-class \nAmericans goes to taxes of some sort--and 67 percent of the people say \nthey're handing over too much of their own money to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  They might feel differently if they were getting a fair return on \nthen investment. But Americans see their hard-earned dollars being \nwasted by the Federal Government. They look at the services they are \ngetting in return and they feel like they are being taken to the \ncleaners.\n  The 1993 tax bill offered by President Clinton did not help, either. \nAs the largest tax increase in American history, it hit middle-class \nAmericans right where it hurt the most--their wallets.\n  The President's 1993 tax hike actually increased their tax burden, \nmaking it more difficult for the middle class to care for themselves \nand their children.\n  And I remind you--not a single Republican voted for it.\n  The tax burden has become so heavy in my home State of Minnesota that \nit took until May 14 this year--134 days into 1995--for us to finally \nreach Tax Freedom Day.\n  That is the day when Minnesotans are no longer working just to pay \noff taxes, and can finally begin working for themselves. Nearly 20 \nweeks, over 800 hours on the job just to pay Uncle Sam and his cousins \nat the State level.\n  In order to pay all these taxes, Americans are spending more time on \nthe job. Within the past three decades, the average American has added \nabout 160 hours annually to their work schedule. That is about 4 extra \nweeks of work a year.\n  They are overworked, overstressed, and they are moonlighting more \nthan ever before.\n  In 1995, one in six Americans holds more than one job. One out of \nevery three is regularly working on weekends and evenings. And it is \nnot because they necessarily want to--it is because they must.\n  A significant number of families are relying on that second job just \nto pull themselves above the poverty line and meet their annual tax \nobligations.\n  The majority of families who have reached a middle-class standard of \nliving are families relying on two incomes. They are still pursuing the \nAmerican dream, but the ever-increasing tax burden keeps pushing it out \nof reach.\n  Imagine what those longer work hours are doing to the family. Or \nbetter yet, listen to taxpayers like Natalie Latzska-Wolstad of Coon \nRapids, MN, who struggle with the demands of family life, the job, and \nthe Government--while pursuing their own version of the American Dream.\n  I went to the floor of the Senate last month to talk about Natalie \nand her family, after she wrote me a moving letter about the enormous \ntax burden her family is forced to bear.\n  It hit home for Natalie after she and her husband met with their \nrealtor, only to learn that they simply could not afford to purchase a \nnew home on their own.\n  Let me quote just a few paragraphs from Natalie's letter: ``I have \nfinally reached the point of complete frustration and anger over the \namount of taxes being deducted from my check each month,'' she wrote.\n\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\n       When we got home that evening my husband and I sat down \n     with our checkbook and our bills and tried to determine what \n     we were doing wrong.\n       After taking everything into consideration we determined \n     that we weren't spending our money foolishly.\n       The only real problem we found was when we looked at our \n     paycheck stubs and actually realized how much of our income \n     was going to pay for taxes.\n       It saddens me to think of how hard my husband and I work \n     and how much time we have to spend away from our daughter to \n     be at work, and still we cannot reach the American dream.\n\n  This is a disturbing letter, and I am even more troubled knowing it \nis just one of hundreds I have received from across the country. I know \nyou have heard some Senator on the floor say: Americans do not want tax \nrelief. I do not know who they are talking to, or who is writing them \nletters. But I hear something completely different from the people that \nI get letters from. Here is another example.\n  From California:\n\n       Our families desperately need tax relief, and our \n     Government needs to stop spending so wastefully.\n  From Georgia:\n\n       I want to personally thank you for fighting for tax relief \n     for families. Your efforts do not go unnoticed.\n\n  From Illinois:\n\n       We are a one-paycheck family struggling to keep our heads \n     above water.\n       Two of our three children are in a private school. The \n     burden of paying for the public and private school systems is \n     great for us. Nonetheless, we must do what we know to be best \n     for our children.\n       It is encouraging to know there are members of the \n     government who understand our struggle and are working on our \n     behalf.\n\n  From Kentucky:\n\n       We realize you are fighting a tough battle and we fully \n     support you on this issue. Keep fighting!\n\n  From Oklahoma:\n\n       I want to let you know there are a lot of us middle-income \n     heads of households who support you firmly.\n\n  And finally from Pennsylvania:\n\n       Please continue to keep the pro-family community in mind. \n     The family, its strength, is what keeps this nation strong.\n\n  Those are strong words, Mr. President, from people who know what they \nare talking about.\n  As somebody once told me, those who say, We don't need a tax cut \nprobably do not pay taxes.\n  Contrary to 40 years of conventional wisdom in Washington, American \nfamilies are better equipped and better able than the Federal \nGovernment to spend their own dollars. And they need the tax relief \noffered in the budget resolution more than ever.\n  When we first introduced the idea of family tax relief and the $500 \nper-child tax credit in 1993, our arguments were simple: taxes were too \nhigh, the burden of tax increases fell disproportionately on the \nmiddle-class, and big government was forcing more workers out of the \nworking class and into the welfare class.\n  Today, those same problems remain, and the arguments for tax relief \nhave not changed, either. The big difference, however, is that this \nyear, with this Congress--with this budget resolution--we are finally \ndoing something about it.\n  The $500 per-child tax credit takes money out of the hands of the \nWashington bureaucrats and leaves it in the hands of the taxpayers. It \nwould return $25 billion annually to families across America, $500 \nmillion to my Minnesota constituents alone.\n  And it is truly a tax break for the middle class. We will ensure that \n9 out of every 10 dollars of this tax relief go to families making less \nthan $100,000.\n  That is not the wealthy, Mr. President. That is middle-class America.\n  The Clinton administration and the Treasury Department have tried to \nrefute our tax relief numbers.\n  Without dwelling on the inherent bias in asking the President's own \nTreasury Department to examine a Republican budget plan, let me just \nsay that our budget figures are based on numbers provided by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committees.\n  Members of the President's own party have called on him to use CBO \nnumbers--numbers which clearly show middle-class taxpayers benefit most \nfrom our tax relief.\n  Along with tax relief, the other important aspect of the budget \nresolution is that we have balanced the budget.\n  For decades, Congress has offered up budgets which raised taxes, sent \ngovernment spending spiraling out of control, and created massive \ndeficits.\n  They built up a national debt of nearly $5 trillion because Congress \nthrives on spending other people's money.\n  But who gets stuck with the bill?\n  Not this generation. No, we are passing this debt on to our kids and \ngrandkids.\n  Even the Clinton administration, despite all its talk about shrinking \nthe deficit, has washed its hands of the problem.\n  Under both of the President's budget plans, the deficit would \nincrease from $177 billion this year to well over $200 billion through \nthe next decade, and add another $1.5 trillion to the national debt.\n  When the voters ushered in a new political reality in November, they \nsoundly rejected business as usual in Washington.\n  They looked to the Republicans for an alternative, for a budget that \ncould turn back 40 years of spending mentality and the belief that \n``money will fix everything, especially if it's your money and \nWashington can spend it.''\n  Today, we have delivered.\n  We crafted a document the naysayers said could never be achieved--a \nresolution that brings the budget into balance by the year 2002--and it \nis proof that we are serious about living up to our pledge.\n  And we have done it without slashing Federal spending, without \nputting children, seniors, and the disadvantaged at risk.\n  Most of our savings are achieved by slowing the growth of Government.\n  Will there need to be some sacrifices? Yes, although the Government \nwill have to sacrifice more than the people will.\n  Will belts need to be tightened? Yes.\n  But a belt that is not tightened today may become a noose tomorrow, a \nnoose around the necks of our children and grandchildren.\n  As I hear over and over from Minnesotans: The American people are \nwilling to make those sacrifices--if they believe their Government is \nserious about making change.\n  At long last, America has a Congress that is serious.\n  Mr. President, what we do with this budget resolution, we are doing \nfor the taxpayers who silently foot the Government's bills--the average \nmen and women who get up every morning, send their kids to school, go \nto work, maybe at more than one job, and pay their taxes every year.\n  They are the forgotten middle-class families, the people who have for \ntoo long borne the burden of Federal overspending.\n  The taxpayer have watched their money vanish and then reappear in the \nform of some lavish Federal program which benefits few but the \nbureaucrats themselves.\n  Mr. President, is it fair to ask these middle-class Americans to \nendure greater economic hardships if we continue to do nothing?\n  Is it fair to expect middle-class Americans to endure greater \neconomic hardships if we continue to do nothing?\n  Is it fair to expect middle-class Americans to do without, when their \nGovernment has never had to, if we continue to do nothing?\n  Is it fair to enslave the children of middle-class America with our \ndebts if we continue to do nothing?\n  If each Senator in this Chamber asks themselves those very questions, \nthe budget resolution will pass and it will be an overwhelming \nvictory--a victory not for this Congress, but a victory for the people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Brown was \nnext.\n  How much time is the Senator going to use?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to Senator Brown. And then following \nthat, we will go to Senator Frist if there is no Democrat who wants to \nbe heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to start this discussion off with a tribute to a Senator who \nhas been on the front line in this fight for a long time. Senator \nDomenici's brilliant efforts not only helped put together a package \nthat has not been put \n\n[[Page S9298]]\ntogether before in this Senate, at least during the last quarter \ncentury, but he brought people with widely diverse views into agreement \nover a plan that will rescue America. This is a bailout for America's \nfinances. I believe it is due in large part to an enormous amount of \ndedicated effort by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I said bailout of America's finances. That is not an \noverstatement. That is precisely what I meant.\n  For those who are listening, let me share with you why I believe that \nis true. The chart on my left is a simple, straightforward chart on the \namount of money this country owes.\n  Mr. President, let me quickly acknowledge these are not numbers that \nan accountant would use. There is no CPA firm in the country that would \nshow this as the amount we owe. It is far from what we owe. It does not \nuse sound accounting principles that are generally accepted, but it is \nthe numbers that we use. It does not show our contingent liabilities. \nIt does not show a wide balance sheet. But this is the net amount, if \nyou are in the marketplace to borrow each year, and it is significant \nin that it is the amount that American working men and women have to \npay interest on each year.\n  What we have seen for a quarter century is a continuous growth line \nof budget deficits. They go up in bad times and down slightly in good \ntimes, but they continue to grow and grow and grow and grow.\n  Mr. President, what is depicted here is nothing more on a straight \nbasis than the amount we owe coming from the lower levels in the \n1950's, rising to almost $5 trillion. That is roughly $40,000 for every \nworking person in this country.\n  Let me put it in perspective. That is every man, woman and child who \nhas a full-time or a part-time job owes over $40,000 for their share of \nthe national debt. What is significant is that they have to pay the \ninterest on that every year. Before a penny goes to support their \nfamily, before a penny goes to support their parents or their children, \nbefore a penny goes to pay the necessities of life, they have to come \nup with the interest on over $40,000.\n  The problem is that this amount is expected to explode even higher. \nAny reasonable person, Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, \nwho can look at these numbers, who can look at this chart, who can look \nat the forecasts that have been put in place, cannot but conclude that \nthis problem has to be solved. It is not a question of can we wait \nuntil tomorrow. It is not a question of can we hide from it. It is not \na question of can we refigure it in a way that will not look as bad. It \nis a simple, straightforward question that we are at a point now where \nthe deficits are in a runaway fashion, and if we fail to address it, if \nwe fail to acknowledge it, every American, rich or poor, will be poorer \nbecause of it. The predominance of the American economy in the 20th \ncentury will be lost. Our ability to be able to finance our debt, our \nvery ability to borrow in the international marketplace will be \ndestroyed.\n  I believe people who do research of this type cannot help but notice \nwhat has happened to the value of the dollar in this crisis has gotten \nworse. The value of the dollar has plummeted. As a young man in the \nUnited States Navy when I visited Japan, the dollar would buy over 400 \nyen. And as we speak it is in the neighborhood of 85. It used to be, at \nthe end of the war, that the dollar would buy 5 deutsche marks. As we \nspeak it is about 1\\1/3\\.\n  The trend is not good. The reality is the financial crisis that has \ngripped our country has seen the rapid depreciation of the value of our \ncurrency. We have turned the biggest trade surplus in the world's \nhistory into the biggest trade deficit in the world's history. We have \nturned the greatest creditor nation in the world into the biggest \ndebtor nation in the world.\n  I honestly believe that unless we address this problem, what we will \nface is a drastic, almost catastrophic financial failure of this \nNation.\n  The good news is that this budget does address it. This budget does \ngive us a plan, and it gives us a commitment. It involves a proposal to \nrevise the programs when reconciliation bill comes before this body.\n  Some will say it is too harsh, and some, like me, will say it is too \nweak; it is not strong enough; we ought to do more; we ought to end the \ndeficit in the next year or two and not wait 7 years. But the political \nreality is that this is a budget that can pass. This is a budget that \nwill solve the problem. It is a moderate proposal, but it is essential. \nWe do not continue to have a viable financial circumstance for this \nNation as a whole if this problem goes unaddressed.\n  The normal process is for the President of the United States to come \nforward and recommend a budget. One may fairly ask: What did the \nPresident recommend in light of those astronomic increases in the \ndeficit?\n  Here is what the President suggested. He suggested huge increases in \nspending each year for the next 5 years, and proposed increasing the \nannual deficit from what was then estimated as $177 billion for 1995, \nincreasing it each and every year up to $276 billion in the year of \n2000. Now, that is reestimated by the Congressional Budget Office over \nthe next 5 years.\n  Members will note that what we have talked about is a 7-year budget \nthat not only comes into balance but provides a surplus. But the \nPresident's plan for this Nation was not to reduce the annual deficit \nbut to increase it and to increase it dramatically. I believe that had \nwe followed the President's course, the U.S. finances would be \ncomparable to those of Orange County today. What the President had \nprescribed was a plan for fiscal disaster for this Nation and a poorer \nlife for every working American and higher interest charges for every \nworking American to pay, and, yes, a further decline in the value of \nthe dollar.\n  Some will say: Well, the President stepped forward and revised those \nfigures and, instead of proposing continuous, increasing deficits, \nadvocated balancing the budget within 10 years. Indeed, all Americans \nhave heard the President speaking on TV, talking about he proposes a \nbalanced budget in 10 years and the Republicans in 7 years. So what are \nwe talking about? In fact, he even said his was far more humane.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address that because the President of the \nUnited States himself has indicated that the Congressional Budget \nOffice is the one that ought to be the arbiter of these figures.\n  The Congressional Budget Office did evaluate his figures. They did \ncome back and tell us what the President's revised proposal was. It was \nnot a $276 billion debt increase in the year 2000, as he had originally \nproposed. What he proposed was something that involved a 10-year \nbudget, but in the 7th year it called for a $210 billion deficit.\n  Mr. President, here is the proposal: Continuous rising debt, \ncontinuous rising spending by the President and a deficit by the year \n2002, a deficit increase by the year 2002 of $210 billion.\n  The agreement that is before this body is a surplus proposal for that \nyear of $6.4 billion--a $210 billion increase in the deficit versus a \n$6.4 billion surplus.\n  Some will say: Wait a minute; that is not what the President said. He \nsaid he wanted it balanced by the end of 10 years.\n  Mr. President, the figures are not what he said in his rhetoric but \nwhat they total up to when you have an independent Congressional Budget \nOffice review them.\n  The reason I mention all of this is because this body faces a choice. \nIt faces a choice of whether we vote yes or no on this budget \nresolution.\n  Let me remind the body of what the choices that have been presented \nare, and they are the only alternative choices out there. One is to \nbalance the budget in 7 years and have a $6.4 billion surplus. The \nother is the President's revised plan that calls for a $210 billion \ndeficit and a failure to address the problem in the following years.\n Mr. President, there is no choice. And that is the bottom line of what \nwe consider here today. It is either fiscal disaster, continuing \nincreases in deficits and debt, a higher and higher burden for every \nworking American, or it is a responsible plan that slows the growth of \nspending.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, some may say, ``It slows the growth? I thought \nyou were cutting?'' Mr. President, on this chart we see what this \nbudget does. It modestly increases spending each year and modestly \nreduces the deficit each year, attaining a surplus by the year 2002. \n\n[[Page S9299]]\n\n  Some will say, ``Wait a minute. Let us talk about real numbers and \nreal figures. What does this budget really do?'' We have heard, and it \nhas been said nationwide, that the President says we slashed and cut \nMedicare. Mr. President, that is false. That is inaccurate. That is not \ntrue. That is not a fair representation of the facts of this budget.\n  Now what are the facts of this budget? Medicare in 1995 spends $158 \nbillion. Medicare under this plan by the year 2002 will spend $244 \nbillion. Medicare will increase over the distance of this plan by $317 \nbillion on a net basis and $349 billion on a gross basis.\n  Some will say, ``Wait a minute. Medicare increases? I thought you \nwere cutting it.'' What this budget plan calls for is a slowing of the \nrate of increase in Medicare. It does not call for a cut in Medicare. \nIt calls for a huge increase in Medicare. Let me repeat it. On a gross \nbasis, this budget calls for a $349 billion gross increase over 7 years \nin Medicare spending. To depict it as a slash in Medicare is simply \ninaccurate. Literally over the next 7 years we will spend $1.6 trillion \non Medicare. And total spending on Medicare in the next 7 years will be \n73 percent higher over the next 7 years than it has been in the past 7 \nyears.\n  I hope as Americans listen to this debate, they will have firmly \nfixed in their minds that what this budget does is to increase Medicare \nspending, not cut it. It also slows the rate of increase in Medicare \nspending, so that it is less likely that the trust fund goes bankrupt. \nFor those who think we ought to increase spending even faster than this \nbudget does, I hope they will accept the burden to come here and \nexplain what they do when they bankrupt the trust fund, how they \nprovide health care, because, Mr. President, that is the bottom line \nfor the debate on health care. Yes, you can spend up all your savings \naccount, but what happens when it runs out? That is what this budget \nattempts to address.\n  Now, some have said we will cut Medicaid. What are the facts? \nMedicaid spent $89 billion in 1995 and will spend $124 billion a year \nby the year 2002. Medicaid spending will rise $149 billion on a net \nbasis. It will spend a total of $772 billion in the next 7 years. The \ntotal spending in the next 7 years on Medicaid will be 73 percent \nhigher than it was in the past 7 years.\n  Well, perhaps by now people are saying, ``Wait a minute, I have heard \nall the numbers. What is bottom line?'' The bottom line is the rhetoric \nby those naysayers that say we cannot change anything. The bottom line \nis, what they have used to describe and attack this budget has not been \naccurate. The bottom line is, what we have seen is a misdescription of \nwhat this budget does.\n  Mr. President, lastly what I heard some of the detractors say is, \nthis budget provides a huge increase in defense spending. Mr. \nPresident, if you look at the numbers, I think they speak for \nthemselves. Defense spending goes from $270 billion in 1995 to $271 \nbillion in the year 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator his time is \nexpired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that I have an additional 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the reality on defense spending is that \nbetween now and the next 7 years, compared to 1995 defense spending, it \nwill drop $13 billion. It will not increase; it will drop. Some will \nsay, ``Wait a minute. It might have dropped more under other plans.'' \nThat is absolutely correct. But let me remind the body that that $13 \nbillion drop is a drop in stated dollars and not adjusted for \ninflation. If you viewed it in constant dollars, it would be much more \ndramatic dollars. Could we save more in defense? My view is we could, \nand should. But to say this is a bad budget because it increases \ndefense spending simply flies in the face of the real fact.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to put back up the chart we started with, \nbecause I think it displays in cold, hard facts the reality of this \ndebate. Do we adopt a budget that brings us into balance? Or do we go \non as we have? Is the status quo that the President advocates good \nenough? Or do we need to take strong, firm steps to slow the growth of \nspending and bring the budget into balance and restore fiscal \nsoundness?\n  Mr. President, I believe there is no choice. I believe there is no \nchoice because there is no alternative before the body. If you select \nstaying with the status quo, you not only condemn American working men \nand women to carry a burden of interest payments and debt that will \ncause the greatest economy in the world to stagger and fall, you not \nonly foment a fiscal crisis, but you deny the men and women and the \nchildren and their children and their great grandchildren any \npossibility of having a competitive economy in the years ahead.\n  There is no choice on this budget, Mr. President. It is either adopt \na reasonable plan to move this budget into balance or offer the status \nquo that the President has advocated and see the future of our children \nand grandchildren lost. Great nations and great societies have arisen \nin abundance on this Earth. They abound around the globe. The glories \nof the Samarian society and the Egyptian society are renowned in the \ntextbooks of history. The Greek civilization brought great advances to \nmankind. Perhaps few have achieved the dominance of the Romans. There \nwas a time when French glory spread its influence around the world. And \nthere was a time when the Sun never set on the British Empire.\n  Each nation in its turn has had its time in the Sun. And now, Mr. \nPresident, the question is whether or not the Sun will set on the \ngreatest experiment in democracy in the history of mankind--the United \nStates of America. This budget offers our children a future.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield such time as may be required for me, which I will \ntake from our side.\n  Mr. President, I rise today, first, to commend my colleagues on the \nBudget Committee who participated in the conference on the budget \nresolution. I was not a member of the conference, but as a member of \nthe Budget Committee, I certainly appreciate the hard work that went \ninto this package from Members in both Houses of Congress.\n  Second, I want to express my strong support for this package and to \npoint out why the reforms Republicans have outlined in this plan are \nvital to America's future. This is truly a historic budget agreement, \none that will achieve balance in 2002 for the first time in almost \nthree decades. And this budget is fair. It slows the growth of Federal \nspending. Even President Clinton has now agreed that we must balance \nthe budget and that we must change our spending habits if we are ever \nto restore the long-term health of this country.\n  Mr. President, as a physician, I would like to focus on the health \ncare spending aspect of this budget agreement,\n because I think it is critical for each and every American to \nunderstand exactly what the Republicans have proposed. But first I \nwould like to commend the conferees on coming to an agreement with \nrespect to tax relief for hard-working Americans.\n\n  The conference agreement ensures that we get to balance by first \nlocking in spending cuts and then, and only then, by cutting taxes to \nput hard-earned dollars back into the hands of the working families and \nsmall businesses of the country.\n  I look forward to working with the Finance Committee to craft the \nspecifics of the Senate tax relief bill which I hope will, indeed, \ninclude family tax relief, as well as capital gains tax cuts. These \nreductions will greatly benefit the American family and the American \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, the most important provisions of the budget conference \nagreement in my mind are those which address the growth in the Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs. Like the earlier resolution passed by the \nSenate, the budget resolution conference report sets forth outlay \nlevels for Medicare spending that are based on reforms necessary to \npreserve and protect Medicare. These new spending levels will require \nstructural changes in our Medicare system, changes which will improve \nthe system, will improve the delivery of care, changes which are \nabsolutely essential to ensure that Medicare will be solvent in the \nyear 2002 and beyond. \n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\n  By beginning the process of reform to avoid bankruptcy in the short-\nterm, we will be on our way toward structural reform that will ensure \nMedicare's long-term viability so that this program, which is so \nimportant to many seniors and individuals with disabilities, will be \nthere for years to come.\n  Yet, even though these reductions in the growth of Medicare spending \nwill certainly require change, it is important to understand that both \ntotal spending and spending for each Medicare beneficiary will continue \nto grow over time, will continue to increase at a rate well above that \nof inflation.\n  Total spending grows in Medicare from $178 billion in 1995 to $274 \nbillion in the year 2002. That is an average annual growth rate of 6.4 \npercent in the Medicare Program, which is twice as fast as the average \nprojected inflation rate over the next 7 years.\n  More importantly and easier to understand, I think, and I will refer \nto this chart next to me, is that the Medicare per capita spending in \nthis conference agreement--that is, how much we are spending per \nMedicare beneficiary--increases over time. A Medicare beneficiary today \nwill have spending associated of $4,816 in 1995, and in this conference \nagreement, that will increase by the year 2002 to $6,734. This is not a \ncut, this is an increase from 1995 to the year 2002 for each individual \nin the Medicare Program, from $4,800 to $6,700. That is a 40-percent \nincrease over 7 years. Even after accounting for inflation, that is a \n12-percent increase per person in our Medicare Program over these 7 \nyears.\n  These numbers show two things. First, the Republican budget takes \ncare of our seniors. The conference agreement increases spending for \neach Medicare beneficiary so that we can continue to provide access to \nhigh-level, high-quality care for our seniors and disabled citizens.\n  Second, these numbers show that the Republican budget is responsible \nby requiring the Medicare Program to be improved and to be \nrestructured, it strengthens and preserves the fiscal viability of the \nprogram for our Nation's seniors now and for generations to come.\n  Finally, the conference agreement strikes the right balance on \nMedicaid as well. Currently, the growth in Medicaid is simply \nunsustainable. Medicaid comprises nearly 20 percent of State budgets. \nIn my own State of Tennessee, Medicaid accounts for 25 percent of the \noverall State budget, $3 billion of a $12 billion State budget. If left \nunchecked, Federal spending on Medicaid will double by the year 2002. \nIt is simply not sustainable.\n  The conference agreement gradually slows the rate of growth in the \nMedicaid Program from over 11 percent now down next year to 8 percent, \ngradually down to 7, 6, 5, and then 4 percent by the year 2002. Still, \ntotal Federal spending on the Medicaid Program will be $773 billion \nover the next 7 years.\n  Again and again, Governors all across this country have told us that \nif we strip away the regulations, if we increase flexibility and return \ncontrol of these programs in Medicaid over to the States that they will \nbe able to institute reforms to achieve these levels of Federal \nspending.\n  Mr. President, the States are the entities responsible for managing \nthe Medicaid Program, and I am confident that the levels agreed to in \nthe budget resolution conference report will be attainable.\n  I wanted to outline the specifics of the Medicare and Medicaid \nspending today, because I do believe it is important, critical that we \nlook at the facts and not just get lost in the rhetoric. The rhetoric \nthat we have heard today, and will likely hear tomorrow, undoubtedly \nwill continue to surround our consideration of this agreement as we \nhear that there are tax cuts being taken on the backs of the elderly \nand the poor. This representation really ignores the problems that are \ninherent in our Federal health programs that do need to be improved, \nthat do need to be changed. And this representation is, in my judgment, \nan inappropriate response to an impending crisis that is staring us in \nthe face.\n  Again, I am proud of my colleagues and honored to be a part of this \nhistoric occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the great French philosopher Voltaire \nonce said, ``History doesn't repeat itself, men do.'' So here we go \nagain, precisely as Voltaire said, plowing the same ground, the same \nway we did in 1981, and it will be a few years from now before we can \nstand on the floor and say, ``I told you so.''\n  In 1981, I stood right here at this desk and fought like a saber-\ntoothed tiger to keep us from quadrupling the deficit. But there was a \nherd instinct that swept across this floor, and only 11 Senators--only \n11--stood up for common sense.\n  What did we get? We got a deficit which grew to $290 billion in 1992, \nand which accumulated over the years into today's $4.6 trillion \nnational debt.\n  This chart shows what the Republicans promised in 1981. They were \ngoing to balance the budget in 1983, no later than 1984, and here is \nwhere they said the deficit would go--down toward zero. Between 1984 \nand 1985, they said, we would have a balanced budget.\n  ``How do you reach a balanced budget?'' we asked. ``You double \ndefense spending and cut taxes,'' they said. That was their method of \nbalancing the budget.\n  What happened? Here it is. By 1983, we had a $200 billion deficit. \nEven those of us who were terrified by the 1981 budget changes would \nnever have guessed that could happen.\n  David Stockman, President Reagan's head of OMB, wrote a book about \nthat.\n  Here it is. It is called ``The Triumph of Politics,'' and he wrote it \nin 1986, after the damage had been done. In the book he says that the \n1981 Reagan budget plan was all done on the back of an envelope. Where \nwere the numbers coming from, he asked? People kept putting things on \nhis desk that he did not understand.\n  Stockman was a friend of Senator Moynihan because he had studied \nunder Senator Moynihan while in college. And in his book, Stockman \nrelates a conversation he had over dinner with the Senator and Mrs. \nMoynihan on September 24, 1981 after the damage of the Reagan tax cuts \nhad already been done. Stockman says he told Moynihan, ``You guys on \nthe hill are going to have to rescue this. We went too far with the tax \ncut and now I can't get them to turn back.''\n  And Moynihan responds, ``I am not sure whether anything can be done \nabout it.''\n  And so the damage continued to pyramid. In 1992, Bill Clinton was \nelected President. President Clinton came to this body in 1993 with a \nproposal to raise taxes by $250 billion and cut spending by $250 \nbillion, and we passed it, without one single Republican vote in the \nHouse and without one single Republican vote in the Senate.\n  And this chart shows where the deficit was when President Clinton \nmade his proposal. It was headed for a $300 billion deficit in 1992. We \nhad nearly a $300 billion deficit. The Republicans said the Clinton \nproposal would be a disaster for the Nation and would bring on a \nterrible depression. The predictions were ominous and endless. But what \nhappened? The deficit, the first year, went from $300 billion to $255 \nbillion; the next year, to $203 billion; and this year to $175 billion, \nwithout one single Republican vote.\n  So here we are. We cannot stand to admit the success of that. So we \nhave this budget here. I daresay I could walk down the streets of \nLittle Rock and pick out 535 people at random, bring them to \nWashington, put 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate, and I promise \nyou that we could come out with a better budget, a more compassionate \nbudget, and a fairer budget, than this one.\n  I heard a Congressman say the other day that there is ``plenty of \npain in this for everybody.'' Really? Pain for everybody? What about \nMembers of Congress? Where is their pain? Where is the pain of people \nwho can afford to send their children to school without Pell grants and \nstudent loans?\n  The one thing that will restore some sense of decency, civility, \nculture, and social fabric in this country is education. You can stand \non this floor and \n\n[[Page S9301]]\nmoralize all you want. You are not going to force people to go to \nchurch by moralizing with them. You are not going to force people to \nquit having babies out of wedlock by moralizing with them. You are \ngoing to solve all of these problems by educating people. The one thing \nJoycelyn Elders said--and it is not popular to quote her these days, \nbut this is worth repeating--when they asked, ``What are you going to \ndo about this generation?'' She said, ``Nothing, they are already lost. \nI am going after the next generation.'' Well, I do not totally agree \nwith that, but I can tell you that is where our money ought to be \nspent--on the coming generation.\n  So what are we going to do? Cut $11 billion out of education for the \nnext 7 years and stand back and ask why our children are not learning.\n  What else? Why, we are going to deny 350,000 children the right to \nHeadstart. Everybody knows what Headstart means to children, \nparticularly from poverty areas. So what are we going to do? Sorry, we \nare closed.\n  What else? Two things that we fund here are, for some reason, such an \nanathema to most Republicans. I watch public broadcasting and Discovery \nand Arts and Entertainment. I do not watch sitcoms. I do not know any \nof those people. I do not say that boastingly. It just does not \ninterest me. I have an intense curiosity about everything, and I am \ninterested in knowledge; I want to learn all I can before I die--and \nthat is not too far away. But I am still curious about everything, so I \nwatch the Learning Channel and the channels where I am likely to learn \nsomething, not the channels where I know I am not going to learn \nanything.\n  So what do the Republicans propose? Eliminate PBS. Eliminate the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. ``Well, Senator, you favor \npornography, or you must if you favor the National Endowment for the \nArts.'' No, I do not favor pornography. But I am hot to keep the \nArkansas symphony afloat. I am hot to keep the Arkansas Repertory \nTheater afloat. I am hot to see people in small rural communities of \nthis Nation get exposed to Shakespeare now and then. I deplore the \nMapplethorpe exhibit as much as the Presiding Officer or any other \nSenator. It is like welfare--eight percent rip off. You cannot design a \nprogram that somebody is not going to corrupt.\n  So two of the few civil, decent culturally enriching things in this \nNation, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, \nthey go on the block.\n  Earned-income tax credit. You think about the earned-income tax \ncredit, which everybody considers to be the greatest program ever \ninvented to keep people off welfare. This is where people who make less \nthan $28,000 a year get a refundable credit of up to $2,200 a year, on \na sliding scale. We make money off of it because we keep them off \nwelfare. Is that what Dale Bumpers says? No. That is what Senator \nDomenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, said. What did he say about \nthe earned income tax credit? ``It is a great way to help families with \nthe costs of raising their children. It sends assistance to those in \nneed; to those who work hard and yet struggle to make a living and \nprovide for their children.'' That was Senator Domenici, not Dale \nBumpers. This is what Senator Packwood said: ``A key means of helping \nlow-income workers with dependent children get off and stay off \nwelfare.'' Those are Senator Packwood's words. This is what President \nReagan said: ``The best antipoverty, the best profamily, the best job \ncreation measure to come out of the Congress.''\n  So what do we do to that? About $21 billion is whacked off of it in \nthis budget resolution.\n  Family values. I must tell you that I get sick listening to the \nmoralizing about family values from the same people who choose to \ntorpedo the best program we have going to help families stay together \nand stay off welfare.\n  What else are we going to do? We are going to sell the Presidio, the \nmost magnificent piece of property left in America. The old Fort \nPresidio goes on the auction block.\n  What else? We are going to sell the naval petroleum reserves, which \nwe have always relied on in a time of military crisis. The naval \npetroleum reserve. We are going to sell it to the highest bidder.\n  What else? We are going to privatize all those people who are in the \ntowers at the airports who guide our planes. We are going to privatize \nthem. It will run for profit in the future--not for safety necessarily, \nbut for profit.\n  What else? We are going to sell the Uranium Enrichment Corporation \nand the Power Marketing Administration which make the Government money. \nWe will get a pretty good amount of revenue in the year that we sell \nthose programs, but then we will fail to get the annual revenue that we \nare getting now.\n  What else? We are getting down to the bone now, Mr. President. We are \ngoing to cut Medicare $270 billion. How are we going to do that? We are \ngoing to reform Medicare. How are we going to reform it? Nobody knows. \nNobody has said.\n  We can either bankrupt every rural hospital in America, which we \nwould do in my State, cut doctors' fees to the point they do not want \nto participate in the program anymore, or assess every single Medicare \nrecipient in the country $3,345 over the next 7 years.\n  Medicaid, the poorest of the poor, we are going to increase 4 \npercent. It has been increasing by 10 percent. What will happen? We \nwill do block grants to the States and we will have 50 different \nprograms for Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, all 100 people who sit in this body get a nice fat \ncheck every month, $133,000 a year. A lot of them never dreamed they \nwould make that much. I guess I am one of them. We get $133,000 a year. \nWe have a nice, fat, cushy pension waiting to retire. But we have a \nhealth care plan second to none. Any doctor or hospital in this city is \nmore than pleased to see a Member of Congress come in because they know \nour plan will pay for everything.\n  But do you know what we forget? We forget that 37 million people in \nthis country are over 65, and 50 percent of them go to bed terrified at \nnight for fear they will get sick and not be able to pay their medical \nbills. We in Congress have no such fears.\n  What are we going to do? We are going to give a $245 billion tax cut. \nNot a middle-class tax cut. I cannot believe people have the temerity \nto call this a middle-class tax cut. This tax cut, at least the House \ntax cut, goes to virtually the wealthiest people in America.\n  What in the name of God are we thinking about? Seventy percent of the \npeople of this country say, ``Don't spend that $245 billion on tax \ncuts.'' If you can come up with $245 billion, put it on the deficit.\n  Mr. President, what is next? Defense--the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is this day marking up a bill that is calculated to do one \nthing: that is to gin up the cold war one more time. More B-2 bombers. \nFor whom? Whom are we going to bomb? Even new battleships--two \nbattleships. All kinds of things the Defense Department, even the Joint \nChiefs of Staffs, say they do not want. We in Congress will teach the \nJoint Chiefs a thing or two about military battles.\n  Imagine Senators telling old people we are cutting Medicare by $270 \nbillion and telling poor people we are cutting Medicaid by $180 \nbillion. What do we say to the Defense Department? Have it all; just \nhave what you want. Do you want to kill the ABM treaty so the Russians \nhave no choice but to start rearming? Do you want to build all the \nweapons systems that really have no meaning in today's world? Here is \nthe proof of the pudding.\n  The United States is spending $280 billion this year, counting the \nEnergy Department's budget, on defense; the eight biggest military \nnations on Earth outside NATO--Russia, China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, \nLibya, Syria, Cuba, our most likely adversaries--the combined total \nbudgets of all eight nations is $121 billion.\n  We are spending twice as much in the United States alone as our eight \nmost likely adversaries combined. When we add NATO spending of $250 \nbillion, the United States and NATO are spending four times more than \nall these nations combined. Mr. President, this sounds like sheer \nlunacy, because it is.\n  In a few days, the Budget Committee will send over all their \nmandatory spending instructions to the committees to report back to \nthem by September 22. Then CBO will certify that the budget really will \nbe in balance in the year 2002. Then the Budget Committee \n\n[[Page S9302]]\nwill tell the Finance Committee, ``Come up with a big tax cut of $245 \nbillion over the next 7 years,'' and then the Budget Committee will \ncombine all of this mandatory savings legislation with a tax cut bill, \nand it is all going to be passed in one fell swoop.\n  What does that mean? That means that we will pass a tax cut this \nfall. We will pass this budget, and all the appropriations bills that \ngo with it, and then we will be free to have an immediate tax cut.\n  Then next year, it will require only 51 votes to undo every bit of \nour balanced budget. If we have a recession, a war, if we have a trade \nwar, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, every Senator in this body will \nfall all over himself to vote to pay for every bit of it, and there \ngoes our balanced budget because we will have already passed a $245 \nbillion tax cut.\n  Mr. President, we are back to square one. I know my time is about to \nexpire. I wanted to say some other things. I just want to close by \nmaking a couple of observations.\n  This budget is guaranteed not to solve the problems of this Nation. \nThis budget tells the American people only one thing: That it has been \ncrafted with the utmost cynicism to keep people's attention diverted \njust long enough to get this tax cut passed.\n  When we pass a tax cut, think of who will feel the pain. Here is the \nchart. On capital gains alone, 76.3 percent of the capital gains tax \ncuts will go to the wealthiest 5 percent of people in America--76 \npercent to the wealthiest 5 percent of people in America. If that is \nwhat America is about, somehow or another, I missed it all. You could \nnot hold a gun to my head and make me vote for this budget. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time consumed by the quorum not be charged against the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, it should come as no surprise that the \nbudget resolution which has come back to us from conference is far \nworse and more dismaying in its impact than the version which passed \nthe Senate on May 25.\n  What I said when I voted against the resolution the first time \napplies now with even more force: This budget is a plan for the \nevisceration of progressive government as we have come to know it in \nthe past 40 years. Sadly, it marks the end of an era of high intentions \nand decency and compassion in public policy.\n  On of the worst provisions of the conference report, from my point of \nview, is the mandatory cut of some $10 billion in education programs, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Senate last month voted 67-32 to \nrestore $9.2 billion to this account.\n  The conference cut in education will substantially increase the \nindebtedness that students incur to pay for college tuition, adding \nsome $4,000 to $5,000 to the cost of an average student loan. It could \nwell mean that literally millions of students will have to trim, defer \nor even drop their plans for college.\n  A number of important education programs--such as Safe and Drug Free \nSchools, Goals 2000, School to Work Opportunities, Head Start, Pell \ngrants, the National and Community Service Act and Vocational \nEducation--could well be subject to severe funding reductions and even \nelimination.\n  At a time when our Nation needs a more educated and better prepared \nworkforce, these education cuts mean we would be moving in precisely \nthe opposite and wrong direction.\n  Similarly, Mr. President, the conference report's outline for \nspending on foreign affairs, the so-called 150 account, indicates that \nover time, there will be significant cuts in funding for U.S. foreign \naffairs agencies, personnel and assistance programs; there will be an \nenormous reduction in U.S. financial support for the United Nations and \nU.N. peacekeeping missions; and there will be major constraints on the \nability of the United States to conduct diplomacy and exert influence \nabroad.\n  If we follow the prescriptions in this budget plan, the United States \nwill be unable to exercise leverage over or work cooperatively with the \ninternational community to resolve conflicts, advance our interests, or \npromote democratic and free market principles.\n  I am particularly disturbed by the potential impact of the budget \nplan on our ability to contribute to the United Nations. Having just \nreturned from the 50th anniversary celebration of the United Nations, I \nam once again reminded of the tremendous contributions that the United \nNations has made to support and advance U.S. foreign policy goals, and \nof how useful a tool it could be for the United States in the future. I \nam not so naive as to profess that the United Nations has always lived \nup to its potential, but for every example of failure that are numerous \ncountervailing examples of success.\n  These cuts will set us squarely down the road toward retrenchment and \nwithdrawal. If we choose to go this route, we will do grave disservice \nto the next generation of Americans. At the end of World War II, we \nchose not to yield to the temptation of isolationism, and our country \nprospered as it never had before. I think we should have learned our \nlesson by now.\n  These cuts in education funding and in the foreign affairs account \ntypify the great differences in priorities and values which distinguish \nthe opponents from the proponents of this resolution. All of us agree \nthat many Federal programs should be trimmed or restructured or phased \nout altogether. But we have significant differences over where the axe \nshould fall.\n  I for one think that far more critical attention should be given to \nmodifying and reducing the elaborate defense and security structure \nwhich in many ways is a casualty of its own success in the cold war.\n  I am dismayed that the conference report comes back to us with even \ngreater allowance for defense outlays than we originally provided. As I \nsee it, we should be spending far less on defense and more on domestic \nsocial programs.\n  The same might be said for the vast hidden budget of our intelligence \napparatus which I note spent some $10 billion in its unsuccessful \nefforts to estimate the state of the Soviet economy, the collapse of \nwhich it failed to anticipate.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated last month, my differences on the \nbudget go deeper than priorities. I continue to question the basic \npremise that the Federal budget must be brought into absolute balance \nin a specific time frame.\n  And I particularly question the wisdom, indeed the sanity, of \nproviding for tax cuts at the very time our objective should be to \nbring revenues and expenditures into balance. It seems preposterous \nthat the budget resolution now comes back to us with a provision for \ntax cuts of $245 billion, notwithstanding the Senate's decisive \nrejection by a vote of 69 to 31 of the Gram amendment last month.\n  For every dollar of opportunistic tax cuts provided by this \nresolution, an offsetting dollar must come from some other source. The \ndesigners of this budget actually propose to borrow funds in the next \nfew years to make up for the lost revenue, and then the impact will \nfall on school children, college students and Medicare recipients among \nmany others.\n  This seems like a strange way indeed for a modern society to manage \nits affairs. A far better way, it seems to me, would be to make \njudicious cuts, reduce the deficit to reasonable proportions and, if \nnecessary, raise additional revenues to preserve worthy programs.\n  We should not loose sight of Franklin Roosevelt's wise dictum that \n``Taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of \nmembership in an organized society.'' In the end, we get what we pay \nfor.\n                  opposition to defense funding levels\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have asked to speak at length on this \nconference agreement to raise some serious reservations about the \nfunding levels it contains for defense. I appreciate Chairman \nDomenici's cooperation in allowing me this time.\n  I would like to say first that I will vote for this conference \nreport. I spoke \n\n[[Page S9303]]\nat length earlier today about the positive aspects of this budget, and \nwhy it's needed for this country's future. Whatever reservations I have \nabout the defense numbers, they are secondary to the main priority--\nwhich is a credible, balanced budget.\n  To me, the explosion of debt sanctioned by Congress over the last \nthree decades is unconscionable. It has become a moral issue with me. \nWe are mortgaging our children's future by failing to act responsibly \nnow. It has to stop. The goal of this conference agreement is, in fact, \nto restore responsibility to our fiscal policy. And that's why I \nsupport the conference agreement despite my opposition to the defense \nbudget levels.\n  Let me also say that I strongly supported the Senate budget, \nincluding the defense numbers. To me, the Senate's version of the \nbudget we passed in May was the most credible budget passed by this \nbody that I have voted for. There was no smoke and mirrors. Just sound, \ntough choices. And as I have done before on this floor, including \ntoday, I want to once again commend Chairman Domenici for his \noutstanding leadership in crafting that budget.\n  Having provided that context, Mr. President, I would like now to \naddress the defense issue.\n  The conference report pumps $40 billion into the defense budget over \nthe next 7 years. There are two justifications given. First, the \ndefense budget is ``underfunded.'' Second, we need more money for \nweapons so we can have more money for readiness.\n  Neither argument has credibility, in my view.\n  The defense debate is often dominated by fancy buzz words and \nphrases. Two examples are: First, the defense budget is \n``underfunded''; and second, we cannot sacrifice ``future readiness'' \nfor current readiness. These are the phrases being used. But what do \nthey mean?\n  What I plan to do is explain these arguments in terms the taxpayers \ncan understand. That way, they can see how they are getting ripped off.\n  First, the underfunding argument. This argument cites a gap between \nthe level of funding for programs in the defense budget, versus the \nrealistic cost of those same programs when the bills come due. It says \nmore money is needed to fund everything that's in the defense budget.\n  This argument is bogus. The fact of the matter is, more money would \nnot be needed if the defense managers were to manage their programs \nproperly. The funding gap cited in the conference agreement is future \ncost overruns that happen historically because defense managers are not \ndoing their jobs.\n  The defense budget is not underfunded; it is overprogrammed. The cost \nof what is in the budget is deliberately underestimated. That way, the \nbureaucrats can squeeze more programs in. It is a bait-and-switch game \nthat would make the best of the con artists green with envy.\n  Once they get all the programs stuffed in by underestimating their \ncost, they turn around and say: ``Gosh, we need more money to pay for \neverything we just crammed in there.''\n  If it were not for the conscious game of deliberately underestimating \ncosts to shoehorn more programs into the budget, the term \n``underfunding'' might be legitimate. But that is not the case. The \nfact that it is a deliberate scheme to game the system is why it is \nreally a case of overprogramming, not underfunding.\n  For example, when Republicans accuse President Clinton of using rosy \neconomics to balance the budget--therefore, claiming his budget really \nis not balanced--we are accusing him of not making the tough choices. \nBy assuming a rosier revenue stream, he is trying to fit more programs \ninto the Federal budget, and make fewer cuts. It is poor management and \nleadership. It will lead to higher deficits. In his case, our \naccusations are justified.\n  It is the same with the defense budget. That is why I call the \ndefense budget a ``blivet''--5 pounds of manure in a 4-pound sack. The \nquestion is, after they pull this bait-and-switch routine, do we give \nthem a bigger sack, or do we ask them to manage their manure better?.\n  Interestingly, Mr. President, I used this argument to successfully \nfreeze the defense budget in 1985--during the height of the Soviet \nthreat. If the argument was successful then for spending less money, \nwhy would we use it now to argue for more money, especially when the \nthreat is gone?\n  Simply put, those who are using the argument now to justify more \nspending do not understand the issue.\n  The Defense Department has a history of playing the overprogramming \ngame. I first uncovered it in 1983, and used analysis of that problem \nto show how more money was making the funding gap worse. The answer was \nnot more money, but rather better management. Using that argument, we \nfroze defense spending in 1985, and it has been plateaued ever since.\n  The overprogramming gap was bad back in 1983, and it hasn't gotten \nany better. The data confirm this. The conference report language \nacknowledges that the problem is still with us. But what the report \ndoes not do is present a logical case for why an argument that once was \nused to justify less spending and better management, is now used to \njustify more spending in place of better management.\n  If my colleagues were to respond correctly to this problem, we would \nsay better management must substitute for more money. That means taking \naway a pound of manure, rather than getting a bigger sack. Better yet, \npreventing the excess manure in the first place is what we want. That \nis proper management. If all we do is keep getting a bigger sack, we're \nrewarding bad management.\n  It is a game. It is a game mastered by crafty bureaucrats to extort \ntaxpayer money out of Congress. In reality, by doing what is argued for \nin this conference agreement, we would be covering the cost overruns \nthat will result from putting in more money.\n  You see, the cost overruns have not occurred yet. They will occur \neach of the next 7 years, if business is conducted as usual. Putting \n$40 billion more in the defense budget guarantees that business will be \nas usual. And we will get $40 billion of cost overruns as a result.\n  Now, let me address the second argument used by the conferees. It is \nreally just another symptom of the problem I just described.\n  The second argument goes like this: More money lessens the need for \nPentagon decisionmakers to sacrifice future readiness to meet current \nreadiness requirements.\n  ``Current readiness'' means spare parts, fuel, and training. ``Future \nreadiness'' means procurement. This argument simply means that DOD \nmanagers do not want to have to manage and prioritize. As cost overruns \ndue to bad management occur in each\n of the next 7 years in weapons accounts, the managers don't want to \nhave to rob the readiness accounts to pay for the weapons. That is what \nthey used to do. But that would hollow out the force. Instead, this \ntime they want more procurement money to cover the cost overruns.\n\n  When you hear the cry for more money for things like ``procurement'' \nor ``modernization'' or ``future readiness needs''--all of which are \nfancy buzz words--those are euphemisms for putting in more money to \ncover cost overruns. It says, ``We are not going to manage better. We \nhave run the defense budget this way for decades, and we're not going \nto change now.''\n  That is the attitude that troubles me, Mr. President. What troubles \nme even more is that the new Republican Congress is willing to tolerate \nit. We are treating it as a sacred cow. Worse. We are treating it as a \nsacred fatted cow.\n  Why is it that Members on my side of the aisle send their management \nprinciples on a vacation whenever the defense budget is mentioned? We \nscrutinize every other program for better performance. But when it \ncomes to the defense budget, it is a jobs jamboree. A pork paradise.\n  It is hypocritical. It undermines our credibility as a party. We are \nnot willing to tolerate business-as-usual in any corner of the Federal \nGovernment, except for defense. On defense, we worship at the altar of \nthe sacred fatted cow.\n  I want to make it clear, Mr. President, that my colleagues in the \nSenate did not have this attitude, for the most part. It was mainly \nthose of the other body. During the conference, we met with our \ncounterparts in a very important defense discussion. Afterward, we \n\n[[Page S9304]]\nreached a compromise on the defense numbers.\n  I do not intend to mention names. But I would like to relay a couple \npoints that were made by House leaders in defense of pumping up the \ndefense budget.\n  The first argument was the pork argument. At the time of the defense \nmeeting of conferees, the relevant House committee had already \ncompleted work on this year's defense bill. If the conferees did not \npump up the numbers, it would mean going back to Members of Congress \nand saying we would have to go back on our promise to fund this project \nor that program.\n  Now, when a Member of Congress is faced with a choice like that, \nguess what he or she will do? The choice is, go along with the pumped-\nup defense numbers, or we'll cancel this project in your district. And \nthat'll mean jobs.\n  What kind of national security strategy is this, Mr. President?\n  Everyone knows, the defense budget is justified by a national \nsecurity strategy. We've all heard of the two-war strategy. The defense \nbudget is built on a strategy of fighting and winning two near-\nsimultaneous wars in different parts of the globe.\n  Now, I am not so naive to think there's any real tight connection \nbetween a national strategy and our defense budget. But at least our \ndefense community usually goes along with the gag. They pay lip service \nto the connection, even though we all know the defense budget is as \nmuch a big pork factory as it is a generator of fighting capabilities. \nIf we did not pay lip service, there would be no justification for \nbudget increases, and hence no credibility.\n  In this case--in my discussion in that defense meeting--there was not \neven lip service. It was unadulterated realpolitik. The justification \nfor more defense spending was more pork ad more jobs. Period.\n  The other comment that was made was the recognition that a national \nsecurity strategy is no longer the basis of our defense budget, since \nthe cold war is over. So what, I asked, is the justification for the \npresent budget, let alone vast new increases. The answer I got was\n that more defense spending is needed because the United States must \npolice the world. And we are the only ones who can do it.\n\n  My question is, how in the world can that justify the spending levels \nin this agreement? If anything, it undermines it. This defense budget \nis still based on an obsolete, cold war strategy. We are still buying \ncold war relics. Before this conference agreement, we were on a path \ntoward a post-cold war budget. But with this influx of money, we are \nnow returning to the cold war budget in a post-cold war era.\n  If we are now going to be policemen of the world, why are we still \nbuying things that were specifically designed to counter the Soviet \nthreat, not to police the world? We are still buying Seawolfs and B-2's \nand F-22's and Comanche helicopters, and the like. If we are supposed \nto now police the world, why are we buying these? The fact is, this \nargument does not justify these larger defense numbers.\n  Another argument is that the defense budget is not going up, we are \nsimply trying to freeze it, and keep it from going down. But this is \nnot a credible argument. And it never has been. The defense budget is \nbased on a national strategy, at least supposedly. If the budget \ndeclines, which would be consistent with the disappearance of the \nSoviet threat, what is the problem? There should not be a problem--\nunless, that is, we view it as a port factory with jobs attached.\n  Mr. President, there is no logical basis for the defense numbers in \nthis conference agreement. The arguments are bogus, and they reflect a \nlack of serious, credible justification.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I support the conference agreement because I \nbelieve it will lead to a legitimate balanced budget in 2002. And I am \nwilling to accept the defense compromise if that's what it takes to get \nan overall agreement.\n  But I am taking this opportunity to warn my Republican colleagues not \nto repeat the mistakes we made in the 1980's with the defense budget. \nIn the 1980's, our goal was not a defense build-up. It was a defense \nbudget build-up. We ended up buying much less with much more than we \ngot and spent under the Carter administration. That's because we \nsubstituted more money for better management. We lost credibility as a \nparty because of it.\n  As the party that now controls Congress for the first time in 40 \nyears, we are right back where we were in 1981. Our defense policy, as \nreflected in this conference agreement, is to once again build up the \ndefense budget, not defense. It is to, once again, create jobs, not a \nlean fighting machine.\n  I have been given assurances by Members of the other body that \ndefense reforms are forthcoming. After concentrating this year on \nhealth care reform, the top reform priority of the other body next year \nwill be major defense reform.\n  By inference, my colleagues are admitting that they will tolerate \nbusiness-as-usual with the Defense Department--at least for 1 more \nyear. I am here to warn my colleagues that 1 year is all they will get. \nOne year to conclude that better management will win out over more \nmoney, as a solution.\n  Because if there is not a change next year to doing business-as-usual \nin defense, then I will expend everything in mu arsenal to bring sanity \nto our defense policy. Just like I did from 1983 to 1985, when I ended \nthe irrational defense budget buildup under President Reagan. It was my \namendment on this very floor on May 2, 1985, by a vote of 50-49 that \nended the insanity back then. And I will do it again.\n  Even if it takes me 2 full years to do it, like it did back then. And \nI will win. Because it is not right to have a double standard--one for \ndefense, and one for the rest of Government. All that will do is hurt \nthe credibility of our party. And I do not want that. Because in my \nview, our party is the only one that can restore hope and opportunity \nfor the next generation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9296-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to transfer management of the Tishomingo National \nWildlife Refuge in Oklahoma to the State of Oklahoma, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the tishomingo national wildlife refuge act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take the floor today to introduce a \nbill which will turn the management responsibilities of the Tishomingo \nNational Wildlife Refuge from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over \nto the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. This legislation \nresponds to unacceptable policies promulgated by the Fish and Wildlife \nService in their management of national wildlife refuges.\n  During the past several years, the Fish and Wildlife Service has \nattempted to restrict public access and traditional activities on our \nwildlife refuge preserves. Long-allowed public uses on refuges such as \nwildlife viewing, hunting, fishing, hiking, grazing, and boating, have \ncome under close scrutiny and curtailment. These short-sighted \nrestrictions proposed by the administration's political appointees have \nresulted in unnecessary burdens and pressures on the public who use and \nbenefit from our wildlife refuges.\n  What the Fish and Wildlife Service fails to realize is that the \ntaxpayers own and finance the refuge lands. Outdoor recreation \ncontributes significantly to local economies and local support for the \nrefuges. Allowing traditional activities, such as fishing and boating \nat Tishomingo, is integral in maintaining continued public support and \nfunding for the refuge system.\n  Due to ill-advised changes in Federal management practices during the \nlast 10 years, wildlife populations on the Tishomingo refuge have \nseverely declined. The State of Oklahoma, however, presently provides \nsuitable habitats for wildlife resources across the State and currently \nmanages 650,000 acres of Federal land. State officials have assured me \nthat they will improve habitat conditions for wildlife at the refuge \nand work to reverse the negative impact of inadequate Federal \nmanagement.\n  My legislation will ensure limited Federal funding for the Tishomingo \nRefuge and will ultimately result in significant savings to the Federal \nGovernment. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation can manage \nthe refuge more efficiently and with fewer taxpayer dollars. \nSpecifically, my bill stipulates annual funding be made available to \nthe State in the amount of 50 percent of the refuge's current operating \ncosts.\n  In conclusion, I believe the State of Oklahoma can manage the \nTishomingo National Wildlife Refuge in an efficient and cost-effective \nmanner and do so with fewer employees than the Federal Government. \nLocal management will result in better communication between the \nmanagers of the refuge and \n\n[[Page S9306]]\nthe public. Those responsible for managing our national refuges must be \nheld accountable to the needs of the public they serve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT OF TISHOMINGO NATIONAL \n                   WILDLIFE REFUGE.\n\n       (a) Transfer.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     transfer, with the consent of the Governor of Oklahoma, the \n     management of the lands and waters within the Tishomingo \n     National Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma to the State of Oklahoma \n     for administration by the Director of the Oklahoma Department \n     of Wildlife Conservation (or any successor agency).\n       (b) Management.--\n       (1) In general.--The lands and waters transferred under \n     subsection (a) shall--\n       (A) be managed for the same uses and in the same manner as \n     the lands were managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service prior to 1994; and\n       (B) continue to be a national wildlife refuge.\n       (2) Applicable laws.--The laws (including regulations) \n     applicable to the National Wildlife Refuge System established \n     under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act \n     of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd et seq.) shall continue to be \n     applicable to the lands and waters on and after the effective \n     date of the transfer under subsection (a).\n       (c) Authorization of Funding.--For each fiscal year \n     commencing after the date of enactment of this Act, there is \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the \n     Interior to make annual grants to the State of Oklahoma for \n     management of the lands and waters transferred under \n     subsection (a) an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount \n     made available to the Secretary of the Interior in fiscal \n     year 1994 for the management of the refuge.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 977. A bill to correct certain references in the Bankruptcy Code; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    technical correction legislation\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would work a purely technical correction to certain \nreferences in the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Title 11, United States Code, section 1228 contains incorrect cross \nreferences to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1222(b)(10). Those references should be to \n11 U.S.C. Sec. 1222(b)(9). The errors have been pointed out to me by \npractitioners, and have been commented on by the leading bankruptcy \ntreatise. See 5 ``Collier on Bankruptcy'' para.1288.01 at p. 1228-3 n.1 \n(15th ed. 1994). The bill I introduce today would correct those errors.\n  The substance behind the corrections is fairly straightforward. \nSection 1228 provides for the discharge of debt in chapter 12 \nbankruptcies. Under that provision, as soon as the debtor completes all \npayments under the debtor's pan, debt will generally be discharged, \nsubject to a few, limited exceptions. One obvious exception covers \ncertain payments that, under the plan, will necessarily extend beyond \nthe period of the plan. It simply makes sense that, where the plan \ncontemplates payments to be made beyond the period of the plan, the \ndebt will not be discharged at the close of the plan period.\n  The exception currently refers to subsections 1222(b)(5) and \n1222(b)(10), which appear in that section of chapter 12 governing the \ncontents of the plan. The reference to subsection 1222(b)(10) is \nplainly in error, however, and should be to subsection 1222(b)(9). \nSubsections 1222(b)(5) and 1222(b)(9) both concern debts on which \npayments are due following completion of the plan. Subsection \n1222(b)(10), however, concerns something entirely different: the \nvesting of property in the debtor or another entity. The current cites \nto subsection 1222(b)(10) should be to 1222(b)(9). This bill corrects \nthose errors, in accordance with the suggestions of practitioners and \ncommentators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REFERENCE.\n\n       Section 1228 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``section 1222(b)(10)'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``section 1222(b)(9)''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 978. A bill to facilitate contributions to charitable \norganizations by codifying certain exemptions from the Federal \nsecurities laws, to clarify the inapplicability of antitrust laws to \ncharitable gift annuities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the charitable giving protection act of 1995\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, one of charities' most \nimportant sources of funds--charitable gift annuities--is threatened.\n  Ever since the American Bible Society entered into the first planned \ngiving arrangement in the 1830's, charitable gift annuities have been a \ntraditional method of giving in America. Typically, the donor gives \nproperty to a charity and receives some of the investment income for \nthe rest of her life. After the donor's death, the charity keeps the \nproperty to help with its charitable mission.\n  Donors establish charitable gift annuities to help feed and clothe \nthe neediest among us, to provide relief for disaster victims, to heal \nthe sick, to educate our children, and to bring culture to our \ncommunities.\n  The threat to charities comes from the misapplication of laws to \nprotect consumers from securities fraud and unfair competition to \ncharitable giving. A lawsuit filed in Federal court in Wichita Falls, \nTX, challenges the ability of charities under Federal securities laws \nand antitrust laws to engage in planned giving with donors.\n  The lawsuit alleges that the American Council on Gift Annuities--an \neducational organization sponsored by more than 1,500 charities to \nassist them in issuing gift annuities--violated antitrust law by \nproviding actuarial tables to charities to assist them in determining \nthe interest they should pay on annuities. The lawsuit also alleges \nthat commingling of more than one charities' trust funds in a pooled \nincome fund is a violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and \nother securities laws.\n  The plaintiff--a disappointed potential heir of the elderly woman who \nmade the charitable donation--says that it is price-fixing for the \ncouncil to suggest what charities should pay in interest on gift \nannuities. She overlooks that gift annuities aren't trade or commerce \nin the first place. Congress recognized this fact in the Technical \nCorrections Act of 1988 when it excepted gift annuities from the \ndefinition of commercial insurance.\n  Instead of getting the best possible return on her investment, a \ncharitable donor is trying to help the charity. If she wanted \ninvestment return, she would go to a bank or a brokerage house, not the \nRed Cross.\n  Lawyers for the plaintiff are seeking class action certification to \nexpand the suit to charities from every State. The lawyers ask for the \nreturn of all charitable annuity donations plus treble damages--damages \nthat would have to be paid from endowments or unrelated donations.\n  Such an award could financially disable thousand of charities, \nincluding hospitals, relief organizations, arts groups, museums, \nuniversities, and every religious denomination in the country. One of \nthe plaintiff's lawyers in this case has boasted that this is a \n``billion-dollar lawsuit,'' because it will extract huge sums of money \nfrom our Nation's noblest institutions--and earn him a big contingency \nfee.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial security \nof American charities from being undermined. The bill exempts \ncharitable organization's annuity activities from the antitrust laws. \nIt also codifies current SEC policy for irrevocable trusts by \nclarifying that charities may make collective investments under the \nsecurities laws, such as investment in pooled income funds. For \nrevocable trusts, the bill provides a 3-year window for compliance with \nthe securities laws, termination of revocable trusts, or conversion of \nrevocable trusts into irrevocable trusts.\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\n  Similar legislation was unanimously passed this spring by the Texas \nLegislature to clarify that charities issuing gift annuities are not \nrequired to be licensed as insurance companies or incorporated as trust \ncompanies.\n  Charities in America have a consistent track record of honoring their \npromises and commitments to donors, and will remain liable for \nfraudulent acts--although none are alleged in this lawsuit. My bill \ndoes not exempt charities from liability for fraud. The persons \nresponsible for the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy ``Ponzi \nScheme'' would still be held responsible for their acts.\n  Charities are not harming anyone--the only harm being done is by this \nlawsuit to America's charities. We must act now to protect charitable \ngiving from harm, and to protect our laws from being misapplied.\n  Returning charitable annuity gifts and opening up endowments to pay \ntreble damages will harm all of us. Every dollar lost is a child \nunvaccinated, a baby unfed, a sick person with no medical care, a Boy \nScout troop that will cease to exist, a house for a poor family that \nwill not be built, and a scholarship that will not be granted. I urge \nall Senators to protect their most important institutions and pass this \nbill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Glenn, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 979. A bill to protect women's reproductive health and \nconstitutional right to choice, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       the women's choice and reproductive health protection act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduce the Women's Choice and \nReproductive Health Protection Act with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Murray, Senator Feinstein, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Inouye, Senator Glenn, Senator Packwood, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Specter. Similar legislation will be \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Schroeder and Lowey.\n  The Women's Choice and Reproductive Health Protection Act \nunequivocally calls on Congress to maintain current policies which \npreserve a woman's right to choose and critical reproductive health \ncare services.\n  Specifically, the bill upholds the following policies which represent \ngains for women that were achieved through legislative action, \nPresidential Executive order or court decisions:\n  Medicaid funding of abortions for victims of rape or incest;\n  Protection for reproductive health care clinics and a woman's access \nto them;\n  Reauthorization of family planning programs;\n  Funding for contraceptive research and for screening programs in all \n50 States for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and chlamydia;\n  The prohibition of any ``gag rule'' on information pertaining to \nreproductive medical services;\n  Fair evaluation of the drug RU-486;\n  Ensuring that all women, including Federal employees, can obtain \ninsurance policies that provide the full range of reproductive health \ncare services;\n  Allowing women in the military to use their own funds to obtain \nabortion services at overseas facilities; and\n  A woman's right to choose, as decided by the Supreme Court in Roe \nversus Wade.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support a woman's right to choose. \nYet there are those in this Congress who are determined to turn the \nclock back--on clinic access, on family planning, and on reproductive \nrights. The women of America cannot afford to go back and this bill \ncalls on Congress to hold firm against such attacks.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill and in \nreaffirming their support for a woman's right to choose and for crucial \nreproductive health care services.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 980. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Social \nSecurity Act to protect and improve the availability, quality and \naffordability of health care in rural areas, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      the rural health care protection and improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Rural Health \nCare Protection and Improvement Act of 1995. I have introduced similar \nlegislation in previous sessions of Congress but believe the need for \nthe legislation has grown more critical in light of our failure to \nenact comprehensive health care reform and because of the impending \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Perhaps no where else will the proposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts \nhit harder than in Iowa and other rural States where there is such a \nhigh proportion of seniors, uninsured and others without access to \nhealth care. Iowa ranks first in percent of citizens over age 85 and \nthird nationally in percent of the population over age 65. The health \ncare system in many small towns in Iowa is already on the critical \nlist--we have too few doctors, nurses, and other health care \nprofessionals and many of our rural hospitals are barely making it.\n  Because of demographics our health care providers in Iowa depend \nheavily on Medicare payments. Many Iowa hospitals are financially \nstrained and 75 percent of all hospitals lost money on patient revenue \nin 1993. But, according to a recent study conducted by Lewin-VHI, under \nthe Republican budget plan, Iowa hospitals will lose on average $1,276 \nfor each Medicare care patient in the year 2000--and losses for rural \nhospitals will be even greater.\n  Mr. President, without question, the future of rural health care is \njeopardized by the budget plan we will consider later this week and the \nreconciliation bill that will implement it. The level of cuts proposed \nwould be absolutely devastating to the fragile health care systems in \nrural areas and thus to our rural and small town economies as hospitals \nare typically the largest employer in small towns and help keep other \nbusinesses there. So our first and most important concern must be to \nstop the level of cuts proposed by the budget resolution. If they \nbecome law, there is very little that could be done to resuscitate \nrural health care. Smaller efforts, while well intentioned, will not be \nsuccessful in counteracting the impacts of such cuts.\n  We need to be improving access to and affordability of quality health \ncare in rural areas, not reducing it. The legislation I introduce today \nwould do just that. It would make a number of important improvements to \nrural health. First, it would establish a grant program to expand \naccess to health services in rural areas through the use of \ntelemedicine. For 6 years as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education my \ncommittee funded many telemedicine projects including several in my own \nState of Iowa. These funds have spurred great interest and activity in \ntelemedicine across the country. But more needs to be done.\n  The grant program in my legislation will encourage the development of \ntelemedicine networks which can play a critical role in ensuring that \npeople in rural areas have access to high quality health care. \nTelemedicine puts technology to work to improve the delivery of\n health care. It uses technology to link patients and their doctors in \nrural or remote hospitals with highly-trained medical specialists and \nstate of the art medical technology located hundreds, or even thousands \nof miles away. These linkages will allow more patients to receive care \nin their community and will ease the burden on specialists in \nunderserved areas. By increasing the education and training \nopportunities for providers in rural areas these links will also help \nunderserved communities recruit and retain physicians.\n\n  Telemedicine will help ensure that people who live in small towns and \nrural communities have the same access to quality health care as people \nin Beverly Hills or Palm Beach.\n  Rural hospitals and other facilities can benefit from the cost \nsavings and access to specialists that telemedicine provides. Using a \nnetwork, a family doctor in Muscatine, IA could immediately consult \nwith a specialist at the \n\n[[Page S9308]]\nUniversity of Iowa for an instant diagnosis in a life-or-death \nsituation. A specialist in Mercy Hospital in Des Moines could provide \nemergency advice and help oversee a difficult surgery taking place in \nCenterville. And a radiologist at Methodist Hospital in Des Moines \ncould help examine x rays just taken in Jefferson.\n  My home State of Iowa has developed a world class fiber optic system \nthat holds great potential in the area of telemedicine. Fiber optic \ncables greatly enhance the potential of telemedicine because they carry \nmuch more information than traditional, copper telephone wires.\n  My President, telemedicine will allow patients to stay close to home \nfor support. For most people, one of the most traumatic times in their \nlife is when they are sick or injured. And we should be helping them \nstay with their family and friends, who often provide the support and \nlove they need to get well. This will also reduced costs associated \nwith travel.\n  One of the obstacles for further expansion of telemedicine is the \nlack of a payment system in Medicare and Medicaid. To begin to address \nthis problem, my legislation would require the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to issue regulations regarding reimbursement for \ntelemedicine.\n  This legislation would also authorize the Rural Health Outreach Grant \nProgram. I began this program as chairman of the Health Appropriations \nSubcommittee several years ago and it has been a great success. Many \nrural communities suffer critical shortages of health providers. \nDistance, lack of public transportation, rough terrain, and \nunpredictable weather, present additional obstacles. This initiative \nrecognizes that existing health and social services agencies do not \nalways cooperate and coordinate to reach needy populations in rural \nAmerica.\n  Through the Rural Health Outreach Program rural organizations have \nbeen able to come together to collaborate and build networks to deliver \nmuch needed health care. For example, communities used funds provided \nby the Outreach Program to provide basic health care services to \nisolated seniors, to provide care to pregnant women, to build emergency \nmedical systems, and to bring mental health services to isolated \ncommunities with the help of telemedicine.\n  In my own State of Iowa, outreach funds were used to help get a new \nhospice program in rural Grundy County up and running. The local \nhospital joined with the local health department and volunteer \norganizations to develop a program to help families coping with \nterminal illness. The program helps families that are struggling to \nsurvive under the weight of nursing chores, daily responsibilities and \ngrief.\n  Mr. President, the Rural Health Care Protection and Improvement Act \nwould also extend the Medicare Department, Small, Rural Hospital \nProgram. Between 1980 and 1990, 330 rural hospitals were forced to \nclose their doors, in large part because of inequities in Medicare \nreimbursement. In OBRA 1989, Congress wisely acted to redress these \ninequities by establishing the Medicare Dependent Small Rural Hospital \n[MDH] Program. The MDH Program allows rural hospitals under 100 beds to \nqualify for somewhat higher reimbursement if over 60 percent of their \npatient days went to caring for Medicare patients. But, Mr. President \nthis program expired in October 1994.\n  Iowa has 45 Medicare department, small, rural, hospitals. These \nhospitals mean access to health care services and retention of local \nhealth care providers. They also provide economic stability and are a \nstrong draw for businesses and residents into the area. If the hospital \nor clinic closes it means that the local economy goes, and the nursing \nhome goes, and so does the local economy. It is a domino effect.\n  The MDH Program is helping many Iowa hospitals survive and this \nprogram should be extended to ensure that these small rural hospitals \ncontinue to provide health care services.\n  So, Mr. President, the Rural Health Care Protection and Improvement \nAct will help improve access and enhance the quality of health care in \nrural areas. It will help shore up the fragile health care \ninfrastructure in our rural communities and towns. I am pleased that \nSenator Kassebaum has included the Rural Outreach Grant Program and a \nTelemedicine Grant Program in her Health Centers Consolidation Act of \n1995 that will soon be voted on in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. And, I am hopeful that as we consider steps to improve our \nNation's health care system, the Medicare Department, Small, Rural \nHospital Program will be extended. But not even my bill will be enough \nto save rural health care if the unprecedented level of cuts to \nMedicare being proposed become a reality. We must defeat those \nproposals and work toward a more sound, a more reasonable effort to \nreform Medicare.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 981. A bill entitled ``Truck Safety and Congressional Partnership \nAct''; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           the truck safety and congressional involvement act\n\n Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which the \nSenate was expected to consider as an amendment to the National Highway \nSystem. Last minute negotiations between the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee and myself produced an understanding that this legislation \nwould be considered by the full committee at the next scheduled markup.\n  This legislation is a very simple and very narrow measure. It \npreserves congressional involvement in critical truck safety issues \ncurrently before a trinational committee authorized under the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. This legislation simply states that if \nthe executive branch moves to set a standard for single trailer lengths \npursuant to the NAFTA negotiations and that standards exceeds 53 feet, \nthe executive branch must come to the Congress for such authority.\n  This legislation only applies to Federal regulations on truck trailer \nlength issue pursuant to the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing on this issue of truck lengths and \nsafety. Needless to say there are serious concerns about the safety of \nlonger and heavier trucks.\n  Pursuant to the NAFTA agreement, the Governments of Mexico, Canada, \nand the United States of America are negotiating the harmonization of \ntraffic safety laws. The Senate has been very concerned about these \nnegotiations and following the approval of NAFTA, approved a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that these negotiations should bring \nCanadian and Mexican traffic safety up to United States levels, rather \nthan lower United States standards. I am pleased to report that the \nClinton administration expressed their desire to involve Congress in \nthe adoption of any new safety rules arising out of these negotiations. \nthis legislation simply locks in that commitment.\n  Since the Federal Government maintains no single trailer length \nstandards, there is a risk that a future administration cold use the \nNAFTA negotiations to increase lengths beyond the generally accepted \n53-foot standard.\n  This legislation assures that the Congress will remain involved in \ncritical truck safety issues. Again, Mr. President, this bill only \napplies if the administration sets a single trailer length standards \npursuant to NAFTA negotiations exceeding 53 feet. In such a case, \ncongressional action would be necessary to implement the longer Federal \nstandard.\n  The amendment does not restrict State action.\n  The amendment does not affect Federal legislative action.\n  The amendment does not affect Federal regulatory action not related \nto the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  The amendment is consistent with the intent of the Reigle-Exon NAFTA/\ntruck safety resolution, approved by the Senate following the approval \nof NAFTA, and in no way disrupts the long combination vehicles freeze \nSenator Lautenberg and I authored as part of the 1990 highway bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider and support this narrow legislation \nwhich will preserve congressional discretion over truck safety and the \nNAFTA.\n\n\n

Mr. President, 6 years ago the National Council \nof Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] released a publication, the \n``Curriculum Standards for School Mathematics,'' which established \nnational standards for mathematics education. The Standards presented a \nvision of appropriate mathematical goals for all students. It \nrepresented a consensus view of educators, mathematicians, classroom \nteachers, researchers, lay persons, and leaders in business.\n  The Standards are based on the assumption that all students are \ncapable of learning mathematics. The Standards describe what a high-\nquality mathematics education for North American students, K-12, should \ncomprise. However, since their publication, NCTM has granted permission \nfor the Standards to be translated into the Chinese, Korean, Spanish, \nand Portuguese languages. The Standards are being used as a guide to \nmathematics education reform in many countries around the world. This \npublication has given the world a vision of meaningful mathematics \neducation.\n  NCTM's goal was to develop mathematics power for all students. \nReaching this goal required more than a vision. Two years later this \npublication was followed by a second document, ``Professional Standards \nfor Teaching Mathematics.'' These Professional Standards are a guide \nfor the creation of a curriculum and an environment in which teaching \nand learning are to occur. It is now being used by colleges and \nuniversities in their mathematics teacher preservice education \nprograms. The goal is to develop public school teachers who are more \nproficient in selecting tasks to engage students in learning \nmathematics, providing opportunities for understanding mathematics, \npromoting the investigation and growth of mathematical ideas, using \ntechnology and other tools to promote investigations, and connecting \nmathematics to previous and developing knowledge.\n  The Curriculum Standards contained the vision. The Professional \nStandards outlines teacher training methods that will enable educators \nto achieve this vision. Recently, NCTM has released a third \npublication, the ``Assessment Standards for School Mathematics.'' This \npublication will establish criteria for student assessment and program \nevaluation and elaborate the vision of assessment that was described in \nthe previous documents. The purposes of assessment include monitoring \nstudent progress, making instructional decisions, evaluating student \nachievement, and evaluating programs. The assessment standards should \nreflect the mathematics that all students need to know and be able to \ndo, should enhance mathematics learning, should promote equity, and \nshould be an open process.\n  If meaningful and long lasting change is to realized, all aspects of \nschool mathematics--content, teaching, and assessment--need to change \non a systemic basis. These three documents are tools, not solutions. \nThey will provide the tools needed for significant mathematics reform \nto take place. This effort is truly exemplary in that first, the \ncommunity came together on its own, and second, standards have been \ndeveloped without one dollar from the Federal Government.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to bring this publication to the \nattention of fellow Senators and voice my support for worthwhile \neducation reforms. I congratulate NCTM for their efforts to this end by \nproviding the mathematics community these valuable documents.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9310-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9310-S9311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nIN MEMORY OF TREASURY ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND SPECIAL AGENTS LOST IN \n                         OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it has been 2 months since a bomb \nexploded at 9:02 a.m. April 19 in Oklahoma City. The rescue is over but \nwe are still in shock, still grieving, and still trying to understand \nthis tragedy. I come to the floor today with a profound sense of \nsadness. My heart goes out to the families of the fine people whose \nlives have been tragically taken by this horrific act. I feel that it \nis my duty as the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nwhich funds the Department of Treasury that I share my thoughts on \nTreasury law enforcement and their losses. All law enforcement--agent \nand personnel alike--live with the threat of losing a colleague, but no \nmatter how dangerous the job, no matter how families and the law \nenforcement community prepare themselves, it is never enough.\n  It is particularly devastating to have the lives of law enforcement \nlost in this manner--helpless, unaware, and going about their daily \nbusiness as were the rest of the employees in the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building. Wednesday, April 19, 1995, 9:02 a.m., was a sad day \nfor all Americans across the United States. It was also the day that \nthe U.S. Secret Service suffered the largest loss in its history. \nAssistant special agent in charge, Alan G. Whicher, age 40; office \nmanager, Linda G. McKinney, age 48; special agent, Cynthia L. Brown, \nage 25; special agent, Mickey B. Maroney, age 50; special agent, Donald \nR. Leonard, age 50; and investigative assistant, Kathy L. Siedl, age \n39. In addition, the U.S. Customs Service lost two senior special \nagents, Claude A. Meaderis, age 41; and Paul D. Ice, age 42.\n  Let me just say a few words about these fine people.\n  Alan Whicher, appointed as a special agent to the U.S. Secret Service \non April 12, 1976 in the Washington field office, known by his friends \nas Al, was a devoted father and husband. His career, which spanned two \ndecades, included the Vice Presidential Protective Division during the \nReagan administration and the Presidential Protective Division of two \nPresidents. He is survived by his wife Pamela Sue Whicher and their \nthree children, Meredith, Melinda, and Ryan.\n  Linda G. McKinney, was appointed to the Secret Service on June 28, \n1981 in Oklahoma City. Linda served as the office manager. She is \nsurvived by her husband Danny, and son Jason Derek Smith, age 22. Her \nmother, Minnie J. Griffon, also survives her. I know she will be sorely \nmissed as a daughter, wife, and mother.\n  Cynthia L. Brown, who had celebrated her first year as a rookie agent \nand was married only 40 days to Secret Service Special Agent Ron Brown \nof the Phoenix field office. They were both waiting for transfers so \nthey could be together. Cindy was only 25, a bright future ahead of her \nboth in her career and in her new life with Ron.\n  Mickey Maroney, was appointed as a special agent to the U.S. Secret \nService in the Fort Worth office on June 14, 1971. Mickey's \ndistinguished career included the Johnson Protective Division and Lady \nBird Johnson's protective detail. Mickey is survived by his wife \nRobbie, and children Alice, age 27, and Mickey Paul, age 23. I know he \nwill be missed by those whose lives he touched.\n  Don Leonard, was appointed as a special agent to the U.S. Secret \nService in Oklahoma City on November 16, 1970. His career spanned over \ntwo decades including assignments in the Tulsa resident office, the \nProtective Support Division, the Vice Presidential Protective Division \nand the St. Louis field office. Don is survived by his wife Diane, and \nsons, Eugene, age 26, Jason, age 23, and Timothy, age 22.\n  Kathy Siedl, was appointed to the U.S. Secret Service on March 17, \n1985, as an investigative assistant. She served her country for over a \ndecade. Kathy is survived by her husband Glenn and her son Clint, who I \nunderstand collects Secret Service pins. In addition, she is survived \nby her parents, Dallas and Sharon Davis, and Carol Reiswig, her sister, \nwho works \n\n[[Page S9311]]\nfor the Internal Revenue Service in Oklahoma City.\n  Paul D. Ice, born and raised in Oklahoma, was a senior special agent \nfor the U.S. Customs Service and had a lengthy record of Government \nservice. He began his career as a Marine jet pilot and spent 5 years \nwith the IRS as an agent in the Criminal Investigation Division before \ntransferring to Customs as a special agent. He was one of the first \nspecial agents assigned to the resident agent office in Oklahoma City \nand had been there for 7 years. He was a member of the Marine Corps \nReserve for 20 years, retiring last year with the rank of lieutenant \ncolonel. Paul is survived by his daughters, Sara and Miranda, their \nmother Faith, and his parents Jack and Neva Ice.\n  Claude A. Medearis was a senior special agent for the U.S. Customs \nService and also a native of Oklahoma and a veteran of public service. \nBefore coming to the Customs Service he served in the military and in \nthe Oklahoma State probation and parole office. He began his career \nwith Customs in Del Rio, TX, before transferring to Oklahoma City in \n1992. He was recently promoted to senior special agent status. Claude \nis survived by his wife Sharon and daughter Kathy.\n  Mr. President, in light of all that has happened since the bombing, I \nwould simply like to remind us of this simple fact--these brave people \nwho worked in Federal law enforcement were members of the Oklahoma City \ncommunity. They were mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, they \nshared the same dreams and goals for their children that their \nneighbors did--they were little league coaches and volunteers in their \ncommunity. They were willing to give the supreme sacrifice to their \nNation and community--we should not tarnish their families' memories by \nvilifying them. They are not faceless, nameless robots. They hurt like \nyou when they lose a loved one, as their families hurt now from losing \nthem.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9310-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9311-S9312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    DON'T SIGN A BAD DEAL IN GENEVA\n\n Mr. BOND. The world's attention is focused on today's deadline \nfor a resolution of the auto parts trade dispute between the United \nStates and Japan. At the same time, however, another critical trade \ndeadline looms largely unnoticed.\n  On June 30, the United States must decide whether to lock open its \nfinancial services markets regardless of whether our trading partners \ndo the same. We would do this by surrendering our right to take an \nexemption from the most-favored-nation [MFN] provision of the World \nTrade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS].\n  For many years, it has been the policy of the United States to \nprovide open access and national treatment to foreign financial firms \nthat want to enter our market, regardless of foreign barriers to entry \nby U.S. firms. During the past decade, our Government, actively aided \nby our financial services industry, has worked to open foreign \nfinancial markets. The Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations, which \nbegan in 1986, aimed at achieving for the first time multilateral \nstandards for open trade in financial services. Our negotiators sought \ncommitments from other countries that would guarantee substantially \nfull market access and national treatment to U.S. financial firms in \nforeign markets. Unfortunately, those negotiations ran into \ndifficulties as some of our trading partners with the most restrictive \npractices in financial services were reluctant to make the market \nopening commitments needed to bring them to a successful conclusion.\n  In December 1993, as the Uruguay round concluded in Geneva, \nnegotiators agreed to include financial services within the GATS. That \nagreement establishes a multilateral framework of principles and rules \nfor trade in financial services, including the principles of national \ntreatment and MFN status. However, members were bound by these \nprinciples only to the extent they made commitments in their GATS \noffers. Unfortunately, the commitments made by many countries to open \ntheir markets to foreign financial institutions under that framework \nwere far less than the United States had hoped for. As a result, the \nUnited States, as it was legally permitted to do, took an exemption \nfrom the GATS MFN obligation with respect to new establishment and new \npowers for foreign financial firms. The purpose of doing so was to \nallow our Government to differentiate among members of the World Trade \nOrganization in regard to providing their firms a guarantee they would \nalways have full access with national treatment in our market. In \nessence, we did not want to lock our market open, while other countries \nwere given GATS protection to continue restricting access to theirs.\n  The Uruguay round final agreement provided that for 6 months after \nthe GATS went into effect, countries would suspend their MFN exemption \nand continue to negotiate.\n  The stakes in these talks are enormous. Exports of financial products \nand services represent one of the greatest potential export markets the \nUnited States will have in the coming century. We are far ahead of most \nof the rest of the world in development of our markets and of new \nfinancial instruments. One need only think of the billions of people in \nChina, India, Indonesia, Brazil, and other developing nations who have \nno insurance, who do not have access to an ATM machine, who have not \never invested in mutual funds or who do not yet even have saving \naccounts. As these countries develop and personal income levels rise, \nU.S. firms can and should play a role in providing those services.\n  Even more important is the impact of financial services on other \ntrade and investment. The ability of other American industries to sell \ntheir goods overseas depends, in large part, on the support of American \nbanks and securities firms in those markets. As U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Mickey Kantor recently told the Senate Banking \nCommittee, ``if you can't get your financial services companies into a \nmarket, it has a negative effect upon your ability to get your products \ninto the market and, of course, that has a negative effect on the U.S. \neconomy.''\n  The United States has approached these talks with a call for fair and \nopen markets. We have offered--and urged all other countries to offer--\n a system of national treatment, whereby foreign institutions would be \ntreated the same as domestic ones.\n\n  Unfortunately, it appears likely that come midnight on June 30, we \nwill not have seen sufficient progress to justify signing an agreement. \nAlthough several countries have put forward offers that would provide \nnational treatment, the WTO's MFN rule prevents us from guaranteeing \nthese countries national treatment in our market without giving it to \nall other WTO members as well. Thus, for example, if the United States \nand the European Union accept each other's offers and guarantee each \nother national treatment, other countries not doing the same would \nstill reap the benefit of that agreement and get national treatment in \nboth Europe and the United States without offering equal access to \ntheir market. These free riders would be getting the benefit of the \nagreement without giving anything in return.\n  Many of the offers on the table today are simply unacceptable. India, \nfor example, has closed its insurance market to all private companies. \nBrazil maintains a total prohibition on new foreign financial firms \nentering their market. Korea continues to restrict foreign access to \nits financial markets. A number of Southeast Asian nations have placed \non the table offers that could require United States financial \ncompanies to divest their current holdings in local firms. These are \nsome of the fastest growing and potentially most lucrative markets in \nthe world. Signing an agreement under these conditions, would lock in \nthese barriers and provide countries a legal right under the WTO to \nenforce them. That would deny our financial firms access to good \nmarkets, and would hurt our ability to get U.S. goods and investments \ninto those markets. We would be insane to sign an agreement which would \nlegitimize these barriers and effectively shut American firms out of \nthese markets in perpetuity while locking our market open to firms from \nthese same countries.\n  There is an alternative for U.S. negotiators, however; we can reject \na bad agreement, maintain our MFN exemption, and begin to negotiate \nbilateral agreements with countries that want \n\n[[Page S9312]]\nopen financial markets. Under such a plan, the United States could \nimmediately sign agreements with the European Union, Switzerland, \nNorway, and other countries that are offering national treatment. We \ncould then continue to negotiate with other nations, using access to \nour lucrative American market as a lever to get them to open their own.\n  There is no question the United States is under strong international \npressure to surrender our MFN exemption. Earlier this year, a senior \nBritish trade official flew to Washington to pressure United States \nTreasury officials to sign an agreement in Geneva--regardless of \nwhether it makes sense for the United States. And the head of the WTO \nargued recently that the United States must make the right decision and \nsign whatever agreement is on the table when the deadline rolls around.\n  Proponents of a deal argue that failure to conclude an agreement will \nweaken the WTO. But that argument is hogwash. To the contrary, the \nworst thing we could do would be to sign an agreement that sanctions \nclosed markets and unfair barriers. That would weaken support for the \nWTO far more than failure to reach an agreement in Geneva. The American \npeople rightly expect that free trade must be a two-way street.\n  In recent days, some have proposed an extension of the talks as one \nway to deal with the lack of progress. I believe an extension makes \nsense since it will allow us to build on the progress that has been \nmade to date. I believe strongly, however, that for the United States \nto maintain its leverage during any extended talks--whether in the \nmultilateral WTO forum, or on a bilateral basis--the United States must \nexercise its MFN exemption. To do otherwise would remove any incentive \nfor countries such as Korea, which wants to expand in our market, to \nnegotiate in good faith. Exercising our MFN exemption would not require \nthe United States to retaliate against other countries or to, in any \nway, close off its market. It would merely give us the right to do so \nat a later date, if we decided it was in our best interest to do so. \nGranting MFN, on the other hand, would lock our market open--and \nthereby remove our leverage in the talks.\n  U.S. negotiators should stand firm. The United States has played the \nsucker far too many times in international trade negotiations. The \nstakes this time are simply too high. Handshakes and promises of future \naction are not good enough. If the final written offers are not \nsignificantly better than those on the table today, U.S. trade \nofficials should act in our clear national interest, and walk away from \nthe table.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9311-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n RECOGNIZING RECIPIENTS OF THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD FROM THE STATE OF \n                                MARYLAND\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I was recently privileged to \naddress the convention of the United Nations Association during its \nconference in San Francisco, coinciding with the celebration of the \n50th anniversary of the United Nations. I took the opportunity to make \nsome observations about the past, present, and future of U.N. \npeacekeeping, and I offer them here for the record.\n\n\n             The U.N. Mission: A Trend Toward Peacekeeping\n\n  When we look at the 50-year history of the United Nations, certain \nfacts and trends become evident. One of these is the increasing trend \ntoward peacekeeping. In the first 43 years of its existence, from 1945 \nto 1988, the United Nations launched 13 peacekeeping missions in places \nsuch as Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, the then-Congo, Cyprus, \nbetween India and Pakistan, and along Arab-Israeli borders. While the \nresults of these missions were not uniformly successful, the United \nNations proved it was able to play an important role in resolving, or \nat least containing, a number of dangerous conflicts.\n  And yet, during this period, the United Nations faced certain \nrealities, the largest of which was the superpower rivalry between the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union. As conflicts developed, the \ncountries involved were forced, either through external or internal \nforces, to align themselves with one superpower or the other. In this \nenvironment, the United Nations was often left on the sidelines. When \nUnited States and Soviet interests collided, each could cancel out the \nother's initiatives with their Security Council vetoes. When conflicts \ninvolved vital United States and Soviet interests, the two powers did \nnot hesitate to take it upon themselves to try to resolve the conflict \nin their favor rather than seeking a negotiated resolution through the \nUnited Nations.\n  There is no question that the cold war was a time of serious \ninternational insecurity. The specter of two superpowers, with weapons \nof immense destructive capability aimed at each other, competing for \ninfluence across the globe, lasted for nearly 45 years, ending \nstartlingly in 1990 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  Even today, many people share the misconception that the demise of \nthe Soviet Union has created a more secure world. I do not believe that \nthis is necessarily the case.\n  The cold war, for all its dangers, had the unintended effect of \ndiscouraging many smaller countries, nationalities, and ethnic \nminorities from fighting one another. The danger that any uprising \ncould, and would with certainty, be put down brutally by the Soviet \nUnion, clearly contained insurrections and civil wars in areas like the \nformer Yugoslavia. If Tito were in power \n\n[[Page S9313]]\ntoday, under Soviet control, the civil war would most probably not have \nhappened. A dying vestige of this cold war control is seen today in \nChechnya, where a weakened Russia is brutally struggling to contain and \nvanquish Chechen rebels.\n  However, the potential for nuclear war also had a deterrent and \nstabilizing effect on both major superpowers in their dealing with each \nother.\n  Today, with these cold war constraints gone, an equally, if not more \ndangerous scenario has developed whereby smaller conflicts that had \nbeen festering just beneath the surface have now emerged, many erupting \nwith unprecedented force and brutality. Though the numbers vary almost \nweekly, through most of 1994 and 1995, there have been over 30 wars \nraging simultaneously across the world.\n  Trouble spots seem to crop up everywhere. Some fizzle quickly, while \nothers spread into larger regional conflicts. Once again, genocide, \nstarvation, ethnic cleansing, mass rape, torture, and millions of \nhomeless people confront all of us. From Bosnia and Croatia to Rwanda \nand Burundi, from Afghanistan to Algeria, and from Sudan to Tajikistan, \nethnic, religious and national grievances are taking a tremendous toll \nin human life. And whether these conflicts are internal or across \nborders, they all contribute to the deepening sense of international \ninsecurity.\n  In this increasingly complex and dangerous environment, there has \nnever been a greater need for the United Nations to provide leadership. \nNo other body, and certainly no single nation, is equipped to deal with \nthe problems of ancient territorial disputes, ethnic and religious \nrivalries, inherent in the host of newly emergent independent nations, \nmany with ruthless dictators.\n  For this reason, peacekeeping is fast becoming the most important and \nsignificant function of the United Nations. As the world community \ngrapples for ways to deal with these burgeoning conflicts, multilateral \npeacekeeping is increasingly seen as the best or the only viable \nrecourse. As such, the United Nations alone is also seen--and \nrightfully so--as the only body with the structure, the experience and \nthe international mandate to make a nonpartisan peacekeeping effort \nsucceed.\n  The numbers bear out this trend: After 13 peacekeeping missions in \nits first 43 years, the United Nations has performed 25 such missions \nin the last 7 years alone. Today there are 16 concurrent peacekeeping \nmissions underway. In 1988 there were 9,000 soldiers from different \ncountries participating in peacekeeping missions. Today there are more \nthan\n 61,000 from over 80 countries.\n\n  I believe that on this anniversary, we should pause, take stock, and \nreevaluate where events mandate change in both the role and mission of \nthe United Nations. Clearly, peacekeeping has become a major and \nexpanding role. The question is: Can the blue-helmeted observer of the \npast and present effectively be the peacekeeper of the future?\n  For a moment, let us look at some peacekeeping successes.\n  In Cyprus, U.N. peacekeepers have helped since 1964 to prevent a \nresumption of hostilities that could lead to war between two of our \nNATO allies, Greece and Turkey.\n  On the Golan Heights, U.N. peacekeepers have helped make the Israeli-\nSyrian border one of the quietest in the Middle East for the last 21 \nyears.\n  In El Salvador and Cambodia, U.N. peacekeepers helped to safeguard \nthe reconciliation process at the end of those countries' civil wars, \nand helped provide the order necessary to conduct free and democratic \nelections.\n  Clearly, these were, and are, successful missions. When peacekeeping \nworks, it can stabilize, reduce tension and hostility, and provide the \nbackdrop needed before which peacemaking can succeed.\n  It is worth noting here that, today, even with the dramatic increase \nin peacekeeping missions, U.S. troops constitute only about 5 percent \nof total U.N. peacekeeping efforts around the world--about 3,300 out of \nover 61,000.\n  Now let's look at some of the problems.\n  As peacekeeping missions increase in numbers, more funding is \nrequired to keep it going. In 1988, the [U.N.] peacekeeping budget was \n$230 million. In 1994, the budget grew to $3.5 billion.\n  Here, the United States makes its primary contribution to U.N. \npeacekeeping in financial terms, paying 31 percent of all assessed \ncosts, although Congress has mandated that the U.S. share be reduced to \n25 percent this October. In 1988, the U.S. contribution for assessed \npeacekeeping cost was $36.7 million. In 1994, the U.S. share rose to \n$991 million -- a huge increase.\n  Clearly not all peacekeeping operations have been successful. We can \nand should learn from the tragedies of Bosnia and Somalia--perhaps the \ntwo most difficult examples of U.N. peacekeeping in the last 50 years. \nWhy have they been so difficult? I would submit that not all \npeacekeeping missions are the same, and they often become confused. \nDifferent peacekeeping missions require different types of peacekeeping \nefforts. You cannot lump them all together.\n  For example, in Somalia, the United Nations started out engaged in a \nsuccessful humanitarian mission to prevent hundreds of thousand from \nstarving to death, but the mission soon changed into one of nation-\nbuilding and political involvement, finally resulting in confrontations \nwith the warring factions.\n  The U.N. forces in Somalia proved unable to respond to a shifting set \nof dynamics. The dynamics in one country are not going to be the same \nas the dynamics in another, and the dynamics within a country can \nchange overnight. The blue-helmeted observer that cannot fire back to \nprotect himself or civilians, without a convoluted approval process, \ncannot maintain peace when warring factions want to have at each other.\n  Somalia was a classic lesson in that regard. We saw a renegade \nwarlord who was prepared to circumvent the peacekeeping mission one way \nor another. The U.N. forces, when challenged, could not fight back \neffectively. The result was more than 100 U.N. peacekeepers and 18 U.S. \nArmy Rangers killed during that 24 month mission, and the United \nNations and the United States pulled out with mixed results.\n  But the ultimate challenge in this century to peacekeeping has been \nthe war in the former Yugoslavia. There the United Nations faces \ninsurmountable problems and dilemmas. Literally, more than 800 year of \nanimus, hatred, and territorial disputes have combined to provide \nUNPROFOR Its most difficult and challenging mission in U.N. history.\n  Perhaps in 1878, Benjamin Disraeli said it best when he offered these \nwords, in the British House of Lords:\n\n       No language can describe adequately the condition of that \n     large portion of the Balkan peninsula--Serbia, Bosnia, \n     Hercegovina and other provices--[the] political intrigues, \n     constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit . . \n     . hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions and \n     absence of any controlling power . . . nothing short of any \n     army of 50,000 of the best troops would produce anything like \n     order in these parts.\n\n  And that was 117 years ago.\n  On one hand, there has been a dramatic decrease in civilian \ncasualties in that terrible conflict--from 130,000 in 1992 down to \n3,000 in 1994. On the other hand, it is in Bosnia that we begin to see \nthe major shortcomings of United Nations forces as peacekeepers.\n  We saw it on May 25 in Tuzla, a ``U.N. Safe Area'' when 71 young \npeople, all under age 28, were killed by a single Serb shell--one of \nmany instances when Serb forces have eroded safe areas with attacks--\nwithout any retaliation, despite a Security Council resolution \nauthorizing such responses.\n  We saw it when 377 U.N. troops were recently taken hostage after a \nNATO airstrike on a Serbian ammunition dump.\n  We saw it when Captain O'Grady's F-16 was shot down, the second plane \nlost in Deny Flight operations, without response [as] scores of \nhostages were still held captive.\n  We see it every day, as U.N. peacekeepers attempt to protect innocent \ncivilians, sometimes successfully, but often not.\n  And we saw it, most poignantly, on June 10, when the United Nations \nmission in Sarajevo announced it would not respond to protect Muslim \nenclaves from attack without the consent of the Bosnian Serbs.\n  I believe it is fair to say that U.N. forces have neither the \ntraining, the \n\n[[Page S9314]]\nequipment, nor the rules of engagement, to allow them to sufficiently \nrespond to attacks against them or against civilian populations. They \nare meant to be observers--not fighters.\n  These problems have taken their toll on U.S. congressional support. \nAnd they have taken their toll, I think unfairly, on support for the \nUNPROFOR troops. In the Congress, there has been continuing debate over \nwhether a unilateral or a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo \nagainst Bosnia, or the withdrawal of UNPROFOR troops altogether is the \nhumane or the inhumane action to take. And, because the United States \nhas no troops on the ground in Bosnia, we have less leverage in \ninfluencing nations that do have troops on the ground.\n  It is my belief that the United Nations must address peacekeeping \nefforts more realistically in view of the variety of situations they \nfind themselves in, and provide a speedy and effective response \ndependent on the individual situation. The rapid reaction force \nrecently created for Bosnia should help. We all hope they can be moved \ninto the scene speedily, and that they will be properly empowered and \ncommanded, in order to have an effective and immediate impact.\n  The idea of rapid response units has been discussed repeatedly over \nthe past 50 years. At the international seminar hosted by the \nNetherlands Government in the spring of 1995, the Minister of Foreign \nAffairs of the Netherlands, Mr. Hans van Mierlo, presented a proposal \nof how such a force might work. Mr. van Mierlo's plan proposes a \npermanent rapid response nucleus, which would be able to be sent to a \ncritical area of the world on very short notice. Such a force, if \nheaded by a well-trained commanding officer with field experience, \ncould provide a robust response to any aggressive action.\n  So my first point here today is that the entire United Nations \npeacekeeping structure must be reexamined, and perhaps redefined and \nrestructured. Those of us who consider ourselves friends of the United \nNations, and who believe that the world needs the United Nations, and \nvice versa, are prepared to make a case for continued U.S. \nparticipation, even for payment of our dues, but our success depends \nupon the willingness of the U.N. leadership to meet and discuss these \nissues with the Congress, and on their willingness to make improvements \nin the way peacekeeping is conceived and carried out.\n\n\n                    peacekeeping versus peacemaking\n\n  The second point I would like to make here involves peacekeeping \nversus peacemaking. Clearly the record on peacekeeping over 50 years \nhas been, by and large, successful. The record on peacemaking is less \nclear.\n  I believe that the United Nations has an important and viable role in \npeacekeeping. And at times, the U.N. leadership has proven to be able \nmediators, and have helped parties in conflict reach a negotiated \nsettlement. At other times it has been unsuccessful. But I do not \nbelieve that the United Nations is set up for peacemaking, because \nsometimes peacemaking requires force, or at least the ability to bring \nforce to bear. The United Nations generally lacks the ability to bring \nsuch force to bear--whereas states, and alliances of states, have a \ngreater capacity to do so.\n  So, I would suggest that peacemaking efforts also be reevaluated. \nThis reevaluation should begin with an assessment of regional and \npolitical imperatives that lend themselves toward specific peacemaking \nalliances. Regional political forces, in the form of strong \ngeographically based alliances, can more effectively spearhead \ndiplomatic and military efforts to promote peacemaking than can the \nUnited Nations alone.\n  For example, peace has reigned in Europe for five decades since World \nWar II, primarily\n because of the strong NATO alliance. NATO has been an important \nframework for making and maintaining peace between longtime \nadversaries--like Greece and Turkey, or Germany and France, and it has \ndeterred aggression and conflict between East and West.\n\n  When peacemaking, rather than peacekeeping is called for, the United \nNations needs to work with alliances like these to bring about the \ndesired result. The United Nations can even foster the creation of such \nalliances, as indeed it did through a series of resolutions during the \n1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis. When the situation calls for peacemaking, \nthe United Nations must understand whether diplomacy is sufficient, and \nwhere it is not, the United Nations must cooperate with individual \nstates and alliances of states that can bring the necessary force to \nbear.\n  I am one that believes that the solution in Bosnia must be a \nnegotiated one. In other words, a diplomatic solution rather than a \nmilitary solution. Why? I can think of no military solution that would \nsolve these 800-year old animosities without enormous bloodshed and \nloss of life. Nor can I think of a diplomatic solution that will work \nwithout the force of military action to compel it and, perhaps, to \nmaintain it.\n  Warren Zimmerman, former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, in a recent \narticle in the Washington Post, laid out what I believe is the only \nrealistic goal: Give the Bosnian Serbs a limited time and certain \ndeadline to agree to the plan advanced by the so-called contact group \nof five nations--a plan to which Mr. Milosevic has already agreed--\nwhich divides Bosnia virtually in half between the Serbs and their \nadversaries. But, as Ambassador Zimmerman correctly concludes, this \noutcome is only realistic if the Bosnian Serbs believe the West means \nbusiness.\n  If this solution remains unacceptable to the Bosnian Serbs, there \nappears to be no other choice but a multilateral lifting of the arms \nembargo and an expedited removal of UNPROFOR forces.\n  Based on briefings I have had, I can find no acceptable rationale for \na unilateral lifting of the embargo that would not involve the massive \nloss of life, or one without America being forced to arm and train \nMuslim forces, with the probability of a major spread of conflict in \nCroatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia.\n  In Bosnia, the single biggest problem for UNPROFOR has been that it \nis trying to carry out its mission with its hands tied. I truly believe \nthat if a U.N. peacekeeping operation is unable to respond to hostile \naction taken against it, then it is unlikely to succeed.\n  UNPROFOR troops, through no fault of their own, have had to stand by \nand watch civilians get picked off by sniper fire, have their own \nequipment stolen and used against them, and finally, have 377 of them \nbecome hostages themselves.\n  The primary lesson of Bosnia for U.N. peacekeeping is that U.N. \nmilitary commanders on the ground must have the authority, the weapons, \nand the trained fighting personnel to respond to hostile action with \nsufficient force to protect civilians and peacekeepers, and deter \nattack. This may require the establishment of permanent rapid response \nteams within U.N. peacekeeping missions, which will protect the mission \nand enable it to carry out its mandate.\n  In addition, peacekeepers need to be able to adapt to changing \nconditions. No matter how well a mission is planned, warring parties \ncan force the United Nations to change its mission, and U.N. troops \nneed to be able to respond. In this case, NATO's military response in \nthe form of airstrikes is based on a ``dual key'' decisionmaking \nprocess, whereas both the United Nations and NATO commanders decide \nupon and coordinate the response. Targeting and execution are joint \ndecisions by United Nations authorities and NATO military commanders.\n  The final point I'd like to make is that there is a need to develop \nalternative structures and alliances that can be employed both for \npeacekeeping and peacemaking.\n  Neither the United States, nor any other member state, can \nparticipate in every U.N.-sponsored effort to resolve every conflict. \nBut I do believe that the United Nations can proceed most effectively \nif it is able to develop solid back-up among regional groupings and \nalliances.\n  Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has suggested that regional groupings \nlike NATO, the Organization of the American States [OAS], and the \nOrganization of African Unity [OAU] could appropriately take on \npeacekeeping responsibilities for certain types of missions in their \nregions. Other organizations that might contribute include the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] and the Newly \nIndependent States of the former Soviet \n\n[[Page S9315]]\nUnion. There is a healthy logic to putting together specific alliances \nin specific areas of the world, so that peacekeeping is carried out \nwith some geographical relationship. Such missions would be \nstrengthened by the political determination of neighbors--who could be \naffected should a war spread--to see that peace is the only result.\n  There are successful models that should be considered. One such case \ninvolved the United States, Israel, and Egypt, who, in the 1979 Camp \nDavid Accords, jointly established a private, United States-led \npeacekeeping operation in the Sinai peninsula--the Multinational Force \nand Observers [MFO]. This successful mission, undertaken without U.N. \ninvolvement, goes on to this day. It might serve as a model for other \nmissions.\n  I have little doubt that the value of the United Nations to the \ninternational community and the United States will continue to grow. \nThe United States simply does not have the support of its people, nor \nthe resources, to assume the role of world-caretaker for the settlement \nof all disputes. The recognition of this fact will always bring people \nback to the conclusion that the United Nations is the best institution \nwe have for dealing in a collective way with problems that affect the \nsecurity of the United States and others.\n  Therefore, the United States has an obligation to work with the \nUnited Nations--not against it--to improve it, strengthen it, and make \nit more successful. With U.S. leadership, U.N. peacekeeping can indeed \nbecome more effective, better defined, and more realistically \nemployed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9312-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO VAN VANCE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to \nVan Vance, the ``Voice of the Cards.'' Van Vance has kept University of \nLouisville basketball and football fans tuned in on WHAS radio since \nthe 1981-82 seasons. And today, I'm saddened to announce that one of \nthe biggest Cardinals fans is giving up two of his true loves; play-by-\nplay for U of L basketball and his ``Sportstalk'' radio show.\n  Van's voice will surely be missed by U of L basketball fans next \nseason. He will also be missed by his old buddy and cohost, Jock \nSutherland. For Cardinal fans, Jock and Vance are like the Siskel and \nEbert of basketball, they have been inseparable for the past 13 \nseasons. Jock describes Van as ``an absolute total professional.'' In a \nrecent article in Louisville's Courier Journal Jock called Van ``the \nWalter Cronkite of Louisville Sports. They can replace you and replace \nyou with a good man, but there'll only be one Walter Cronkite.''\n  Van's love for basketball started at an early age. He earned the \nnickname ``Hawkeye'' while playing basketball at Park City High School. \nHe lead the team in scoring during the 1951-52 season, and even though \nhis career high was 39 points, Van most remembers a 34-point \nperformance that included a perfect 18 of 18 from the free throw line. \nThose are just several reasons Van earned letters in four sports and an \nathletic scholarship to Western Kentucky University.\n  His first job in radio came after a station manager in Glasgow, KY, \nheard his delivery of an ``I Speak for Democracy'' speech. He wasted no \ntime getting to work, he started the job just hours after his last \nbasketball game at Park City High in 1952. Van still had ``Hoop \nDreams.'' He went to play basketball for legendary Ed Diddle at Western \nKentucky, but when the coach made him choose between basketball and \nradio, Van gave up the courts for the studio.\n  After several radio jobs, Van finally landed at WHAS-AM in \nLouisville. He started as a staff announcer in 1957, and then joined \nthe sports staff in 1970. That same year, WHAS acquired the rights to \nbroadcast the Kentucky Colonels' games of the American Basketball \nAssociation. Van did play-by-play for the Colonels until the franchise \ndisbanded in 1976. Then in 1981, WHAS-AM was awarded the rights to U of \nL football and basketball games, and Van Vance was back on the air. The \nrest is Cardinals sports history.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to pay tribute to \nthe career of Van Vance. It has been a memorable one, highlights \ninclude; doing play-by-play for the Louisville victory over Duke in the \n1986 NCAA championship, the Kentucky Colonels' victory in the 1975 ABA \nchampionship, the first basketball ``Dream Game'' between U of L and \nUK, and the football Cardinals big win in the 1991 Fiesta Bowl. A \nrecent quote from Van sums it up best: ``I've always said a play-by-\nplay announcer is like a surfer--the better the team, the better the \ngame, the better announcer you can be. If you have a good wave, just \nride it.'' Let's hope Van catches the ``Big Kahuna'' and the ``Voice of \nthe Cards'' lives on in the hearts of cardinal fans young and \nold.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9315-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9315-S9317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE INFORMATION AGE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate took a dramatic step \ntoward transforming our telecommunications laws for the 21st century.\n\n\n                      congress sets telecom policy\n\n  There were many important issues addressed in that debate. But today, \nI would want to hit on one of the bill's main themes. It is simple, but \nimportant--Congress will not play second fiddle to the courts, or any \nother branch of Government, when it comes to establishing \ntelecommunications policy. Despite heavy opposition by the White House, \nI believe the final vote of 81 to 18 clearly demonstrated that Congress \nis now in charge.\n  This is not just a simple turf battle. Although, I seem to recall, \nthat legislating is a function of Congress, sometimes the courts have \nforgotten this constitutional separation of powers.\n  No other branch has greater accountability than ours. Voters have the \npower to elect us, and they have the power to send us home. We serve at \ntheir pleasure.\n  So in effect, when Congress sets policy, it is set by the people. \nNeither the courts nor the executive branch can make that claim.\n  That is why I found it so troubling when the courts usurped Congress' \nauthority to set telecommunications policy in the early 1980's. Instead \nof the voices of 535 Members of Congress, any judge in the country \ncould unilaterally set telecommunications policy. And they have done so \noften, sending conflicting signals.\n\n\n                          expanding doj's role\n\n  The reason I raise this point is some Members of this body wanted to \ngive the Department of Justice the same decisionmaking role as the \ncourts. Under existing antitrust statutes, the Department of Justice \nprepares an analysis that it must defend and prove in court. In effect, \nit is the prosecutor. What DOJ wanted in the telecommunications bill, \nhowever, was to be both prosecutor and judge. Sort of one-stop \nshopping.\n  Mr. President, I did not support this expansion of power. To me, this \nwas not an issue of whether you were pro-Bell or pro-long distance. \nInstead, I thought it set bad precedent. If we expanded DOJ's authority \nover Bell companies, someone could legitimately ask: ``Why shouldn't \nthis so-called one-stop shopping be extended to the entire \ntelecommunications industry? And why stop there. Maybe we should give \nDOJ such authority over all sectors of our economy.''\n  I do not believe that was the intent of my colleagues who supported \ngiving the Department of Justice a decisionmaking role, but what I did \nhear, however, was that many colleagues believed that current antitrust \nstandards were not sufficient.\n\n\n                           an overzealous doj\n\n  Mr. President, antitrust standards are not only sufficient, but it \nseems to me that the current Department of Justice is overzealous in \nits use of these statutes.\n  Just take a look at an article entitled, ``Microsoft Corporation \nBroadly Attacks Antitrust Unit'' that appeared in the June 27 edition \nof the Wall Street Journal. It outlines Microsoft's latest problem with \nthe Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n  More importantly, it sheds some light on how the Department of \nJustice intends to use its antitrust authority to regulate the \ninformation age. And to me it is frightening.\n  The article chronicles Microsoft's latest run-in with the Department \nof Justice and reports that DOJ is considering blocking Microsoft's \nefforts to \n\n[[Page S9316]]\ngive customers package deals on certain Microsoft products. The \nspecific products involved are Microsoft's updated windows software \npackage and its new on-line service.\n  Let us understand what is going on here. A company develops a new \nproduct. A product that consumers want. But now the Government steps in \nand is in effect attempting to dictate the terms on which that product \ncan be marketed and sold. Pinch me, but I thought we were still in \nAmerica.\n  If somebody makes something and somebody wants it, you sell it. You \ndo not have to go to the Department of Justice to get their approval.\n  Unfortunately, DOJ does not stop there. According to the article, and \nI quote, ``One of the [DOJ] document requests asks the company to \nproduce `all strategic plans prepared by or for Microsoft by any party \nand any documents provided by or to the board or top executives of \nMicrosoft concerning predictions as to the future of computers and \ncomputer technology.'''\n  If this report is accurate, DOJ is out of control.\n  Let us not forget, however, Justice has gone after Microsoft more \nthan once this year. First, there was the accord reached between \nMicrosoft and DOJ that Judge Sporkin opposed until the case was taken \naway from him.\n  Then there was Microsoft's efforts to purchase Intuit, a maker of \npersonal banking software. This fell through after DOJ sued to block \nthe deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, before DOJ took \nMicrosoft to court, the company had complied with two DOJ subpoenas \nwhich involved producing 772 boxes of paper and a ``foot-high stack of \nanswers'' to DOJ questions. That is right, 772 boxes of paper. \nBureaucrats gone wild. Imagine all the time and money, not to mention a \nforest or two, wasted on complying with Justice's requests.\n\n\n                   doj: an equal opportunity meddler\n\n  And it is not just Microsoft that DOJ has been eyeing lately. For \ninstance, earlier this year this same Antitrust Division declared that \na new cellular company by the name of Air Touch was a regional Bell \noperating company. As a result, it would carry all the restrictions of \na Baby Bell company.\n  True enough, Air Touch was a spin-off from the Baby Bell company \ncalled Pactel. But let us not forget the facts.\n  Fact No. 1. Air Touch is not a subsidiary of Pactel, it is a separate \ncompany.\n  Fact No. 2. Air Touch was purchased with money not connected with \nPactel.\n  Fact No. 3. Cellular or wireless services were not restricted under \nJudge Greene's break-up of Ma Bell. As Air Touch is a wireless company, \nhow can it have restrictions placed upon it that are not even \napplicable to a real Bell company? It just does not make any sense.\n  Now DOJ may believe that Air Touch is a Bell company because it is \ncomposed of former Bell property. I guess that makes Bell companies the \nmodern day equivalent of King Midas--anything they touch turns into a \nBell company.\n  Unfortunately, that line of logic creates a new problem. Bell \ncompanies have been off-loading all sorts of property to different \ncompanies in the last decade. Does that make all of these buyer \ncompanies a Bell company, too?\n  The bottom line is that DOJ cannot and has not justified its actions.\n\n\n                    big government: doj's expertise\n\n  Ironically, this is the same Department of Justice that wanted us to \ngive them a key role to play in telecommunications policy, because, get \nthis, they have greater expertise than the FCC. I read articles like \nthe Wall Street Journal's and I am left wondering: ``Greater expertise \nin what?'' Maybe it's in big government micromanaging business. Or \nmaybe it's that they have greater expertise in scuttling new services \nand products. Whatever it is, America does not need that type of \nexpertise.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, if DOJ is able to be this meddlesome under current \nlaw, just imagine if we had increased its authority under the \ntelecommunication bill. Unlike Congress, they have little or no \naccountability.\n  That is why Congress--not the executive or judiciary branches--should \nset telecommunications policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article which \nappeared in the June 27 Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 27, 1995]\n\n             Microsoft Corp. Broadly Attacks Antitrust Unit\n\n\nacting to quash subpoena, firm says it's facing apparent ``harassment''\n\n                    (By Viveca Novak and Don Clark)\n\n       Microsoft Corp., trying to quash a government subpoena \n     related to its new on-line information service, launched a \n     broad attack on the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n       In its unusual challenge to the subpoena, the Redmond, \n     Wash., software giant lashed out against the department and \n     belittled the legal theories the agency might use to block \n     the company from bundling access to the Microsoft Network \n     with Windows 95, the much-promoted operating system due for \n     release in late August.\n       Microsoft says it ``has been subjected to a series of \n     burdensome document demands . . . that shows no sign of \n     abating.'' The antitrust division ``seems to be doing its \n     level best to hinder Microsoft's efforts,'' it says, and it \n     calls the subpoena ``the latest salvo in what increasingly \n     appears to be a campaign of harassment directed against \n     Microsoft.''\n       Microsoft's petition, filed Friday in federal court in the \n     Southern District of New York, asks that the subpoena be set \n     aside. The Justice Department responded yesterday with a \n     motion to strike the petition, setting forth a different \n     version of circumstances surrounding last week's subpoena. \n     The subpoena gave the company only a few days to respond to \n     33 sets of questions and 16 requests for documents, some of \n     them sweeping.\n       For example, one of the document requests asks the company \n     to produce ``all strategic plans prepared by or for Microsoft \n     by any party and any documents provided by or to the board or \n     top executives of Microsoft concerning predictions as to the \n     future of computers and computer technology.''\n       The two sides even disagree about the date the subpoena was \n     issued; Microsoft said it was Wednesday, while the government \n     asserts Microsoft was given a ``courtesy copy'' two days \n     earlier, with slight modifications on Wednesday.\n       William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said that \n     filing the petition was simply a matter of ``protecting \n     ourselves against the consequences'' of missing the \n     government's deadline, since Microsoft didn't comply with \n     Wednesday's subpoena. The government could have asked a judge \n     to impose sanctions on the company.\n       Mr. Neukom said Microsoft filed the petition in New York \n     because it was convenient\n      to the company's outside law firm and because courts in New \n     York ``have a history of dealing with fast-moving, \n     complicated business transactions.'' Antitrust experts \n     speculated that Microsoft didn't want to file in \n     Washington because the company might draw Judge Stanley \n     Sporkin, whose sharply critical decision against a \n     separate antitrust accord involving Microsoft was recently \n     overturned.\n       For its part, the Justice Department contends it was still \n     in negotiations with Microsoft on the scope and timing of \n     delivering the documents when Assistant Attorney General Anne \n     Bingaman received a Friday-morning call from Microsoft's \n     outside counsel ``stating that he was standing in the \n     chambers'' of a district court judge and had moved to quash \n     the subpoena.\n       Microsoft acted in bad faith, the department's motion \n     defending the subpoena states, by abruptly terminating ``an \n     established negotiating process.'' Microsoft and a Justice \n     Department lawyer had been negotiating Thursday to narrow the \n     scope of the subpoena, and talks hadn't broken off. The \n     motion asserts that Microsoft's petition concerns a matter \n     that should be worked out between the parties. Microsoft's \n     petition is a ``tempest in a teapot,'' the department says.\n       If the Justice Department were to file suit to force \n     Microsoft to remove software for tapping into its new on-line \n     service from Windows 95, Microsoft may have trouble meeting \n     its Aug. 24 deadline to release the product.\n       Microsoft is taking an unusual step in filing a copy of the \n     latest Justice Department subpoena with its petition. Many \n     targets of antitrust probes attempt to keep such information \n     requests from becoming part of the public record, since the \n     documents sometimes contain confidential company data or give \n     unflattering hints about areas the agency is investigating. \n     In this case, Microsoft apparently hopes to use the sheer \n     breadth of the department's latest subpoena to bolster the \n     company's case that it is being treated unfairly.\n       Microsoft isn't the only company receiving subpoenas with \n     short turnaround times. The department also has issued such \n     subpoenas to competing on-line services, software suppliers \n     and companies that plan to supply content for the Microsoft \n     Network, also known as MSN.\n       One major focus of Wednesday's subpoena is the relationship \n     between the MSN and independent companies that will sell \n     goods or information over the new network. That suggests the \n     agency is examining whether the company is competing unfairly \n     with other on-line services in wooing ``content'' suppliers.\n       The subpoena asks for the ``full consideration'' paid by \n     Microsoft to each content\n      \n\n[[Page S9317]]\n     company, for example, and whether Microsoft has exclusive rights to \n     their content. Microsoft has said content companies get a \n     standard split of revenues for their services, and are not \n     required to sign exclusive contracts.\n       Another focus is on Microsoft software, dubbed Blackbird, \n     for developing new content offerings, and on whether \n     companies that use Blackbird can develop content for other \n     on-line services. The subpoena also asks for extensive data \n     on projected sales and expenses tied to MSN and other \n     Microsoft products, including Windows 95.\n       Last Week, the agency intensified its search for data that \n     might bolster a case that Microsoft's new network might \n     attain market dominance quickly.\n       One previously undisclosed source is Pipeline \n     Communications Inc. Among other things, the Atlanta company \n     works for on-line services, offering a speedy way for new PC \n     users to try out those services soon after they turn on their \n     machines for the first time. The Justice Department \n     approached Pipeline early last week.\n       According to Pipeline's data, about 60% of the people \n     offered these trial memberships subscribed, said Matt \n     Thompson, Pipeline's president. If that experience carried \n     over to the huge number of Windows 95 users, MSN could \n     quickly dwarf other on-line services, some industry \n     executives said. Dataquest Inc. expects Windows 95 to sell 30 \n     million copies in just its first six months on the market.\n       Microsoft's petition seems at least partly a bid to elicit \n     sympathy by portraying itself as the victim of intensive and \n     unfairly focused antitrust-division scrutiny since August \n     1993. That's when Ms. Bingaman, the division's head, reopened \n     a Federal Trade Commission investigation begun in 1990 and \n     closed after commissioners deadlocked on whether to bring a \n     case.\n       In large part, the petition catalogs Justice Department \n     requests for information. For example, when Microsoft sought \n     last fall to buy Intuit Inc., a maker of popular personal-\n     finance software, it gave the department 37 boxes of \n     documents in response to its first subpoena, the petition \n     said. A second department request produced 735 more boxes of \n     papers, plus a foot-high stack of answers to questions, after \n     the request was narrowed in negotiations, according to the \n     petition. The Justice Department sued to block the Intuit \n     acquisition, and Microsoft dropped the deal.\n       The subpoena being challenged is the second issued to \n     Microsoft in connection with the current investigation. \n     Another was issued June 5 and demanded a response by June 9, \n     but the department agreed to extend the deadline. Mr. Neukom \n     was in Washington to meet with Ms. Bingaman last week when he \n     learned the department wanted more data.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9315-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDWARD BANKS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on Tuesday evening Erik Weihenmayer and his \nclimbing partners reached the summit of Mount McKinley, 20,320 feet \ninto the Alaskan sky and the highest point in North America. Mount \nMcKinley is called ``Denali''--the Great One--by Native Alaskans.\n  Under the best of circumstances, Mount McKinley is one of the \ntoughest climbs in the world. Average daytime temperatures are a \nbonechilling 20 degrees below zero, dipping to 40 below at the summit. \nThe National Park Service reports that the success rate for reaching \nthe top is just 47 percent. Since 1913, 79 climbers have died on the \nmountain. Six died earlier this year.\n  Mount McKinley is the ultimate challenge for any serious climber. But \nit is a unique challenge for Erik Weihenmayer, who is blind. Erik was \nborn with limited vision, and lost all his sight by age 13.\n  Most of the time, Erik is a 26-year old fifth-grade teacher and \nwrestling coach in Phoenix, AZ. About 10 years ago he took up mountain \nclimbing. He uses two ski poles to locate the footprints of the hiker \nahead of him, and then steps in the same tracks. To maintain balance \nand direction, Erik hangs on to a taut rope tied to his partner. Other \nthan that, he carries the same gear and equipment as other team \nmembers.\n  As Erik has said, ``I may do things a little different, but I achieve \nthe same process * * * . There's very little my team has to do to \naccommodate me.''\n  Over the past 10 years, Erik had trekked the Inca Trail in the Andes \nof South America, the Rockies in Colorado, and other demanding spots \naround the world.\n  On June 9, under the sponsorship of the American Foundation for the \nBlind, Erik and four others set out to conquer the summit of Mount \nMcKinley. The other members of the AFB HIGHSIGHTS '95 team are Sam \nEpstein, of Tempe, AZ; Ryan Ludwig of Laramie, WY; and Jeff Evans and \nJamie Bloomquist of Boulder, CO.\n  The AFB HIGHSIGHTS '95 team prepared for this climb for 8 months, \nwith rigorous training. Since January, the team also climbed Humphrey's \nPeak near Flagstaff, AZ; Long's Peak in Colorado; and Mount Rainier in \nWashington State, all in blizzard-like conditions.\n  Mr. President, the American Foundation for the Blind deserves great \ncredit for making this climb possible. Founded in 1921, AFB is one of \nthe Nation's leading advocates for the blind.\n  AFB's motto is ``We help those who cannot see live like those who \ndo.'' Erik exemplifies this spirit. Early on, he decided that \n``Blindness would often be a nuisance, would always make my life more \nchallenging, but would never be a barrier in my path.''\n  Mr. President, the message of AFB HIGHSIGHTS '95 is universal, \nextending well beyond blindness. It inspires all of us to realize our \npotential rather than focusing on our limitations.\n  Coincidentally, Tuesday also marked the 115th anniversary of the \nbirth of Helen Keller. For 40 years, Helen Keller was AFB's Ambassador \nof Goodwill. At the age of 74, on an around the world flight, she said, \n``It is wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me \nand before me is God and I have no fears.'' I imagine that Erik and the \nAFB HIGHSIGHTS '95 team have been similarly inspired.\n  Mr. President, let us wish Erik Weihenmayer and his climbing partners \nGodspeed and a safe return.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9317-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9317-S9318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            CHANGE OF VOTES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The 70-to-29 vote for this bill in its \nrevised form demonstrated strong bipartisan commitment to repairing and \nchanging the country's securities litigation system.\n  Like any effort to change the status quo, especially through \nlegislation that must win a majority of support from diverse corners, \nthis final product cannot be called perfect. Compromises and tough \njudgment calls had to be made throughout the process of grappling with \na very complex set of issues posed by securities and the legal system. \nAfter much consultation and reflection, today I felt the vote for a \nmore rational, less costly, and improved system was a vote for this \nbill.\n  This bill's fundamental purpose is to reduce and deter frivolous and \nmeritless lawsuits in the securities area. The idea is by no means just \nto protect potential defendants. the need for legislation is based on \nthe costs and problems created by the current system for investors when \nthey cannot get helpful information on investment opportunities; for \nworking Americans when the legal costs of the current system saps jobs, \ncapital, and growth; and for participants like accountants who are at \nrisk of liability that's far beyond their fault. In other words, \nrepairing the system is designed to resolve problems that are hurting \nsmall and large investors, workers and our communities, and specific \npeople professionally involved in securities.\n  Thirty-one years ago I went to Emmons, WV, to be a VISTA worker \nbecause I wanted to make some small difference in the lives of other \npeople. I quickly learned that West Virginians are people who value \nhard work, and are ready to earn their fair share of what society has \nto offer.\n  But there were not enough jobs in Emmons, or in many other places in \nWest Virginia. After deciding to make public service my career and West \nVirginia my permanent home, I also made creating long-term, well-paying \njobs for West Virginians one of my main goals. Three decades later, it \nis still my focus. Almost everything I do for West Virginia must be \nweighed against that goal of creating the opportunity for West \nVirginians to earn a living, and, through work, to achieve the quality \nof life they seek.\n  And when West Virginians are able to earn a decent living, and are \nable perhaps to invest a few dollars for their futures through savings \nor investment, I want to make sure that they are treated fairly and are \nprotected.\n  It was for both of these reasons--protecting the small companies in \nWest Virginia that create quality jobs and protect wage-earner \ninvestors--that I have sponsored the current legislation regarding \nsecurities litigation. The bill I sponsored would go a long way toward \ncurtailing what I believe is an epidemic of frivolous securities fraud \nlawsuits that are brought by a small cadre of lawyers against often \nsmall and start-up companies, and against their lawyers and accountants \nwho may have little to do with the operation of the company.\n  The stated purpose of S. 240, as introduced last January, was to \nfacilitate the ability of companies to gather capital for investment, \nthe underlying theory being that frivolous lawsuits against \ncorporations make it very difficult to do so. While American securities \nmarkets have been very successful, the Banking Committee, after \nextensive hearings, reported that class action suits, as well as the \nfear of being sued in a class action by professional plaintiffs has the \ncapital formation markets in terror. From this flows the need to come \nto a better balance between protecting the rights of investors and the \nstandards of recovery. In my view, this is an appropriate goal.\n  When I was asked to cosponsor S. 240 in January, I carefully analyzed \nits provisions to make sure that it struck a fair balance, and I came \nto the conclusion that it did. Regarding frivolous lawsuits, the bill \ncontained many important provisions to assure that meritless lawsuits \ncan be dealt with in an expeditious and less costly way. And there were \nseveral important protections for investors as well, including a 1-year \nextension of the statute of limitations for securities suits, the \ncreation of a self-disciplinary auditor oversight board to assure \ntruthfulness of securities statements; and encouragement of alternative \ndispute resolution for both plaintiffs and defendants, rather than \nresorting to lengthy and costly litigation in the courts. \nUnfortunately, several of these investor protection provisions have \nbeen deleted from the bill.\n  The Banking Committee's action was not one-sided, however, and the \nbill contains a number of valuable provisions, and changes, to help \ndeter frivolous lawsuits. A review of these changes reveals that the \nCommittee did:\n  Lower the pleading requirements, somewhat, to a standard set by the \nleading Federal circuit.\n  Eliminate an onerous ``loser pays'' provision, but replaced it with a \nmandatory requirement that judges review pleadings in these cases under \nFederal Rule 11, which will most often mean that investor-plaintiffs, \nbut not defendants, may be punished. Judges already have this \nresponsibility under Rule 11, and it should be equally applied to \nplaintiffs and defendants--An amendment by Senator Bingaman has now \nmade this provision more balanced.\n  Eliminate an investor-plaintiff ``steering committee'' to manage the \nsecurities class action, but replaced it with a troublesome lead \nplaintiff provision which will likely result in large institutional \ninvestors--to the exclusion of small investors--controlling class \nactions--An amendment by the Senator Boxer, which would have corrected \nthis shortcoming was defeated during earlier consideration of the bill.\n  Eliminate a dollar threshold to be the named plaintiff.\n  Partially restore SEC enforcement against those who aid and abet the \ncommission of a fraud by another, but failed to restore a private right \nof action.\n  Other changes included in the committee bill include:\n  Expanding the protections of the legislation to include the 1933 \nSecurities Act.\n  Creating a legislative safe harbor for forward-looking economic \nstatements about a company, thus ending an ongoing rulemaking on this \nsubject by the SEC.\n  An extension of the proportional liability protections.\n  Providing that investors with the largest financial interest, will \ncontrol securities class action suits.\n  Eliminating the loser pays provision, as stated earlier, and \nreplacing it with a provision with a strong presumption of fee-shifting \nagainst investors only.\n  During the Senate's floor consideration of the legislation over the \npast week, a number of amendments were proposed by some of my \ncolleagues from the Banking Committee. I strongly supported a number of \nthese initiatives, and want to review\n each of them.\n\n\n                    statute of limitations amendment\n\n  In 1991, the Supreme Court decided in the Lampf versus Gilbertson \ncase to establish a uniform statute of limitations applicable to \nimplied private actions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \nBefore this decision, Federal courts had followed the statute of \nlimitations in the applicable State. \n\n[[Page S9319]]\nThe timeframe established was consistent with that for express causes \nof action for false statements, misrepresentation, and manipulation \nunder the 1934 Act: One year from the date of discovery of the \nviolation or discovery of the facts constituting the violation, or 3 \nyears from the date of the violation.\n  In 1991, an extension of this statute of limitations was proposed as \npart of the FDIC Improvement Act. Its supporters sought to change the \nstatute of limitations to 2 years after the plaintiff knew of the \nsecurities violation, but in no event more than 5 years after the \nviolation occurred. This provision was dropped because of the argument \nthat it should only be enacted as part of a bill with further reform of \nthe securities litigation system, as we are now doing.\n  The extension of the statute of limitations was part of both the \nDomenici/Dodd bill from the 103d Congress, and the original version of \nS. 240 this year that I cosponsored.\n  The original S. 240 also provided that a violation that should have \nbeen discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence would fall \nunder the 2-year category.\n  An amendment rejected by the Senate would have returned the statute \nof limitation provision to that which was in the original version of S. \n240. In the committee markup, the statute of limitation provision was \ntaken out, returning to a shorter 1-year/3-year provision.\n  A good number of our colleagues believed that this provision was \nharmful to business in that it would establish, at least de facto, a 5-\nyear statute of limitation; that 3 years is a reasonable cap because \nafter that, cases become stale and more difficult to defend; that a 1-\nyear minimum is enough time to get a suit ready; that there are other \nadequate remedies including State actions, blue sky laws, and \noccasionally awarding of disgorgement funds by the SEC; and that the \namendment would invite claim speculation--allowing investors to sit \nback and see if they turn a profit before suing.\n  There were persuasive arguments put forth by supporters, as well. For \nexample, the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] argued that:\n  The bill as reported has a statute of limitations that is shorter \nthan that in 31 states. Thirteen States also allow tolling of the \nstatute until fraud is discovered.\n  Under current law, it is too easy for a claim to be barred through no \nfault of the investor, especially because fraud is difficult to detect.\n  I supported the amendment because I did not believe that it would \nadversely impact capital formation, and thus job creation.\n\n\n                     aiding and abetting amendment\n\n  Prior to 1994, courts in every circuit supported the right of \ninvestors to sue those who aid and abet securities fraud. This right \narose from common law, but was not specifically provided for in Federal \nsecurities statutes. For primarily this reason, the Supreme Court--in \n1994--eliminated the right of investors to sue aiders and abettors of \nfraud.\n  The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] upon whose advice I depend \nheavily in this matter, as well as the SEC, the administration, and \neven the Supreme Court, has expressed the belief that the private right \nof action to pursue those who aid and abet should be replaced by \nstatute. At the Committee hearing, Senator Dodd said, ``This is conduct \nthat must be deterred, and Congress should enact legislation to restore \naiding and abetting liability in private actions.''\n  The SEC testified before the Banking Committee strongly in favor of \nrestoring this investor right because of its deterrent effect on \nfraudulent behavior. Otherwise, those who knowingly or recklessly \nassist in a fraud will be shielded.\n  However, the committee failed to restore the private right of action, \nbut did empower the SEC to bring aid and abet actions, although not \nauthorizing any additional resources for the SEC to undertake this \nadded responsibility.\n  In my opinion, protecting aiding and abetting has nothing to do with \ncapital formation, since it is not applicable to the primary investment \ncompany. I thus supported an amendment, offered by the Senator from \nNevada [Mr. Bryan] which sought to restore this important right of \ninvestors to seek redress only against those who knowingly or \nrecklessly provide substantial assistance to another who commits fraud.\n          Safe Harbor For Forward-Looking Statements Amendment\n\n  The term ``forward-looking statements'' is broadly defined in S. 240 \nto include financial projections on items such as revenues, income, and \ndividends, as well as statements of future economic performance \nrequired in documents filed with the SEC. As with any attempt to \nforesee the future, such statements always have an element of risk to \nthem, and prudent investors must be careful in relying on them.\n  Up until 1979, the SEC prohibited disclosure of such forward-looking \ninformation because it felt that this information was unreliable, and \nit feared that investors would place too much emphasis on these \nmaterials. After extensive review, the SEC adopted a safe harbor \nregulation for forward-looking statements in 1979. This regulation--\nknown as rule 175--offers protection for specified forward-looking \nstatements when made in documents filed with the SEC. The theory for \nthe safe harbor was to encourage voluntary disclosure by companies to \nthe SEC. To sustain a fraud suit, a plaintiff/investor needed to show \nthat the forward-looking information lacked a reasonable basis and was \nnot made in good faith.\n  The effectiveness of this regulation has been widely criticized, and \nas recently as May 19, 1995, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt acknowledged \n``a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently exists.'' In fact, \nthe SEC is currently conducting a rulemaking on its safe harbor \nregulation.\n  The original S. 240 bill required the SEC to consider adopting rules \nor making recommendations for expanding the safe harbor. This idea was \nstrongly endorsed by SEC Chairman Levitt, among others.\n  However, the Banking Committee abandoned this approach in favor of \nenacting a statutory safe harbor provision. Many have argued that the \nSEC is in the best position. Many have argued that the SEC is in the \nbest position to tailor rules for this issue. The SEC will be able to \nclosely monitor the effects of any new policy and quickly modify it if \nneed be. The SEC also has the advantage of having already examined this \nproblem in great detail.\n  More important, however, is the way the committee did this. Under the \ncommittee version of S. 240, a forward-looking statement can only be \nthe basis for fraud finding if the investor-plaintiff can prove that \nthe statement is knowingly made with the expectation, purpose, and \nactual intent of misleading investors. Expectation, purpose, and actual \nintent are to be treated as separate elements, each of which must be \nproven independently. This is an\n extremely difficult standard to meet--an amendment adopted by voice \nvote removed the ``expectation'' requirement.\n\n  Any safe harbor provision, whether statutory or by regulation, places \na greater burden on the investor to uncover fraudulent \nmisrepresentations. However, in order to encourage companies to file \ninformation with the SEC, most believe it is important to have some \nsafe harbor provision. Because I believed that the committee's changes \nto S. 240 might make it more difficult for investors to prove that \nforward-looking statements should be liable for fraud--and thus that \nthe SEC promulgated rule currently is a much better standard and that \nthe Congress should leave this to the SEC--I supported the amendment to \nreturn this provision to the original S. 240 version.\n  That amendment failed, and the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, \nproposed an amendment to modify the standard for recovery for \nfraudulent forward looking statements to require a showing that it was \nmade with actual knowledge it was false or actual intent of misleading. \nThis was what I believed was a reasonable middle-ground standard \nbetween what all agreed to be an ineffective current rule on safe \nharbor--reasonable basis/good faith--and the stringent actual intent \nstandard inserted in the bill by the committee. Unfortunately, this \namendment was tabled.\n\n\n                    proportional liability amendment\n\n  Under current law, each defendant who conspires to commit a \nsecurities violation is joint and severally liable, and thus can be \nheld accountable for \n\n[[Page S9320]]\n100 percent of damages found by a court. Most agree that this unfairly \ntreats defendants who have only a small percentage of responsibility.\n  As originally introduced, S. 240 provided for joint and several \nliability to be maintained only for primary wrongdoers, knowing \nviolators, and those controlling knowing violators.\n  As the bill reported by the committee, only knowing violators are \nheld joint and severally liable. Knowing securities fraud is defined in \nthe bill to exclude reckless violators, whose liability would be \nreduced to proportional liability. Additionally, if the judgment is \nuncollectible, proportionally liable defendants can be held to pay an \nadditional 50 percent of their share, and can be made to pay the \nuncollectible share to investors with net worth less than $200,000 and \nwho have lost more 10 percent of their net worth. Under the 50 percent \nprovision, a defendant could be liable for up to 150 percent of their \nproportional share.\n  The bill's proportionality provision is an improvement over current \nlaw, but may not fully protect investors when a judgment is \nuncollectible from a primary defendant. An exception was carved out so \nthat those who have invested more than 10 percent of their net worth \nmight still recover at least some portion of the damages even from the \nnon-primary defendant.\n  An amendment proposed by Senators Bryan and Shelby would have allowed \nfor full reallocation of uncollectible shares among culpable \ndefendants, while maintaining a system of proportionality as contained \nin the committee bill, to protect minimally responsible defendants, who \nare usually the accountants and attorneys, but at the same time would \nhave been, I believe, fairer to victims of investment fraud.\n  I supported this important amendment because I believed that it was a \nvast improvement over the current system of joint and several \nliability, but also as a stronger protection for investors.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I am disappointed that the managers \nsupporting S. 240 rejected the amendments offered that I voted for. \nPerhaps some further enlightenment and discussion will inspire the \nconferees to incorporate some of them to ensure the balance that I \nthink the legal system also calls for.\n  Because the current system and its problems should not be left alone, \nI still came to the conclusion that a vote for the bill was in the \ninterests of the people I represent and the country. Most of us may not \nbe aware of the way the securities litigation system ultimately affects \njobs, economic growth, and opportunity. The proponents of this bill \nhave reminded us of these very real-life and serious effects. Today, I \nfelt it was time to support action to revise and change the system so \nthat it's more about common sense than a proliferation of lawyers and \nlegal costs.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9318-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9320-S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, now that the Senate has completed action on \nS. 240, the Securities Litigation Reform Act, I wanted to take a few \nmoments to focus on many of the salient provisions of this legislation \nthat were not fully discussed during our 5 days of debate on 17 \ndifferent amendments.\n  Of course, I am extremely pleased that the legislation received an \noverwhelming vote of support from my colleagues this morning, passing \nby a margin of 70 to 29.\n  This vote is yet another confirmation of the very strong bipartisan \nsupport that the bill has received in the Senate and it also reflects \nthe broad coalition of investor groups and businesses that have \nsupported these reform efforts for the past 4 years.\n  This is certainly an important day for American investors and the \nAmerican economy. Passage of S. 240 puts us well on the road to \nrestoring fairness and integrity to our securities litigation system.\n  To some, this may sound like a dry and technical subject, but in \nreality, it is crucial to our investors, our economy and our \ninternational competitiveness. We are all counting on our high-\ntechnology and bio-technology firms to fuel our economy into the 21st \ncentury. We are counting on them to create jobs and to lead the charge \nfor us in the global marketplace.\n  But those are the same firms that are most hamstrung by a securities \nlitigation system that works for no one--save plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  Over the past 1\\1/2\\ years, the intense scrutiny on the securities \nlitigation system has dramatically changed the terms of debate, as we \nhave seen on the floor for the past 5 days.\n  We are no longer arguing about whether the current system needs to be \nrepaired; we are now focused on how best to repair it.\n  Even those who once maintained that the litigation system needed no \nreform are now conceding that substantive and meaningful changes are \nrequired if we are to maintain the fundamental integrity of private \nsecurities litigation.\n  The flaws in the current system are simply too obvious to deny. The \nrecord is replete with examples of how the system is being abused and \nmisused.\n  While there has been much discussion of the position of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, it is important to note that the \nChairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, agrees with the fundamental notion \nthat we must enact some meaningful reform:\n\n       There is no denying that there are real problems in the \n     current system--problems that need to be addressed not just \n     because of abstract rights and responsibilities, but because \n     investors and markets are being hurt by litigation excesses.\n\n  The legislation under consideration today is based upon the bill that \nSenator Domenici and I have introduced for the last two Congresses.\n  There are some provisions from the original version of S. 240 that I \nwould have liked to see included in this bill, such as an extension of \nthe statute of limitations on private actions.\n  In fact, I strongly supported an amendment offered by my good friend, \nSenator Bryan, that would have extended the statute of limitations from \n1 year after the fraud is discovered to 2 years and from 3 years after \nthe actual perpetration of the fraud to 5 years.\n  It is also important to note that the statute of limitations was \ndecreased by the Supreme Court in last year's Central Bank decision, \nand not by any part of S. 240.\n  But I certainly understand why this provision was taken out of the \ncommittee's product. It is excruciatingly difficult to produce a \nbalanced piece of legislation, especially in such a complex and \ncontentious area.\n  But that is exactly what the Senate passed today, a bill that \ncarefully and considerately balances the needs of our high-growth \nindustries with the rights of investors, large and small. I am proud of \nthe spirit of fairness and equity that permeates the legislation.\n  I am also proud of the fact that this legislation tackles a \ncomplicated and difficult issue in a thoughtful way that avoids excess \nand achieves a meaningful equilibrium under which all of the interested \nparties can survive and thrive.\n  As I stated earlier, this is a broadly bipartisan effort. This bill \npassed the Banking Committee with strong support from both sides of the \naisle, and the 70 Senators from both parties who voted in favor of the \nbill this morning, represent all points on the so-called ideological \nspectrum.\n  I believe that this morning's strong show of support displays the \ndesire of the Senate to stand in favor of the balanced approach of S. \n240. In my view this vote also demonstrates the Senate's disagreement \nwith the more extreme securities reform bill (H.R. 1058) that passed \nthe other body in March.\n  Those of us who have supported this legislation must be very mindful \nof the close vote that occurred on the second Sarbanes amendment to \nfurther limit the safe harbor provisions of the bill.\n  I, for one, am committed to ensuring that as we move to a conference \nwith the other body, we retain a safe harbor provision that is truly \nmeaningful but that gives no aid and comfort to those who would try to \ndefraud investors.\n  And I would like to use this opportunity to reinforce the statement \nthat I made earlier today: I will urge my colleagues to reject any \nconference report that includes safe harbor provisions --or any other \nprovision for that matter--that are so broadly expanded that they \nbreach the rights of legitimately aggrieved investors.\n  Mr. President, H.L. Mencken once said that every problem has a \nsolution that is neat, simple, and wrong. Believe me, if there were a \nsimple solution to the problems besetting securities litigation today, \nwe would have been able \n\n[[Page S9321]]\nto pass a bill after 5 minutes, rather than 5 days, of floor debate.\n  But these problems are so pervasive and complex that we have moved \nfar beyond the point where the public interest is served by waiting for \nthe courts or other bodies to fix them for us.\n  The private securities litigation system is too important to the \nintegrity and vitality of American capital markets to continue to allow \nit to be undermined by those who seek to line their own pockets with \nabusive and meritless suits.\n  Let me be clear: Private securities litigation is an indispensable \ntool with which defrauded investors can recover their losses without \nhaving to rely upon Government action.\n  I cannot possibly overstate just how critical securities lawsuits \nbrought by private individuals are to ensuring public and global \nconfidence in our capital markets. These private actions help deter \nwrongdoing and help guarantee that corporate officers, auditors, \ndirectors, lawyers, and others properly perform their jobs. That is the \nhigh standard to which this legislation seeks to return the securities \nlitigation system.\n  But as I said at the beginning of floor debate, the current system \nhas drifted so far from that noble role that we see more buccaneering \nbarristers taking advantage of the system than we do corporate \nwrongdoers being exposed by it.\n  But there is more at risk if we fail to reform this flawed system. \nQuite simply, the way the private litigation system works today is \ncosting millions of investors--the vast majority of whom do not \nparticipate in these lawsuits--their hard-earned cash.\n  Mary Ellen Anderson, representing the Connecticut Retirement & Trust \nFunds and the Council of Institutional Investors, testified that the \nparticipants in the pension funds,\n\n       . . . are the ones who are hurt if a system allows someone \n     to force us to spend huge sums of money in legal costs . . . \n     when that plaintiff is disappointed in his or her investment. \n     Our pensions and jobs depend on our employment by and \n     investment in our companies. If we saddle our companies with \n     big and unproductive costs . . . we cannot be surprised if \n     our jobs and raises begin to disappear and our pensions come \n     up short as our population ages.\n\n  There lies the risk of allowing the current securities litigation \nsystem to continue to run out of control. Ultimately, it is the average \ninvestor, the retired pensioner who will pay the enormous costs clearly \nassociated with this growing problem.\n  Much of the problem lies in the fact that private litigation has \nevolved over the years as a result of court decisions rather than \nexplicit Congressional action.\n  Private actions under rule 10(b) were never expressly set out by \nCongress, but have been construed and refined by courts, with the tacit \nconsent of Congress. But the lack of Congressional involvement in \nshaping private litigation has created conflicting legal standards and \nhas provided too many opportunities for abuse of investors and \ncompanies.\n  First, it has become increasingly clear that securities class actions \nare extremely vulnerable to abuses by entrepreneurs masquerading as \nlawyers. As two noted legal scholars recently wrote in the Yale Law \nReview:\n\n       . . . The potential for opportunism in class actions is so \n     pervasive and evidence that plaintiffs' attorneys sometimes \n     act opportunistically so substantial that it seems clear that \n     plaintiffs' attorneys often do not act as investors' \n     ``faithful champions.''\n\n  It is readily apparent to many observers in business, academia--and \neven Government--that plaintiffs' attorneys appear to control the \nsettlement of the case with little or no influence from either the \nnamed plaintiffs or the larger class of investors.\n  For example, during the extensive hearings on the issue before the \nSubcommittee on Securities, a lawyer cited one case as a supposed \nshowpiece of how well the existing system works. This particular case \nwas settled before trial for $33 million.\n  The lawyers asked the court for more than $20 million of that amount \nin fees and costs. The court then awarded the plaintiffs' lawyers $11 \nmillion and the defense lawyers for the company $3 million. Investors \nrecovered only 6.5 percent of their recoverable damages. That is 6\\1/2\\ \ncents on the dollar.\n  This kind of settlement sounds good for entrepreneurial attorneys, \nbut it does little to benefit companies, investors or even the \nplaintiffs on whose behalf the suit was brought.\n  A second area of abuse is frivolous litigation. Companies, \nparticularly in the high-technology and bio-technology industries, face \ngroundless securities litigation days or even hours after adverse \nearnings announcements.\n  In fact, the chilling consequence of these lawsuits is that \ncompanies--especially new companies in emerging industries--frequently \nrelease only the minimum information required by law so that they will \nnot be held liable for any innocent, forward-looking statement that \nthey may make.\n  Last week, I related to my colleagues the case of Raytheon Co., one \nof the Nation's largest high-tech, firms. This example warrants \nrecapitulation here. Raytheon made a tender offer of $64 a share for E-\nSystems, Inc., a 41 percent premium over the closing market price. Let \nme allow Raytheon to explain what happened next:\n\n       Notwithstanding the widely held view that the proposed \n     transaction was eminently fair to E-Systems shareholders, the \n     first of eight purported class action suits was filed less \n     than 90 minutes after the courthouse doors opened on the day \n     that the transaction was announced. [Raytheon letter to \n     Senator Dodd; June 19, 1995.]\n\n  No one lawyer could possibly have investigated the facts this \nquickly. What the lawyers want here is to force a quick settlement.\n  The Supreme Court in Blue Chip Stamps versus Manor Drug Store echoed \nthis concern about abusive litigation, pointing out:\n\n       [i]n the field of federal securities laws governing \n     disclosure of information, even a complaint which by \n     objective standards may have very little success at trial has \n     a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to \n     its prospect of success at trial . . . The very pendency of \n     the lawsuit may frustrate or delay normal business activity \n     of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.\n\n  The third area of abuse is that the current framework for assessing \nliability is simply unfair and creates a powerful incentive to sue \nthose with the deepest pockets, regardless of their relative complicity \nin the alleged fraud.\n  The result of the existing system of joint and severable liability is \nthat plaintiffs' attorneys seek out any possible corporation or \nindividual that has little relation to the alleged fraud--but which may \nhave extensive insurance coverage or otherwise may have financial \nreserves. Although these defendants could frequently win their case \nwere it to go trial, the expense of protracted litigation and the \nthreat of being forced to pay all the damages make it more economically \nefficient for them to settle with the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  The current Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, as well as two former \nChairmen, Richard Breeden and David Ruder, have all spoken out against \nthe abuses of joint and several liability. Chairman Levitt said at the \nApril 6 hearing of the Securities Subcommittee that he was concerned, \nin particular, ``about accountants being unfairly charged for amounts \nthat go far beyond their involvement in particular fraud.''\n  Frequently, these settlements do not appreciably increase the amount \nof losses recovered by the actual plaintiffs, but instead add to the \nfees collected by the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  Again, the current system has devolved to a point where it favors \nthose lawyers who are looking out for their own financial interest over \nthe interest of virtually everybody else.\n  At the beginning of debate on this bill, I spent a fair amount of \ntime discussing, in some detail, the various provisions of the \nlegislation. I would like to again return our focus to how the \nlegislation that the Senate passed earlier today deals with the \nexisting problems in the securities litigation system:\n  First, the legislation empowers investors so that they, not their \nlawyers, have greater control over their class action cases by allowing \nthe plaintiff with the largest claim to be the named plaintiff and \nallowing that plaintiff to select their counsel.\n  Second, it gives investors better tools to recover losses and \nenhances existing provisions designed to deter fraud, including \nproviding a meaningful safe harbor for legitimate forward-looking \nstatements so that issuers are encouraged, instead of discouraged, \n\n[[Page S9322]]\nfrom volunteering much-needed disclosures.\n  Third, it limits opportunities for frivolous or abusive lawsuits and \nmakes it easier to impose sanctions on those lawyers who violate their \nbasic professional ethics.\n  Fourth, it rationalizes the liability of deep-pocket defendants, \nwhile protecting the ability of small investors to fully collect all \ndamages awarded them through a trial or settlement.\n  I would like to go into each of these provisions in more detail.\n  The legislation ensures that investors, not a few enterprising \nattorneys, decide whether to bring a case, whether to settle, and how \nmuch the lawyers should receive.\n  The bill strongly encourages the courts to appoint the investor with \nthe greatest losses--usually an institutional investor like a pension \nfund--to be the lead plaintiff. This plaintiff would have the right to \nselect the lawyer to pursue the case on behalf of the class.\n  So for the first time in a long time, plaintiffs' lawyers would have \nto answer to a real client. We are bringing an end to the days when a \nplaintiffs attorney can crow to Forbes magazine that ``I have the \ngreatest practice of law in the world. I have no clients.''\n  The bill requires that notice of settlement agreements that are sent \nto investors clearly spell out important facts such as how much \ninvestors are getting--or giving up--by settling and how much their \nlawyers will receive in the settlement. This means that plaintiffs \nwould be able to make an informed decision about whether the settlement \nis in their best interest--or in their lawyers' best interest.\n  And the bill would end the practice of the actual plaintiffs \nreceiving, on average, only 6 to 14 cents for every dollar lost, while \n33 cents of every settlement dollar goes to the plaintiffs' attorneys. \nThis bill would require that the courts cap the award of lawyers fees \nbased upon how much is recovered by the investors. Simply putting in a \nbig bill will not guarantee the lawyers multimillion-dollar fees if \ntheir clients are not the primary beneficiaries of the settlement.\n  Taken together, these provisions should ensure that defrauded \ninvestors are not cheated a second time by a few unscrupulous lawyers \nwho siphon huge fees right off the top of any settlement.\n  The bill mandates, for the first time in statute, that auditors \ndetect and report fraud to the SEC, thus enhancing the reliability of \nindependent audits. The bill maintains current standards of joint and \nseveral liability for those persons who knowingly engage in a \nfraudulent scheme, thus keeping a heavy financial penalty for those who \nwould commit knowing securities fraud.\n  The bill restores the ability of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to pursue those who aid and abet securities fraud, a power \nthat was diminished by the Supreme Court in last year's Central Bank \ndecision.\n  With regard to frivolous litigation, the bill clarifies current \nrequirements that lawyers should have some facts to back up their \nassertion of securities fraud by adopting the reasonable standards \nestablished by the second circuit court of appeals. This legislation is \ntherefore using a pleading standard that has been successfully tested \nin the real world; this is not some arbitrary standard pulled out of a \nhat.\n  The bill requires the courts, at settlement, to determine whether any \nattorney violated rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nwhich prohibits lawyers from filing claims that they know to be \nfrivolous. If a violation has occurred, the bill mandates that the \ncourt must levy sanctions against the offending attorney. Though the \nbill does not change existing standards of conduct, it does put some \nteeth into the enforcement of these standards.\n  The bill provides a moderate and thoughtful statutory safe harbor for \npredicative statements made by companies that are registered with the \nSEC. It provides no such safety for third parties like brokers, or in \nthe case of merger offers, tenders, roll-ups, or the issuance of penny \nstocks. There are a number of other exceptions to the safe harbor as \nwell. Importantly, anyone who deliberately makes false or misleading \nstatements in a forecast is not protected by the safe harbor.\n  By adopting this provision, the Senate will encourage responsible \ncorporations to make the kind of disclosures about projected activities \nthat are currently missing in today's investment climate.\n  While almost everyone, including SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, \nrecognizes the need to create a stronger safe harbor for forward-\nlooking statements, this is clearly one of the most controversial parts \nof the bill.\n  I recognize the desire of my colleagues who have opposed this \nprovision to clearly and firmly protect investors from fraudulent \nstatements by corporate executives, and I am committed to maintaining \nthe most balanced possible language on safe harbor as we enter into \nconference with the other body.\n  I would point out that the legislation preserves the rights of \ninvestors whose losses are 10 percent or more of their total net worth \nof $200,000. These small investors would still be able to hold all \ndefendants responsible for paying off settlements, regardless of the \nrelative guilt of each of the named parties.\n  And while the bill would fully protect small investors--so that they \nwould recover all of the losses to which they are entitled--the bill \nestablishes a proportional liability system to discourage the naming of \ndeep-pocket defendants.\n  The court would be required to determine the relative liability of \nall the defendants, and thus deep-pocket defendants would only be \nliable to pay a settlement amount equal to their relative role in the \nalleged fraud. A defendant who was only 10 percent responsible for the \nfraudulent actions would only be required to pay 10 percent of the \nsettlement amount. In some circumstances, the bill requires solvent \ndefendants to pay 150 percent of their share of the damages, to help \nmake up for any uncollectible amount. By creating a two-tiered system \nof both proportional liability and joint-and-several liability, the \nbill preserves the best features of both systems.\n  Mr. President, the legislation passed by the Senate today will keep \nthe door to the courthouse wide open for those investors who \nlegitimately believe that they are the victims of fraud, while slamming \nthe door shut to those few entrepreneurial attorneys who file suit \nsimply with the intent of enriching themselves through coercing \nsettlements from as many defendants as possible.\n  It has become clear that today's securities litigation system has \nbecome a system in which merits and facts matter little, in which \nplaintiffs recover less than their attorneys, and in which defendants \nare named solely on the basis of the amount of their insurance coverage \nor the size of their wallet; in short, we have a system in which there \nis increasingly little integrity and confidence. Mr. President, such a \nsystem of litigation is rendered incapable of producing the confidence \nand integrity in our Nation's capital markets for which it was \noriginally designed.\n  I am extremely pleased that this morning the Senate took the \nimportant step of repairing this ailing system by overwhelmingly \npassing the Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9320-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9322-S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to bring to your attention that June \nis National Dairy Month.\n  Earlier this month I was in Vermont during the Enosburg Falls Dairy \nFestival in Franklin County, VT, home of some of the finest dairy farms \nand dairy products in America.\n  June 1, 1995, was Dairy Day in Montpelier, the State capital. There \nwas a grand celebration with cows on the State house lawn and a milking \ncontest. It was the first chance for Vermont's new agriculture \ncommissioner, Leon Graves, a dairy farmer himself, to show his \nexpertise. And while the celebration is light hearted and fun, there is \na serious side to it.\n  In Vermont we stop and take the time to celebrate the importance of \ndairy farmers in our State and the importance of milk in our lives. In \nVermont we pay tribute to the men and women of America who get up so \nearly in the morning to milk the cows and bring us the safest, most \nwholesome supply of milk in all the world. I think \n\n[[Page S9323]]\nwe should pay tribute here in Washington, too.\n  We should also remember how important dairy products are to American \nculture and to the diet of Americans.\n  Little League games just would not be the same without the promise of \na trip to the drive-in for a cone after the game. The Indy 500 winner \nstill drinks milk in victory lane and cookouts would not be the same \nwithout a sizzling burger topped by a slice of cheddar.\n  More important than the enjoyment we get from dairy products, is the \nnutrition we get from dairy products. There are some who try to hurt \nthe image of milk and others who distort the truth about the \nnutritional value of milk, but the facts cannot be denied.\n  Milk is a nutrient dense food that is an important part of the \nAmerican diet. Milk and dairy foods supply 75 percent of the calcium in \nthe U.S. food supply as well as substantial amounts of riboflavin, \nprotein, potassium, vitamin B 12, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins A and B \n6. Some might argue that calcium can be gained through fortified foods \nor taking calcium supplements. While these alternatives can supply \ncalcium, research has shown that people who have low calcium intakes \nalso have low intakes of several other nutrients which can be supplied \nby dairy foods. A recent report from the National Institutes of Health \nrecommends that ``the preferred source of calcium is through calcium \nrich foods such as dairy products.''\n  Adequate calcium intake is especially critical for young women. \nBuilding optimal bone mass before age 30 is one of the best ways to \nprevent osteoporosis later in life. Increasingly, we see young women \nfailing to get the calcium they need. In addition, nutrients from dairy \nproducts are keys to preventing high blood pressure, which increases \nthe risk of heart disease, stroke, and renal failure.\n  Many Americans are becoming more conscious about their diets. It is \nimportant that people not eliminate nutritious foods such as dairy \nfoods from their diets as they attempt to reduce fat intake. A wide \narray of dairy foods come in low fat and nonfat versions, while \ndelivering the same amount of nutrients. Research has shown that people \ncan increase dairy food consumption to recommended levels without \ngaining weight or increasing blood cholesterol.\n  I will not talk about policy or politics today except to add we need \nto keep the importance of dairy products in mind as we consider changes \nto our nutrition programs. And we need to remember the hard working men \nand women who bring us nature's most perfect food as we craft our dairy \npolicy this year during the farm bill.\n  I do not often rise to talk about commemorative days, weeks, or \nmonths. But I hope my colleagues will join with me in raising the \nawareness of Americans about good nutrition and expressing our \nappreciation to America's dairy farmers for their hard work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/28/senate-section/article/S9322-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
