Mr. President, since the American people put the \nRepublicans in control of Congress, I think there has been a \nconsensus--Democrats, Independents, Republicans--that we should balance \nthe budget. We have succeeded now in making a balanced budget, which is \nsupported by 80-some percent of the American people, a national \npriority. Perhaps no policy is more important than the personal \neconomic future of Americans, the future of our children and the future \nof our Nation.\n  Last year, under Republican leadership, Congress did pass a budget \nthat would be in balance by the year 2002. President Clinton vetoed \nthat budget and denied America the brighter future that would have \nresulted in higher standards of living, more real economic growth, \nlower interest rates, reducing what Americans will pay for home \nmortgages, car loans, and student loans, and an increase in the savings \nrates, higher productivity, and relief from the crushing burden of \ndebt.\n  But notwithstanding that, the President and his allies in and out of \nCongress who talk about a balanced budget say we ought to have a \nbalanced budget. They may have a different way to arrive at one. So I \nthink there is a fairly strong consensus at least that we should \nbalance the budget. We just have not been able to come together on how \nwe do that. We have tried private negotiations at the White House with \nmyself and the Speaker and the majority leader in the House. They went \non\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\nday after day, week after week, 55 hours of face-to-face meetings. We \ncould not come together.\n  So my view is that since almost everyone agrees we should balance the \nbudget at least by the year 2002, we should take the next logical step \nand do what it takes to make certain that we fulfill our commitment to \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Last year, we had a month-long debate. We talked about all the pros \nand cons of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The final \nvote was 65-35. It was actually 66-34. Then I changed my vote to ``no'' \nso that I could use the parliamentary procedure to have a \nreconsideration of this vote, and I said sometime this year.\n  All we were doing, if you recall, was sending this to the States \nwhere three-fourths of the States would have to ratify the amendment \nbefore it became part of the Constitution. So we were, in effect, \nleaving it to up to the people or leaving it up to the legislative body \ncloser to the people whether or not this particular balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution should be ratified and be made a part of \nthe Constitution.\n\n  I have made a number of statements both in the Chamber and in public \nthat we would take up the balanced budget amendment again, and since my \ndeparture is imminent, I want to keep my word and keep my commitment, \nalthough I have no illusions about the outcome. So during the week of \nJune 3, it is my intention to fulfill the commitment I made to hold \nanother vote on the balanced budget amendment.\n  As I said, I am not under any illusions, but I think there is a great \ndeal at stake. I think we have an obligation to future generations of \nAmericans to make the effort. Only one man stands between the balanced \nbudget amendment and the American people, and that is President \nClinton. I hope President Clinton will change his position on the \nbalanced budget amendment. I believe the upcoming vote will give \nPresident Clinton the opportunity to demonstrate the kind of leadership \nthe American people want, but I am certain it will succeed only if the \nPresident lends his support, his unqualified support to the effort. \nOnly the President can help encourage Democrats who voted for it in the \npast and then voted against it last year to give us the necessary 67 \nvotes to send this to the States for ratification.\n  Again, let me make it clear. We are not making the final judgment \nwhen we send an amendment to the States for ratification. It takes \nthree-fourths of the States. It would not be easy, but my view is we \ncan send it back to the people, back to the people's representatives, \ncloser to the people, and this also, of course, will give my colleagues \nwho have supported the amendment in the past but voted against it last \nyear another opportunity to come home again, an opportunity to do the \nmost important thing we can be asked to do, and that is to make a \npositive difference.\n  So I hope that President Clinton could repair the damage. I know he \nurged and probably persuaded at least six of our colleagues to vote \n``no.'' It is not very often we get a second chance to do the right \nthing, but we are going to offer that chance to the President and to \nothers. I assume the vote will be the same, or maybe even one or two \nless, but this is a bipartisan effort.\n  I want to underscore that. One of the leaders in this effort has been \nSenator Paul Simon from the State of Illinois, who is retiring from the \nSenate at the end of this year. He has been working day after day, \nmonth after month, year after year for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. He did not dream it up last year or the year before. \nAs long as I have known Paul Simon, he has been supporting a balanced \nbudget amendment, and so has the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and \nthey have worked closely together.\n  At one time, we thought we had as many as 72 votes, but when the vote \nwas taken, it was only 66. So my view is it is bipartisan. It comes \ndown to one simple question: Do we trust the American people? Do we \ntrust the State legislatures? I think if we do, then we will send this \namendment to the States and let them take a look at it. The Founding \nFathers did not give Congress the power. They reserved that power to \nthe States and the people. For most of us who say we are for a balanced \nbudget, this is an opportunity to give our States, whether it is Kansas \nor some other State, members of my legislature, an opportunity to say, \nwell, it is good; it is bad; it should not be done.\n  So, I will let my colleagues know, and I will advise the Democratic \nleader on the precise time. But it will be sometime, probably, I would \nguess, along about June 4. But I will let my Democratic friend, the \nleader of the Democratic Senate, Senator Daschle, know a precise time. \nAs I understand, there is no debate. So any debate will happen before. \nThere will not be any agreement on any debate, but bring it up, vote, \nand then move on to something else.\n  Let me also say that I was prepared last night--because the President \nmade a statement in Wisconsin to send him the welfare bill and he would \nsign it--and I may later today ask unanimous consent to bring up the \nwelfare bill and pass it, send it to the House. This is apparently a \nbill the President wants. I do not assume there would be any objection \non the other side. But, if the President is serious, we are serious. We \nwill get serious in a hurry.\n  I will ask consent, we will send it to the House, and the House, of \ncourse, with the Rules Committee, they do not have to wait 4, 5, 6, 10, \n12 days on an issue like this, they can do it in 3 or 4 hours.\n  So, if the President is serious about this, if he will just notify my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle not to object, we may pass a \nwelfare bill here very quickly.\n  I have also been asked, and I have not discussed it with the majority \nleader--the majority whip, Senator Lott, about when we would bring the \nminimum wage vote to the floor. I do not have a problem with bringing \nit to the floor at any time. In fact, we offered my colleagues on the \nother side an agreement which, had they accepted, we would bring it up \nas soon as we came back from the Memorial Day recess, but it was \nrejected.\n  It still seems to me that we ought to be able to bring it up; \nwhenever they want to they bring up an amendment, we bring up what we \nwant to bring up as an amendment. We do that frequently around here. We \nhave two different views. I think there should be an increase in the \nminimum wage. I think we couple it with--we have talked about it some, \nabout a teenage provision, where you want teenagers to work, the so-\ncalled training wage. We might increase those who are not covered, by a \nsmall amount, for businesses that are small businesses.\n  I have talked about this to Senator Daschle. I think there are a \ncouple areas we may be able to agree on. There may be others who have \nother amendments we may not be able to agree to. But it seems to me, if \nwe are serious about it, we ought to bring it up and do it very \nquickly. We have had enough debate on the action. We would be prepared \nto take care of that also on the week of June 3.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the distinguished majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. When the majority leader says ``the minimum wage bill,'' \ndoes that mean the bill that was sent over to us from the House; that \nwould be a stand-alone offer?\n  Mr. DOLE. We have the right to amend.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand you have the right to amend it, but it will \nstand alone, it would not be included in the package as in the debate \nwe had here previously in the Senate?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be happy to work out something along that line with \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Rather than have four or five votes and then have a vote on \nthe whole package, including the coupling as the Senator said, that we \ncould have the stand-alone votes--I think we are very close to making \nsome kind of agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would want to consult, obviously, with my colleagues. But \nmy view is there will be a minimum wage increase. It will pass the \nCongress. It will have some amendments that maybe are not totally \npleasing to everybody in the Senate on either side of the aisle. In \nfact, maybe even the minimum wage is not totally pleasing to everybody \non either side of the aisle. But I think, given the strong bipartisan \nvote in the House, and I think there is support, bipartisan support, \nfor\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nan increase on this side, the question is what do you add to it to get \nit passed?\n  Mr. FORD. The only question I was concerned about is that originally \nwe had four or five individual votes and then that would have been \nincluded in a total package, with the coupling of maybe a poison pill \nor two there, that the President may not particularly like and said he \nwould have to veto that with that pill. If we get the House bill and \nthen that is a stand-alone, and we get the amendments and let the \nSenate work its will, I think we are getting very close to an agreement \non minimum wage. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to take it up with the leadership on my \nside and, hopefully, be able to go to the Democratic leader and the \nSenator from Kentucky with some proposal to be accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5635-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think our Democratic leader is on his \nway. I will certainly yield to him at the time he comes for any remarks \nhe would like to make. But I would like to just take some time in his \nabsence to comment on one of the comments made by the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, regarding welfare and welfare reform.\n  I think there is a growing consensus on behalf of both sides of the \naisle that a welfare reform bill is achievable. It is achievable in \nthis Congress this year. I think we are getting very, very close. The \nPresident of the United States has said some favorable things about the \nwelfare plan that has been proposed by the Republican Governor of \nWisconsin, Senator Thompson. I think the President made it very clear \non the previous bill, the so-called Dole-Gingrich welfare reform bill \nthat the President vetoed, that he vetoed it for a very specific \nreason. He vetoed it because it did not provide for adequate health \ncare for children and he vetoed it because it did not provide for \nadditional child care funding for children of welfare parents.\n  The President's stated position on welfare reform is that it should \nbe tough on work but also should be good for children. I think that is \nthe right approach. I do not think there is anyone in America who wants \nto be tough on welfare who wants to be tough and unfair to innocent \nchildren who did not ask to be born into this world.\n  Yes; be tough on the parents. Yes; put time limits on welfare. Yes; \ncut able-bodied parents off of welfare if they refuse to work. But let \nus make sure that this Nation, as great as it is, takes care of \ninnocent children who did not ask to be born.\n  So I think the President made it very clear he would support his \nunderstanding of what was in the Wisconsin plan if it, in fact, took \ncare of children by providing Medicaid or health care for those \nchildren and also additional child care funding. That is why he vetoed \nthe previous welfare bill that had been sent to him, because it simply \ndid not provide for those two major ingredients.\n  If the Wisconsin plan meets those standards, I think it is one that \ncan be signed. I think the comments of the President yesterday while he \nwas in Wisconsin really said exactly that, that he would support a \nwelfare reform even if it's a Republican plan, or a Democratic plan; it \ndoesn't make any difference who has authored it. But he also said, \n``So, what I say, if this is Senator Dole's plan''--meaning a plan that \nprovided for health care for children and for child care funding for \nchildren, that, if that is in the plan, ``I think what he ought to do \nis pass his plan through this Congress before he leaves the Senate and \nI will sign it.'' That was a statement that I agree with, that, if a \nplan is presented that provides medical care for innocent children and \nif it is a plan that provides for child care funding so the parents can \ngo to work, then it is a plan that, indeed, the President would want to \nsign.\n  So I think we are close. I commend the latest plan that I saw coming \nfrom our Republican colleagues for the closeness that it allows the two \nbodies to get together on an agreement. What I point out is that my \nreview of what they are trying to do with their plan is, I think, very \npositive, in the sense that it does some things in the direction of \nproviding more for child care, a very positive thing; it has tough new \nwork rules in the Republican proposal, and that is good; it has a \nlarger contingency fund for States in an economic downturn, and that is \ngood. So there are a number of really good things in the new Republican \nplan that moves it closer to what we as Democrats have been trying to \nget accomplished.\n  But there are, I think, some deficiencies. I think these deficiencies \nare not such that they cannot be corrected, but the deficiencies, I \nthink, are significant. For instance, they provide no vouchers for \nchildren after the parents have been cut off of welfare assistance.\n  What do you do, I would say to our colleagues, when you tell a parent \nyou are not going to get any more assistance after 2 or 3 years--what \nare you going to say to a 2-year-old child, a baby, an infant, or a \nchild that has no way to support itself and gets sick? Are we not going \nto have any help for innocent children? I think that is wrong.\n  Be as tough as we possibly can on parents and make them go to work \nand say, ``If you don't go to work, you are going to lose your \nbenefits,'' and say, ``There is a certain time limit that you have to \nget to work if you are capable of doing it.'' But, unfortunately, there \nare going to be some who do not meet those standards and unfortunately \nthey are going to be some children who are going to be innocent victims \nunless we find a way to take care of them. I suggest if we do not take \ncare of them in the short term we are going to be spending a great deal \nmore money in the long-term taking care of medical problems.\n  So I suggest that we ought to bring up the welfare bill as soon as we \ncan. Do not tie it down with other things that are still in dispute, \nlike Medicare or Medicaid or other controversial issues. Let us face \nit. If we can get an agreement on welfare, let us do it and let us quit \narguing about who will get the credit. There is enough credit for \neverybody. Everybody will win if we come to an agreement that makes \nsense. But everybody loses if we continue to fight it from a political \nstandpoint and not address it from a humanitarian standpoint. Let us be \ntough on reform, but help children.\n  I am encouraged we are getting closer on welfare reform. I will again \nsay the new proposal from the Republican side is a very positive step. \nThis allows us to sit and negotiate over just a couple of items and be \nable to say, ``Yes, we can produce a bipartisan welfare plan which will \nbe good for the country.''\n  I hope we can do it very quickly. I think it can be a product this \nPresident will sign very quickly. So what if you have a signing \nceremony and Senator Bob Dole comes down and President Bill Clinton \ncomes down and signs the same piece of legislation. Is that not good \nfor this country? Is that not why we are supposed to be here? I think \nthe answer is yes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, \nsince no one is apparently waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I see no colleagues on the floor today. We \ndo not have record votes. I expect there are very few Senators here. I \nknow we are in a period for morning business with a 5-minute \nlimitation. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak for 20 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the minority leader or others come and need to take \nsome time, I will be happy to accommodate them.\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\n\n\n              UNITED STATES TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor of the \nSenate today and talk a bit about trade. The Senate last evening passed \na budget, and there was a lot of discussion about deficits. Actually, \nwe had three budgets considered by the Senate, none of which balances \nthe budget in the year 2002, despite the fact it was alleged that all \nof them did. That is because the only way any of them--whether it was \nthe President's, the centrist's, or the GOP budget--portrayed a balance \nin 2002 was by using the Social Security trust funds.\n  We do have a fiscal policy deficit, and there is reason to talk about \nthat. But that deficit has been coming down and coming down rather \nsubstantially for a number of reasons. There is another deficit in the \ntwin deficits we face in this country that no one talks about. \nVirtually no one talks about the trade deficit. I do not quite \nunderstand why no one talks much about this, but it is every bit as \nserious a problem for this country as the fiscal policy deficit. It \nrelates to jobs and opportunity that are lost in this country. It \nrelates to jobs moving from our country to other countries.\n  So I want to spend a little time talking about the trade deficit. \nPreviously I did talk about it more generally. Today I want to talk \nabout one portion of it. That is the portion of the trade deficit that \nrelates to our trade with Japan. In future presentations I will talk \nabout trade with China, Mexico and Canada and other aspects of the \ntrade deficit as well. I want to talk today about the trade deficits we \nhave had generally in our country and specifically about the largest \ndeficit that we have, which is with the country of Japan.\n  This chart shows the merchandise trade deficit in our country, and it \nshows in 1995 it set a record of $175 billion. All of this is red ink. \nThis is what the chart shows, massive quantities of trade deficits year \nafter year. They are not accidental. They are the result of a trade \nstrategy that is not working and a trade strategy that bleeds economic \nopportunity away from our country.\n  As I begin, I want to say the Clinton administration has been better \nthan the previous two administrations in dealing with this issue, but \nit does not solve the problem. They are more aggressive with China and \nthey have been more aggressive with Japan, but the fact is our trade \nstrategy has not been working, under Republican or under Democratic \nadministrations.\n  Here is what our trade deficit looks like. Our merchandise trade \ndeficit hit $175 billion last year. The fact is, we need to take a look \nat our trade relationships. We need to develop long-term trade policies \nthat make sense for our entire economy--business, labor, agriculture \nand industry. We need to bring new and, in my judgment, innovative \napproaches to this problem to try to figure out how do we eliminate \nthese trade deficits.\n  The fact is, our Nation's trade deficit cannot be solved by a one-\nsize-fits-all solution in the global economy. If we are going to solve \nthis problem, we have to understand what causes these trade deficits. \nWe need to understand the bilateral relationships we have with the \nother countries that make up these deficits.\n  I want to talk specifically about the largest trade deficit we have \nin the context of these trade deficits. It is our trade relationship \nwith Japan.\n  Japan is our second-largest trading partner, but we have the single \nlargest merchandise trade deficit with them. This issue is not just \nabout theory. It is about baseball bats. It is about apples. It is \nabout rock-and-roll music. It is about automobiles. It is about VCR's. \nIt is about computer chips and about fair trade between us and Japan.\n  As the world's two economic powerhouses, the United States and Japan \ntrade with each other. We have a joint responsibility to bring about \nsome kind of economic balance between us. Trade and growth ought to be \ntwo-way streets. They are mutual, and they are reciprocal. Our trade \nrelationship with Japan has not been mutually advantageous.\n  No Nation can benefit from a trade strategy in which you have \nrecurring consecutive deficits year after year. Our trade balance looks \nlike this: 37 percent of the merchandise trade deficit in our country \ncomes from our relationship with Japan, nearly a $60 billion trade \ndeficit.\n  The bottom line is that we must change that circumstance. Our country \ncannot continue to have a trade relationship with Japan that has these \nkinds of deficits. The only other country that approaches that is our \ndeficit with China. We have a fairly large deficit with Canada and \nMexico combined: over $30 billion. This cannot continue.\n  The next chart shows the yearly trade deficits with the country of \nJapan. If you take a look at this sea of red ink in our trade \nrelationship with Japan, you can only conclude that our trade \nrelationship with Japan has not been mutually beneficial. 1995 was the \n31st consecutive year of trade deficits that we have had with the \ncountry of Japan. In fact, the last time we had a trade surplus with \nJapan was 1964.\n  This chart shows that last year was the third highest trade deficit \nwe had with the country of Japan. This will not go away by wishful \nthinking. Oh, some months there is a story in the paper that says it \nhas improved; some months there is a story saying it gets a little \nworse.\n  This chart shows exactly what our trade relationship with Japan is. \nIt is a one-way relationship that substantially benefits them and hurts \nus by draining jobs and opportunity and economic growth in our country.\n  Our country cannot continue to have this kind of a structural trade \ndeficit with Japan year after year after year. In the past 5 years \nalone, we have racked up a quarter of a trillion dollar trade deficit \nwith one country.\n  You can make a case on the fiscal policy of the budget that is money \nwe owe to ourselves. Really, that is only partially true. But, you \ncannot make that kind of case on the trade deficit. Any trade deficits \nwe have in the aggregate are going to be paid for by a lower standard \nof living in America.\n  The next chart shows the trade flow between us and the country of \nJapan. This past year our imports from Japan include automobiles, \nvehicles, machinery, electrical equipment, VCR's, television sets, \nmanufactured articles. $123 billion has been sent to America from Japan \nin the past year. That is right: $123 billion.\n  What are we sending back? We are sending grains, cereals, meats, \nfood, wood, mineral fuels, coal, some oil, and some aircraft. There was \n$64 billion of goods shipped from America to Japan. So we purchase $123 \nbillion from Japan, and they purchase $64 billion from us.\n  The important part of this relationship is that most of what we are \npurchasing from Japan represents manufactured goods, high-technology \ngoods, the kinds of things that relate to jobs. Much of what they \nconsume from us is not the product of manufacturing.\n  We appreciate very much the fact that they buy our grains, and I want \nthem to buy a lot more. They have an obligation to buy a lot more. I \nappreciate that they buy our steak, our beef, our pork. They ought to \nbuy more T-bone steaks and send it to Tokyo. The fact is, there is more \ndemand for beef in Japan than can be served by the quantity of beef \nthey now allow in.\n\n  But the fact is, we need some more balance in both the overall trade \nflow and also the kinds of goods that are moving between our countries. \nWe need to also be sending to Japan the product of our manufacturing \ngoods.\n  The next chart shows the market share that the United States has of \nselected industries in Japan. It is pretty interesting. It shows our \nmarket share in the world as a United States producer and then our \nmarket share in Japan. None of this is accidental.\n  Paper and paper board: We have a 14 percent world share; we have 2 \npercent of the Japanese market.\n  Aerospace: We are better than most, we have a 69 percent world share; \n44 percent in the Japanese market.\n  Automobiles and vehicles: We have a 16 percent share of the world \nmarket; a 1 percent share of the Japanese market. Is that an accident? \nWhile we are driving Hondas and Nissans and Toyotas, is it an accident \nthat we only have 1 percent of the Japanese market? No. I am going to \ntalk about why that is the case. It is a deliberate restriction on \nAmerican products going into Japan.\n  Machine tools: 6 percent of the world market; 1 percent of the \nJapanese market.\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n  Pharmaceuticals: 27 percent of the world market; 7 percent of the \nJapanese market.\n  Office machines: 29 percent of the world market; 10 percent of the \nJapanese market.\n  The point from this chart is that the Japanese systematically keep \nfrom their marketplace the kinds of things that we are shipping around \nthe rest of the world because they want to restrict what they buy from \nus. Yet, they want to continue to expand the amount they sell to us. \nWhat does it mean? It means that we have a very large trade deficit \nwith the country of Japan.\n  The next chart reviews a little about the trade agreements that we \nhave had. Some say, well, we have all these trade agreements. We have \nGATT, we have bilateral agreements, we have all kinds of agreements \nthat are going to be opening up segments of the Japanese market.\n  During the past 3 years the Clinton administration has been very \naggressive. They have negotiated 21 separate agreements with Japan. \nIncluded in these are two of the general framework agreements, and a \nvariety of industry-based agreements with Japan. They contain \neverything from intellectual property to medical technology, from autos \nto auto parts and air cargo.\n  The purpose of these agreements is to try to make consistent and \nmeasurable gains in getting American products into the Japanese \nmarketplace. I think President Clinton has been aggressive on this. I \nappreciate that. Former Ambassador Mickey Kantor has been the most \naggressive of all of our trade ambassadors.\n  But at the same time, we ought to understand that this progress is \npainfully slow and terribly inadequate. We are not solving the problem. \nThis was especially evident to me, at least, in a statement made by \nJapan's Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry about a month \nbefore President Clinton recently went to Japan. Yoshihiro Sakamoto \ntold the Foreign Correspondents Club in Tokyo:\n\n       It is no longer relevant to negotiate and have an agreement \n     on issues related to global industries in a limited bilateral \n     context between Japan and the United States. The era of \n     bilateralism is over. Any such friction from now on will have \n     to be solved in accordance with the World Trade Organization \n     . . .\n\n  In other words, he is saying about this big surplus they have with \nus, or our big trade deficit with Japan, that the days are over when we \nare going to negotiate with them to get more of our cars into Japan or \nmore of our electronics equipment into Japan. Now he says we are going \nto be dealing with the WTO under GATT.\n  The fact is, the World Trade Organization simply does not even \naddress or relate to the kinds of barriers that we face in getting \nAmerican products into Japan. I can understand why Japan really wants \nto deal through the World Trade Organization rather than bilateral \nnegotiations. They have decided that it is the best route for them \nbecause we have painted ourselves in a corner with this thing called \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  The WTO, the World Trade Organization, primarily deals with tariffs \nand quota barriers. The problem is that Japan has a whole range of non-\ntariff barriers that keep American products out. I am going to describe \na few of them. These barriers have nothing to do with the WTO and GATT. \nWe cannot solve them through the WTO and GATT. But nonetheless, Japan \nkeeps a wide range of products out. It restricts dramatically a wide \nrange of American products going into Japan.\n  Perhaps a couple of Japanese agricultural tariffs will best \nillustrate the circumstances that I am talking about.\n  Beef. I do not know if many have been to Japan. The Presiding Officer \nhas been to Japan. If you go to Japan to buy a T-bone steak in Tokyo. \nIt costs you $28 to $30 a pound. Why? Because there is not enough beef \nin Japan.\n  We negotiated with Japan to get more American beef into Japan. You \nwould have thought when it was over you that we had won the Olympics. \nYou had people doing cartwheels and praising Hosanna and doing feasts \nand fiestas. What a wonderful thing it was that we would get more \nAmerican beef into Japan.\n  We have such low expectations of the trade relationship with Japan. \nWhen you strip away what is actually in the agreement, you find that \nthere is a 50-percent tariff on all the beef that goes into Japan. In \nother words we were successful in getting them down to a 50-percent \ntariff applied to American beef going into Japan. And, there is going \nto be a reduction, they say, of that 50-percent, down 2 percent a year.\n  But, if you have 120 percent growth in the volume coming in the \nreduction does not happen. So, you still have a 50-percent tariff on \nbeef going into Japan. All the folks that did cartwheels about the \nmajor breakthrough should take a second look. This was on the front \npages some years ago as a major breakthrough in beef going to go into \nJapan. Guess what? We still have a 50-percent tariff on American beef \ngoing into Japan. Despite that the cattle organizations think it is \ngreat we are sending more beef to Japan and so do I.\n  But, what low expectations we have if we believe it is fair for a \ntrading partner like Japan to say to us, ``You want to ship us \nhamburger or T-bone steaks, guess what? You have a 50-percent tariff.'' \nThat is exactly the kind of thing they have done to us over and over \nand over again. It is exactly why our trade deficit with them has \ngrown.\n  I will not describe the situation with pork but it is almost exactly \nthe same thing. The implication was that we have solved a problem and \nwe get more pork into Japan. Yet the fact is they put up a nontariff \nbarrier.\n  In my judgment it is a fundamentally outrageous trade policy to say \nto us, ``We want to ship you all our cars, we want to ship you our \nVCR's, ship you what we produce, but when you want to send American \ngoods to Japan we want to narrow your market and restrict your \nopportunities.''\n  The next chart shows some of these foreign trade barriers. I have a \ncopy of the booklet put out by the U.S. Trade Representative offices \nshowing trade barriers. It shows the trade barriers we face when \nAmerican producers and workers try to send their products to Japan. \nThis book says:\n\n       Whereas previous administrations had reached bilateral and \n     multilateral agreements with Japan, long-term access to \n     Japan's markets for foreign goods and services has remained \n     elusive. While Japan has reduced its formal tariff rates to \n     imports to very low levels, invisible non-tariff barriers \n     such as nontransparency, discriminatory standards and \n     exclusionary business practices maintain a business \n     environment protective of domestic companies and restrictive \n     of the free flow of competitive goods into the Japanese \n     domestic market.\n\n  That says we are losing American jobs and sapping America's economic \nstrength. Our jobs are going overseas. Why? Because Japan is sending \ntheir manufactured products here and we cannot get enough of our \nmanufactured products into Japan.\n  The next chart shows the barriers to getting the products into Japan. \nThere are many of them. The intricate trade and customs bureaucracy \nthat stalls products when they get to Japan. Then there is \noverregulation and excessive inspection, restrictive standards, \ndiscriminatory pricing and procurement, state trading authorities, and \nsomething called the Keiretsu system. Most Members of the Senate \nunderstand that this Keiretsu structure in Japan would be illegal in \nthe United States. It is a whole series of integrated business \nrelationships and cross ownership that simply prevents us from getting \ninto and competing in the Japanese market.\n  There are plenty of examples of that. Automobiles, for example: If \nyou do not have dealers or existing dealers who are licensed to sell \nyour cars, you cannot get sell your cars. The nontariff barriers of \ngetting goods into Japan is legendary even for companies constantly \ntrying to do that.\n\n  I mentioned apples. It took us 20 years of negotiation and study and \nreview before Japan would accept apples from Washington State--20 \nyears. When it comes to accepting the international phytosanitary \nstandards on fruits and vegetables the best the USTR can say is, \n``Progress has been slow.'' That radically understates the \ncircumstance, when it takes 20 years to get an apple into Japan.\n  Go to Japan today to Tokyo, and see some kids play on a high school \nplayground. See if you see an aluminum baseball bat. You hear the ping \nof aluminum baseball bats in America these days. It seems a lot of the \nkids want aluminum bats rather than wood, but do you hear that sound \nhitting a softball or baseball. You will not hear it in\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nJapan because in Japan if a Japanese high school wants to buy a \nbaseball bat, the bat has to have the Japanese Industrial Standard seal \nof approval.\n  While there are no formal prohibitions on aluminum baseball bats, no \none has been able to get the Japanese Industrial Standard seal of \napproval on an aluminum baseball bat. That means there are no aluminum \nbaseball bats in Japanese high schools. It does not relate to tariffs \nor quotas. It relates to something called the Japanese Industrial \nStandard seal of approval.\n  Now with all the international intrigue in all of the high-level \nnegotiations, we run up a massive trade deficit with Japan and we are \ntold, ``Well, our marketplace cannot accept enough T-bone steaks or any \naluminum bats, or it take 20 years to get an apple through to be eaten \nby a Japanese consumer.''\n  Japanese do not recognize the copyrights on sound recordings made \noutside of Japan prior to 1971. Now, the Presiding Officer, being from \nMontana, knows that the best music in our country came in the 1950's \nand 1960's. Because of the circumstances of the nonrecognition of \ncopyrights on sound recordings in Japan, none of this good old rock and \nroll music is protected in the Japanese market. All of it is available \nto be used for nothing. That is another example of a circumstance of \ndoing business in Japan.\n  Even earthquakes do not seem to shake their resolve to prevent \noutside interests from coming in with goods and services. The Kobe \nearthquake prompted some Swiss dogs to be sent to help find people \nburied in the rubble. Those Swiss dogs were held up at the airport in \nquarantine. Special emergency equipment was delayed in customs to \nrespond to the Kobe earthquake and foreign teams of emergency doctors \ncame to Japan to help and could not practice because they did not have \nJapanese licenses. That is the kind of bureaucracy that we face in \ntrying to get foreign goods and services into the Japanese markets.\n  Next, finally, I will talk about some myths about the United States \ntrade deficit with Japan. The first myth is this is something we do not \nhave to talk about and that it is self-correcting. It will go away.\n  It is not going away. It is getting worse. It is a deliberate managed \ntrade strategy by Japan to enhance their economy at our expense. It \nmeans fewer jobs in our country. It means economic opportunity lost. It \nmeans a lower standard of living in America.\n  The second myth is that the trade deficit can be solved through the \nWorld Trade Organization. Anybody that believes that needs to go find \nsome bridges to buy this afternoon. It will not happen. The World Trade \nOrganization is not going to solve this problem.\n  Another myth is that bilateral trade deficits do not matter. It is \nonly the aggregate that matters. That would be true for some other \ncountry that would have equal trade surpluses to offset against such a \ndeficit. That argument has no relationship to this. We have a constant \nrecurring trade deficit that is hurting this country and the largest \ndeficit is with the country of Japan. It is deliberate. It is not \ngetting better. It is getting worse.\n  It does not matter what we trade with Japan, some say. Nonsense. \nJapan is one of our largest trading partners. As I have indicated, for \nover 30 years, every single year, we have had a trade deficit. More \nimportantly, they are sending us finished products, the product of \nlabor and manufacturing and good jobs, and all too often they are \nunwilling to buy from us the product of our manufacturing. They are \ninterested in buying our coal and other things that are not a product \nof manufacturing and do not create as many jobs in our country.\n  Another myth is that the deficit can be solved by macroeconomic \npolicies. The deficit is not going to be solved by macroeconomic \npolicies. Our trade deficit with Japan is a structural problem, and the \nimbalance in our economies is a result of a continuing trade deficit, \nnot a cause of it.\n  We have cut our Federal budget deficit substantially in recent years. \nYet, we have still seen a massive surge in Japanese imports during \nthese years.\n  Some say, well, it is the currency exchange rate that caused the \ndeficit. That is simply not true. As the currency exchange rate moved \nin one direction or another, our trade deficit has frequently moved \nexactly the opposite direction that you would expect. This trade \ndeficit is not going to be solved by macroeconomic policies.\n  Some say that the Japanese market cannot absorb more American goods. \nThat, of course, is the biggest myth of all. This is another version of \nthe myth that we cannot compete in the Japanese marketplace because we \ndo not understand the Japanese market. The fact is that the American \nproducts produced here do well whenever they are available to Japanese \ncustomers. The problem is getting into the Japanese marketplace to make \nthem available to the Japanese customers.\n  Now, it is true that, on a per capita basis, the Japanese import as \nmuch from the United States as the United States imports from Japan. \nBut that is one of those statistics that conceals rather than reveals. \nIf we turn this around, we would find that, on a per capita basis, \nJapan exports four times more to the United States than we export to \nJapan. That is a statistic that just confounds an issue rather than \nclarifies an issue.\n  The fact is, whenever the Japanese market has been opened up to an \nopportunity to trade more and import more from the United States, the \nUnited States has experienced a substantial growth in sales to Japan. \nOur problem is that opportunity has not existed very often with Japan, \nand that is the reason for our recurring trade deficit.\n  The final chart talks about solving our trade deficit with Japan. \nWhat do we have to do to resolve this? First of all, you stop ignoring \nit. Do not have 200 days of discussion on the floor of the Senate about \nthe fiscal policy deficit and then completely ignore a trade policy \ndeficit that is even higher than the fiscal policy deficit. Don't \nignore one that will inevitably be repaid some day by a lower standard \nof living in this country. This is another part of the twin deficits \nthat hurt our country, and we have to deal with it.\n  We have to continue and expand bilateral framework talks with Japan, \nand push them hard. We have to say to Japan: You have a responsibility \nto us. A trade relationship is a two-way relationship, and we will no \nlonger countenance a relationship in which you do well at our expense. \nWe will not continue, in the next 30 years, a continuing trade deficit \nwith Japan.\n  Second, we must monitor market access and enforce agreements, and do \nit aggressively. None of this talk and fluff. Go at this aggressively \nand insist on market access, demand market access for American workers \nand for the products of American businesses in Japan.\n  We need to involve and aggressively represent U.S. business, \nagriculture, and labor interests in trade disputes. We have been \nwallflowers in our trade relationship with these folks. We sit around \nand twiddle our thumbs and act nervous and sweat all day wondering what \nwe can do. It is very simple.\n  What we say to countries like Japan is: We enjoy your products, \nAmericans deserve to have opportunity to purchase your products, but we \ndemand, as a part of that, that you open your markets to us. If you are \nsaying to us, ``We want to ship our cars, VCR's, and television sets to \nAmerica to sell, but we will not allow American products into Japan in \nany significant quantity,'' then we say, ``Sell your cars in some other \ncountry. Sell your cars in Kenya. See how many cars you sell in the \nKenyan market.''\n  If you want to sell in this market, you are welcome to. Then we hold \nup a mirror and say, ``Treat us as we treat you. If you want access to \nour market, you will have it on the condition that we get access to \nyour market.'' Anything short of that, in my judgment, is unacceptable \nto this country.\n  We also have to work with our trading partners to open Japanese \nmarkets. Other countries suffer the same problems. We have to work with \nthem to respond.\n  We need to require full reciprocity and full market access. That is \nthe mirror approach, saying, if you want to be in our markets, we \nexpect and demand to be in yours.\n  Finally we have to make solving the trade deficit a national \npriority. I intend to offer, next week, a piece of legislation that \nwould establish a commission to move quickly to develop national \nrecommendations on how we aggressively involve ourselves in resolving \nthis trade deficit and bringing this\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\ntrade deficit down. We need balanced trade, not just with Japan but \nwith China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries as well.\n  I am not saying, in any way, that Japan is not a valued trading \npartner of ours. I am saying that our trade relationship with Japan has \nnot been mutually beneficial. It is not helping this country. It is \nhurting this country. We ought to decide, as a country, that we want to \nhave a strong manufacturing base that helps create good jobs here in \nour country. We ought to decide we do not want to put a wall around us. \nWe want to be willing and able to compete with anybody who wants to \nship their goods into our country, provided they are produced with a \nliving wage paid somewhere else, produced under circumstances that do \nnot pollute the environment, do not exploit child labor, and so on. \nEven while we do that, we as a country ought to insist that other \ncountries allow us the same access to their markets.\n  It is interesting, if you go back to the Second World War and chart \nthe 50 years since the Second World War, you will find that 25 years \nafter the Second World War we won everything economically. And, we did \nit with one hand tied behind our back. Our trade policy was a foreign \npolicy, and nobody made any bones about it. It was designed to help \nother countries. But we could beat other countries without any problem. \nWe were the biggest, the strongest, the most, the best. We could \noutcompete and outsell and beat any country in the world on almost any \nlevel economically.\n  As a result, during those 25 years, American wages continued to rise \nand workers benefited from our economic opportunities and the economic \nstrength that we had. In the first 25 years, wages went up like that. \nThen in the next 25 years, in that second half of the 50 years, wages \nbegan to stagnate for most Americans. What happened? What happened was \nthat those we used to treat with a trade policy that was really a \nforeign policy have become tough, shrewd economic customers and tough \ncompetitors--Japan, Germany, and others.\n  What has happened was we began to bleed strength out of this country \nwith these kinds of trade deficits that we have seen. These were \nrecurring, consistent, yearly trade deficits that sapped this country's \neconomic strength.\n  Our trade policy should no longer be a foreign policy. They ought to \nbe economic policies that say to other customers and other trade \npartners in other countries, who are tough competitors, that we will \ngive you certain access to our marketplace because we want to have a \nfree and open marketplace. It should say we want to give consumers \naccess to a wide range of products from around the world. But all of \nyou--Japan, China, Germany, and others--have a responsibility in \nreturn. This responsibility finally is going to be one that America \ninsists upon. The responsibility is to allow the American worker and \nthe American producer into your marketplace to compete on the same \nbasis as you compete in our country. We expect it, and, more \nimportantly, we demand it, and we are going to do things necessary to \nenforce it.\n  I come from a State that requires that we find foreign homes for a \nlot of what we raise. I understand that. There is our grain, beef, and \na lot of agricultural produce which move overseas. I appreciate the \nfact that we have trade relationships with countries that are willing \nto purchase these commodities. But it is not gratuity that suggests to \nme that Japan and China ought to buy more agricultural products, not \nless, from us.\n  When we run up trade deficits, or when Japan and China run up a trade \nsurplus with us and then go elsewhere to buy grain or shop elsewhere to \nbuy airplanes, there is something fundamentally wrong with our trade \nrelationships. I hope that we will decide that this kind of trade \nstrategy that we have had under Republicans and Democrats for three or \nfour decades is robbing our children of the kind of economic future \nthey ought to have in our country. It has been shifting our Nation from \na high-wage nation to a low-wage nation. It has been a major \ncontributor to our fiscal policy deficits because it has zapped our \neconomic strength and it has slowed our economic growth.\n  I hope all of us will decide to do something about this. As I said, I \nwant to introduce some legislation next week to form an emergency \ncommission to try to deal with recommendations on how this country \nconfronts this trade deficit. I am going to make presentations similar \nto this on our trade deficit with China, which is $34 billion a year \nand growing, and on our trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, which \ncombined is also nearly $34 billion a year and growing.\n  I hope, perhaps at the conclusion, all of us will have some more \ninformation and some more facts about a problem that I think is a \nserious problem for our country and one that literally begs for \nattention. It demands a solution if we as a country are going to remain \nan economic power in the world in the decades to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nbudget that this body enacted last evening. I voted with pride for the \nDomenici-Dole budget because it places our budget in balance by the \nyear 2002.\n  This budget is the first real budget, with real numbers in it that \nwill lead us to a balanced budget, that has been passed since I came to \nthe Congress in 1974. We finally have passed a real budget with real \nnumbers in it that will lead us to a balanced budget.\n  Also, this budget contains welfare reform, real welfare reform, that \nwill lead us to workfare following the Wisconsin plan. We passed the \nsame thing last year. It was vetoed twice by the President. But even he \nnow says he has endorsed most parts of the Wisconsin plan. So even \nthough our budget last year was not enacted, it has had some dramatic \nresults. Even the liberal Democrats are now talking about a balanced \nbudget for the first time. They are at least pretending to be \ninterested. The President gave his radio address on the need for \nwelfare reform following the Wisconsin plan which, under Republican \nGov. Tommy Thompson, has become a model to get people onto workfare.\n  So this is very, very important for our country. In fact, a balanced \nbudget is the most important thing we can do because it will provide \nfor low interest rates and a stable dollar, and that will help us \nexport more. A balanced budget will help college students who have \nstudent loans because it keeps interest rates down and the payments can \nbe less. It helps homeowners who have home mortgages in terms of their \ninterest. It helps small business people because of lower interest \nrates and a stable dollar for exports. It helps agriculture. In fact, \nit may be the most important farm bill.\n\n  I supported the freedom-to-farm bill with pride, and I was a part of \nthe leadership team that brought us the freedom to farm bill. But if we \ncan export, commodity prices will take care of themselves. In fact, we \nhave some of the highest commodity prices in history.\n  Mr. President, we have a serious problem with cattle prices at this \ntime. I just finished a conversation about the need for the Clinton \nadministration to enforce the antitrust actions and the price-fixing \nactions if American consumers are not getting the advantages of lower \nbeef prices--and they are not. Some people say we need more \ninvestigations and studies. We do not need more investigations and \nstudies. We need action by the Clinton administration and the Justice \nDepartment to enforce the antitrust laws and the price-fixing laws that \nwe have in this country. That will help beef prices. That will help our \ncattle.\n  Mr. President, I grew up on a farm, and I used to raise cattle. We \nwould go out to western South Dakota and buy 400-pound feeder calves \nand bring them back to eastern South Dakota, feed them for a year, and \nsell them. I kept records on my 4-H beef cattle, and I\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\nknow how tough it is to make a profit on feeder cattle. I know that a \nlot of our cattlemen today are losing money and are losing their farms \nbecause of low cattle prices. There have been a number of steps taken. \nBut they have all been on the edge.\n  The real issue is price. I feel strongly that the great packer \nconcentration is causing price-fixing, and we need antitrust action by \nthe Clinton administration. They have the authority. The law is on the \nbooks. We should do it now.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that I voted with pride \nfor the Dole budget that passed the Senate because it has welfare \nreform in it that will lead to workfare.\n  It will fundamentally change the welfare system in our country to \nworkfare. It will save taxpayers' money. It will mean that actual \nwelfare recipients will do even better. This is a good budget that will \nlead us to $1 billion in 2002. I hope the House of Representatives and \nthe White House accept the budget this year.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back my time.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we leave for the Memorial Day \nrecess, I wanted to make a couple of comments if I could with regard to \nthe current situation on welfare reform. I did not hear all of his \nremarks, but I know that the Senator from South Dakota just made a \nreference to welfare in the budget. A number of colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle have addressed the issue this morning--Senator \nBreaux, and I believe, the majority leader did so as well. I think it \nis fairly clear that Democrats and Republicans want welfare reform. I \ndo not know of anyone who supports the status quo.\n  There has been a lot of talk about reform principles over the last \nseveral months. The President reiterated the basic principles just last \nweekend. And on Tuesday, my colleague, the majority leader, announced \nhis principles. The legislation to reform welfare has come a long way \nin the last 12 months. Senator Breaux and Senator Chafee have worked \nover the course of the better part of a year now to achieve a \nbipartisan compromise on welfare reform, and frankly I applaud them for \ntheir effort and for the contribution they have made to this debate.\n  On the House side, Representatives Tanner and Castle have done much \nthe same thing, and for them, too, there has been a good deal of \nattention for the work product they have produced. On Wednesday, \nRepublican House and Senate Members introduced legislation very close \nto those bills. So in large measure, many of the extreme provisions of \nthe legislation offered in 1995 are no longer evident in the welfare \nreform proposals that are currently being considered. If you look at \nthe proposals, what is remarkable is the degree to which there is \ncommon ground. That common ground is really based on a number of \nprinciples that apparently are shared now by the vast majority of \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  First, able-bodied welfare recipients ought to work. I do not think \nthere is much disagreement about that. Second, welfare receipts ought \nto be limited in time. Now, there is some disagreement with regard to \nthe length of time perhaps, especially on my side of the aisle, but I \ndo believe there is a broad, bipartisan consensus in the middle that \nthere ought to be a time limitation. Adequate funds for child care need \nto be provided as well. You cannot ask a family to go take that new \njob, to leave the security of the welfare infrastructure and then to \nexpect them to leave children in the living room unattended. We talk \nabout making sure that families have the ability to be families, to \ntake care of their children. If they are going to work, somebody has to \ntake that responsibility while they are gone.\n  I also recognize, and I think most colleagues do, that there is a \nbroad consensus about how we treat illegal noncitizens. They should not \nreceive welfare, period. I do not think there is much disagreement with \nregard to welfare receipt for illegal noncitizens. Child support \nenforcement laws need to be strengthened. There are still too many \ndeadbeat dads out there who ought to be sought out and ought to be made \nto live up to their responsibilities.\n  We need to provide more flexibility to States. The President has \nprovided now, I am told, over 60 waivers in States across the country. \nNo greater level of flexibility has ever been given by any \nadministration to States to find ways to address the welfare issue from \ntheir perspective more effectively than has this administration.\n\n  Finally--and I think there is some disagreement on this--there is a \ngrowing consensus that children, infants, and toddlers especially, \nthose most vulnerable, need to be protected; that welfare reform should \nnot be about punishing kids. It ought to be about giving them as much \nempowerment, as much opportunity to be cared for, to be educated, to be \nfed, to be clothed, and housed in a way that will ensure that they are \nnot on welfare someday. We need to break this generational linkage. The \nonly way we are going to do that is to empower children and find ways \nto ensure that they are not punished as we continue to find a more \nviable approach to our welfare system.\n  The President said yesterday that he would like to enact welfare \nquickly. In fact, he said he would like to see it happen before the \nmajority leader leaves the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I think there ought to be bipartisan agreement to that \neffect. Let us try to do that. I listened carefully to the speech by \nthe majority leader in Wisconsin, and he said, ``When I say real \nwelfare reform, I mean requiring every able-bodied welfare recipient to \nfind work within 2 years.''\n  The Republican bill introduced yesterday goes beyond that particular \nrequirement for work, and it is something we are going to have to be \nable to address. There are no exceptions, except for mothers with \nchildren under age 1. What about disabled people? Should they be \nrequired to find a job in 2 years? What about those caring for a \ndisabled child? What about those who are caring for a disabled spouse? \nDo we require the same of them that we require for able-bodied people \nin normal circumstances?\n  That is something I am sure in a bipartisan way we can resolve to \neveryone's satisfaction, but clearly those are a series of questions \nthat in our view have to be addressed in a way that will allow us to \npass meaningful legislation sometime soon.\n  I do hope we can act on it soon, but we also need to read the \nlegislation that has been introduced. It was not available yesterday. \nWe do not know if it will be available today. There may be other areas \nin the bill where the provisions do not match the principles that \nappear to be the common ground that binds Republicans and Democrats. \nBut clearly there is a desire, and I think that desire is becoming more \npronounced, more articulate in a more specific way than at any time in \nrecent memory.\n  I agree with much of the majority leader's speech in Wisconsin, not \njust the quote to which I just made reference. He did not speak as an \nextremist partisan leader. He spoke of, and I quote, ``The American \nideals of freedom and human dignity, opportunity and personal \nresponsibility.'' He is right.\n  The President has articulated in much the same way what this ought to \nbe about. Now it is our responsibility to ensure that welfare reform \ndoes not aim at the mother but hit the child.\n  Much has been said about reform. Little has been said about \nprotecting children. We all want to make sure that they are protected, \nthat they do not pay for the mistakes or the circumstances of their \nparents. Somehow there ought to be a way to protect children as we \nattempt in a positive way to construct a welfare infrastructure that \nallows us to make fundamental change.\n  If our Republican colleagues are serious about welfare, then we ought \nto schedule it. We ought to schedule it quickly. We could agree today \nto take that legislation up before the Senate as\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nearly as June 4 when we come back. Let us set aside this so-called \nDefend America Act. Let us bring welfare reform to the floor and let us \nbegin to address it. We can compare our provisions. We can agree on \nprinciples. We can decide how we answer the questions that I have \naddressed, but let us move it.\n  Let's drop the partisan ploy to combine welfare and Medicaid. There \nis no consensus on Medicaid. There is a consensus on welfare. Not \nproceeding on June 4 means that perhaps there are some who are not \nserious about whether or not we ought to move in an expeditious way, \nthat we may not be able to get this bipartisan consensus in a timeframe \nthat will allow the majority leader to demonstrate his leadership as he \nhas in the last couple of days.\n  So I hope that we could get some agreement to take up welfare reform \nat the earliest possible date. I would be prepared to work with the \nmajority leader to find a way to ensure that Senators have an \nopportunity to voice their objectives and their goals as well as their \nopposition to specific ideas that may be debated. That is what a good \nwelfare debate is all about.\n  But I can guarantee this. There would not be any long, unnecessary, \nextended debate. We could resolve this matter. We could send it on to \nthe President. We could find the President and the majority leader in \nagreement, and move on to other issues that may separate us and \ncontinue to require the debate that I know they will. Medicaid and \nMedicare may be two examples. But we can do welfare. We can do it the \nweek we get back. We can do it in a matter of a limited period of time. \nThat is possible. I hope we could find a way, in a bipartisan \nagreement, to make that happen sooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the question of most-\nfavored-nation tariff status for China.\n  Our goals in China policy over the next 10 years are more important \nthan our goals for the next 2 months. But we must begin with the next 2 \nmonths and MFN status, because we can not do much at all unless we \navoid disaster in the short term.\n  We Americans should begin by understanding what MFN status is, and \nwhat it is not. MFN is not a special favor and it does not mean ``best \ncountry.'' It traditionally meant that we would give a country the same \ntariff rates everyone else got. But today, MFN is closer to ``Least'' \nthan ``Most'' favored nation.\n  Only seven countries--Afghanistan, Cuba, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, \nVietnam, and Yugoslavia lack MFN status. And the House, as well as the \nSenate Finance Committee, has already passed a bill to get Cambodia off \nthat list.\n  By contrast, 31 countries get tariffs below MFN through the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative, the Andean Trade Preference Act, the NAFTA, and the \nUnited States-Israel Free-Trade Agreement. And when we renew the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, the total will rise to 151 countries \nand territories with tariffs below MFN.\n  So giving China MFN status is nothing special. Now look at revoking \nMFN. It raises tariffs from Uruguay Round to Smoot-Hawley rates. That \nbrings our average tariff on Chinese goods from 4.6 to 40 percent. To \nchoose some of China's largest exports, Smoot-Hawley tariffs raise the \nduty on silk blouses tenfold, from 6.5 to 65 percent. On radio-tape \nplayers, from 1 to 35 percent. On toys and stuffed animals, zero to 70 \npercent.\n  This would make trade with China impossible. China would lose about \n$44 billion of exports, nearly a third of its total sales to the world. \nChina's inevitable retaliation would cost us $14 billion in direct \nexports, plus much of our $17 billion in exports to Hong Kong.\n  The consequences would be staggering. China would suffer a \nhumanitarian crisis, as millions of workers in coastal export factories \nlose their jobs overnight. That is why the dissident Wei Jingsheng \nhopes we will not revoke MFN status, and says that ``the direct victims \nof such measures are the already poverty-stricken Chinese people.''\n  They would not be the only victims. The damage to Hong Kong would be \ntremendous. The United States would lose hundreds of thousands of \nexport jobs. Retailers and the millions of people they employ would \nsuffer a massive disruption of toy and apparel imports just as they are \nbuying stocks for the Christmas season.\n  And although MFN is a trade policy, the malign effect of revoking it \nwould go far beyond trade and jobs. It is hard to see how we could \ncontinue working with China in areas of mutual interest. And the \nconsequences in politics and security--from our ability to manage the \nnuclear aspirations of North Korea, to preventing weapons proliferation \nin the Middle East, to the U.N. Security Council and beyond--would be \nimmense.\n  That brings us to the larger and more important question--what we \nhope to achieve in China policy generally. And again, start with the \nfacts.\n  China is the world's most populous country. It has nuclear weapons \nand the world's largest army.\n  It is a major industrial contributor to global climate change and \npollution of the oceans. And it is the world's fastest growing major \neconomy. So in the coming decades, China will have significant effect, \nfor good or for ill, on economic, environmental and political \ndevelopments in Asia and around the world.\n  If China is hostile--or, short of outright hostility, refuses to \nrecognize the standards of behavior most countries accept, and \napproaches the world with an angry nationalism--hopes for peace and \nprosperity recede.\n  And as the first half of this century showed, a weak, poor, and \nfragmented China is equally dangerous.\n  It becomes a source of revolution. It sends refugees across the \nworld. And it attracts the greed and aggression of its neighbors, as it \ndid Bolshevik Russia and Imperial Japan.\n  So we should do what we can to avoid either extreme. That is a \ndifficult foreign policy problem which requires patient, continuous \nengagement. We should work with China wherever possible. And issues \nfrom environmental protection, to adoption of Chinese orphans, to \nsecurity in Korea show that it is often possible.\n  We also have disputes with China, on intellectual property \nprotection, treatment of dissidents, and weapons sales. And we must \naddress these disputes in a calm but serious way. The U.S.TR's \nannouncement of sanctions for violations of the 1995 Intellectual \nProperty Agreement today is a good example.\n  But whether we are talking about mutual interests, or disputes, there \nis really only one way to succeed. That is by staying engaged and \nremembering our long-term goal of a world a bit more peaceful and more \nprosperous.\n  Barring a cataclysmic event that makes engagement impossible--an \nunprovoked attack on Taiwan, for example--revoking or conditioning MFN \nwill not help achieve that goal. Rather the reverse, to put it mildly. \nAnd if such an event were to occur, a policy based on MFN would be far \ntoo weak.\n  In fact, there is no situation to which revoking MFN status would be \nthe appropriate response. And thus, after 6 years, it is time to end \nthe debate. It has become simply an artificial, annual crisis at a time \nwhen we have all too many real ones.\n  So this year, the administration should show strength and confidence \nin its basically sound policy.\n  We should not revoke MFN status. We should not try a split-the-baby \nhalf measure like revoking MFN for state-owned industry or bringing \nChina back to Tokyo round tariffs. Nor should we use new conditions to \npostpone the decision a few months or a year. We should just leave MFN \nalone.\n  And next year, we should move on. It is time to bring China out of \nthe Jackson-Vanik amendment, extend MFN permanently, and close this \ndebate for good.\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n\n\n                 VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL SELF-AUDITING\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this week the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing on voluntary \nenvironmental self-auditing. The hearing was held to explore the State \nexperience with laws to encourage self-audits and why it is necessary \nto enact Federal legislation to complement these State laws.\n  I want to take this opportunity today to share with you the \nimportance of what was said at this hearing.\n  First, an explanation of what voluntary environmental self-auditing \nis; why companies do it; and what the problems are.\n  In the past 10 years, the number of environmental statutes and \nregulations that impose compliance obligations, and the corresponding \nincrease in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions for violations \nof those obligations, have dramatically increased. Furthermore, thanks \nin part to these laws, social mores that value environmentally \nresponsible business practices also compel environmental awareness by \nbusinesses. In response to these developments, more and more companies \nuse environmental self-audit programs as a tool to ensure compliance \nwith this complex and litigious system.\n  Generally, an environmental audit is a means of reviewing a business \nin order to get a snapshot of its overall compliance with environmental \nlaws and to troubleshoot for potential future problems. EPA defines an \naudit as a systematic, documented, periodic, and objective review by \nregulated entities of facility operations and practices related to \nmeeting environmental requirements. Audits can include inspections of \nequipment to ensure that permit requirements are being met; assessment \nof future and present risks of regulated and unregulated materials used \nat the facility; and assessment of day-to-day operation of its \nenvironmental management structure and resources. Some companies have \ncompliance management systems that can include day-to-day, even shift-\nto-shift voluntary activities to assure compliance.\n  No State or Federal law requires companies to undertake comprehensive \nenvironmental self-auditing. This is a voluntary, good business \npractice initiated by companies that are taking extra steps to be in \nfull compliance with environmental law.\n  There are no guidelines or standard practices--audits vary \nconsiderably because they are done voluntarily and because they must \naccommodate the individual needs of companies or specific facilities to \nbe most effective. They are typically much more extensive than an \ninspection by a State or Federal regulator because they are done more \noften and because companies simply know much more about their \noperations and permit obligations than the regulator can.\n  So, a company conducting its own audit can identify and correct a \nmuch wider range of potential violations.\n  Sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?\n  Unfortunately, many companies do not do voluntary self-audits because \nthe information contained in the audit document can be obtained by \nregulators, prosecutors, citizens' groups, or private citizens and used \nto sue the company.\n  Remember that we have an incredibly complex compliance system. A \nrecent survey by Arthur Anderson Environmental Services and the \nNational Law Journal found that nearly 70 percent of 200 corporate \nattorneys interviewed said that they did not believe total compliance \nwith the law was achievable--due to the complexity of the law, the \nvarying interpretations of the regulators, the ever-present role of \nhuman error, and the cost. Because of this complexity, it is possible \nand logical that companies that take on the task of self-evaluation \nwill find volations--that is what we want them to do. Find problems and \nfix them without waiting a year for a government inspection. \nUnfortunately, the audit documents are a vehicle for anyone to use to \nsue. Companies completing environmental audits develop documentation of \ntheir instances of noncompliance or areas of potential concern. These \ndocuments, if made public, are a roadmap for third parties or \ngovernments to use to sue the company even if the problem has already \nbeen corrected and no environmental harm has occurred.\n  Companies are already vulnerable to extensive liability under \nenvironmental laws. Under the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, for \nexample, the maximum civil penalty that may be assessed is now $25,000 \nper day per violation. EPA's fiscal year 1994 enforcement and \ncompliance assurance accomplishments report shows that 166 civil \njudicial penalties were brought in 1994 totaling $65.6 million. On \naverage, that is about $400,000 a case. Administrative penalty orders \nfor the same year numbered 1,433 actions, which totaled $48 million.\n  That's a lot of money and a pretty powerful disincentive to self-\nauditing.\n  Seventeen States have recognized this disincentive to self-auditing \nand have enacted laws to fix the problem so more companies will self-\naudit.\n  Mississippi is one of those States that has acted on this issue.\n  These laws typically do two things:\n  First, provide a qualified evidentiary privilege for internal company \naudit documents, and second, grant penalty immunity to companies that \nconduct audits, voluntarily disclose any violations they discover in \ntheir audit, and promptly clean up or fix the violation.\n  In other words, if you are a responsible company that does self-\nauditing to find out where you have problems, and you tell the State \nauthority that you found it and fixed it, you are rewarded by not \nhaving to pay a fine and by getting protection from use of an internal \ncompany audit in court.\n  Better environmental compliance using a voluntary flexible approach: \nthis is what we all--both Republicans and Democrats alike--believe to \nbe the new environmentalism.\n  This is common sense--companies have an incentive to find and fix \ntheir problems right away.\n  That's better for the environment: State officials benefit because \nthey can establish cooperative relationships with companies instead of \nthe current adversarial enforcement first system; Taxpayers get better \nreturn from their tax dollars because enforcement resources can be \nredirected toward the bad guys who are not following the law; and of \ncourse, best of all, we are all rewarded with greater compliance with \nenvironmental law.\n  These laws are not about secrecy and letting polluters off the hook--\nyou'll hear that from the opponents of these laws.\n  Opponents will say that these laws make it more difficult to \nprosecute and that they will interfere with enforcement actions or \ncompromise the public's right to know.\n  Not true. These laws protect only the voluntary self-audit document--\nthey do not protect any information required by law to be collected, \ndeveloped, maintained, reported, or otherwise made available to a \ngovernment agency. The opponents are saying that protection of the \naudit document will allow bad actors to hide violations and endanger \nhuman health. Of course, that is not true: you gain nothing from these \nlaws if you are using an audit for a fraudulent purpose, or if you find \na violation and don't fix it, or if you have a pattern of repeat \nviolations.\n  If you're cheating, you're out, as it should be. These laws are about \na new way to do things with all the safeguards you would expect a State \nlegislature would insist upon to protect its citizens.\n  Again, 17 States think this is a better way to get things done. And \nby the way, 25 other State legislatures are considering this voluntary \nself-audit legislation--that is a grand total of 42 States.\n  I'd say this is a definite trend.\n  We need to enact similar legislation on the Federal level to \ncomplement and assist these States with full and effective \nimplementation of this concept. This is what the hearing was all about: \nthe need for Federal legislation.\n  Why not let the States continue to show us innovative ways to achieve \nenvironmental progress? Because the way our system of environmental law \nis set up, EPA retains the right to enforce the law after it delegates \nprogram authority to a State. This means that without a Federal law \ngranting a qualified privilege and immunity for voluntary self-audits, \nthe EPA can take separate enforcement actions--or overfile--regardless \nof any State action. So, a company that wishes to\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\ntake advantage of a State audit law which provides it with enforcement \nprotections from State action, is not protected from Federal \nenforcement actions.\n  Why would a company voluntarily disclose violations to a State when \nthe feds can come after them for the same thing? It would be asking \nthem to be hit with a lawsuit.\n  EPA has been very clear about its intent to scrutinize actions in \nStates which have enacted laws and in States which are currently \naddressing audit bills in their legislatures. EPA has set up a task \nforce to monitor the approval of State delegated programs under the \nClean Air Act for States with voluntary environmental audit statutes. \nThe Agency has indicated that approval of certain State programs may be \ndelayed or denied because of their State audit privilege statutes. EPA \nhas used this threat to withhold Federal program delegation in order to \ninfluence pending State legislation.\n  This is an astonishing breach of States' rights, if you ask me.\n  Threatening States because of laws their citizens' representatives \nhave enacted. Governor Merrill of New Hampshire said it best in \nresponding to EPA's opposition to that State's law:\n\n       I reject the suggestion that States like New Hampshire must \n     recognize the primacy of Federal laws in order to \n     successfully design and implement effective environmental \n     laws. In fact, States have proven time and time again that \n     the Federal Government does not know best and does not get \n     the job done for the citizens of the several States. I hope \n     that the EPA does not intend to minimize the independent \n     sovereign rights of States to adopt and enforce environmental \n     laws that protect our environment and add to our quality of \n     life.\n\n  Full use of these State laws will never happen in this adversarial \nclimate and an opportunity to encourage this creative and cost-\neffective approach to environmental problems will be missed if we do \nnot take action on the Federal level.\n  Even the Clinton administration has recognized the value of promoting \nenvironmental self-auditing, having issued a policy statement in \nDecember 1995. It is a good step forward by this administration; \nunfortunately, it does not really do the job.\n  Basically, the administration policy says if companies come forward \nand voluntarily disclose violations, then EPA will not prosecute them \nas aggressively as they could otherwise. Not a real bonus. No \nevidentiary protection, no protection against citizen suits, and it is \nonly a policy, not a rule, so it does not have the force of law nor \ndoes it have any impact on what the Justice Department or the FBI can \ndo.\n  A nice gesture but that's about it.\n  The hearing makes a compelling case for enactment of Federal \nlegislation. Senators Brown and Hatfield have introduced legislation, \nS. 582, to encourage environmental self-auditing by setting up parallel \nprotections and incentives on the Federal level that parallel those on \nthe State level.\n  Enactment of S. 582 will allow these 17 States to fully implement \ntheir laws. We here in Congress can put our money where our mouth is by \nenacting the kind of flexible, voluntary environmental statutes that we \nhave all been talking about for a year. And it presents the EPA with \nthe opportunity to work with instead of against our States. This is the \nbest reason yet to pass the Brown-Hatfield bill.\n  We all get better environmental compliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5643-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I begin by asking unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, may turn \nto the consideration of H.R. 3415 regarding the gas tax repeal, and \nthat it be considered under the following time restraints, 1 hour on \nthe bill to be equally divided in the usual form, no amendments or \nmotions be in order, and following the conclusion of time, the bill be \nread for a third time, and final passage occur without further action \nor debate.\n  I think, since we are entering the Memorial Day week, we could come \ntogether on an agreement on a number of unanimous-consent requests \nhere, particularly this one. It would be very helpful to the American \npeople if we could send this gas tax repeal to the President of the \nUnited States. He would be able to sign it right here at this critical \nmoment as Americans are traveling all over our country. And, therefore, \nI make that unanimous-consent request at this time, Mr. President.\n  I further ask immediately following the disposition of H.R. 3415 the \nSenate turn to consideration of S. 295 regarding labor-management--that \nis the TEAM Act, cooperation in the workplace--that no amendments or \nmotions be in order, and there be 2 hours of debate to be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to third reading, and final passage \noccur all without action or debate. Again, that is the so-called TEAM \nAct, and it be brought up with no amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of S. 295, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3448 regarding the minimum \nwage, and it be considered under the following time restraints: 1 hour \non the bill to be equally divided in the usual form, one amendment in \norder to be offered by the majority leader or his designee, one \namendment in order to be offered by the Democratic leader or his \ndesignee; that the amendments be offered in the first degree and \nlimited to 1 hour each, to be equally divided in the usual form, no \nmotions be in order other than motions to table, and following the \ndisposition of the amendments and the conclusion of time the bill be \nadvanced to third reading, and final passage occur all without further \naction or debate.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent for all of those I listed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished majority whip and I \nhave had the opportunity to discuss these matters now on several \noccasions and I appreciate his candor and the opportunity we have had \nto discuss ways with which to bring these bills to the floor.\n  I have indicated to him that on several of these bills my Democratic \ncolleagues hope to offer amendments. It is not our desire to extend \ndebate, to my knowledge, on any of these bills. Our hope, however, is \nthat on the gas tax bill we have the opportunity to offer an amendment \nwhich would ensure that consumers benefit from this reduction in the \ngas tax. This unanimous-consent agreement would not allow for that. We \nhave other amendments that we would like to be able to offer.\n  Because of our desire to offer amendments and our difficulty in \nhaving that right under this unanimous-consent agreement, I have to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Democratic leader, \nI know that the majority leader has indicated that he would be willing \nto work with the minority in developing the concept where the gas tax \nrepeal would be subject to some amendments, including a technical \namendment to be offered by the majority leader regarding previously \npurchased gas, an amendment to be offered by the Democratic leader or \nhis designee, and then one to be offered by the majority leader or his \ndesignee. I know you have a\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nSenator that has been working on trying to come up with a way to \nguarantee the people actually get this gas tax repeal.\n  I am willing, on behalf of the majority leader, to modify that \nunanimous-consent request to include those amendments on the gas tax, \nif that would be helpful.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to consult with a couple of my colleagues prior \nto the time we enter into that agreement at this time.\n  The majority whip has provided us, I think, with an opportunity here \nto reach an agreement, at least on that particular bill. If it were in \nconcert with the minimum wage bill to be taken to the floor at \napproximately the same time--that is, within the same day or the day \nfollowing--I think we might have an agreement that those two bills \ncould be put on the calendar and brought up as soon as we come back. I \nwould be interested in working with my distinguished colleague to see \nif that might be accomplished.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could inquire of the Democratic leader, with regard to \nthe gas tax, I know he would want to consult with others, the outline I \noffered, the technical amendment, and an amendment by either the \nDemocratic leader or his designee or the majority leader or his \ndesignee with regard to the gas tax, that would probably be something?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We have a couple of different approaches that our \ncolleagues have considered with regard to ensuring that the benefit \nactually be provided to the consumer. One involved an accounting \nmechanism, that I would allow that to happen. Another involved a \nstraight tax credit. I would have to make some determination that my \ncolleagues have an interest in offering both amendments. If that were \nthe case, I would have to come back with an alternative which would \nallow the consideration of at least those two amendments. This \nunanimous-consent agreement only allows for one amendment. That is \nsomething we would have to work through.\n  Certainly, the offer is--I take it in good faith. I think I would be \nin a position to respond in the not-too-distant future to that \nparticular unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think we could probably work out the addition or another \namendment if that would help us reach an agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think it might.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to emphasize again, and I know the Democratic leader \nunderstands this, it would really be good if we could get an agreement \non this and find some way to move it quickly for the benefit of all \nAmerican people. We would have liked to do it now before Memorial Day \nor as soon as we can. We think that would be a very, very positive \nthing for the American people and for the economy.\n  Now, on the TEAM Act, is there something more that the Senator from \nSouth Dakota would want on the TEAM Act? We do not include any \namendments here, but we are anxious to have this issue considered. As \nthe saying goes, ``Let's talk.'' We would like to see if we can talk \nabout how we get this done and encourage talk between employers and \nemployees. Do you have any alternative you would like to suggest with \nregard to the TEAM Act?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I say, I think there are a number of amendments, or \nperhaps just one substitute amendment that we would like to offer. We \nhave not had the opportunity to come to closure on that. I do think \nthat also could be agreed upon in the not-too-distant future, perhaps \nas early as the week we get back. That is the timeframe for the number \nof amendments we would want to offer. I suspect that one, perhaps a \ncouple of amendments, would be all we have a need to offer, but we \nwould certainly want to be able to amend the bill as it is currently \npresented.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Democratic leader will give us a response on that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I sure will.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will ask for a modification with regard to the minimum \nwage that would go something like this, if I could go over it. We will \ngive this to the minority leader at the conclusion of our exchange \nhere. We could also probably get approval from the majority leader. We \nask consent for the following disposition of S. 295: That the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3448, which is the House-passed \nbill regarding the minimum wage, and it be considered under the \nfollowing restraints. One hour on the bill to be equally divided in the \nusual form; one amendment in order to be offered by the majority leader \nor his designee; one amendment in order to be offered by the Democratic \nleader or his designee. That the amendments be offered in the first-\ndegree, and 1 hour each to be equally divided in the usual form; no \nmotions in order other than a motion to table, and following \ndisposition of amendments and closing of time, the bill be advanced to \nthird reading, and final passage occur without further debate \noccurring.\n  Again, I am trying to see if we cannot find a way to make all three \nof these very important issues be considered by the Senate. We could \nget the gas tax up, in a way that three or perhaps four amendments \ncould be offered. The TEAM Act, if the Senator from South Dakota has a \nsuggestion of an amendment on that, perhaps we could work it out, and \nwe also offer this additional proposal with regard to minimum wage.\n  I think if this package is going to come up, actually, the majority \nmembers would like to have an opportunity to offer an amendment, \nperhaps, in that area. Before we got a complete agreement here, I want \nto make sure the majority leader is totally satisfied with the response \nthat we get here, and also that our people are comfortable with that \narrangement. Would that help with regard to the minimum wage?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi has given us \nan opportunity here, I think, to move the minimum wage bill. As he is \nfully aware, this minimum wage package includes quite an elaborate \narray of tax provisions for small business.\n  A number of our colleagues, as I understand it, on both sides of the \naisle have expressed some interest in taking a closer look at those \nprovisions, with an expectation that they may want to modify them or \nadd to them. It is largely a concern for that aspect of the legislation \nthat would cause me to be somewhat concerned about whether one \namendment would allow an adequate opportunity for our colleagues to \naddress the tax provisions.\n  So we will have to consult with our colleagues, and I am sure the \nmajority whip may find the same need, as he just has indicated, to \nconsult not only with regard to the minimum wage provisions, but the \ntax provisions as well. We are getting closer. Clearly, this is \nencouraging. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, we can come to \nsome resolution. This is another step in the right direction. I \nappreciate the offer made by the whip, and we will respond as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, with regard to the minimum wage, of \ncourse, we do have an interest in the tax provisions passed in the \nHouse. I know members of the Finance Committee want to take a look at \nit. Hopefully, within the next 10 days they can do that.\n  The idea is, surely, to try to help the small businesses that could \nbe impacted in such a way that their profit margin could evaporate, or \nthey could wind up laying people off. We do not want that. We are \nworried about the human impact, people at the entry level in small \nbusinesses that could wind up losing their job, or not getting that \nfirst job. We hope these tax provisions help soften that blow. We would \nlike to make sure that that, in fact, is what happens. As the minority \nleader suggests, we may want to consider adding some more or taking \nsome out on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, again, we have some important work to do in the \nremaining three legislative months of this year. We are very anxious, \nnow that we passed a budget resolution yesterday, to get that \nconference completed and move on to the reconciliation bill, so that we \ncan have Medicaid and welfare reform and other spending savings, so \nthat we can give some tax relief to the American people.\n  In order to get all that done, including defense authorization, I \nknow we need to clear up these issues. I know the minority would be \ninclined to offer amendments that would wind up bogging down other \nbills, and if we can find a way to break the legislative\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\ngridlock, in a cooperative way, and get the job done in the best \ninterests of the American people, I think the American people would see \nthat very positively. I want to see if we can find a way to make that \nhappen.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me express enthusiastically my desire \nto work with the whip to make that happen. I only lend one small piece \nof advice if he is desirous of making that happen sooner rather than \nlater. We could simply take the defend America bill off of the calendar \nfor now--put it back on the calendar, I should say--or, obviously, we \nare back into a cloture vote at 2:15 on Tuesday. We can avoid that \ncloture vote and go right to these bills and debate them. I do not \nthink there is any desire on our part to unnecessarily extend the \ndebate. We do have some amendments, as I have indicated. I think we can \nresolve these matters one by one and have a very productive week when \nwe get back. That might be time much better spent than to have \nadditional cloture votes on the so-called Defend America Act. That is, \nobviously, a matter that my colleagues on the other side, the \nleadership, are going to have to decide. That would be a way with which \nto break the logjam and keep the process moving along. I look forward \nto working with the distinguished whip and the majority leader to see \nif we can resolve the matters in the not-too-distant future.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The distinguished majority \nleader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5645-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will just say a word or two, and I will \nmake a unanimous-consent request. Three days ago in Wisconsin, I \noutlined my welfare reform plan. Let me be as clear as I can about what \nit contains. There are five principal points.\n  I mean every able-bodied welfare recipient to find work within 2 \nyears, or a shorter period of time if the State so desires.\n  I mean a real 5-year lifetime limit on welfare payments with few \nexceptions.\n  I mean making certain that illegal noncitizens are ineligible for all \nemergency benefits.\n  I mean giving States the ability to stop payments to unmarried teens.\n  And, above all, I mean trusting the Nation's Governors with the \nflexibility they need to establish the laboratories of our democracy.\n  I think it is fair to say that there are different approaches. \nEverybody wants welfare reform. I think the President and I have a \ndifferent approach. It will be debated--maybe after my departure from \nthe Senate--and I hope there is some way to work out welfare and \nMedicaid as a package and have that signed by the President.\n  We are witnessing in the inner cities out-of-wedlock births as high \nas 80 percent. Most Americans believe, I think, that able-bodied people \non welfare should work if there are jobs, and the President indicated \nyesterday that, in effect, he said he would take our suggestions. I am \nnot certain he has had an opportunity to read the bill. It was \nintroduced a couple of days ago. If he does agree with my five \npositions, which I just stated--I do not think they are consistent with \nhis views. In fact, I will indicate for the Record that he has a \ndifferent view on almost each of the five.\n  Governor Thompson and four other Republican Governors wrote to \nPresident Clinton, ``Without national welfare reform for all 50 States, \nthe cycle of poverty goes on--for instance, the number of single women \nhead of households in poverty has increased by 175,000 since you, Mr. \nPresident, took office.''\n  No doubt about it, we must stop the plague of out-of-wedlock births \nin our inner cities, which is as high as 80 percent in some areas.\n  We must give all able-bodied Americans a chance at the American work \nethic.\n  We must reform welfare. President Clinton is not doing this. As we \nall know, he has twice vetoed welfare reform passed by Congress. I \nwonder if he is willing to deny the American dream to another \ngeneration of Americans.\n  President Clinton yesterday suggested my five positions outlined \nabove were very consistent with his. They are not. The President \nsuggested that Congress pass my welfare reform plan and the he will \nsign it.\n  I am ready to move on my plan. I offer the following unanimous \nconsent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5647-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nturn to the immediate consideration of the bill, which I now send to \nthe desk re welfare, and it be considered under the following time \nrestraints: 1 hour on the bill to be equally divided in the usual form; \nno amendments or motions in order; and that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to third reading and final \npassage to occur, all without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, reserving the right to object. The last \ntime the Senate considered welfare reform, as you know and the majority \nleader recognizes, it took over 10 days. We had 200 amendments offered. \nThe Senate conducted 42 rollcall votes in relation to that particular \nbill--all of this on a piece of legislation with close to 700 pages. I \ndo not know if everybody had the opportunity to see the catalog effect \nthat that bill has as you carry it to the desk. But this is the \nconference report from that bill. It is 693 pages long. There were a \nlot of amendments. Ultimately, as the leader recalls, there was a \npretty broad bipartisan support for the bill, after all that work was \ndone.\n  So I do not know that we might be able to agree to what he has \nsuggested now.\n  But in light of what he has suggested, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe majority leader amend his request to provide that the Senate turn \nto the consideration of the welfare bill as the first order of business \non Monday, June 3, and that the motion to proceed to the missile \ndefense bill be delayed until the completion of the welfare bill, so \nthat we might finish it while he is still here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the leader modify his request?\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I object to that. But I indicate that we \nhave talked about minimum wage, we have talked about welfare reform, \nand we have talked about repeal of the gas tax, which we hoped to have \ndone before the Memorial Day recess in order to save millions of \nAmericans a lot of money. We did not quite get it done.\n  I am perfectly willing, if we can work out some agreement. My point \nis that the President says he likes this bill. He said, ``Send that \nbill down here and I will sign it.'' He is going to have a week to look \nat it--the Memorial Day recess. It will be printed, and it will be \navailable. I believe the Democratic leader will find that there are \neven more generous provisions in the bill that passed this body by a \nvote of 87 to 12, and it would have been 88 to 12 except Senator \nHatfield from Oregon was ill that day.\n\n  So we have tried in this bill to accommodate many of the concerns the \nGovernors raised, from both parties. We believe it is a good bill. The \nPresident said it is a good bill. At least that is what he said \nWednesday in Wisconsin. I am just trying to accommodate his wishes. But \nI cannot agree with all of the other matters pending.\n  We may decide on the missile defense, if we can work out some broad \nagreement to put it back on the calendar. I think we could dispose of \nthe other three next week--the week we are back, the last week I will \nbe in the U.S. Senate. It would certainly be agreeable with me.\n  So I will try to work with the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Regrettably, we object at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5647-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5647-S5648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1823\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to expedite waiver approval for the ``Wisconsin \nWorks'' plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    The Wisconsin Works Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill assist the President of the United States in carrying out a \npromise he made to the people of Wisconsin that he would approve the \nWisconsin Works program. There have been some problems getting welfare \nactually acted on. I had a very nice letter from the President last \nyear for the work that we did on the welfare reform bill. But that \nmeasure got vetoed and so did a subsequent measure.\n  Now, the President has said that he supports the welfare reform \ndemonstration project in Wisconsin, known as Wisconsin Works. Well, \ntoday, on behalf of myself, Senators Coats, Abraham, Gramm of Texas, \nAshcroft, Craig, Coverdell, Grassley, Gregg, Santorum, Faircloth, and \nNickles, I am submitting a very brief bill, which, in substance, says \nthat when waivers are submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Health \nand Services to conduct a demonstration project known as Wisconsin \nWorks, those waivers shall be deemed approved.\n  We have heard many stories about the need to reform welfare, Mr. \nPresident, and one of those stories that has been repeated recently is \nthat of an experiment in Sedalia, MO, where applicants for food stamps \nwere sent to an employer. Many of them took jobs, which is good. It \nmoved them off public assistance. Those who were turned down because \nthey were not capable could stay on public assistance. Those who \nrefused to show up were taken off of the food stamp rolls. So there was \nan incentive for those who did not want to work. Two people went for \nthe job, but they were turned down because they tested positively for \ndrugs.\n  Under existing Federal law, the State of Missouri could not sanction \nthose people, even though they were turned down for a job because they \ntested positive for drugs. The simple point of that is that that \ncreates the most perverse of incentives--the incentive for people who \nare on public assistance and who do not want to have to take a job to \nget on drugs and they can stay on the public assistance rolls.\n  That is the kind of thing that needs to be changed. That is why we \nneed welfare reform. Today, Mr. President, I am simply acting to \nexpedite one of the many waivers now pending from the States, which has \nbeen delayed, I understand from the Governors, an average of 210 days. \nThis measure, if and when adopted, will deem the waivers submitted by \nthe State of Wisconsin to be approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5648-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5648-S5649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House had \npassed the\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nfollowing bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3448.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to permit the \nSecretary of Agriculture to waive the prohibition on the termination of \nconservation reserve contracts for certain lands, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n  the conservation reserve program contracts modification act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to make \na minor modification in the rules applicable to the early termination \nof Conservation Reserve Program contracts. This bill will provide \ngreater flexibility in the management of CRP acreage and increase \nopportunities for livestock production using land that has been \nenrolled in CRP, while continuing to protect against soil erosion and \nto conserve the natural resource base.\n  The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \nestablished a new early termination option for holders of CRP \ncontracts. Participants who entered into a contract before January 1, \n1995, may terminate the contract at any time if the contract has been \nin effect for at least 5 years. Certain lands considered to be of high \nenvironmental value are not eligible for the early termination option. \nThe act specifically disallows the early termination of contracts on \nland having an erodibility index of more than 15, a restriction that \nalso was included in the rules for the early CRP termination option \noffered this spring through administrative action independent of the \nfarm bill.\n  The restriction on early removal of the more highly erodible land \nfrom the CRP is obviously designed to reduce the potential for \nreturning land to crop production where doing so presents a higher risk \nof damaging levels of soil erosion. Of course, a principal purpose of \nthe CRP was to remove highly erodible land from production in order to \nconserve soil, so it is reasonable to ensure that early terminations of \nCRP contracts do not nullify the benefits of the CRP or negate the \ninvestment in conservation made by taxpayers through CRP payments.\n  While the prohibition against early termination of contracts on land \nhaving an erodibility index higher than 15 seems reasonable in general, \nit does not take much sense to livestock producers who would like to \nremove land from the CRP in order to use it for haying or grazing. The \nnationwide emergency release of CRP for grazing and haying has relieved \na good deal of the concern regarding access to CRP acres for livestock \nfeed--but only for this year. There is a real need for a longer term \nresolution of this matter.\n  My bill would simply allow the Secretary to waive the restrictions on \nthe types of land that may be removed from the CRP under the early \ntermination option if the Secretary determines that the land will be \nused only for haying, grazing or other use not involving the \ndestruction of vegetable cover. By ensuring that the vegetable cover is \nnot destroyed, protection against soil erosion will be maintained. In \naddition, any such waiver can be made only if the Secretary determines \nthat the land will be used only in a manner that adequately protects \nthe natural resource base. As discussed, the waiver authority contained \nin this bill is designed specifically to deal with the prohibition \nagainst early termination of CRP contracts on land with an erodibility \nindex higher than 15. There may be some other instances in which a \nwaiver meeting the requirements of this bill could be granted, but they \nwould be tightly limited by the requirement that vegetable cover not be \ndestroyed and that the natural resource base be adequately protected.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a commonsense solution that will provide \nmore reasonable options to CRP contract holders for returning land to \neconomic use while maintaining vegetable cover and protecting the \nnatural resource base. I hope my colleagues will support this \nlegislation and that it will be enacted at the earliest opportunity. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on a \nbill that overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives this week. \nThe vote was 414 to 10. The bill I refer to is the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996.\n  The bill is a collection of tax incentives for small businesses. As \nevery Member of this body knows, small businesses create the lion's \nshare of jobs in America. The bill will lift some of the heavy tax \nburden borne by small businesses. To the extent we lift the tax burden \non small businesses, these businesses will be able to continue to \ncreate jobs for Americans. Included in the bill are some proposals that \nwere contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  First, an increase in the amount of equipment a small business can \nexpense; the current annual amount of $17,500 would be gradually \nincreased to $25,000.\n  Second, a package of proposals to simplify the pension tax rules. \nThese proposals will bring more small businesses and their workers into \nthe pension system; in addition, these proposals will enhance pension \nsecurity for millions of American workers and their families.\n  Third, a series of proposals to reform the subchapter S corporation \ntax rules. Almost 2 million small businesses do business as subchapter \nS corporations.\n  This package of small business tax incentives is fully paid for.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Bill Archer for successfully \nshepherding this package of much-needed tax relief through the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In recent days, many of my colleagues have asked me about Senate \naction on this bill. When the bill arrives from the House, I expect the \nbill to be referred to the Finance Committee. Once referred to the \nFinance Committee, I anticipate taking action on the bill shortly after \nthe Senate returns from the Memorial Day recess.\n  Mr. President, the Finance Committee, including longstanding members \non both sides of the aisle, has a tradition of sensitivity to the needs \nof small business. I intend to continue that tradition with a Finance \nCommittee imprint on the small business tax bill.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am also considering adding measures to \nhelp create economic growth, promote savings and investment, and \nenhance economic opportunities for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5650-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5650-S5651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         A CRACKDOWN ON IMMIGRANTS IS RESTRICTING SCHOLARSHIPS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I cast one of the few votes against \nthe immigration bill that passed the U.S. Senate recently. And I did it \nbecause part of the bill simply goes too far. We are in a period in \nwhich there is a great deal of mean-spirited and anti-immigrant \nsentiment, a mean-spiritedness and sentiment that does not serve the \nNation well.\n  For example, my amendment to permit people who are illegal \nimmigrants, and who are going to become citizens, to get student aid \nthat is available to all American citizens, is just common sense.\n  We want these future citizens to be productive members of our \nsociety.\n  The bill that passed the Senate not only denies them that assistance, \nbut can be the basis for deportation if they receive that aid for one \nyear.\n  Two items have appeared recently that should cause us to reflect a \nlittle more.\n  One is an op-ed piece in the Chicago Sun Times, by a member of the \neditorial board, Tom Sheridan.\n  The other is an article titled ``A Crackdown on Immigrants Is \nRestricting Scholarships'' by Dirk Johnson that appeared in the New \nYork Times. I ask that both articles be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  Both suggest that we are being short-sighted in what we are doing.\n  I urge my colleagues to read these two items if they have not done \nso.\n  The op-eds follow:\n\n                           Foreign Treasures\n\n                           (By Tom Sheridan)\n\n       First, an explanation. I'm half-Irish on my father's side. \n     Third generation. My mother's ancestry is more muddled, \n     though European. My wife is half-Italian (third generation), \n     with the rest mostly German.\n       With that mix, our kids would be a diverse lot. But we also \n     have children who are Filipino (first generation) Hispanic \n     (second generation) and Asian.\n       What I've done to enrich the Sheridan family gene pool is \n     nothing less than remarkable. It's the same way families--and \n     Nations--are enriched: Each of us has ancestors who came from \n     somewhere else.\n       All of which makes me very impressed with people becoming \n     U.S. citizens these days. And damn glad I was born here and \n     didn't have to take the citizenship test. I might not pass \n     it.\n       A study question for the citizenship test: How many changes \n     or amendments are there to the U.S. Constitution? Do you \n     know? Without looking?\n       There's a lot of public yelping these days over \n     immigration--legal and no-so-legal. Illegal immigration is \n     just that--illegal--and should not be tolerated. Congress is \n     right to clamp down on it.\n       But we seem to have confused the two. It has given us a \n     sense of public schizophrenia. On one hand, the folks in \n     Congress have passed legislation making it harder to \n     immigrate--even legally. On the other hand, Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service people are working doubly hard to help \n     people become citizens.\n       Bills rolling through Congress would slow the immigration \n     process. Included in the measure passed by the Senate this \n     month are provisions to sharply limit federal benefits \n     available to legal residents, even as they pursue the process \n     of becoming citizens.\n       It means that legal immigrants couldn't apply for a student \n     loan, a tuition grant (even based on merit) or federal job-\n     training assistance. The penalty is deportation. Even if a \n     legal immigrant gets help, and later seeks citizenship, the \n     reward would be deportation.\n       Should we tolerate legal residents who perform acts of \n     terrorism against the United States, or threaten its society \n     with acts such as drug-smuggling? Of course not. But under \n     the recent Terrorism Act, a legal resident who has been a \n     successful member of society\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\n     for years and ran afoul of the law would be deported.\n       That's hardly a welcoming gesture. It would make me wonder \n     whether our nation, which has traditionally embraced all \n     classes of people, really wanted me.\n       It screams election-year propaganda: ``Look everybody; look \n     how tough we are.'' Such tough talk is phony. But only three \n     senators, including Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, saw it that way \n     and voted against it.\n       All of which brings me to the act of becoming a citizen, \n     which more than 19,000 people did through the Chicago INS \n     office last year. Five times that many will take the oath to \n     support and defend the United States this year.\n       Test question: What amendment addresses or guarantees \n     voting rights?\n       Citizenship USA, an INS project, took over 18,000 square \n     feet of the old Sears store on State Street on April 30. \n     Workers are processing at least 800 people a day to work \n     through a backlog of citizenship applications. In the 12-\n     month period ending this fall, INS officials expect that an \n     amazing 60,000 new citizens will have been naturalized in \n     Chicago. That's wonderful.\n       The next celebration of citizenship will take place May 24 \n     in the International Amphitheater, where 10,000 new citizens \n     from scores of nations around the world will be sworn in.\n       Question: Why did the Pilgrims come to America?\n       Answer: For religious freedom. And a better life.\n       That's something we should keep in mind when we put up \n     roadblocks to the process that enriches us as a nation. \n     Immigration certainly enriched me.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         A Crackdown on Immigrants Is Restricting Scholarships\n\n                           (By Dirk Johnson)\n\n       Edgar, WI, May 9.--Vying to attend a prestigious camp for \n     patriotic young Wisconsin scholars, one student's resume \n     sparkled above the rest: a 16-year-old who earned straight \n     A's, played violin, spoke French and displayed an interest in \n     government.\n       But the girl, Pang Thao, a junior at rural Edgar High \n     School, has been rejected by the camp's sponsor, the American \n     Legion Auxiliary, because she is not a United States citizen, \n     even though she will become one in a matter of months.\n       ``Rules are rules, and unfortunately she's not a citizen,'' \n     said Eileen Knox, a spokeswoman for the Auxiliary. ``There \n     are lots of American-born girls who are still waiting in the \n     wings, hoping they can be chosen.''\n       The rejection of Pang, who immigrated with her parents when \n     she was two months old, follows a similar incident in Texas \n     earlier this spring. The Houston Stock Show and Rodeo awarded \n     a $10,000 scholarship to a Texas honors student, only to \n     withdraw the prize after learning the winner was not a United \n     States citizen.\n       When it comes to anger toward immigrants and their \n     children, a growing sentiment by almost any measure, \n     Americans usually complain about unskilled and illiterate \n     newcomers putting a drain on budgets and services.\n       But the rejection of the two young scholars, immigration \n     advocates say, illustrates a wellspring of resentment against \n     those who can compete, perhaps too well.\n       ``On the one hand, we encourage assimilation and \n     achievement,'' said Lucas Guttentag, a lawyer who specializes \n     in immigration for the American Civil Liberties Union, ``and \n     we say we want immigrants to learn the values of American \n     society. But then we turn around and exclude these people \n     from the very institutions that imbue those values.''\n       The tough immigration bill passed overwhelmingly by the \n     Senate, for example, would deny college financial aid to \n     legal immigrants who are not citizens.\n       For Pang, the talk of policy and politics can be reduced to \n     something very basic. ``There are a lot of people out there \n     who don't like me,'' she said the other night, while on break \n     from her job as a waitress at here parents' restaurant. \n     ``They don't know me. But they don't like me.''\n       In fact, Mr. and Mrs. Thao were among the thousands of \n     Hmongs driven by Communist forces from Laos for helping the \n     United States in the Vietnam War.\n       Pang is an exceedingly polite teenager who seems to bend \n     over backwards to avoid sounding like a complainer. But she \n     hears plenty of the stereotypes about minorities: ``They get \n     more welfare. They don't pay taxes. They're not loyal to \n     America.''\n       She has found herself saying in a flash of defensive anger: \n     ``Man don't you understand, I'm here because of you. I'm here \n     because my relatives and my ancestors helped the Americans in \n     the war.''\n       Her parents, Long, 38, and Chong Thao, 38, delayed starting \n     the citizenship process until last year. ``It is hard to let \n     go when you come from another country,'' said Mrs. Thao. \n     ``It's a part of you. But over time, we understand. This is \n     our home country now. We are Americans.'' They run the Thai \n     Cafe in a strip mall in Wausau, a city of 37,000 in central \n     Wisconsin with a sizeable Hmong (pronounced mung) population. \n     Pang works nights and Saturdays.\n       Mrs. Thao also works full time as a caseworker for the \n     Marathon County Welfare Department. In addition, the family \n     raises ginseng in the fields around their farmhouse here, \n     about 20 miles west of Wausau.\n       The family, with six children, struggles financially. But \n     the parents remember life in the refugee camp in Thailand. \n     ``The refugee camp was hell,'' Mrs. Thao said. ``Not enough \n     food. Poor sanitation. Hot. A lot of sick children. Many \n     died. We were lucky.\n       Pang and her parents have been careful not to criticize the \n     American Legion. And they have expressed gratitude to the \n     University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, which recently invited \n     Pang to participate in an international conference there in \n     June, as a consolation for her rejection at the Legion camp, \n     Badger Girls State.\n       Those who defend the citizenship rule noted that favoritism \n     for citizens goes back to the nation's founders. They point \n     to the constitutional requirement that the President be born \n     in the United States.\n       ``Citizenship means something,'' said Mrs. Knox, of the \n     Legion Auxiliary. ``On Election Day, you cannot go to the \n     polls and say, `Well, I'm going to be a citizen next week.' \n     ''\n       The disappointment in the Thao family has been keen, \n     although Pang, the oldest child, bristles at the notion of \n     people feeling sorry for her. ``I'm not complaining,'' she \n     said. ``I'm not whining, and I don't need anyone's pity.'' \n     More than anything else about the citizenship issue, she \n     said, she is bothered by the views of those who believe being \n     born in the United States is a virtue. ``I really dislike \n     this idea of some people being superior over others,'' she \n     said. ``Most of the people here are just a mix of \n     nationalities from somewhere else. The difference between me \n     and you is the color of our skin and our background. And \n     that's it.''\n       At the time of the application for the camp, it appeared \n     the citizenship approval might be granted in time. But the \n     shut-down of some Government offices in the Washington budget \n     dispute delayed citizenship applications and doomed those \n     hopes.\n       ``It's all right, Mom, it's really no big deal,'' Pang had \n     said, knowing how badly her mother felt.\n       The students and teachers at Edgar High School, where \n     minorities can be counted on the fingers of one hand, have \n     supported Pang, said Mark Lacke, the school principal.\n       ``She is a very bubbly, smart, popular girl,'' said Mr. \n     Lacke, who had pressed the Legion to reconsider. If the \n     Legion would not budge, Mr. Lacke asked if it would be \n     possible for Pang to attend the camp as an observer, rather \n     than as a delegate. The principal said he would drive the \n     girl there himself, and the school would pay her expenses.\n       ``They got back to me and said there was no latitude,'' he \n     said. ``There should have been some forum for an appeal \n     here.''\n       Pang, who will attend the University of Minnesota after she \n     graduates from high school next year, plans to study \n     architectural design. ``The best schools are in the East, but \n     they're really expensive,'' she said.\n       As Pang helped her harried parents clear tables and deliver \n     orders, she spoke of the financial pressures at home, vowing \n     to claim a piece of the American dream.\n       ``After college,'' she said, ``I'm going make big bucks, \n     help my little sister get in to one of those Eastern \n     schools--one of us has got to.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5650-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5651-S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEMOCRATS BLOCKING REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am disappointed that again today, \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked efforts to start \nto relieve the tax burden on the American people by repealing the 1993 \nClinton gas tax increase. I wish we would have been able to repeal this \ntax today before the American people set off to enjoy the Memorial Day \nweekend and the beginning of the summer driving season.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle had agreed to pass the \ngas tax repeal if the House passed the minimum wage bill in a form \nacceptable to them. Well, Mr. President, the House did pass a clean \nminimum wage bill. Yet, rather than keep their promise and pass the gas \ntax repeal, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have again \nblocked its passage. Time and again we have tried to accommodate them \nand time and again they have backed away from their promises. How are \nwe to help the American people if my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle continue to renege on their promises?\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, that when President Clinton \nraised taxes $268 billion in 1993, he said he was raising them on the \nrich. We knew then that that was not true. Now there is no doubt. \nPresident Clinton has raised taxes not only on the middle class but \nalso on low-income families, and now my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are denying these low-income families tax relief. The truth \nis, Mr. President, that every person who drives a car, who buys \ngroceries, who takes the bus, the train, or a plane has to pay this \ntax. These aren't all rich Americans. In fact, Americans who are hit \nthe hardest by this regressive tax are people at the lowest income \nlevels,\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nthose making less than $10,000 a year. Repeal of this regressive tax, \ntherefore, would benefit all Americans, especially those with modest \nincomes.\n  It is a well-known fact that the 4.3-cents-per-gallon motor fuels tax \nnot only disproportionately affects low-income people, but it also hits \npeople in rural areas harder than it does those in more metropolitan \nareas. President Clinton knows this. In February 1993, just months \nbefore he signed into law the largest tax increase in history, said, \nand I quote, ``For years there have been those who say we ought to \nreduce the deficit by raising the gas tax a whole lot. That's fine if \nyou live in the city and ride mass transit to work. It's not so good if \nyou live in the country and drive yourself to work.'' Despite this \nstatement, the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax increase was enacted. I agree \nwith President Clinton's 1993 statement. People in rural areas should \nnot be penalized because they live in areas that require them to use \ntheir cars and travel longer distances. For example, in my home State \nof Delaware, which contains many rural areas, the average family pays \n$463 in gas taxes per year. This figure includes both State and Federal \ngas taxes. When the 4.3-cents-per-gallon motor fuels tax is repealed, \nthe average Delaware family's tax burden will be reduced by $48--a good \nfirst step.\n  The Clinton gas tax increase did not get a single Republican vote \nbecause Republicans believe in cutting wasteful Government spending, \nrather than increasing taxes to pay for more Government spending. So \nwhile in the scheme of Government programs the 4.3-cents-per-gallon gas \ntax may not seem to be a paramount issue, it represents what separates \nRepublicans from the big Government spenders. While the President \npurports to favor balancing the budget, at best he would do so by \nmatching big spending with high taxes. Our belief is that we should cut \nspending and lower taxes.\n  Mr. President, it is time to give Americans a break from taxes and \nbig Government. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nallow the Senate to move forward, and stop blocking tax relief for \nworking Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5651-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5652-S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMBASSADOR ROBERT KRUEGER\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, our former colleague in the Senate, \nAmbassador Robert Krueger, has been nominated to be Ambassador to \nBotswana after serving as Ambassador to Burundi. A report that he sent \naround to some friends about Burundi is worth reading for anyone \ninterested in that troubled nation.\n  I ask that Ambassador Krueger's report be printed in the Record.\n  The report follows:\n\n             Burundi: An Oklahoma City Massacre Every Hour\n\n        (A Report by Ambassador Robert Krueger, April 24, 1996)\n\n       Summary: The situation in Burundi is more threatening to \n     human life and democracy, with a greater chance for major \n     conflagration, than at any time in the last two years. A \n     European diplomat says that ``if the world gives up on \n     Burundi . . . perhaps a million may die'' there. (End \n     summary.)\n       On the weekend of April 19, Americans mourned again and \n     reflected on the worst terrorist attack in our history: 168 \n     people killed a year ago in Oklahoma City. Television cameras \n     covered the scene; dignitaries spoke on the occasion; and \n     citizens everywhere questioned how terror could strike so \n     unexpectedly, shattering lives in an instant and a sense of \n     security for years.\n       But if we adjust proportionately for the difference in \n     populations, Burundi has an Oklahoma City-size massacre every \n     hour of the day. Burundi's population is only about one-\n     forty-second (1/42) that of the USA. Hence, 4 people being \n     killed in Burundi are numerically equivalent to 168 killed in \n     the USA. Regrettably, a reasonable estimate is that 100 \n     people are killed daily in Burundi; or, four every hour, 24 \n     hours a day.\n       Understandably, cameras in America focussed, on April 19, \n     1996, on Oklahoma City; or on Lebanon, where at least 75 were \n     killed. And world attention naturally follows the camera. \n     Yet, normally there are no international camera crews in \n     Burundi. But the filling continues.\n       This cable is a reminder that in an obscure country in the \n     heart of Africa, the killing is proportionately vastly \n     heavier than what the cameras are covering; or, indeed, than \n     in almost any place else in the world. And as the protagonist \n     of Arthur Miller's play ``Death of a Salesman'' said, \n     ``Attention must be paid.''\n       I recently sent a summary report (Secstate 80807) stating \n     that I had perceived a steady destruction of democracy and an \n     increase in mayhem during my almost two-year tenure as \n     ambassador to Burundi. And the situation now seems to me \n     worse than when the cable was first drafted several weeks \n     ago. Even though I have not been in Burundi for the past 7\\1/\n     2\\ months, and I must rely on the reports of various \n     individuals whom I learned to trust when I was there, I am \n     regrettably but firmly convinced that the situation in \n     Burundi is at this moment more precarious, with a larger \n     possibility of massive bloodshed, than at any time since my \n     arrival in Burundi in June, 1994.\n       In 1994, and often in 1995, visitors would regularly ask, \n     ``Will Burundi be another Rwanda?'' with, of course, all the \n     fears of historically large genocide which the question \n     carries. My response was ``I won't predict for more than two \n     months or so into the future; but, no, we will not have a \n     Rwanda-type disaster in that period.'' And that much proved \n     true.\n       But today, I find that the president of the large political \n     party, Dr. Minani of Frodebu, has openly written in official \n     public documents, just two weeks ago, that the believes \n     Burundi is in a situation like that of Rwanda before April 6, \n     1994, the onset of the deluge. Other Burundi leaders and \n     foreign diplomats with whom I have spoken sound more ominous \n     tones than anything I had heard in Burundi during my time \n     there.\n\n ``The center will not hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.''--\n                               W.B. Yeats\n\n       While the international community and those who support \n     democratic institutions in Burundi have both hoped that \n     political centrists and moderates would gain greater control, \n     the country has instead become increasingly polarized. As the \n     poet Yeats said, writing of another revolution, ``The \n     center will not hold.'' Certainly it has not held in \n     Burundi, and the risk is increasing of mere anarchy being \n     loosed--if not upon the world--then at least upon Burundi \n     and other countries in Central Africa.\n       The president and prime minister no longer travel together, \n     and are said to be openly at odds. The prime minister's \n     party, Uprona, has renewed its periodic call for the \n     president's resignation. Moreover, the divisions are not only \n     inter-party, but intra-party. Many Hutu members of parliament \n     are now more sympathetic with Nyangoma than with their \n     official leadership. And divisions among the Tutsi \n     community--in the army itself, within Uprona, within the \n     various minor parties--are forcing people more and more to \n     the extremes.\n\n\n prime minister tells the populace to defend itself against ``enemies''\n\n       As is well known, the prime minister several weeks ago \n     called upon the population to defend itself against its \n     ``enemies.'' But, as Dr. Minani pointed out in a recent \n     Frodebu announcement, the Prime Minister did not define who \n     those enemies were. That determination was left to the minds \n     of the arming populace. Such calls to self-defense, it is \n     reliably reported, have been repeated in the prime minister's \n     visits to various locations in the countryside. Meanwhile, \n     the FDD and other guerrilla groups have enlarged their \n     attacks. And in face of an impotent civilian government \n     incapable of protecting them, the majority of the population \n     have sometimes given support to guerrillas even as they \n     spread terror.\n\n\n                         immolation and murder\n\n       Consider some of the events of the last several weeks, \n     reported to me from several sources that have proven reliable \n     in the past.\n       (A) In an act of ethnic purification, over Easter weekend, \n     22 Hutu domestic workers were immolated in Nyakabiga quarter \n     in Bujumbura by their Tutsi employers.\n       (B) Reportedly, 50 Hutus, including community leaders, were \n     killed in the city of Gitega: all were members of Frodebu and \n     related Hutu minor parties. The head of the agriculture \n     department for that region and several teachers in secondary \n     schools were among those murdered. The provincial governor \n     has now fled, as have other Hutu political leaders from \n     Gitega, the second-largest city in Burundi. To judge from \n     recent government actions in other provinces, the civilian \n     governor's departure will offer an excuse to replace him with \n     yet another military governor.\n       (C) Even the national radio, known to favor Tutsi \n     interests, and likely to underestimate the killing, has \n     acknowledged that at least 300 people were killed in Gitega \n     province between April 5-12.\n       (D) Tutsi extremists have driven the Red Cross from the \n     city of Gitega so hat it will be unable to witness and \n     possibly report on the carnage.\n       (E) The FDD attacked and killed a large number of Tutsi \n     students in an urban center (the name of which I failed to \n     record).\n       (F) After an attack by the FDD against the army, at Bukeye, \n     on April 10 the army killed more than 30 Hutu civilians in \n     revenge.\n       (G) An official in the security service has confirmed that \n     members of the military are recruiting Tutsi civil servants \n     and students, training them, and issuing them weapons for use \n     against their ``enemies'' in the countryside.\n       (H) A university official has confirmed that a letter \n     circulating now on campus has been signed by over 100 Tutsi \n     students, urging their classmates to stop academic work and \n     take up arms with them against\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n     Nyangoma and his allies (i.e. Hutus) in the Bujumbura \n     quartiers of Mutanga Nord, Kinama, and the countryside.\n       (I) Lt. Col. Nzeyimana Dieudonne, a high-ranking officer in \n     the gendarmerie, was assassinated on 20 April (reportedly by \n     Sans Echec) in Bujumbura.\n       (J) The Hutu parliamentarian Gahungu Gerard, from the \n     Province of Cibitoke--a moderate with a Tutsi wife, was \n     killed by a gunman in Ngagara.\n       (K) On 20 April, at least 7 (perhaps more) Hutus were \n     killed in the Bujumbura quartier of Nyakabiga, having been \n     kidnapped and brought there from other parts of the city.\n       (L) Over 30 Hutus were massacred in the commune of Rutovo \n     by Tutsi militias, assisted by the army.\n       (M) A secondary school (lycee) in Kayanza was attacked with \n     grenades; two students were killed, others injured.\n\n        ``Perhaps a million will die. . .''--a European diplomat\n\n       The above are a few illustrations of what is happening. \n     They form but a fraction of the total picture. I have \n     received reports of fighting during the past two weeks in \n     Bubanza, Gatumba, Ngozi, Mutare, Karuzi, Gitega, Rutama, \n     Bururi, and other locations. One reliable source said that at \n     least 75-80% of the country is currently shaken by violence. \n     A respected Western diplomat told me that every province \n     except Bujumbura was now subject to attack by guerilla \n     forces.\n       Perhaps most poignantly, I was asked by a very experienced \n     European diplomat who once served in the USA and now serves \n     in Burundi, ``Please, I know the generosity of the American \n     people. Do what you can to see that the USA remains \n     concerned. I am afraid, (he continued) that most of the world \n     is about to give up on Burundi. But if the world gives up, \n     there is a risk that not just thousands, but perhaps a \n     million will die in a rage that no one can justify.''\n       I am not suggesting that I expect a million people to die. \n     I do not. And I would be shocked if Burundi suffered carnage \n     on anything approaching that scale. Nor do I believe Burundi \n     has yet arrived at a situation similar to Rwanda on April 6, \n     1994.\n       But when I observe that the president of the majority \n     political party and an experienced and balanced European \n     diplomat foresee such possibilities, it should give us pause. \n     Two years ago, very few people in Burundi used such severe \n     terms. These two would not have. Today, many others might do \n     so.\n       If asked whether I am predicting the imminence of a major \n     civil war I would say: no. But with qualifications. During \n     the months I was present in Burundi, I said confidently that \n     no such event would occur within the next two months. I can \n     no longer confidently say that. I don't know if the \n     probability of such an event is 5%, 10%, 20% or higher. I do \n     know it is no longer an impossibility.\n       Reports from every quarter describe the situation as more \n     precarious than in 1994 or 1995. The capacity of the Burundi \n     populace to absorb horrendous punishment and yet to persevere \n     is awesome, but not infinite. I don't know the trigger point \n     of national rage. And I have only the reports of others, not \n     of my own eyes. But all their eyes see the situation as \n     deteriorating more rapidly than before.\n       An unclassified cable is not the place to explore \n     suggestions for possible ways to address all these problems. \n     Yet, as ambassador, I want without delay and without \n     reticence to offer a partial account of some of the events \n     and attitudes that now prevail in Burundi.

He is both sensible and sensitive.\n  I urge my colleagues to read his remarks, which I ask to be printed \nin the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Radio and Television News Directors Foundation Annual Banquet and \n                   Celebration of the First Amendment\n\n                          (By Howard Stringer)\n\n       This is an interesting moment for any broadcaster to accept \n     an award attached to the 1st Amendment. Just weeks ago, \n     President Clinton and a number of television executives \n     assembled in The White House to collaborate on a ratings \n     system which would measure and proclaim the intensity of sex \n     and violence on their programs. The President endorsed the V-\n     chip as a device that would, ``hand the remote control back \n     to America's parents.'' It would be one small step for \n     broadcasters, but a giant step for viewers. Some observers \n     found the quid-pro-quo a little cynical--free use of the \n     spectrum for digital compression on one side, election year \n     political advantage for the other, but all in all, surely a \n     positive gesture.\n       Some observers are concerned that the government has at \n     least nudged its unholy way into content. Remembering \n     President Nixon's use of the IRS as a weapon against \n     political enemies, some day a President could recognize that \n     in the digital future, whoever controls the chip not only \n     controls V for Violence, but V for Voters.\n       In the near term, I'm more worried that this new political \n     contract will do two things. Firstly, it will engender \n     cynicism if it has no impact at all, and secondly, it will \n     let programmers off the hook, especially if by gladly \n     accepting the V-chip they abdicate further responsibility for \n     content.\n       The cynicism factor is no small consideration. Since I came \n     to America, successive governments have trumpeted a grand \n     solution to whatever ails the country. The war to end \n     communism in Vietnam, the war on poverty, the war on hunger, \n     the war on racism, the war on drugs, all created a level of \n     expectation, only to be followed by let down. After World War \n     II, America became, in Robert Samuelson's words, ``a nation \n     of enthusiastic problem solvers'' with the expectation that \n     everything could be easily solved. When solutions fail, he \n     observed, we sink into an atmosphere of ``free floating \n     gloom.'' The ranks of the cynical grow ever larger.\n       In 1993 I attended hearings on Capitol Hill on the subject \n     of violence. With the valiant exception of Senator Paul \n     Simon, most of my interrogators clearly hadn't watched \n     television, couldn't differentiate between network and cable, \n     and weren't terribly interested in debating the issue on its \n     merits. One Congressman told me that he was going to vote for \n     the V-chip because he was fed up with network news reporters \n     attacking Congressional junkets.\n       On the evening after the hearings, I received a telephone \n     call from that remarkable reporter, Jimmy Breslin. He told me \n     he'd just spent the night in Bedford Stuyvesant, where kids \n     were out on the streets, armed to the teeth, dealing in \n     drugs, joining gangs and dropping out of school. ``Trust me'' \n     said Breslin, ``those kids aren't watching your network.'' Of \n     course he was right. The street kids of urban America aren't \n     glued to ``The Nanny,'' ``Friends,'' ``Touched by an \n     Angel.'' We'd be a lot safer if they were. The gutter body \n     count is more accurately represented in movies like ``Die \n     Hard'' or ``Terminator,'' which are `R' rated, than on \n     television, though even in those movies at least the good \n     guys win and the bad guys lose.\n       Ratings systems are valuable to the child with responsible \n     parents. They're not much of an obstacle to the latch-key kid \n     with nothing but time on his hands. So even if we accept that \n     the V-chip will help some parents, let's not fool ourselves \n     that it will diminish violence on the street. Otherwise, the \n     letdown will, as I've said, promote yet more cynicism all \n     round.\n       My second point is that all of us in the broadcasting or \n     cable or telephone programming community have a higher \n     responsibility that the government cannot and should not \n     enforce. Instead of debating the issue of TV's relationship \n     to violence, let's turn the question on its head. Can we help \n     society fight violence? Can we do more? Bill Moyers said \n     recently, ``What we need is a strategy of affirmation by \n     society as a whole, from homes, schools, churches, synagogues \n     and all the institutions that transmit values.'' What about \n     from our entertainment institutions?\n       There has been violence in great literature and in great \n     drama beyond Shakespeare to the ancient Greeks. Blood is the \n     ink of much theatrical history, but great writers understand \n     great consequences. Villains are doomed. Victims mourned. The \n     audience is taught accountability, responsibility, \n     sensitivity and compassion. It's not enough for the audience \n     to leave the stage or screen just thrilled or amused. The \n     true artist can teach us to care, and of course, to feel.\n       If the sociopaths who parade through our news clips show no \n     remorse, then maybe our entertainment programs should. If the \n     eyes of killers reflect only the chill of arctic wastes, then \n     maybe we should offer warmer vistas. If dozens of people die \n     unrecognized and unmourned in our movies, then maybe we \n     should shed tears for them.\n       If we perceive the loss of life as unremarkable, then the \n     absence of love will also be unremarkable. Death stings, pain \n     hurts, loss devastates, fear terrifies. If we complain that \n     television merely mirrors reality, then let us try to reflect \n     our reality more skillfully and honestly. Violence is not \n     poetic or balletic. It is ugly. Violence inspires more tears \n     than cheers on the streets of our cities. True artists have \n     the power to move not only their audiences, but also their \n     times.\n       America won more than the Cold War. It's also winning the \n     global infotainment war. We export popular culture to the \n     world. With that victory comes some responsibility. We can \n     give audiences only ``What they want'' and cynically wait for \n     the cash registers to ring, or we can challenge our creative \n     minds to reach further into their souls. We can certainly do \n     more than shelter gratefully behind labels, and allow taste \n     to evaporate.\n       In the end industry leaders must take personal \n     responsibility for what goes on the screen. If we separate \n     like church and state, our artistic values from our personal \n     values, then we create programs for others we would not be \n     willing to share with our own family\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n     and friends. If we produce dreadful entertainment just \n     because we automatically assume they, the viewers, will like \n     it, eventually the viewers will turn on us, challenge our \n     cynicism and demand not just the V-chip but the C-chip-C for \n     censorship.\n       The greatest threat to all our hard won freedoms, whether \n     freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press \n     or the right to petition is cynicism. I accept this award on \n     behalf of my colleagues, my collaborators and my comrades, \n     especially those of you I know in this room who are anything \n     but cynical. If all of you are to be custodians of the new \n     world cultural order, then you have a clear duty to try to \n     protect and cherish its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5653-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMON SENSE, R.I.P.\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Jeff Lyon had a brief observation \nunder the title ``Common Sense, R.I.P.'' in the Chicago Tribune \nmagazine, which I ask to be printed in the Congressional Record after \nmy remarks.\n  It comments on the death of 7-year-old pilot Jessica Dubroff, but its \nreal commentary is on our society and what we have permitted.\n  It is worth reading and reflecting upon.\n  The article follows:\n\n                          Common Sense, R.I.P.\n\n                             (By Jeff Lyon)\n\n       Despite what legions of editorial writers have said, the \n     real message in the death of 7-year-old pilot Jessica Dubroff \n     is not that we're pushing our kids too hard, which, it goes \n     without saying, we are.\n       It's that everywhere you look, the perishable human \n     commodity known as common sense has died.\n       Of course, it's absurd that the FAA lets tots fly planes. \n     But it's equally crazy that we can't get a ban to stick on \n     guns that can kill a dozen people in a microsecond. Or that \n     the government is allowed to spend more than it takes in for \n     years, even though any imbecile know what happens when you \n     charge up too much merchandise on your credit cards.\n       An entire generation celebrates sexual promiscuity, then is \n     surprised when the harvest is AIDS, herpes, illegitimacy and \n     marital erosion. An industry that makes billions selling a \n     lethal, highly addictive drug like tobacco claims the stuff \n     is harmless in the face of overwhelming evidence to the \n     contrary and is allowed to get away with it.\n       We pile people into public housing, take the dignity of \n     work away from them and are astonished when the result is a \n     permanent underclass. We put our schools on short rations, \n     then are shocked that our kids think like Beavis and \n     Butthead. We let the rankest, foulest programming spew out \n     over the airwaves and wonder why there is moral decay.\n       There was a time when people recognized that certain \n     behaviors had consequences. It was a lesson that sank in the \n     first time you got sick after Mom warned against eating too \n     many potato chips.\n       But that kind of wisdom has become another casualty of \n     modern life. Maybe moms and dads aren't dispensing it \n     anymore. Maybe moms and dads aren't even home anymore.\n       Whatever the cause, as a society we've forgotten our \n     umbrella and now it's started to rain. Isn't it time we \n     reacquired the sense to go inside?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5654-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 3, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

That vote occur on Tuesday June 4, at 2:15 \np.m., unless we can work out some overall agreement. We would want to \nadd to that--I have discussed this with the Democratic leader--health \ncare reform. That package is in conference. That is something which I \nvery much would like to do that week. I talked to both Senators \nKassebaum and Kennedy, and others. Hopefully, we might add to the list \nthree or four things that we might complete action on that week.\n  If there is not any change, then that rollcall vote will occur after \nthe policy luncheons, I understand, at 2:15.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I do not want to delay the \ndistinguished majority leader, but I would also note that he and I have \nhad the opportunity to discuss the issue of confirmation of judges, and \nI hope that we could continue to work on that and find some resolution. \nI know there is a great deal of interest on both sides in trying to \nfigure out a way to break loose the logjam on what I believe are 17 or \n18 judges that await some action here. A lot of families and a lot of \nfutures are on the line. I am sure that the sooner we accommodate \neveryone's interest, the better it is for everybody concerned.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's interest in trying to resolve that \nmatter as well. We will want to work with him to see that we get that \ndone.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would say to the Democratic leader that if we cannot \narrive at some agreement, I would be prepared to call them up one at a \ntime. If someone wants to vote ``no''--and I understand that at least \none may take some time, one of the nominees. For others, there may be \nrollcall votes. But it seems to me that the Democratic leader is \ncorrect. We should not be holding people up. If we need a vote, vote \nthem down or vote them up, or whatever, but they ought to be voted on \nbecause they probably have plans to make and there are families \ninvolved.\n  So I hope we can reach some accommodation to dispose of those as \nquickly as possible when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/24/senate-section/article/S5654-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1:30 P.M., MONDAY, JUNE 3, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
