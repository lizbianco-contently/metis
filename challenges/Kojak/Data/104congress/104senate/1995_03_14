Mr. President, President Clinton recently issued an \nExecutive order to ban the use of permanent replacement workers during \nlabor disputes involving Government contractors. The Secretary of Labor \nwould have the responsibility to enforce the order by asking Federal \nagencies to cancel existing contracts, or ban violators from future \ncontracts.\n  This Executive order is contrary to current law and, therefore, \nimproper. It will deny to Federal contractors a legal right which is \navailable to all other businesses; namely, the right to respond to \nunion economic warfare by hiring permanent replacement workers. This is \na fundamental legal right of all employers and should not be eliminated \nby Executive order.\n  This administration asserts that the Executive order is simply a \nprocurement policy under the discretion of the President. Yet, Congress \nhas dealt decisively with this issue over the past 4 years by \nconsistently rejecting legislation with the same objective as this \norder. Furthermore, the right to hire permanent striker replacements \nhas been Federal law for 60 years. Let me repeat that--60 years. \nBanning the use of permanent replacements by Federal contractors \nthrough Executive order is an improper intrusion into the province of \nthe legislative branch of Government.\n  This Executive order violates the congressional mandate of Federal \nGovernment neutrality in labor disputes. Current Federal labor laws are \ndesigned to strike a very delicate balance between management and \nlabor. The right to replace strikers is just as much a vital part of \nthat balance as is the right to strike and the right to bargain. This \nbalance has evolved over many years of congressional scrutiny, and this \nintrusion will change the effectiveness of the law without proper \nlegislative action.\n  Mr. President, it is a sad day for our Nation whenever one branch of \nour constitutional form of Government seeks to encroach upon the \nprovince of another. The Kassebaum amendment will prohibit the \nadministration from spending any appropriated funds to implement this \nExecutive order. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and to support cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n   [[Page S3854]] Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I have a response \nto the order currently pending from the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak very briefly on \ntwo points, one involving the framework agreement between North Korea, \nand the other a resolution pending to allow President Li to visit the \nUnited States. It is my understanding that the occupant of the chair, \nSenator Thomas, also wishes to speak briefly on the matter of President \nLi's visit to the United States. I would be willing to relieve him from \nthe chair for the period of time for his statement.\n  If I may proceed, Mr. President, one of the issues I want to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues that is rather disturbing is associated \nwith the United States and North Korea agreed-to framework on nuclear \nissues. There is an agreement that has been entered into by the United \nStates directly with the Government of North Korea. As the President \nwill recall, the framework agreement was signed on October 21 and we \nhave so far had some four senatorial committee hearings covering \nvarious aspects of the framework agreement. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee has addressed it. The Energy Committee has addressed it. The \nArmed Services Committee has addressed it, and the Intelligence \nCommittee has addressed it.\n  In the agreed-to framework, the administration has stressed \nconsistently North Korea's adherence to the terms of that agreement. \nBut I share two specifics with my colleagues concerning recent articles \nthat cast some doubt on North Korea's good faith.\n  First, North Korea is conducting vigorous military exercises at this \ntime. In a March 6 Defense News report, it says:\n\n       North Korea is conducting its most vigorous winter military \n     exercise in recent years, an event that the U.S. and South \n     Korean officials here attribute, in part, to the U.S. \n     shipments of heavy oil authorized under the October 1994 \n     nuclear package deal with Pyongyang.\n\n  Having been in Pyongyang with my colleague, the Senator from \nIllinois, I think we both find this rather distressing and \ninconsistent.\n  I remind my colleagues that the story is referring to the 50,000 tons \nof oil that was paid for with $4.7 million in Department of Defense \nemergency funds. Although not intended, the provision of heavy oil to \nNorth Korea has the perverse effect of strengthening North Korea's 1-\nmillion-man military machine. The story states:\n\n       This year's exercises are significant because of the \n     increased air sorties and a surge in the number of armored, \n     mechanized and artillery corps practicing joint warfare \n     operations.\n\n  I further point out in the March 6 Defense News the following:\n\n       Although U.S. oil is not used directly to fuel military \n     maneuvers, the influx of heavy oil into the country has \n     allowed North Korea to divert other types of fuel reserves \n     from domestic to military use.\n\n  We were assured, Mr. President, by the administration that this would \nnot happen. Well, it has happened. What is our response? Well, the \nUnited States response is to cancel our winter ``team spirit'' military \nexercises with South Korea. I find that very inconsistent. What are we \nfollowing it up with? The preparation to send 100,000 tons of \nadditional oil in October, without safeguards.\n  The second report is that North Korea is not fully cooperating with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. The March 2 Nucleonics Week \nreported:\n\n       Pyongyang categorically refuses to allow the IAEA to \n     reconstruct the history of fissile materials production at \n     its Yongbyong complex.\n\n  The report of Nucleonics Week points out that Pyongyang's refusal to \ngrant access could cause irreparable damage. The North Korean position \nis that the IAEA will have access to the inside of the reprocessing \nplant on or after a 5-year period. But IAEA officials report that \naccess to the inside of the plant before then is paramount. The IAEA \ndoesn't know right now what is going on inside the plant, if there is \nany plutonium separation, or if there are any materials being moved \naround.\n  The second story illustrates the problems with the agreed-to \nframework. We should have had a broader agreement that addressed other \nissues of concern--such as North Korea Army activities; should have \ndemanded access to the two suspected wastesites, complete and total \naccess to past, current, and future nuclear activities--something we \ndemand from all other nations that are a party to the nuclear \nproliferation agreement.\n  We asked South Africa to come clean and they did, but the North \nKoreans have not. We have left the North Koreans, in the opinion of the \nSenator from Alaska, with too many cards in their hands.\n  I have sponsored two specific resolutions, one that is being taken up \nby the Foreign Relations Committee next week, requiring that we show \nprogress on the framework agreement, and one that was accepted last \nweek on the defense appropriations stating that no further funding \ncould take place without the administration coming to Congress for \napproval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3854-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3854-S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RESOLUTION ALLOWING PRESIDENT LI TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a concurrent \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the President of \nTaiwan, Li Teng-hui, be allowed to visit the United States.\n  We submitted this concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution \n9, last week. We had 36 bipartisan cosponsors, some 11 or 12 Democrats, \nand 24 or 25 Republicans.\n  Specifically, the concurrent resolution calls on President Clinton to \nallow President Li to come to the United States on a private visit, as \nopposed to an official state visit. An identical concurrent resolution, \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 33, has been submitted in the House by \nCongressmen Lantos, Solomon, and Torricelli.\n  Why should we simply let the People's Republic of China, our friends \nin China, dictate to us who can visit our country? The current State \nDepartment policy of saying that allowing Li to visit would upset \nrelations with the People's Republic of China offends the Senator from \nAlaska. I think Taiwan has made great strides toward achieving some of \nthe goals that we have achieved in our democracy, such as ending \nmartial law, free and fair elections, a vocal press, and in human \nrights great advancements have taken place.\n  Taiwan is a friendly, democratic, stable, prosperous country and the \n5th largest trading partner of the United States and the world's 13th, \nI might add. They buy twice as much from the United States as from the \nPeople's Republic of China. The largest foreign reserves per capita, \nand contribute to international causes. They are good international \ncitizens.\n  But the United States continues to give a cold shoulder to the leader \nof Taiwan. That leader, I might add, is going to run in a reelection \neffort. It is the first time they have had free and open elections. \nLast May, in Hawaii, the State Department refused to allow President Li \nto visit overnight while his plane refueled, and they indicated they \nwould not allow a private visit. The rationale for that was that the \nPresident was going on to Central America and his plane had to land for \nrefueling. I think it was the worst type of hospitality evidenced by \nthe State Department in some time. We know that the People's Republic \nof China is going to bellow about everything we do regarding Taiwan--\nUnited States pressures at the United Nations on human rights, World \nTrade Organization membership, and anything we do for Taiwan is raised \nas an issue by the People's Republic of China. But, in the end, they \nwill make the same calculation about when to risk offending us on the \nU.S. market.\n  I think that the precedent exists for President Li to visit the \nUnited States. Consider for a moment, Mr. President, that we have \nwelcomed other unofficial leaders to the United States, such as Dalai \nLama, who called on Vice President Gore--over the objections of the \nPeople's Republic of China. Yasser \n[[Page S3855]] Arafat came to the White House ceremony; he was once \nconsidered a terrorist. Gerry Adams has been granted numerous visas \nover British objections.\n  In each case, the administration made direct choices to allow a visit \nto advance America's goals. Li's visit would do the same thing. United \nStates-ROC Economic Counsel Conference will hold a meeting in \nAnchorage, AK. Visiting there would not be a political statement. We \nare almost another country, in the sense that we are a little out there \nin the western northern part of the hemisphere, if you will.\n  What they are asking for here is for Li to visit his alma mater, \nCornell University in New York. They would like him to come up in the \nspring and give an address to the students and faculty. I call on the \nadministration to allow these events.\n  I remind my colleagues, as we address the friction between Taiwan and \nChina, that there are two organizations--one, the mainland People's \nRepublic of China, and one in Taiwan. They meet regularly and discuss \nhijackings and commercial and trade activities--everything but \npolitics. Chinese business men and women are probably the best in the \nworld. They recognize that it is necessary that they maintain a dialog, \nand now we are seeing the opening up of some of the southern ports of \nChina with direct shipment of goods originating in Taiwan. They will \nnot have to go through Hong Kong anymore. So as we look at a stagnant \nrelationship with Taiwan, clearly there is a dialog developing between \nTaiwan and the People's Republic of China. It is time that we allowed \nPresident Li to visit this country.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I see my friend from \nIllinois on the floor seeking recognition. I had the pleasure of \naccompanying him on a recent trip to North Korea and to China, as well. \nI am sure he has some observations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me speak briefly on both the Taiwan \nsituation and the North Korean situation.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor the concurrent resolution of Senator \nMurkowski. I commend him for his leadership on this.\n  We ought to maintain a good relationship, if possible, with the \nPeople's Republic of China, but they should not be permitted to veto \nour standing up for human rights.\n  Senator Murkowski mentioned that when President Lee landed in Hawaii \nat a military base on his way to Costa Rica, he was not permitted to \nstay overnight. The base commander was not permitted to come out and \ngreet him.\n  Is this the President of a dictatorship? We treat dictators better \nthan we treat the freely elected President of Taiwan. Taiwan is doing \neverything that we say a country should do--free press, a multiparty \nsystem, holding elections--and yet we treat them as a pariah. We treat \nthem as they used to treat people with leprosy.\n  It is very interesting what happened in Germany. There were two \nGermanys, and we recognized both Governments. Neither Government was \nparticularly happy that we did it, but it did not prevent the two \nGermanys from coming together. And that should be our attitude toward \nTaiwan.\n  I realize that right now formal recognition is not going to be in the \ncards for Taiwan. But, at the very least, we ought to say to the \nPresident of Taiwan, President Lee, who wants to come over to go to his \nschool reunion at Cornell, who was not permitted to do that last time, \nthat he should be able to come to his school reunion at Cornell.\n  There is also a meeting on United States-Republic of China economic \nrelations. He would like to combine the two. Why should he not be \npermitted to come and attend those?\n  As one Senator, I think our conduct toward Taiwan has, frankly, been \nan embarrassment. If the People's Republic of China squeals some \nbecause we show some deference to the leadership of Taiwan, I think we \njust have to understand that is going to be part of the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3855-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me comment also on the North Korean \nsituation.\n  When Senator Murkowski and I were in North Korea in December, we \nlanded with the first official American plane to land in North Korea \nsince the Korean war. It is important that both the United States and \nNorth Korea live up to our agreements.\n  The situation in Korea is the most volatile anywhere in the world \nwhere there are American troops. We have 36,000 to 37,000 American \ntroops just south of the border in Korea. You have about 1 million \ntroops in total facing each other with no communication. Even in the \nsituation with Pakistan and India, there is communication between the \ntwo Governments. There is no communication between North Korea and \nSouth Korea.\n  North Korea is unlike any other government on the face of the Earth \nright now. It is a very tightly controlled dictatorship. The radio \nstations only have one station. The television stations only have one \nstation. It is like Albania must have been back in the old days of \ncommunism.\n  I think it is important that the United States assist--while making \nclear to South Korea that we are going to be loyal to our friends \nthere--in communication between the two countries.\n  Thanks to President Carter, a meeting had been set up between the \nPresident of South Korea and Kim Il-song, the leader of North Korea. \nThen he died fairly suddenly back in July of last year, and that did \nnot happen.\n  Senator Murkowski and I are working on the possibility of getting \nsome North Korean and South Korean Parliamentarians together, some kind \nof minimal contact, so that there is some understanding between the two \nsides, so that what happens on the other side in both cases is not \nviewed with paranoia.\n  I would add, I think it is extremely important that North Korea \npermit South Korea to build the nuclear plants that we talked about. \nThat was the understanding in the agreement that we had with North \nKorea and they should not back down on that agreement.\n  I hope we can be of some assistance to North Korea, which feels very \nisolated now. It is isolated. It has to make this transition from an \nold-fashioned, extremely monolithic communism to at least a more \nmoderate communism, if their such a phrase, as in China and Vietnam. \nBut I think we can play a constructive role there, and I hope we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3855-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, I certainly thank the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois for noticing the cartoon and for being one of the first \npeople in this body to come to me and say that we do need to prevent \nthis tax cut frenzy if we are going to be serious about balancing the \nFederal budget.\n  I think, Mr. President, now is the time to put the tax cut proposals \nout of their misery. Let us do it early on so the American people know \nthat there is something real to all this rhetoric in \n[[Page S3856]] Washington about balancing the Federal budget.\n  It seems to me, ever since the tax cut frenzy started with the \nNovember 8 election, that I have had a hard time finding anyone who is \nreally for it other than a few folks here in Washington.\n  I have chosen this cartoon from December at Christmastime to \nillustrate how early the people of America were ahead of the \npoliticians on this issue. It is a very simple cartoon. It shows a \ncouple of parents holding a nice present, ``The tax cuts.'' But their \nbaby holds ``The bill.'' The parents are enjoying this nice present, \nbut passing its cost along to the next generation.\n  So even before the 104th Congress convened, I feel that the American \npeople were way ahead on this and felt that this just did not make \nsense and that it did not add up.\n  I sort of felt as if maybe this issue would die pretty quickly, but I \nwas wrong. In a way, this frenzy for a tax cut, which nobody supports, \nis the inevitable result of the November 8 election.\n  In the Milwaukee Sentinel just yesterday, there was an editorial \nentitled ``Tax Cut Plans--Questions About Both Party Plans.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the \nMilwaukee Sentinel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Milwaukee Sentinel, Mar. 13, 1995]\n\n            Tax Cuts Plans--Questions About Both Party Plans\n\n       Bill Archer, the new Republican chairman of the House Ways \n     and Means Committee, strode to the microphone in a basement \n     hearing room after being introduced by a young couple from \n     Virginia holding their year-old daughter.\n       It was just the common touch the Texas congressman was \n     seeking to announce the committee's plan to cut taxes by \n     nearly $200 billion over the next five years, or about $140 \n     billion more than President Clinton has proposed in his plan.\n       Trouble is, both plans butt up against growing popular \n     discontent over the federal deficit, which still will grow by \n     $1 trillion over five years under Clinton's irresponsible \n     budget plan. There also is no indication that Republicans \n     have discovered the magic bullet that will slay the deficit \n     dragon.\n       The reality is that hardly anyone accepts the current \n     political nostrum that Congress and/or Clinton can cure what \n     ails the nation by advocating spending and tax cuts, all at \n     the same time.\n       That even includes prominent Republicans such as Bob \n     Packwood, of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance \n     Committee, and Pete V. Domenici, of New Mexico, who heads the \n     Budget Committee.\n       Both have voiced opposition to tax cuts while government \n     continues to spend more than it takes in. The simple truth is \n     that House Republicans have not yet indicated how they would \n     pay for tax cuts in the $200 billion range and still balance \n     the budget.\n       Still, the Republican plan has some attractive features.\n       A capital gains tax cut, harangued by Democrats as a payoff \n     to the rich, would benefit millions of middle-class investors \n     and, at least in the short term, increase federal revenue as \n     stockholders liquidate some of their holdings. That could \n     help lead to the creation of revenue-producing jobs.\n       Similarly, the suggestion that people could withdraw money, \n     free of penalty, from their individual retirement accounts \n     for buying a home or other purposes is another economy \n     booster. For local government, that's a future source of \n     property-tax revenue.\n       What's confounding about it all is that while Democrats \n     such as Rep. Sam M. Gibbons, of Florida, ranking Democrat on \n     Ways and Means, say it's ``the wrong time and the wrong tax \n     cut,'' you can bet that if it were Clinton and not Archer \n     making a tax cut proposal, Democrats would rush to his \n     banner.\n       The public, however, is far out in front on this issue and \n     can see through both parties' strategies.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to briefly suggest that this \neditorial points out that there is still a problem with both parties \ngoing after this tax cut idea.\n  The article says:\n\n       Bill Archer, the new Republican chairman of the House Ways \n     and Means Committee, strode to the microphone in a basement \n     hearing room after being introduced by a young couple from \n     Virginia holding their year-old daughter.\n       It was just the common touch the Texas Congressman was \n     seeking to announce the committee's plan to cut taxes by \n     nearly $200 billion over the next 5 years, or about $140 \n     billion more than President Clinton has proposed in his plan.\n       The trouble is [the Milwaukee Sentinel says] both plans \n     [both Republican and Democratic plan] butt up against growing \n     popular discontent over the Federal deficit, which still will \n     grow by $1 trillion over 5 years under Clinton's \n     irresponsible budget plan. There also is no indication that \n     Republicans have discovered the magic bullet that will slay \n     the deficit dragon.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say, ``The reality is that hardly anyone \naccepts the current political nostrum that Congress and/or Clinton can \ncure what ails the Nation by advocating spending and tax cuts all at \nthe same time.''\n  So, Mr. President, what the public knew in December has apparently \nnot completely reached the Halls of Congress. Day after day I see \nevidence, whether at a Wisconsin town meeting, or reading the major \nnational newspapers, that in general the American people and the \nopinion makers outside of Washington do not want to do this, and thinks \nit is a foolish way to handle our budgetary problems.\n  This last night I had a chance to see a few minutes of a C-SPAN \nprogram on which two of our colleagues were appearing in front of the \nNational League of Cities, and what they pointed out was that they had \ndifferent views exactly on what should happen in the Federal budget.\n  I was intrigued by the different responses on what they said about \nthe tax cut issue. The junior Senator from New Hampshire, Senator \nGregg, indicated to the audience he was interested in a $500 billion \ndeficit reduction package, to be passed by the 104th Congress.\n  I was struck by that figure, because that is exactly what we have \nalready accomplished in the 103d Congress under President Clinton and \nthe Democratic leadership. I am glad to hear that kind of figure is \nbeing thrown around. What the Senator from New Hampshire then said was \nperhaps as a part of the $500 billion--he would not go with the overall \nRepublican contract idea of a $200 billion tax cut, I believe I am \ncorrectly characterizing his statement that that was too much--but he \nsaid, ``Maybe we would look at the President's $63 billion level, and \nperhaps have that included in the $500 billion.''\n  That got applause. People seemed to feel that was more sensible that \na $200 billion tax cut. But then the Senator from Nebraska, the junior \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, took the microphone and said to \nSenator Gregg, ``Now, how much will it take to balance the budget by \nthe year 2002? What is the total figure?'' And the indication was that \nit was well over $1 trillion.\n  So Senator Kerrey indicated that even if we do the $500 billion, we \nare less than half the way there. Senator Kerrey said to this audience \nof people involved in city government that he was against tax cuts in \nany form.\n  I would think people would maybe nod or maybe even disagree. Instead \nit got a rousing applause. Everyone in the audience gave him a similar \nstrong applause in saying he would fight any of the tax cuts, because \nthey are not consistent with the notion of dealing with the deficit and \ncaring about our children and our grandchildren.\n  So the common sense is out there. The common sense view that frankly \nhelped fuel the debate on the balanced budget amendment and had a lot \nto do with that month-long debate. That common sense is out there.\n  If this institution is willing to listen, the first thing we will do \nis say we cannot afford either the Clinton tax cut or the Republican \ncontract tax cut. Of course, I believe the American public would like \nto have a tax cut if they possibly could. But what they are saying \nclearly is, we cannot afford it until we get our house in order.\n  Mr. President, it is not easy to slay the tax cut dragon. I have \nnoticed the allure of a tax cut to politicians, just as the allure of \nthe balanced budget amendment has been very strong. I would have to \nsay, compared to the first time I had a chance to oppose this in \nDecember, things look a lot better, especially here in the Senate.\n  Between November 8 and now I have gone from being the lone voice, \naccording to the Los Angeles Times, against this to being one of many \npeople who are criticizing the tax cut. In fact, I would call it now \nsort of a healthy competition between a lot of the leading Senators who \nare saying that they will oppose this.\n  I even think there is a good strong competition going on to see who \ncan be \n[[Page S3857]] the toughest on opposing the tax cuts. I think that is \nvery healthy. We do not get anything done around here by being 1 out of \n535. I am extremely happy that so many of the leading Senators, \nespecially on the Finance Committee, have openly stated their \nopposition to either all or part of the tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, as Senators recall, we did have our test vote on this \nissue during the balanced budget amendment. The proposition, that we \nought to put the tax cut below deficit reduction, got 32 votes, \nincluding some of the leading Republicans in the Senate. That was \namazing, because it was 32 Senators saying up front they are not for a \ntax cut.\n  A couple months ago, people would have said nobody would take that \nposition. It was also very striking because a number of Senators told \nme they wanted to vote for the amendment, but they were not going to \nsupport any amendments to the balanced budget amendment. My guess is we \nare a lot closer to 50 or even higher than anyone would have imagined \nat this point.\n  For example, Mr. President, if we take a look at the reaction, we see \nin the Washington Post even today an editorial called ``Greasing the \nTax Cut Rules,'' and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Greasing the Tax Cut Rules\n\n       The President and Congressional Republicans keep saying \n     that to get control of the deficit they have to cut the cost \n     of entitlements. They're right, but even as they've been \n     making the speeches again this year, they're also preparing \n     to change the budget rules to let entitlements partly off the \n     hook.\n       The president and Republicans both want to cut taxes. It's \n     a terrible competition for them to be engaged in; the \n     government is in no position to give up the revenue. As a way \n     of driving home the cost of tax cuts and creating a political \n     barrier to their enactment, the budget rules used to provide \n     that they be paid for either by offsetting tax increases or \n     by entitlement cuts.\n       The administration relished neither alternative, and in its \n     budget suggested a third. It proposed a change--it would say \n     careful rereading--of the rules under which tax cuts could \n     also be paid for by cuts in non-entitlement spending or \n     appropriations. The House Republicans, far from objecting, \n     have adopted the idea with enthusiasm. It sounds as if only \n     accountants should care. If the dollars all come from the \n     same Treasury, as they do, what difference does it make which \n     category of programs is trimmed to produce them? A dollar \n     saved one way is surely as good as another.\n       That's true, and an evasion at the same time. The easing of \n     pressure on the entitlement side of the budget, where cuts \n     are hardest to make because so many people are affected, \n     represented a weakening of budget discipline. The tax cuts \n     the House Republicans propose would cost about $200 billion \n     their first five years and $500 billion the five after that. \n     The Republicans would have found it hard to extract that much \n     from entitlements without getting into the giant programs for \n     the middle class, Social Security and Medicare. As it is, \n     they'll propose to pay half the first-year cost by lowering--\n     again--the caps that the budget rules also impose on \n     appropriations.\n       The pressure will fall on domestic appropriations only, not \n     defense. Most of the programs the government runs fall into \n     this category--everything from Head Start and highway grants \n     to the costs of operating the national parks and \n     administering the Immigration and Naturalization Service--but \n     together they make up only about a sixth of the budget and as \n     a group have already been much cut in recent years. It's \n     relatively easy, of course, to lower appropriations caps. \n     They're an abstraction. The effect will be felt only later \n     and be spread across enough programs so as to leave few clear \n     political fingerprints. The Republicans say not to worry, \n     that sooner or later they're going to have to cut the major \n     entitlements too in order to balance the budget, as they've \n     also promised. But the old rules would have forced the tax \n     and entitlement cuts to be made at the same time. The new \n     ones make it easier to blur the cost of an irresponsible \n     policy.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the point of that editorial is that \nalthough there is this opposition growing in the Senate, there is an \neffort going on to change the budget rules in such a way that would \nallow these tax cuts in a way that would immunize, in effect, both \nentitlements and the defense budget, causing any cuts that might be \nmade to pay for the tax cuts to come, essentially, out of the \nappropriations areas, out of discretionary funding.\n  The Washington Post does a good job of criticizing this move, \npointing out that it does not bode well for the future of deficit \nreduction. They commented on what it would mean, given the need for \nfurther cuts in discretionary spending, on top of the fair amount we \ndid in the 103d Congress. And they noted that not all of those cuts are \ngoing to be applied to reducing the Federal deficit, but instead would \nbe used to promote this tax cut that I am having a hard time finding \nanyone favoring other than those in Washington.\n  So, Mr. President, despite the growing criticism of the tax cut \naround the country and in this body, the skids are being greased for a \nhave-your-cake-and-eat-it-too approach, when it comes to balancing the \nbudget and fixing the tax cut problem.\n  Mr. President, I turn again to a cartoon that I think describes the \nproblem we have here in Washington. This cartoon refers to a new \nillness called deficit attention disorder. We talk about the balanced \nbudget amendment, run around the country saying that a balanced budget \nis the top priority, and we come out here every day and say bringing \nthe deficit under control is our top priority. But this cartoon shows \nthe contrast of those words with the possible actions here. It shows \nfolks running in and out of offices saying, ``$50 billion tax cut, $60 \nbillion tax cut, $75 billion tax cut, $100 billion tax cut, $120 \nbillion tax cut.''\n  The cartoon suggests a serious illness in this place. That is, the \ndeficit attention disorder from which institution suffers. Mr. \nPresident, I think the worst example of this deficit attention disorder \nis the very document that the Republican Party says they campaigned and \nwon on--the Republican contract, which calls for increased defense \nspending, balancing the budget, and tax cuts that dwarf what this \ncartoon suggests. Notice all the little people in the cartoon talking \nabout tax cuts from $50 billion to $120 billion.\n  What the Republican contract calls for over the next 10 years is a \n$700 billion tax cut. What Congressman Archer proposed last week would \ncost $200 billion over the next 5 years. This includes the $500 tax \ncredit for families making up to $200,000 per year, including changes \nin IRA's and a variety of other provisions.\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious example of how, even today, \ndespite all the criticism and all the concern in the other House, the \nother body especially is continuing to move forward as if not only we \ndo not have a deficit problem, but that we have a giant surplus that \ncan be used for all these cuts.\n  Mr. President, on March 10, the Washington Post commented on these \nproposals in an editorial entitled ``The Tax Cuts and the Deficit,'' \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 1995]\n\n                      The Tax Cuts and the Deficit\n\n       The tax cuts from the House Republican ``Contract With \n     America'' have been reduced to legislative form. The process \n     hasn't improved them a bit. They remain a bad idea, the \n     revenue loss from which would be more than the sponsors have \n     acknowledged, and more than a government running a deficit of \n     a fifth of a trillion dollars a year can afford to give up.\n       The cuts would make it harder to reduce the deficit even if \n     the Republicans do come up with a way to pay for them, which \n     despite their pledges they haven't yet. The stated purpose of \n     several of them is to increase savings and investment, but by \n     leaving the deficit larger than otherwise they would reduce \n     the national savings rate. They are also poorly targeted, and \n     the long-term effect of their enactment would likely be to \n     widen the income gap between the better-off and the rest of \n     society.\n       The last time the Republicans cut taxes, in 1981, they \n     failed to make the spending cuts to match, and the deficit \n     soared. This time they've said the spending cuts will come \n     first; they're still saying that. But the only specific \n     spending cuts of any size that they've advanced thus far have \n     been in welfare and other programs for the poor; that's not \n     the way to finance tax cuts. It is said they may next propose \n     some generalized entitlement and appropriations cuts, lump \n     sums that they will commit themselves to saving over time \n     without spelling out how. That's not the way to do it either, \n     the more so because they've promised that in cutting they \n     won't touch defense or Social Security and can't touch \n     interest on the debt. They've left themselves less than half \n     the budget in which to work. Nor is it just their tax cuts \n     that they have to finance. They've said they'll balance the \n     budget as well. But the more spending cuts they dedicate to \n     the first purpose, the fewer they'll have left for the \n     second. That's the problem.\n       [[Page S3858]] The Republicans keep saying they want to get \n     at the cost of entitlements. The last Congress, at the \n     administration's behest, did put a dent in the net cost of \n     the largest entitlement, Social Security, by subjecting a \n     larger share of benefits to the income tax. The bill that the \n     House Ways and Means Committee will begin marking up next \n     week would repeal that modest step in the right direction. In \n     the name of capital formation, it would also cut the capital \n     gains tax, create a new stream of wholly tax exempt \n     investment income by expanding the individual retirement \n     account or IRA provisions in current law, and enact a \n     roundabout cut of as much as a third in the corporate income \n     tax by liberalizing depreciation rules. All three of these \n     provisions would be late bloomers. Two are set up in such a \n     way that they look as if they would even raise revenue in the \n     first years. That masks the full effect that they would have \n     in terms of revenue lost; it wouldn't be felt until after the \n     five-year estimating period. Who will pay for that?\n       These are damaging proposals--and unfortunately, the \n     administration has already weakly concurred in some of them. \n     We suppose they're likely to pass the House. In the Senate, \n     however, some Republicans as well as some Democrats are \n     saying that spending and the deficit should be cut first. \n     They're right.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that article commented on the Contract \nWith America, and specifically the Archer proposal, by saying the \nfollowing:\n\n       The tax cuts from the House Republican ``Contract With \n     America'' have been reduced to legislative form. The process \n     hasn't improved them a bit. They remain a bad idea, the \n     revenue loss from which would be more than the sponsors have \n     acknowledged, and more than a government running a deficit of \n     a fifth of a trillion dollars a year can afford it give up.\n       The cuts would make it harder to reduce the deficit even if \n     the Republicans do come up with a way to pay for them, which \n     despite their pledges, they haven't yet. The stated purpose \n     of several of them is to increase savings and investment, but \n     by leaving the deficit larger than otherwise, they would \n     reduce the national savings rate.\n\n  The editorial also goes into a bit of a history:\n\n       The last time the Republicans cut taxes, in 1981, they \n     failed to make the spending cuts to match, and the deficit \n     soared. This time they've said the spending cuts will come \n     first; they're still saying that. But the only specific \n     spending cuts of any size that they've advanced thus far have \n     been in welfare and other programs for the poor; that's not \n     the way to finance tax cuts. It is said they next proposed \n     some generalized entitlement and appropriations cuts, lump \n     sums they will commit themselves to saving over time without \n     spelling out how. That's not how to do it either, the more so \n     because they've promised that in cutting they won't touch \n     defense or Social Security and can't touch interest on the \n     debt. They've left themselves less than half the budget in \n     which to work. Nor is it just their tax cuts that they have \n     to finance. They've said they'll balance the budget as well. \n     But the more spending cuts they dedicate to the first \n     purpose, the fewer they'll have left for the second. That's \n     the problem.\n\n  Again, it is the harsh reality that the numbers cannot possibly add \nup, it cannot possibly be true that we can do all of these things laid \nout in the Archer proposal and then come up with a balanced budget, \neven in the long term, let alone doing it in the short term.\n  So, Mr. President, not only do we have a deficit attention disorder \nwith regard to the Archer plan and the Republican contract, but time \nand again, whether it be the President's plan, the plan of the minority \nleader in the House, the plan of the senior Senator from Texas, in each \ncase we have a plan for tax cuts that is not paid for.\n  I realize that there will be many opportunities to speak on this \nissue on the floor. I will not take the time today to outline all the \nopposition from different places in the country, whether it be \neditorials or polls or statements of economists. All I can say is that, \nalthough the news is troubling to me, although the tax cut keeps coming \nback and coming back, I see reason for optimism in the U.S. Senate. It \nappears that it is going to be up to the U.S. Senate to stop this \nfiscal irresponsibility.\n  I was very heartened to see the article in the Washington Post of \nlast week on March 9 entitled ``Tax Cutters Lose Steam in Senate.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1995]\n\n  Tax Cutters Lose Steam In Senate; House Panel To Unveil GOP Revenue \n                                  Plan\n\n                            (By Eric Pianin)\n\n       Republican and Democratic opposition in the Senate to major \n     tax cut legislation stiffened yesterday, while Ways and Means \n     Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tex.) prepared to unveil \n     the details of a House GOP tax plan that could cost as much \n     as $700 billion over 10 years.\n       Archer's plan, modeled after proposals within the House GOP \n     ``Contract With America,'' includes a $500-per-child tax \n     credit for families earning up to $200,000 a year, a 50 \n     percent reduction in the capital gains tax, massive write-\n     offs and tax breaks for businesses and a new Individual \n     Retirement Account (IRA) for middle- and upper-income \n     families.\n       The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on the \n     proposal early next week. House leaders have pledged to make \n     offsetting cuts in the 1995 budget and to alter welfare \n     programs and Medicare to pay for the package. But in the wake \n     of the defeat of the constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood \n     (Ore.) and other deficit-conscious Republican tax writers \n     warned yesterday that the tax package would take a back seat \n     to further efforts to reduce the deficit.\n       ``Almost every witness we've had has indicated the deficit \n     is the biggest problem we face,'' Packwood said, ``and if we \n     want to do more for the economy, then reducing the deficit is \n     the most important thing to do.''\n       Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), a Finance Committee member, \n     declared: ``Basically, I'm opposed to tax cuts * * * as much \n     as we love to parcel them out.''\n       Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), another committee member, \n     said the House GOP tax cut proposals ``all sound good,'' but \n     Congress would accomplish far more by reducing the deficit \n     and indirectly helping to lower interest rates and spur \n     economic activity.\n       ``Cut spending and get the deficit under control that's \n     number one,'' D'Amato said. ``That's what people want. \n     Otherwise, [the economy will falter and] we're going to end \n     up Mexico II.''\n       President Clinton and liberal House Democrats also have \n     proposed middle-class tax relief, including tax credits for \n     families and other breaks to help cover educational costs. \n     But the tax-cut fever that swept Washington shortly after the \n     Republican takeover of Congress last November has begun to \n     dissipate, as GOP leaders confront the harsh realities of \n     trying to simultaneously eliminate the deficit and make good \n     on their promise of generous tax cuts.\n       For their part, Senate Democratic leaders feel obliged to \n     emphasize deficit reduction over tax relief after helping to \n     defeat the popular balanced budget amendment last week. \n     Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) told \n     reporters yesterday he would not rule out passage of some \n     type of tax reform this year, but members had little \n     enthusiasm for proposed tax cuts that ``would compound our \n     problems'' in reducing the deficit.\n       ``It's apparent to all of us we have a big job ahead of us \n     in deficit reduction, and we want to make everyone understand \n     that that's our first priority,'' Daschle said.\n       House Republican leaders have cited little empirical \n     evidence that a major tax cut is needed at a time when the \n     economy is strongly rebounding, inflation is under control \n     and the deficit is declining for the third year in a row.\n       Earlier this week, three prominent economists--Roger E. \n     Brinner, Stephen S. Roach and Barry Bosworth--told the House \n     Budget Committee that Congress would do little for the \n     economy while complicating its deficit-reduction efforts if \n     it cuts taxes.\n       Brinner, the chief economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill, described \n     the $500-a-child tax credit, the most expensive measure in \n     the Republican tax package, as ``possibly mediocre politics \n     but definitely bad economics.''\n       House GOP leaders concede that the tax credit would do \n     little, if anything, to stimulate the economy. But they \n     insist the tax credit for children 18 and younger is \n     important to providing relief to the middle class and \n     ``strengthening'' the family unit.\n       Archer is scheduled to announce the details of the GOP tax \n     plan this morning in an address to the conservative Family \n     Research Council. According to committee sources, the package \n     will approximate the Contract With America plan, which \n     according to the Joint Committee on Taxation would cost $200 \n     billion over five years but then balloon to $704.4 billion \n     over a decade.\n       House GOP leaders, including Archer, have said the Contract \n     With America plan was not ``written in stone'' and \n     acknowledge that it may undergo substantial changes once it \n     reaches the Senate. However, House leaders are more concerned \n     about honoring the terms of the contract than developing a \n     plan that is palatable to the Senate.\n       ``We're committed to the contract,'' Archer told the \n     Associated Press. ``We ran on it, we all signed it, and we'll \n     do what we said we were going to do.''\n       Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), a senior member of the Ways \n     and Means Committee, said that it doesn't make sense for the \n     committee to put together a package that might pass muster in \n     the Senate ``but that can't get out of the House.''\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we move into the period where we \nactually take up issues such as the line-item veto and then the budget \nresolution and then the reconciliation package, there will be the \nopportunities to actually make this happen, to actually \n[[Page S3859]] force this institution through the work of the U.S. \nSenate to not waste the funds that could be used for deficit reduction.\n  I suggest that as we move into the budget resolution, either at the \ncommittee level or at the level of the entire Senate, if necessary, \nthat an amendment be offered to the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution \nto change the revenue assumption to exclude or reject a major tax cut \nand instead to explicitly allocate the spending cuts that would offset \nsuch a tax cut to deficit reduction, to make sure that every dollar \nthat was identified for spending cuts be immediately transferred into \nan account to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  I think that is the only way we avoid the kind of losses and deficit \nreduction that are the inevitable result of the President's plan and \nespecially the result of the Republican contract and the Archer plan.\n  So I hope we can return to the wisdom that was indicated by the \nAmerican people ever since the proposals were made, and I return to \nwhat is my favorite cartoon on the issue, which is the somewhat bizarre \nbut rather effective portrayal of a giant deficit monster that is \nconstantly calling out for more and more, in this case more fruit cake \nin the form of ``Tax Cuts R Us.'' The American people are onto the \nfoolishness of this. They are onto it in the form of cartoons that \nridicule a Congress that stands up and talks about fiscal \nresponsibility but cannot resist the temptation to get some quick \npolitical gain by handing out a tax cut that will both hurt the economy \nand severely damage, if not permanently ruin, the possibility of ever \nhaving a balanced budget, whether it be in the next few years or by the \nyear 2002.\n  Mr. President, we will be coming back to this, but I notice in this \ninstitution, if you do not keep bringing something up like this, it has \na way of getting resolved in the middle of the night and, all of a \nsudden, you have an up-or-down vote on the whole package. Somehow, \nwhether it be $10 billion or $100 billion or $700 billion, it could be \nlost instead of actually being used to almost eliminate the Federal \ndeficit. I think that is the opportunity we have. Instead of feeding \nthis monster, reject the tax cuts and take the next big step to \neliminate the Federal deficit.\n  So, Mr. President, as I yield the floor, I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which Senator Bumpers, of \nArkansas, and I have offered to specifically go on record as a body \nsaying the tax cuts have to take second place to this historic \nopportunity to eliminate the Federal deficit.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs to join in the sentiments \nof my colleagues on Taiwan, and particularly on the visit of President \nLee.\n  I need not repeat in detail for the Senate Taiwan's many \naccomplishments, either economic or political. These have often been \ndiscussed on the Senate floor. It is sufficient to note that this \ncountry is our fifth largest trading partner and imports over 17 \nbillion dollars' worth of U.S. products annually. More importantly, \nthough, Taiwan is a model emerging democracy in a region of the world \nnot particularly noted for its long democratic tradition.\n  The Taiwanese Government has ended martial law, removed restrictions \non freedom of the press, legalized the opposition parties, and \ninstituted electoral reforms which last December resulted in free \nelections.\n  Taiwan is one of our staunchest friends. I think every Member of this \nbody recognizes that and accords Taiwan a special place among our \nallies. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the administration apparently \ndoes not share our views. Rather, the administration goes out of its \nway to shun the Republic of China on Taiwan, almost as though it were a \npariah state like Libya or Iran.\n  Sadly, the administration's shoddy treatment of Taiwan is based not \non that country's faults or misdeeds but on the dictates of another \ncountry, the People's Republic of China. It is because the People's \nRepublic of China continues to claim that it is the sole legitimate \nGovernment of Taiwan and because of the administration's almost slavish \ndesire to avoid upsetting that view that the State Department regularly \nkowtows to Beijing and maltreats the Government of Taiwan. If this were \nnot such a serious matter, it would almost be amusing, the lengths to \nwhich the administration goes to avoid any perceived official \nentanglements.\n  Representatives of the Taiwan Government are prohibited from \nphysically entering the State Department or the Pentagon buildings. Any \nUnited States Government employee who goes to work to represent United \nStates interests in Taiwan and who also works for the State Department \nmust first resign from the State Department before being allowed to go. \nOne has to carefully choose what one calls the island's government to \navoid slighting Beijing: Is it the Republic of China, is it the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan, Taiwan, or the Republic of Taiwan?\n  Finally, the last humiliation to which we subject our ally brings us \nhere this morning. This administration refuses to allow the President \nof Taiwan to enter this country, even for a private visit--a private \nvisit, Mr. President. President Lee is a graduate of Cornell University \nwhere he earned his Ph.D. He has expressed an interest in attending a \nclass reunion at his alma mater this June and a United States-Taiwan \nEconomic Council conference. Yet, the administration has made it clear \nit will not permit him entry.\n  The only people that this country systematically excludes from entry \nto its shores are felons or criminals, terrorists, and individuals with \ndangerous communicable diseases. How is it possible that this \nadministration can see fit to add the President of Asia's oldest \nrepublic to the list? We have allowed representatives of the PLO and \nthe Sinn Fein to enter this country, yet we exclude a visit by an \nupstanding private citizen?\n  I think we have made it clear to Beijing--I know I have tried to--of \nthe great importance to us of our strong relationship with that \ncountry.\n This relationship should in my opinion transcend squabbles over \ndiplomatic minutia. I will always seek to avoid any move that the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China reasonably could find \nobjectionable. I believe that countries like ours should try hard to \naccommodate each other's needs and concerns in order to further \nstrengthen our relationships.\n\n  However, I believe that the People's Republic of China needs to \nrecognize the reality of the situation. Both Taiwan and the People's \nRepublic of China are strong, economically vibrant entities. Both share \na common heritage and a common culture and yet have chosen political \nsystems that are mutually exclusive. Despite these differences, the \nUnited States has a strong and important relationship with them both, \nand we need to continue those relationships.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to the unfunded mandates bill. I am proud that we are so close \nto delivering this critical legislation to the nation's Governors, \nmayors, and town managers who have been laboring under the terrible \nweight of unfunded mandates.\n  When the President signs this bill, we will hear a collective sigh of \nrelief from coast to coast. For too long, Congress shifted the cost of \nthese regulations and mandates to the States. Their ledgers bled red \nfrom our actions. Their \n[[Page S3860]] treasuries were sapped to pay for compliance with the \nunfunded mandates that we have foisted upon them.\n  However, with this conference report, of which I was very happy to be \na part, in working out the differences between the House and Senate \nversions of the mandate bill, we are taking an important step in the \nright direction. Equilibrium is restored. The fiscal responsibility \nshifts back where it belongs--with the authors of these rules.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues this is a fair and just \ncompromise. This is a conference report that addressed the unfunded \nmandates problems head on. This is a conference report all of us can \nsupport no matter on which side of the aisle we sit. I wish we could \napproach more of the business of the American people in such a \nbipartisan manner as we have addressed this in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  In closing, Mr. President, it is my opinion that the conferees did an \nexcellent job knitting together the two different bills in this \ncoherent and seamless package. We compromised without sacrificing the \nmuscle and teeth of the Senate bill.\n  From my point of view as a Senate conferee, I was most pleased that \nthe judicial review process was kept to a minimum. The current wording \nis certainly far more restrained than the broad House language which \nwould have provided a field day for lawyers. Their loss is our gain, \nthank goodness.\n  I would also point out that the conference report maintained the \namendment sponsored by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \n[Mr. Byrd]. The language forces Congress to vote on an agency's \ndecision on whether or not it can implement a mandate with the money \nappropriated. This conference report gives Congress the last word, to \nwhich I say ``amen.''\n  Mr. President, one of my favorite Presidents, Harry Truman, was \nfamous for the sign on his desk that said, ``The buck stops here.'' We \ncan learn a lot from those words. For too long, Congress has been \npassing the buck to the States. For too long, we have been passing the \nbuck and passing the bill. It is time we took responsibility for our \nown actions. It is time we pulled the plug on unfunded mandates. It is \ntime we passed this conference report, and I hope we will today.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of any time remaining, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand that the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee has received all the necessary paperwork from \nthe administration for Dr. Henry Foster's nomination for U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral. I rise today to encourage the committee to move Dr. Foster's \nnomination expeditiously, and I look forward to his receiving a full \nand fair hearing.\n  Unlike some of my colleagues, I am very excited about Dr. Foster's \nnomination. Dr. Foster is an ob/gyn. I appreciate, and want to stress, \nthe importance and relevance of his practice area. For far too long, \nwomen's health concerns have been neglected by our Government.\n  Women's health is critical to very family--every man, woman, and \nchild--in this Nation. As a woman, and the mother of a son and a \ndaughter, I find the selection of Dr. Foster reassuring. It is \nespecially important at this time that President Clinton chose to \nnominate a physician who has dedicated his life to maternal and child \nhealth.\n  Dr. Foster is one of the country's leading experts on preventing teen \npregnancy and drug abuse, as well as reducing infant mortality.\n  Dr. Foster is a very decent and dedicated physician who has been \nunfairly maligned. I hope my colleagues and the American public will \nhear the stories of some of the many people whose lives Dr. Foster has \ntouched.\n  I hope they get a more complete picture of Dr. Foster and the work he \nhas done.\n  For example, Dr. Foster worked tirelessly to help bring Christopher \nHight into this world. Jeannette Hight and her husband Charles almost \nlost their baby twice during her pregnancy, but Dr. Foster helped nurse \nher through these crises.\n  Earlier this year, Jeannette and Charles Hight wrote to Dr. Foster:\n\n       Without you, there would not be a Christopher Hight. Your \n     talents and work have brought joy to our lives. You will be \n     proud to know that your extraordinary efforts resulted in us \n     having a son who is excelling at Rice University in \n     architecture. His teachers, who are nationally renown, have \n     told us that he has very special talents. No matter what \n     happens, we are with you. We will always remember your \n     special dedication, caring nature and skills.\n\n  Cliff and Wilda Denton from Moses Lake in my home State of Washington \nwrote the following to Dr. Foster:\n\n       I can say in all humility, without you we could have lost \n     our only daughter and first born grandson. Wilma was so very \n     ill and dehydrated. All I had to do was call you. You would \n     nourish her back to normal. This was thirty some years ago. \n     When you were a doctor in the Air Force at Larson Air Force \n     Base, her husband was away fighting a war.\n       That's when we got acquainted with you. After the birth and \n     both were well and healthy, I wrote you a letter, thanking \n     you for all your good care. You told me I was the first \n     person (white that is) to ever give you a compliment. Greg is \n     now over thirty years old.\n       We were so impressed when we visited you a few years ago \n     and found you had dedicated your entire life to humanity . . \n     . I feel confident you will be confirmed. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples for Dr. Foster's great \nwork. He has delivered many thousands of babies, and he has saved \nhundreds of lives.\n  Some of our colleagues would have the U.S. Senate exclude Dr. Foster \nfrom consideration because he has performed abortions. I disagree. \nAbortion should not be the determining factor in the selection of a \nSurgeon General. Abortion is a legal procedure, and every woman in this \nNation has a constitutional right to choose whether and when to bear a \nchild.\n  Whether Dr. Foster has performed 1 abortion or 1,000 abortions, he \nshould not be disqualified from consideration.\n  I believe that the majority in this Nation will not allow an \nextremist minority to criminalize abortion through the Surgeon General \nnomination process. Furthermore, I believe the women in this Nation \nwill not stand for perfunctory disqualification of candidates based on \ntheir practice areas, especially when the physician involved has \ndedicated his life to women's health.\n  Mr. President, why is no one concerned about the exact number of \nbabies Dr. Foster has delivered in the course of his practice? Why is \nno one inquiring into exactly how many lives he has saved?\n  I am curious how many teenagers have benefited from his I Have A \nFuture Program? I wonder how many unintended pregnancies he has \nprevented?\n  How many young people has he empowered and inspired?\n  Why is this man being attacked so viciously when he has dedicated his \nlife to our well-being? Finally, how can a U.S. Senator vow to \nfilibuster Dr. Foster's nomination before the doctor has even had a \nhearing?\n  Mr. President, I had to speak on Dr. Foster's behalf today because I \ncannot stand by and watch his nomination be railroaded. Senator \nKassebaum has promised Dr. Foster a hearing and I believe she is \ncommitted to following through. Luckily, not everyone is rushing to \nprejudge this nominee.\n  Every day that goes by without a U.S. Surgeon General in place who \ncan provide strong leadership for our Nation's future--is a day in \nwhich American lives can be changed.\n  Mr. President, having a Surgeon General in place who can speak to \nwomen's health issues is imperative. I urge the committee to move \nquickly on Dr. Foster's nomination. And, I look forward to \nconsideration of Dr. Foster's nomination by the full Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n [[Page S3861]] IN SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA--SENATE CONCURRENT \n                              RESOLUTION 9\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, in submitting a concurrent resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that President Lee Teng-Hui of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan [ROC] should be allowed a private visit to \nthe United States.\n  This concurrent resolution makes an important statement in the future \ndirection of United States/Republic of China relations. The State \nDepartment's refusal last year to allow President Lee, a freely elected \nleader from a democratic nation, an overnight layover in Hawaii during \nhis trip to Costa Rica, was very unfortunate. It is hoped that, with \nthe passage of this legislation, the indiscretion that occurred last \nyear will not be repeated. And, Mr. President, it is important to note \nthat this bill expresses support for a private visit to the United \nStates.\n  Last May I had an opportunity to visit the Republic of China on \nTaiwan. It was a wonderful experience forging new friendships and \nstrengthening the many ties between the Republic of China and my home \nState, Idaho. I was very much impressed by the public officials with \nwhom I met and enjoyed the engaging conversations about the politics in \nthe Republic of China and the recent elections.\n  During my meeting with President Lee Teng-Hui, I learned of his \ngenuine interest in seeing his country play a larger international \nrole, which is a goal befitting Taiwan's economic power and place \nwithin the international community. President Lee urged all nations, \nespecially the United States, to give their support to Taiwan's \ncampaign to return to the United Nations. It is my hope that this goal \nwill someday be realized. In addition, President Lee expressed a very \nsincere desire to travel privately to the United States. I shared with \nhim an invitation extended by one of my constituents, who was concerned \nabout the incident in Hawaii. In addition, I expressed my hope that he \nwould be able to visit Idaho.\n  Mr. President, Idaho and the Republic of China have enjoyed the \nmutual benefits of a long and close relationship. During my visit last \nyear I had the pleasure of joining then Governor of Idaho Cecil Andrus \nand Governor James Soong of the Taiwan provincial government to \ncelebrate the 10th anniversary of the sister-state relationship between \nIdaho and the Taiwan Province. Through this friendship my State has \ngreatly benefited by expanding trade, cultural, and educational \nexchanges. Idaho exports to the Republic of China range from \nagricultural and wood products to electronics. In addition, the growth \nin trade has\n been enhanced by the placement of an Idaho trade office in the world \ntrade center, in Taipei. Eddie Yen, the gentleman that operates the \noffice for the Idaho Department of Commerce has been an asset to our \nState and has played an essential role in furthering the Expansion of \nIdaho's trade to Taiwan.\n\n  The United States also benefits from a stable relationship with the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan. After extensive internal review, there has \nbeen recent progress toward upgrading the relations between the United \nStates and Taiwan, which was good news from the Clinton administration. \nThe administration has agreed to help Taiwan enter certain \ninternational organizations, especially those that deal primarily with \ntrade and commerce. I applaud and encourage that endeavor.\n  The Clinton administration has also agreed to allow the Republic of \nChina to change the name of its offices in the United States from the \nCoordination Council for North American Affairs, to the Taipei Economic \nand Cultural Representative Office. These modest improvements in \nrelations between our two countries are certainly a step in the right \ndirection. It is hoped that we will see this pattern of improvement \ncontinued.\n  The concurrent resolution submitted by Senator Murkowski is yet \nanother step in the right direction. Mr. President, I hope that \nremaining issues or obstacles can be resolved so that President Lee \nTeng-Hui can be allowed to visit the United States. It is my \nunderstanding that a number of my colleagues have extended invitations \nto President Lee and other leaders from Taipei, to visit Capitol Hill. \nI know for a fact that President Lee has much insight to share with us, \nespecially on East Asian affairs, and, Mr. President, since the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan is a tremendous example of economic \nprosperity and democratic freedom for developing nations around the \nworld, we would undoubtedly benefit from the insights of a leader such \nas President Lee Teng-Hui, who has played a central role in the \nachievements of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3860-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING WEEK, APRIL 30-MAY 6, 1995\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

It assists \nindividuals and groups with problem-solving, personal and social \ndevelopment, decision-making, and self-awareness.\n  Such counseling is offered through community mental health agencies, \nprivate practices, psychiatric hospitals, college campuses, and \nrehabilitation centers. It is often provided in conjunction with other \nmental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, \nsocial workers, psychiatric nurses, and marriage and family therapists \nso that the most appropriate treatment for each patient is assured. It \nis provided by professionals with advanced degrees in counseling or \nrelated disciplines, practicing within the scope of their training and \nexperience. They are currently licensed in 40 States and the\n District of Columbia.\n\n  I want to congratulate the American Mental Health Counselors \nAssociation on their designation of April 30-May 6, 1995 as ``National \nMental Health Counseling Week,'' and urge each and every American to \nseek the assistance of a qualified mental health counselor when needed. \nAfter all, our mental health is just as important as our physical \nhealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3861-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3861-S3862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WELCOMING CROATIA'S DECISION ON U.N. TROOP PRESENCE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I welcome the decision by Croatian President \nFranjo Tudjman to allow an international force to remain in Croatia. As \none who has long opposed sending United States ground troops to Bosnia \nor Croatia, the good news about President Tudjman's decision seemed to \nbe tempered, however, by a report in this morning's New York Times.\n  According to that article, Secretary Perry announced that United \nStates troops would be sent to Croatia to help with the reconfiguration \nof U.N. forces. Upon further examination, however, it appears that this \nmorning's report may have been premature, as the President has not--\nrepeat not--yet made a decision with regard to a commitment of United \nStates troops. Moreover, the administration continues to assure me that \nif United States troops were deployed, it would not be for the purpose \nof helping with a reconfiguration or withdrawal of U.N. troops from \nCroatia.\n  Nonetheless, there is a great deal of confusion surrounding this \nissue, and accordingly, the administration needs to clarify its \nintentions with regard to troop commitments. Before any decision is \nmade to send U.S. troops, I fully expect the administration to follow \nthrough on its commitment to consult with the Congress.\n  The issue of United States troops aside, President Tudjman's decision \nwalks us back from the brink of disaster in Croatia and indeed, the \nentire former Yugoslavia. I can sympathize with President Tudjman's \nfear that a continuation of the status quo might have contributed to a \npermanent separation of Croatia, creating in effect, another Cyprus.\n  Despite Croatia's legitimate concerns, it would have been a grave \nmistake for U.N. troops to withdraw at this time. Following President \nTudjman's January announcement that UNPROPFOR would have to begin \nwithdrawing by March 31, there were \n[[Page S3862]] strong signs that the Krajina Serbs and the Croatian \nArmy were girding for war. A renewed war in Croatia would almost \ncertainly have drawn in Serbia as well as the Bosnian Serbs--leading to \na greater Balkan conflict.\n  While the United Nations does not have a flawless record in Croatia, \nUNPROFOR's presence since early 1992 has prevented the reemergence of \nfull-scale war. Let us hope that the reduced U.N. force, under a new \nmandate, will help maintain the peace. The reduced U.N. force also will \nhave as part of its mandate the patrolling of Croatia's borders with \nSerbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina--which will go a long way toward \nlegitimizing Croatia's international borders.\n  We are not out of the woods yet, however. Neither the Krajina Serbs, \nwho control 30 percent of Croatia, nor Serbian President Milosevic, who \nserves as their patron, have indicated their views of the new mandate. \nTheir response will be key to determining the ultimate success of the \nU.N. mission.\n  The larger question, however, is where we go from here, and how a \nreduced and newly reconfigured U.N. force fits into the big picture. It \nappears that renewed war in Croatia will be averted in the near \nfuture--thanks in no small part to United States efforts. But now we \nmust ask whether we are going to continue simply to put out fires in \nformer Yugoslavia or whether we have long-term interests to pursue \nthere. I am afraid that if we do not answer this question \naffirmatively, we will find ourselves in a continual crisis mode. We \nmay find ourselves meeting one deadline after another--the next of \nwhich is the end of the Bosnian cease-fire on April 30--without a clear \nsense of purpose. I hope this impending deadline does not divert all of \nour attention from the remaining unresolved issues in Croatia. The two \nconflicts are after all, interconnected, and we must address them \nsimultaneously.\n  Before President Tudjman's January announcement that the United \nNations would have to leave, an international plan to resolve the \nstatus of Croatia's U.N. Protected Areas [UNPA's] was on the table. By \nall accounts, the so-called Z-4 plan satisfies many of the concerns of \nboth the Croatian Government and the Krajina Serbs. It calls for the \nrestoration of Croatian sovereignty to all the U.N. areas, with \nconsiderable autonomy for the local Serbian population.\n  Now that the immediate crisis has been averted, I hope that we will \nnot miss out on an opportunity to address the underlying issues in \nCroatia. Now is a good time to revisit the Z-4 plan.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3861-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3862-S3867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nRATIFICATION OF THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE \n                 FISHERY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, many of my colleagues know that I have had \nan abiding interest in oceans issues in general and the Law of the Sea \nConvention in particular. Consequently, I was delighted when on October \n7, 1994, the President transmitted to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (Treaty Doc. 103-39). \nWe are now in the unique position to become full participants in this \nConvention and finally reap the benefits of decades of constructive \nnegotiations conducted by Democratic and Republican administrations.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this Convention will serve the \ninterests of the United States best from a national security \nperspective, from an economic perspective, from an ocean resources \nperspective and from an environmental perspective. I have addressed \nmany of these perspectives during earlier remarks in the Senate. Today, \nI speak to the importance of this Convention to our Nation's fishery \nresources.\n  Some have argued that the United States should not ratify the \nConvention because of a perceived negative impact which it might have \non international fisheries agreements negotiated by the United States \nwith its international partners. I submit that quite the opposite is \nthe case. Ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention will be an \nimportant step towards assuring the continued benefits of these other \nagreements and protecting the fishery interests of our country.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an address \ndelivered by Ambassador David Colson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nState for Oceans, which addresses precisely this issue. In it, he shows \nthe paramount role that the Law of the Sea Convention will play in the \nimplementation of the important international agreements to which the \nUnited States is already a party: The 1992 Convention for the \nConservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean, approved \nby the Senate on August 11, 1992, Treaty Doc. 102-30, Ex.Rpt 102-51; \nthe U.N. General Assembly Resolution on Large-Scale High Seas Driftnet \nFishing (approved by the Senate on November 26, 1991, Treaty Doc. 102-\n7, Ex.Rpt 102-20), the recently concluded Convention on the \nConservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering \nSea, ``the Donut Hole Agreement'' (approved by the Senate on October 6, \n1994, Treaty Doc. 103-27, Ex.Rpt 103-36) and the FAO Agreement to \nPromote Compliance with International Conservation and Management \nMeasures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (approved by the Senate on \nOctober 6, 1994, Treaty Doc. 103-24, Ex.Rpt 103-32).\n  The United States has long taken a pro-active approach to fisheries, \nboth within its own exclusive economic zone and on the high seas. \nThrough these recent successful negotiations, we have ensured that our \ninternational partners will be submitted to no less stringent rules. \nThe United States will put an end to overfishing and further depletion \nof threatened stocks only if we can ensure that sound management \npractices are applied by the other major fishing nations. This is why \nthe\n administration has negotiated in earnest to achieve what are widely \nperceived as breakthrough advances in strong and responsible \narrangements.\n\n  Concerns have been expressed that ratification of the Law of the Sea \nConvention would jeopardize these agreements. Ambassador Colson shows \nthat, far from hindering these processes, the entry into force of the \nConvention will actually benefit their implementation.\n  In the case of salmon, a very important commercial, recreational, and \nsubsistence resource, the Law of the Sea Convention has provided a \nfoundation upon which to build understandings for the States of the \nNorth Pacific region. The Law of the Sea Convention, in essence, \nprohibits fisheries for salmon on the high seas. It also recognizes \nthat states in whose waters salmon originates have the primary interest \nin these stocks. The Anadromous Stocks Convention, approved by the \nSenate in 1992, achieved the major goal of ending all high seas \nfishing, thanks in great part to the clear mandate and requirements of \nthe Law of the Sea Convention. Further, the implementation of this \nagreement will be facilitated by the entry into force of the Law of the \nSea, as the prohibition on high seas salmon fishing will apply to all \nmember states, not just the signatories to the Anadromous Stocks \nConvention.\n  The use of large-scale high seas drift nets in another issue that the \nUnited States has attempted to solve in international fora. A \nresolution was passed unanimously by the U.N. General Assembly that \ncreated a moratorium on the use of those drift nets on the world's \noceans and seas at the end of 1992. The drift net moratorium builds \nupon basic principles of the Law of the Sea Convention, which provides \nfor a limited and qualified right to fish on the high seas, making it \nsubject to the obligation to cooperate in the conservation and \nmanagement of high seas living resources. Enforcement will be \nfacilitated in view of the fact that the Convention's standards would \nbe violated by any high seas large-scale drift net fishing that occurs \ncontrary to the moratorium.\n  With regards to the Bering Sea issue, problems arose for the United \nStates when a straddling stocks fishery began outside our exclusive \nzone and Russia's. Concerns about stocks conditions led to measures to \nrestrain fisheries in the U.S. zone and increasingly urgent calls by \nAmerican fishermen for the Government to take steps to control the \nforeign fishery on the high seas. The Donut Hole Agreement approved by \nthe Senate on October 6, 1994 was the result of lengthy negotiations \nbetween the United States and the other states involved in fishing in \nthe area. \n[[Page S3863]] It is a state-of-the-art fishing convention that \nresolves various issues to the satisfaction of the United States and \nother states concerned. Again, this agreement could not have been \nnegotiated without the framework and foundation provided by the Law of \nthe Sea Convention. The dispute settlement provisions of the Law of the \nSea Convention will facilitate the implementation of the Donut Hole \nAgreement by providing an additional enforcement mechanism to ensure \nthat no vessel undertakes conduct in the Bering Sea contrary to its \nprovisions. It will thus serve as both a deterrent and as a means to \nbring about final resolution should problems arise in the Donut Hole in \nthe future.\n  Finally, the very important FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with \nInternational Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels \non the High Seas approved by the Senate on October 6, 1994 could not \nhave been successfully negotiated had the Law of the Sea Convention not \ncome before it. The High Seas Agreement is part of the FAO's Code of \nConduct for Responsible Fishing and rests upon basic principles \nregarding high seas fishing and flag state responsibility found in the \nLaw of the Sea Convention. The Law of the Sea Convention does not set \nup the high seas as a sanctuary for irresponsible fishermen but spells \nout that states fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate with \nother states to ensure responsible conservation and management actions.\n  This is also true of the current negotiations at the U.N. Conference \non Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. It is hoped \nthat the final outcome of this conference will be a legally-binding \nagreement for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of \nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. The general \nprinciples embodied in this agreement will here again ensure more \nresponsible fishing on the high seas and will build upon the framework \nprovided by the Law of the Sea Convention.\n  Only last week, a Canadian vessel fired warning shots and seized a \nSpanish fishing vessel that was operating on the Grand Banks off the \ncoast of Newfoundland. Had Canada and Spain both been party to the Law \nof the Sea Convention, this dispute could have been settled without the \nfiring of shots. Regrettably, such incidents are the result of the \ngrowing uncertainty that prevails with regard to high seas fisheries \nand will only be avoided if the Convention on the Law of the Sea \nbecomes a widely recognized instrument on which the Straddling Stocks \nConference can build to establish a lasting regime for those fisheries.\n  Another instance where the ratification of the Law of the Sea \nConvention would be beneficial to the United States is in the \nsettlement of disputes with other states. Recently, the Canadian \nGovernment levied a fee of $1,100 for United States vessels that \ntransit from Puget Sound and the States of Oregon and Washington to \nAlaska. The State Department concluded that this transit fee was \ninconsistent with international law, and particularly with the transit \nrights guaranteed to vessels under customary international law and the \nLaw of the Sea Convention. Had the United States and Canada both \nratified the Law of the Sea Convention, the Canadian actions would have \nbeen in clear contravention of the convention. As such, the Canadians \nmight have been more hesitant to take the steps they did. In any event \nthe full force of the convention and the international community could \nhave been brought to bear for a prompt resolution of the dispute.\n  Mr. President, it is clear in my mind that the long-term benefits of \nthese very important fishery agreements will only be realized and \nmutual enforcement ensured if the underlying principles of the Law of \nthe Sea Convention--the constitution of the seas--are ratified by the \nUnited States. The convention entered into force on November 16, 1994. \nTo date 73 countries have ratified, including Australia, Germany, \nIceland, and Italy. Other major industrialized nations, such as Canada, \nthe European Community, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, \nand Japan, have signed the convention and indicated their intention to \nratify it in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I commend the address of Ambassador Colson, which so \nably sets forth the importance of the ratification of the Law of the \nSea Convention to the fishing interests of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the address be printed in the Record \ntogether with the current list of countries who have to date ratified \nthe Law of the Sea Convention.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Conserving World Fish Stocks and Protecting the Marine Environment \n                  Under the Law of the Sea Convention\n\n                    (By Ambassador David A. Colson)\n\n       Virtually every day we see another report about the decline \n     of the world's fish resources or about ocean pollution.\n       We know that the world's population continues to grow \n     dramatically. It is only logical to conclude that there is a \n     direct correlation between more people and more impact on our \n     fisheries and the marine environment.\n       We know that most of the world's population lives near the \n     coast and intuitively we know that the result of an increased \n     population is likely to be greater stress from human activity \n     upon coastal environments be they wetlands, coral reefs, \n     mangroves, beaches or coastal fisheries--all of which are in \n     decline.\n       We know that the ocean is a large ecosystem made up of many \n     smaller ones. We know that there are often relationships \n     between areas, ocean systems, and species. We know that some \n     fishery resources migrate over very long distances.\n       And we conclude that the oceans are a bridge between us; a \n     tie that unites us. They are our sustenance; our life \n     support.\n       They are integral to many global systems that we take for \n     granted, but still do not understand. They are the future--\n     their riches and their energy are yet to be fully tapped.\n       We know their health is important, but how little we really \n     know about them. Yet in spite of our experience, we continue \n     to pollute, to over-exploit--to assume that the ocean's vast \n     regenerative capacity is unlimited.\n       We should know better.\n       And now, after so many years, the 1982 Law of the Sea \n     Convention is in force. Will it help us do better?\n       I believe the Convention has, and it will. Already, for \n     more than ten years, most States have acted consistently with \n     its basic norms--and in those ten years advances in \n     protecting the oceans have been made. And now that it is in \n     force its specific implementation will bring more benefits \n     and advance us further. I must be careful because I do not \n     want to say that the Convention will solve all the ocean's \n     problems. It will not. But can it help? The answer is yes.\n       In 1983, President Reagan said that the United States would \n     act in accord with the balance of interests set forth in the \n     Law of the Sea Convention, as long as other States would do \n     likewise. I can report that in the intervening years \n     basically all States have either expressly or by implication \n     followed the basic rules set forth in the Convention. Thus, \n     the positive achievements that have occurred in marine \n     environmental protection and fisheries in the last ten years \n     have taken place in the widely accepted Law of the Sea \n     framework.\n       And there have been some very important advances. Today I \n     want to review four of these which have occurred in the \n     fisheries field. Before I do, I wish to emphasize the \n     following point: the Law of the Sea Convention enabled the \n     international community to reach these agreements. Even \n     before its entry into force, the Convention was the \n     foundation, the premise, upon which all governments operated \n     in negotiating these understandings. Had we not had this \n     basic foundation, had we not been in agreement about it, our \n     task would have been much more difficult, indeed, perhaps \n     impossible in some cases.\n       The four breakthrough advances are: (1) the 1992 Convention \n     for the Conversation of Anadromous Stocks in the North \n     Pacific Ocean (NPAFC); (2) the 1992 United Nations General \n     Assembly Resolution on Large-Scale High Seas Driftnet Fishing \n     (UNGA Resolution 46/215); (3) the recently concluded \n     Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock \n     Resources in the Central Bering Sea; and (4) the 1993 FAO \n     Agreement to Promote Compliance with International \n     Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on \n     the High Seas.\n\n\n               north pacific anadromous stocks convention\n\n       Salmon, anadromous stocks, are very important commercial, \n     recreational and subsistence resources for the States of the \n     North Pacific region. From time to time international \n     disputes in the region relating to salmon have reached the \n     highest level of government. The Law of the Sea Convention \n     framework, however, provides a foundation that has \n     substantially narrowed debate; its basic rules have been a \n     foundation upon which to build additional understandings.\n       Article 66 of the Law of the Sea Convention recognizes that \n     States in whose waters \n     [[Page S3864]] salmon stocks originate have the primary \n     interest in those stocks. The Law of the Sea Convention \n     prohibits fisheries for salmon on the high seas, with one \n     narrowly drawn and now anachronistic exception--where that \n     prohibition would result in economic dislocation for a State \n     other than the State of origin. The Convention also requires \n     that States cooperate with regard to the conservation and \n     management of stocks when salmon which originate in the \n     waters of one State migrate through the waters of another.\n       The Convention's prohibition on high seas salmon fisheries \n     makes sense from both economic and conservation perspectives. \n     Economically, salmon grow substantially in the last months of \n     their lives and thereby tend to be a higher value and quality \n     resource if taken in coastal zones and rivers and not the \n     high seas. Moreover, maintenance and preservation of salmon \n     producing areas in coastal rivers cannot be expected if other \n     States fish for salmon on the high seas. And only the State \n     of origin can effectively manage salmon resources in coastal \n     waters and rivers, not the high seas where salmon stocks are \n     mixed.\n       The rule of the Convention bans salmon fishing on the high \n     seas for all States, including a State of origin. The only \n     country that was fishing for salmon on the high seas, at the \n     time these Convention provisions were negotiated, and thus \n     the only one which might claim economic dislocation, was \n     Japan. And, it was and is clear, as well, that Japan could \n     claim a right to fish salmon on the high seas only so long as \n     it could make a credible argument of economic dislocation, \n     and so long as it did not assert coastal State rights.\n       As the 1980s passed, Japan's salmon interests shifted: its \n     Coastal State interests in the production of salmon from its \n     waters began to predominate and its reliance upon an economic \n     dislocation argument to continue a high seas salmon fishery \n     was not persuasive. In 1992, negotiations on a new salmon \n     convention were completed by the United States, Japan, Russia \n     and Canada, designed to replace the U.S.-Canada-Japan treaty \n     that had created the International North Pacific Fisheries \n     Commission. Provisions were included whereby these primary \n     States of origin could invite other States of origin, such as \n     China and Korea, to accede to the Convention. Japan agreed in \n     this context to end its high seas salmon fishery. The \n     fundamental rule of Article 66 of the LOS Convention was \n     achieved by the Anadromous Stocks Convention: to end all high \n     seas salmon fishing. This achievement came about among the \n     States most concerned for many reasons--not the least of \n     which is the clear mandate and requirement of Article 66 of \n     the Law of the Sea Convention. Moreover, the respect in which \n     the prohibition on high seas salmon fishing is held by all \n     other States is a direct result of the Convention rule.\n       This positive result of the Anadromous Stocks Convention \n     was achieved without the fundamental rule of Article 66 of \n     the Law of the Sea Convention being binding on any State as a \n     matter of treaty law. I have heard some people in the United \n     States say that this result would never have been achieved if \n     the U.S. had been party to the Law of the Sea Convention. I \n     simply do not agree with that point of view; it is abundantly \n     clear to me, as the United States negotiator for the \n     Anadromous Stocks Convention, that the Law of the Sea \n     Convention--although not in force--played a large role in \n     bringing about this result--it certainly did not hinder it.\n       Let us examine a different question: will the Law of the \n     Sea Convention help the parties to the Anadromous Stocks \n     Convention in the future--if they become a party to the Law \n     of the Sea Convention? The answer is clearly yes.\n       The Law of the Sea Convention does not require any change \n     in the Anadromous Stocks Convention. The two treaties are \n     completely consistent. What the Law of the Sea Convention \n     does do is require all States Parties to it to abide by the \n     prohibition on high seas salmon fishing--the basic rule of \n     the Anadromous Stocks Convention. This is a major long-term \n     benefit to salmon producing States. While salmon producing \n     States assert our rights, the Law of the Sea Convention not \n     only recognizes them, but prohibits all States from eroding \n     those rights by engaging in high seas salmon fisheries.\n       There are additional benefits in the Law of the Sea for \n     salmon producing States. Parties to the Law of the Sea \n     Convention are also required to submit to compulsory binding \n     dispute settlement in many circumstances. In some cases there \n     are exceptions to this rule, but in this case there is not. \n     If vessels of a State begin to fish for salmon on the high \n     seas, one means of enforcing the prohibition on high seas \n     salmon fishing would be to take that State to compulsory and \n     binding dispute settlement under the Law of the Sea \n     Convention.\n       For a moment, let me go into some additional detail on the \n     dispute settlement provisions of the Law of the Sea \n     Convention, as it is important that this subject, which is \n     well understood by international lawyers, be understood by \n     fishermen and political leaders as well.\n       International law requires States to settle their disputes \n     by peaceful means. Where negotiated solutions are beyond \n     reach, States more and more settle differences by going \n     through a legal court-like process. There are several dispute \n     settlement procedures and, as well, several more that can be \n     used. The Law of the Sea Convention obliges States to use \n     dispute settlement in certain circumstances when other means \n     to resolve disputes have\n      failed. Some such circumstances, as noted previously, \n     include fisheries disputes.\n       To elaborate further, one must make a distinction between \n     binding compulsory dispute settlement and nonbinding \n     compulsory conciliation. The reason this distinction is \n     important is that the Law of the Sea Convention uses it in \n     relation to fisheries disputes.\n       With regard to certain fisheries disputes that may pertain \n     to a coastal State's management in its exclusive economic \n     zone, the Convention provides for non-binding compulsory \n     conciliation. In regard to fisheries disputes that relate to \n     high seas activities, the Convention provides for binding \n     compulsory dispute settlement.\n       Nonbinding compulsory conciliation means, in essence, that \n     if State A alleges that State B is mismanaging its 200-mile \n     zone in a serious way, State A may require the establishment \n     of a conciliation panel to look into the matter. While State \n     B should participate in the proceedings, there is no penalty \n     if it does not; and, any report the conciliation panel may \n     issue has no binding or obligatory effect on State B.\n       Binding compulsory dispute settlement, which is required \n     for high seas fishery disputes, is substantially different. \n     If State A alleges that State B is violating Convention \n     fishery rules and principles on the high seas, and if \n     negotiations have failed, State A may institute a process \n     that results in bringing the dispute before an international \n     court or tribunal of some make-up. There are a number of \n     variables concerning these courts or tribunals that we have \n     not time to go into now. The point or bottom line is that \n     pursuant to the Law of the Sea Convention, in such cases, \n     State A can bring State B before such a court or tribunal on \n     a matter pertaining to a high seas fishery dispute, and that \n     court or tribunal can render a judgement which is binding on \n     both State A and State B concerning that high sea fisheries \n     dispute.\n       Returning now to salmon in the high seas of the North \n     Pacific Ocean, the availability of such dispute settlement \n     provides not only an effective tool to enforce the high seas \n     salmon fishing prohibition; its very existence provides an \n     effective deterrent against such fishing. So--for salmon--the \n     Law of the Sea Convention has brought us much already; it \n     consolidates and confirms present practice; it gives us clear \n     rules which prohibit high seas salmon fishing by all States; \n     and it provides a new and useful enforcement tool should \n     someone break the rule in the future.\n\n\n                            driftnet fishing\n\n       The use of large-scale high seas driftnets attracted \n     significant international attention and concern in the 1980s. \n     Ultimately, the General Assembly of the United Nations took \n     up the matter and passed a consensus resolution in 1991. The \n     1991 Resolution, UNGA Resolution 46/215, created a moratorium \n     on the use of large-scale high seas driftnets on the world's \n     oceans and seas at the end of 1992.\n       This concerted action by the General Assembly was a vitally \n     important step to protect fish stocks and other living \n     species on the high seas from this very indiscriminate \n     fishing method being used by more and more vessels, about \n     1,000 in the Pacific Ocean alone at the height of the \n     fishery. Large-scale high seas driftnet fishing was a cause \n     of concern in all regions of the world.\n       The driftnet moratorium of the United Nations builds upon \n     basic principles of the Law of the Sea Convention. It applies \n     only to the high seas--not exclusive economic zones or \n     territorial seas. In the first instance it requires flag \n     States to ensure the full implementation of the moratorium, \n     but it also authorizes all members of the international \n     community to take measures individually and collectively to \n     prevent large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing operations. The \n     moratorium is in implementation of the provisions of Part \n     VII, Section 2 of the Law of the Sea Convention relating to \n     the Conservation and Management of the Living Resources of \n     the High Seas. It gives content to the principles of ``due \n     regard'' for the rights and interests of other States and to \n     the duty to cooperate in the conservation of living marine \n     resources on the high seas.\n       Some have argued that the moratorium would never have been \n     achieved through diplomacy if the Law of the Sea Convention \n     had been in force. They argue that, had the Convention been \n     in force, the driftnetting States would have refused to \n     discuss the matter in the United Nations and might even have \n     tried to use the dispute settlement provisions of the \n     Convention to enforce their freedom to fish on the high seas \n     against those States that sought to end driftnetting. I do \n     not agree with this analysis at all.\n       First, this argument assumes that the freedom to fish on \n     the high seas is an unfettered right. But that is not so. The \n     Convention significantly limits and qualifies that right by \n     making it subject to a number of important conditions, \n     including the obligation to cooperate in the conservation and \n     management of high seas living resources.\n       Second, the States that sought the moratorium were able to \n     demonstrate that large-scale high seas driftnets, \n     particularly in\n      the North Pacific Ocean, intercepted salmon on the high seas \n     in violation of Article 66 of the Convention and \n     indiscriminately killed large numbers of other species, \n     including marine mammals and birds, in contravention of \n     the \n     [[Page S3865]] obligations in Part VII to conserve and manage \n     living marine resources on the high seas and those of Article \n     192 to protect and preserve the marine environment.\n       In light of this, there is no reason to believe that \n     driftnetting States could have successfully challenged the \n     moratorium through dispute settlement under the Convention. \n     In my view, the moratorium would have been achieved whether \n     or not the Convention was in force. A different question is \n     whether the Law of the Sea Convention helps to ensure \n     effective implementation of the moratorium.\n       The moratorium on the use of large-scale high seas drift \n     nets is an important international understanding pertaining \n     to the conservation of living marine resources on the high \n     seas and the protection of the marine environment. It is \n     consistent with and meets the general obligation of States \n     found within Article 192 of the Convention to protect and \n     preserve the marine environment. It is properly within the \n     scope of constraints on fishing on the high seas that are \n     noted in Article 116.\n       And, as in the Anadromous Stocks Convention situation, the \n     Law of the Sea Convention's provisions make fishing beyond \n     the EEZ--including driftnet fishing--subject to compulsory, \n     binding dispute settlement. It is clear to me that the \n     Convention's standards would be violated by any high seas \n     large-scale diftnet fishing that occurs contrary to the \n     moratorium. Thus, the dispute settlement provisions of the \n     Law of the Sea Convention would provide a new additional \n     means through which to ensure respect for the moratorium on \n     high seas driftnet fishing by enforcing Articles 66, 116 and \n     192 of the convention in light of the General Assembly \n     Resolutions on this subject.\n\n\n            The Central Bering Sea Pollock Fishery Agreement\n\n       The problem of straddling fish stocks has vexed the \n     international community since even before the Law of the Sea \n     negotiations concluded in 1982.\n       For the United States, this problem arose in the Central \n     Bering Sea. In the mid-1980s, a fishery began outside the \n     U.S. and Russian 200-mile zones on a stock of pollock--the \n     Aleutian Basin stock--largely associated with the U.S. zone \n     and its fisheries. The international fishery on the high seas \n     grew quickly to harvesting 1.5 million metric tons or more \n     annually. Concerns about stock conditions led to measures to \n     restrain fisheries in the U.S. zone and increasingly urgent \n     calls by American fishermen for the U.S. government to take \n     steps to control the foreign fishery on the high seas.\n       In 1991, negotiations began among Russia, Japan, Korea, \n     China, Poland and the United States in an effort to structure \n     a new fisheries relationship for the high seas area of the \n     Bering Sea. The negotiations began with largely a legal \n     debate about a fishery for a straddling stock on the high \n     seas and the respective rights of coastal States and fishing \n     nations in that regard. Fishing States were strongly of the \n     view that they were entitled to fish there on an equal \n     footing with other States, including coastal States. The \n     United States and Russia were of the opinion that the coastal \n     States--while not having jurisdiction over the fish in the \n     high seas area--nonetheless had a special interest in these \n     stocks. Our six country regional negotiation was more than \n     mindful that the straddling stock issue was also being played \n     out in other regions and was central to the U.N. Conference \n     on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, \n     called for by UNCED.\n       Ultimately, the six countries reached agreement, but only \n     after ten intense and difficult negotiating rounds over three \n     years.\n       The agreement is contained in a convention that is called \n     the Donut Hole Convention in the United States. It is a \n     state-of-the-art fishing convention that resolves various \n     issues to the satisfaction of the States concerned. It does \n     not refer specifically to the special interests of coastal \n     States, but it does reflect such an interest in the outcome \n     of the negotiation on various issues while providing for fair \n     fishing opportunities on the high seas for all countries if \n     and when the stock recovers.\n       Again, the Donut Hole Convention could not have been \n     negotiated without the framework and foundation provided by \n     the Law of the Sea Convention. Nor did the Law of the Sea \n     Convention hinder the attainment of the Donut Hole Convention \n     in any way.\n       I do not have time to review its provisions here in any \n     detail. However, I would like to mention a few because I \n     believe that provisions such as these must and will be \n     incorporated into fishing agreements around the world in the \n     near future.\n       The Donut Hole Convention provides that fishing vessels \n     will use real-time satellite position-fixing transmitters \n     while in the Bering Sea and that information collected \n     thereby will be exchanged on a real-time basis through \n     bilateral channels. This is the first multilateral fisheries \n     management agreement to contain such a requirement and it \n     will enable States such as Japan and the United States to \n     ensure that, for instance, Japanese fishing vessels \n     authorized to fish in the Donut Hole are doing so as \n     authorized as that their presence in the coastal\n      State zones in the region is only for the legitimate purpose \n     of navigating to and from the fishing ground.\n       The Donut Hole Convention also requires notification of \n     entry into the Convention Area; notification of the location \n     of transshipments 24 hours prior to such activity; the \n     presence of trained observers on all vessels; and the \n     collection and sharing of catch data on a timely basis. It \n     also provides for boarding and inspection of fishing vessels \n     by any party; and, in cases of serious violation, the \n     continuation of such boarding until the flag State is in a \n     position to take full responsibility for the fishing vessel.\n       The Donut Hole Convention also contains provisions that \n     ensure that consensus decision-making does not lead to \n     stalemate or the inability to make effective conservation and \n     management decisions. This has been a major problem in \n     traditional fishing agreements. However, in this convention, \n     in the absence of consensus among the Parties, means and \n     procedures are established to ensure that no fishing occurs \n     in the Donut Hole except in accordance with sound \n     conservation and management rules.\n       Provisions such as these break new ground in regional \n     fishery management agreements. I believe we should look for \n     more of this in the future. After all, we are close to the \n     21st century. We live in a world of space age communication \n     and data management. Fisheries data collection and its \n     availability to fisheries managers remains an archaic \n     process, to say the least. There is no reason today--other \n     than the reluctance of fishermen and their governments to \n     compel them--that every fishing vessel on the high seas does \n     not have on board a satellite transmitter capable of two way \n     communication, a fax machine, and a computer capable of \n     collecting, storing and transmitting data immediately in \n     agreed formats This is the future to which we look forward. \n     This is the direction true international fisheries \n     cooperation will take us.\n       Let me return to the Donut Hole Convention. The United \n     States is confident that the Donut Hole Convention will be \n     fully and fairly implemented by its Parties and that in doing \n     so it will contribute to the protection of the marine \n     environment and the conservation of the Aleutian Basin \n     pollock resource and associated species for many years to \n     come. We look forward, as well, not just to seeing this \n     state-of-the-art convention well implemented, but to seeing \n     it evolve and continue to set a high standard for regional \n     fisheries agreements.\n       Could the Law of the Sea Convention help the Parties to the \n     Donut Hole Convention?\n       Certainly. First, the Law of the Sea Convention will \n     require no change in the Donut Hole Convention. The Donut \n     Hole Convention will operate as it was negotiated among its \n     Parties. Second, the Law of the Sea Convention can help the \n     Donut Hole Convention, as in the case of the Anadromous \n     Stocks Convention and the Driftnet Moratorium, by providing \n     an alternative enforcement mechanism to ensure that no vessel \n     undertakes conduct in the Central Bering Sea contrary to the \n     provisions of the Donut Hole Convention. The dispute \n     settlement provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention enable \n     its Parties to ensure enforcement of multilateral fishery \n     conservation arrangements on the high seas. Dispute \n     settlement does not replace other means that States have at \n     their disposal to enforce multilateral conservation \n     arrangements. It adds to the options available. The Law of \n     the Sea dispute settlement option can act both as a deterrent \n     and as a means to bring about final resolution should \n     problems arise in the Donut Hole in the future.\n\n\n                       the fao flagging agreement\n\n       The FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International \n     Conservation and Management Measures By Fishing Vessels on \n     the High Seas is often called the ``Flagging Agreement,'' \n     although it deals with much more than the flagging of fishing \n     vessels. From my perspective, this very important Agreement \n     could not have been successfully negotiated had the Law of \n     the Sea Convention not come before it. Moreover, as with the \n     other fishery agreements I've mentioned, States should be \n     able to use the dispute settlement procedures of the Law of \n     the Sea Convention to ensure observance of the FAO Agreement.\n       The FAO Agreement is part of the FAO's Code of Conduct on \n     Responsible Fishing, an initiative begun at Mexico's Cancun \n     Conference in 1992. It rests upon basic principles regarding \n     high seas fishing and Flag State responsibility found in the \n     Law of the Sea Convention. With respect to high seas fishing, \n     as I have mentioned before, the LOS Convention does not \n     permit a ``free-for-all,'' an unfettered right to fish, as \n     some suggest. While the Convention acknowledges the general \n     right of all States for their nationals to fish on the high \n     seas, it makes this right subject to a number of important \n     conditions, including:\n       (a) other treaty obligations of the State concerned;\n       (b) the rights and duties as well as the interests of \n     coastal States; and\n       (c) obligations to cooperate in the conservation and \n     management of high seas living resources.\n       With respect to Flag State responsibility, Article 91 of \n     the Law of the Sea Convention gives States the right to grant \n     nationality to their ships. Flag States must ensure that \n     there is a genuine link between themselves and the vessels \n     that fly their flag. In addition to cooperating in the \n     conservation and management of highs seas resources, Flag \n     [[Page S3866]] States (like all States)\n      must protect and preserve the marine environment, which \n     includes living marine resources.\n       The FAO Agreement builds upon these principles to meet two \n     basic objectives. First, the Agreement sets forth a range of \n     specific obligations for Flag States to ensure that their \n     vessels act consistently with conservation and management \n     needs developed by regional fishing arrangements. Second, the \n     Agreement greatly promotes the transparency of high seas \n     fishing operations through the collection and dissemination \n     of information. By being Party to the FAO Agreement, a State \n     fulfills basic responsibilities imposed by the LOS Convention \n     to cooperate in the conservation and management of high seas \n     living resources.\n       Flag State responsibility has a long tradition in the Law \n     of the Sea, mostly--but not completely--for the good. It was \n     originally justified on the notion that a ship should be \n     regarded as an extension of the territory of the Flag State. \n     Generally speaking, when a ship is on the high seas, no other \n     State may exercise jurisdiction over it.\n       This exclusivity of jurisdiction has long been recognized \n     to imply a duty--Flag States must control their vessels to \n     ensure that they act consistently with international law. The \n     Law of the Sea Convention makes this explicit--in exchange \n     for exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas, \n     Flag States must ensure that such vessels act responsibly.\n       Today, high seas fishing vessels have harvesting capacities \n     never imagined in the days when the notion of Flag State \n     responsibility first arose. Modern fishing vessels and fleets \n     can literally wipe out fish stocks. Flag States have a duty \n     under the Law of the Sea Convention to exercise great \n     vigilance over their fishing vessels which operate on the \n     high seas. The FAO Agreement identifies vital elements of \n     that duty. If they do not meet their duty, the fishery \n     resources on which we all depend will collapse, and the Flag \n     States will have failed to exercise their responsibility \n     under the Law of the Sea Convention.\n       Some Flag States have begun to exercise this greater \n     vigilance over their high seas fishing vessels. Others, \n     unfortunately, continue to allow their flags to be flown by \n     vessels over which they exercise virtually no control. This \n     is improper under the Law of the Sea Convention. When such \n     vessels fish in ways that break the rules and do harm to the \n     marine environment, these States sometimes try to hide behind \n     the tradition of Flag State responsibility, asserting that no \n     other State may take action to compel proper fishing behavior \n     on the high seas. When such vessels are suspected of fishing \n     illegally in zones of national jurisdiction, and are later \n     found on the high seas, there States sometimes refuse to \n     cooperate with coastal States in investigating the alleged \n     violations.\n       These patterns of conduct are inconsistent with Law of the \n     Sea Convention requirements and jeopardize respect for the \n     tradition of Flag State responsibility for fishing vessels on \n     the high seas. The FAO Agreement represents one attempt to \n     address part of the problem. It sets forth a reasonable set \n     of specific duties for Flag States to ensure that their \n     vessels do not undermine conservation rules on the high seas. \n     As such, it elaborates upon basic duties in the Law of the \n     Sea Convention.\n       All states should move quickly to become party to the FAO \n     Agreement or otherwise observe its requirements. For those \n     Flag States that do not, the international community can be \n     expected to find another approach to fulfill the intent of \n     the Law of the Sea Convention that the marine environment be \n     preserved and protected against the actions of irresponsible \n     high seas fishing vessels.\n       The message is that the Flag States of vessels fishing on \n     the high seas must do more to cooperate among themselves and \n     with coastal States. Some States argue that it is a \n     derogation of sovereignty to cooperate with other States on \n     the high seas in matters pertaining to boarding, inspection \n     and other questions of compliance for responsible fishing \n     behavior. We disagree. We see cooperation as an exercise of \n     sovereignty.\n       Provision of high seas catch data to other States is not an \n     infringement upon sovereignty or a derogation from the \n     traditions of Flag State responsibility. It is a exercise of \n     sovereignty and responsibility in fulfillment of the duty to \n     cooperate to conserve the world's fishery resources and to \n     protect the marine environment. Cooperating with coastal \n     States on high seas enforcement problems, including boarding \n     and inspection, either through formal or informal \n     arrangements, is not an infringement on sovereignty or the \n     traditions of Flag State responsibility. It is a practical \n     decision by a sovereign State and an exercise of its Flag \n     State duties to ensure that its flag vessels comply with \n     international law and the rules and norms of responsible \n     fishing behavior.\n       The Law of the Sea Convention does not set up the high seas \n     as a sanctuary for irresponsible fishermen. States with \n     fishing vessels on the high seas have a duty under the Law of \n     the Sea Convention to cooperate with other States. That \n     cooperation may take many forms--but it must be directed \n     toward responsible conservation and management actions; and \n     that means, at a minimum, monitoring and inspection of \n     fishing vessels and reporting about their activities.\n       Within the context of regional fishery agreements, Flag \n     States should consent to boarding and inspection of their \n     fishing vessels on the high seas by other States to ensure \n     compliance\n      with those agreements. If a high seas fishing vessel is \n     violating agreed fishing measures, the Flag State should \n     either exercise responsibility for the vessel or authorize \n     another State to exercise such responsibility on its \n     behalf. If a vessel is suspected of violating coastal \n     State rules, the Flag State should cooperate with the \n     coastal State and provide the most efficient means of \n     investigation including agreeing to coastal State boarding \n     and inspection on the high seas when the Flag State is not \n     in position to do so.\n       Numerous international extradition agreements include the \n     ``prosecute or extradite'' rule. We believe international \n     fishery agreements and relationships should include a similar \n     approach. A State must either ensure that its flag vessels \n     engage in responsible fishing on the high seas, or be \n     prepared to allow other States to take the necessary steps. \n     This approach fully respects the basic traditions of Flag \n     State responsibility enshrined in the Law of the Sea \n     Convention, while also meeting other responsibilities found \n     in the Convention of equally compelling character to \n     cooperate for the conservation and management of high seas \n     living resources.\n       This approach, which the United States is advocating in the \n     United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and \n     Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, is completely consistent with \n     the Law of the Sea Convention. If Flag States do not \n     cooperate in this fashion, I believe that other members of \n     the international community, particularly coastal States, \n     will become more aggressive in asserting their rights and \n     interests with respect to living marine resources. Indeed, we \n     have begun to witness such actions in recent years.\n       We do not have time to go into this critical subject at \n     greater length. We should recognize, however, the \n     contributions that the FAO Agreement has made to giving \n     content to the Flag State duties of the Law of the Sea \n     Convention. We look forward to the FAO Agreement's entry into \n     force and full implementation.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We generally ask too much of our international \n     institutions. The Law of the Sea Convention is not a panacea \n     that will make the oceans pristine and bountiful. Human \n     behavior has a much greater role to play.\n       In the last ten years we have seen progress made on a \n     number of fronts relating to the marine environment and high \n     seas fisheries. And I should note that I have recounted just \n     a few. These examples demonstrate, however, that it is \n     possible to give real substantive, positive, beneficial, \n     responsible content to that overused word ``cooperation.'' \n     There are, as well, recent major achievements in protection \n     of the marine environment from pollution, including, Marpol \n     and the London Convention prohibitions on the ocean dumping \n     of industrial waste and radioactive waste.\n       But, much remains to be done. The International Coral Reef \n     Initiative in which Japan and the United States are playing a \n     leading role is a step in the right direction. The Global \n     Conference on Land Based Sources of Marine Pollution to be \n     held in Washington at the end of 1995 offers the possibility \n     of beginning to come to grips with the most insidious of \n     ocean pollution problems. And, of course, there is the UN \n     Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \n     Fish Stocks in which we hope to make continuing progress in \n     the field of international fisheries cooperation.\n       The progress made in these areas to date is no doubt due in \n     part to the fact that we have begun to realize in a more \n     forceful way that we have to take care of the oceans--that we \n     have to agree to restrain our behavior--that we just can not \n     do what we want, that ships under our flags must abide by \n     rules of behavior to protect the marine environment and to \n     conserve fisheries. It is also due in part to the fact that \n     for eight years, from 1974-1982, the Third U.N. Conference on \n     the Law of the Sea brought the entire world together to \n     identify and negotiate the basic rules for traditional uses \n     of the oceans and to set them out in the Law of the Sea \n     Convention.\n       Thus, for the last ten years we have had a common \n     foundation upon which to build. The progress made on ocean \n     issues in the last ten years is directly attributable to the \n     fact that everyone agreed on the basic rules.\n       The entry into force of the Law of the Sea Convention \n     creates new opportunities to protect the marine environment \n     and to conserve its fisheries. Not the least of these \n     opportunities is found in the Convention's dispute settlement \n     provisions, which no amount of rhetoric can make customary \n     law.\n       No responsible actor, be it government, or individual, has \n     anything to fear from compulsory dispute settlement. The Law \n     of the Sea Convention's dispute settlement provisions, even \n     if never used, can deter improper behavior and compel \n     performance with basic rules and undertakings established by \n     the international community to protect the marine environment \n     and to conserve fisheries.\n       Let us ensure that we continue to make progress in these \n     all important areas now that the Convention is in force.\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\nThe 73 Countries That Have Ratified the Law of the Sea Convention as of \n                             March 1, 1995\n\n       Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, \n     Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Botswana, \n     Brazil.\n       Cameroon, Cape Verde, Comoros, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, \n     Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       Fiji, the Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-\n     Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq.\n       Italy, Jamaica, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia, Mali, Malta, Marshall Islands, \n     Mauritius.\n       Mexico, Federated States of Micronesia, Namibia, Nigeria, \n     Oman, Paraguay, Philippines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, \n     St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n       Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, \n     Singapore, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo.\n       Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Vietnam, \n     Yemen, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3862-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, careful readers of the New York Times \nmay have noticed something special below the nameplate on the front \npage of today's issue. Just beneath the familiar box--known as the left \near in newspaper parlance--announcing ``All the News That's Fit to \nPrint,'' it says the following: ``Vol. CXLIV . . . No. 50,000.''\n  The New York Times published its 50,000th issue today, a noteworthy \nmilestone even for a newspaper as seemingly eternal and immutable as \nthe great presence on West 43rd Street. The first issue of what was \nthen called the New-York Daily Times appeared 143 years, 7 days ago, on \nThursday, September 18, 1851. With only a very few interruptions, there \nhas been an issue of the Times every day ever since.\n  To give Senators a sense of the magnitude of this event: if one were \nto stack up 50,000 copies of the New York Times, the pile would be 300 \nfeet taller than the Empire State Building, which is 102 stories tall.\n  Mr. President, I am sure all Senators will join me in offering \ncongratulations and great good wishes to Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the \npublisher of the New York Times, and to everyone else at the Nation's \n``newpaper of record,'' on this historic occasion. I ask unanimous \nconsent that an article about the 50,000th issue from today's New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 14, 1995]\n\n      The Times Publishes Its 50,000th Issue: 143 Years of History\n\n                           (By James Barron)\n\n       This was front-page news in No. 1: ``In England, political \n     affairs are quiet.'' So were two stories about New-York, a \n     city that still had a hyphen in its name: a 35-year-old \n     Manhattan woman had died in police custody, and two Death Row \n     inmates were facing execution.\n       No. 25,320 was the one that said Lindbergh did it, flying \n     to Paris in 33\\1/2\\ hours. No. 30,634 described the Japanese \n     attack on Pearl Harbor. No. 35,178 reported that the Supreme \n     Court had banned segregation in public schools. No. 40,721 \n     said that men had walked on the moon, No. 46,669 that the \n     Challenger had exploded.\n       Today, 143 years and 177 days after No. 1 hit the streets, \n     The New York Times publishes Vol. CXLIV, No. 50,000--its \n     144th volume, or year, and 50,000th issue.\n       Except for the Super Bowl and the copyrights in late-late \n     movies, Roman numerals have gone the way of long-playing \n     phonograph records and rotary-dial telephones. And in an \n     industry where the numbers that matter most involve \n     circulation and advertising lineage, the 50,000th issue is \n     the journalistic equivalent of a car odometer's rolling over. \n     The day will be noted in passing at The Times. The newspaper \n     is preparing to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Adolph \n     S. Ochs's purchase of the paper next year.\n       ``The best way we can celebrate'' No. 50,000, Arthur Ochs \n     Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, said \n     yesterday in a memorandum to the staff, ``is by insuring that \n     our 50,001st edition is the best newspaper we can possibly \n     produce.'' He added: ``I'll fax you another memo when our \n     75,000th edition comes out.''\n       Still, 50,000 is a lot of anything. It is the number of \n     copies of John Steinbeck's ``Grapes of Wrath'' sold every \n     year in the United States, and the number of copies of Conrad \n     Hilton's autobiography, ``Be My Guest,'' stolen every year \n     from hotel rooms around the world, the number of rhinestones \n     that were in Liberace's grand piano and the number of \n     customers who crowd into Harrods in London every day.\n       If all 50,000\n        issues of The Times were stacked in a single pile, one \n     copy apiece, they would be roughly 300 feet taller than \n     the Empire State Building, or 200 feet taller than one of \n     the twin towers at the World Trade Center.\n       The idea of 50,000 days of headlines summons memories. \n     Going by the numbers, No. 18,806 said the Titanic had sunk \n     after slamming into an iceberg near Newfoundland. No. 28,958 \n     reported the explosion of the dirigible Hindenburg in \n     Lakehurst, N.J., and No. 34,828 the conquering of Mount \n     Everest. The 1965 blackout dominated No. 39,372; the one in \n     1977, No. 43,636.\n       The Times has covered 28 Presidents (29 if Grover \n     Cleveland, who served two nonconsecutive terms, is counted \n     twice), starting with Millard Fillmore. No. 4,230 reported \n     the death of Abraham Lincoln, No. 38,654 the assassination of \n     John F. Kennedy and No. 42,566 the resignation of Richard M. \n     Nixon.\n       Ten thousand issues ago, No. 40,000 reported that a crib \n     had been set up in the White House for Patrick Lyndon Nugent, \n     the five-week-old grandson of President Lyndon B. Johnson. He \n     was to stay in the White House while his parents took a \n     vacation in the Bahamas.\n       No. 40,000 also reported that Ann W. Bradley was engaged to \n     Ramsey W. Vehslage, the president of the Bonney-Vehslage Tool \n     Company in Newark. No. 40,076, on Oct. 15, 1967, reported \n     that their wedding had taken place the day before in \n     Washington. Mr. Vehslage is still the president of the \n     family-owned company. But the person who answered the phone \n     at Bonney-Vehslage last week was Ramsey Jr., born on June 18, \n     1971 (an event not reported in No. 41,418, published that \n     day).\n       Like No. 50,000 today, No. 30,000 hit the streets on a \n     March 14--Thursday, March 14, 1940. No. 10,000, on Sept. 24, \n     1883, reported that J.P. Morgan's yacht had sunk. That issue \n     had eight pages and a newsstand price of 2 cents. The daily-\n     and-Sunday subscription price in those days was $7.50 a year.\n       Vol. I, No. 1 of The New-York Daily Times, as the newspaper \n     was known, cost only a penny when it appeared on Thursday, \n     Sept. 18, 1851. There were no Sunday issues until No. 2,990 \n     on April 21, 1861. But each day brought a new number, and the \n     continuity was preserved even when the paper was not \n     published. After strikes in 1923, 1953 and 1958, special \n     sections were printed containing pages that had been made up \n     when the paper was not published.\n       Continuity was also preserved during a 114-day strike in \n     1962 and 1963. The Time's West Coast edition kept the numbers \n     going. (The West Coast edition had no Sunday issue, but for \n     the sake of continuity, the numbers skipped one between \n     Saturday and Monday.)\n       In 1965, when a 24-day strike halted The Times's operations \n     in New York, its international edition in Paris kept \n     publishing. That justified keeping the numbers going, even \n     though the international edition had its own different \n     sequence. For that reason, the number of the issue published \n     in New York on Sept. 16, 1965, the last day before the \n     strike, was No. 39,317. The first day after the strike was \n     No. 39,342. The numbers from 39,318 to 39,341 were never \n     used.\n       No such attempt at continuity was made during an 88-day \n     strike in 1978. By then, the Times had suspended its \n     international edition and become a partner in The \n     International Herald Tribune. The last issue of The Times \n     before the strike was No. 44,027. The first issue after the \n     strike was No. 44, 028.\n       The Times is one of the last papers in America to print the \n     volume number (in Roman numerals) and the issue number (in \n     Arabic) on its front page. Dr. Holt Parker, an associate \n     professor of classics at the University of Cincinnati, knows \n     when this tradition began: in the Middle Ages, when scribes \n     copied texts by hand.\n       Why does it continue? Dr. Parker can think of only one \n     reason. ``Because,'' he said, ``it looks good.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3867-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3867-S3868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE DEATH OF JUDGE VINCENT L. BRODERICK\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, New York and the Nation lost a most \ndistinguished attorney, jurist, and public servant with the death on \nMarch 3 of the Honorable Vincent L. Broderick.\n  Judge Broderick, or Vince as he was known to family and friends, was \nborn in 1920 into a family with a long tradition of public service. His \nfather, Joseph A. Broderick, was Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt's \nsuperintendent of banks, and was later appointed by President Roosevelt \nto the Federal Reserve \n[[Page S3868]] Board. His uncle, James Lyons, served as Bronx borough \npresident for 20 years. I might add that this tradition continues among \nother members of the family: Judge Broderick's nephew, Christopher \nFinn, who was my administrative assistant here in the Senate from 1987 \nto 1989, is now executive vice president of the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation.\n  As a young man, Vincent Broderick was a leader of the Young Democrats \nin the late 1940's. He was active in the presidential campaign of \nRobert F. Kennedy, and, after the assassination in 1968, in the \ncampaign of Hubert Humphrey. In 1969, after briefly considering running \nfor mayor of New York City, Mr. Broderick sought the nomination for \ncity comptroller. He was defeated in the primary by Abraham Beame. He \ncontinued to be active in Democratic politics in New York, working on \nSenator George McGovern's presidential campaign in New York in 1972.\n  Judge Broderick was the sort of uniquely able man who was called to \nduty by his Government again and again for the most difficult \nassignments. During World War II, he interrupted his studies at the \nHarvard Law School to enlist in the Army, where he served as a member \nof the amphibious engineers in the Pacific. He rose to the rank of \ncaptain before returning to law school, which he finished in 1948.\n  After practicing law with the Wall Street law firm of Hatch, Root & \nBarrett in the 1950's, Vincent Broderick became deputy commissioner for \nlegal matters of the New York City Police Department. He later served \nas general counsel of the National Association of Investment Companies \nbefore becoming chief assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district \nof New York.\n  In 1965, Vincent Broderick was appointed police commissioner by New \nYork City Mayor Robert F. Wagner. Running the Nation's largest police \nforce in the Nation's largest city has always been an extremely \ndifficult job, and never more so than in 1965, when New York City \nexperienced a terrible blackout, a crippling transit strike, the first \never visit by a Pope--Paul VI--and a bitter dispute with Mayor John V. \nLindsay over the handling of complaints against the police. Despite \nthese challenges, Vincent Broderick excelled as police commissioner and \nbecame known as a leader who refused to tolerate excessive force or \nracial prejudice in his department.\n  After returning to private practice for a time, Vince Broderick was \nnominated to the U.S. District Court for the southern district of New \nYork by President Ford, where he further distinguished himself as a \njurist of great wisdom and fairness. From 1990 to 1993, he served as \nchairman of the criminal law committee of the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States. He remained active as a senior judge in the southern \ndistrict until shortly before he died.\n  Judge Vincent Broderick was a public man of singular accomplishments \nand abilities, a model public servant and model gentleman whose \nextraordinary career and accomplishments in government and the law will \nbe studied and admired for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I commend to the attention of Senators Judge \nBroderick's obituary, which appeared last week in the New York Times, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 1995]\n\n            V. L. Broderick, Judge and Police Head, 74, Dies\n\n                        (By Lawrence Van Gelder)\n\n       Judge Vincent L. Broderick, who was a senior judge on the \n     Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York \n     and who served as New York City Police Commissioner during \n     the tumultuous period of transition, died on Friday at the \n     Stanley R. Tippett Hospice in Needham, Mass. He was 74.\n       Judge Broderick, who lived in Pelham Manor, N.Y., died of \n     cancer, said his daughter Kathleen Broderick Baird of \n     Needham.\n       In the eight months after he was appointed Police \n     Commissioner by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in May 1865, Judge \n     Broderick led the police force through the blackout that \n     blanketed the Northeast, through the biggest transit strike \n     in the city's history, through the first visit to New York by \n     a Pope, Paul VI, and through a conflict with Mayor John V. \n     Lindsay over the creation of a civilian board to review \n     complaints against the police.\n       Lean, calm and reflective, Judge Broderick was a relative \n     rarity in the ranks of commissioners--a man who had never \n     walked a beat. But he came from a background in law, law \n     enforcement and public service, having been deputy police \n     commissioner in charge of legal matters and, at the time of \n     his appointment as head of the 27,000-member force at the age \n     of 45, the chief assistant United States Attorney for the \n     Southern District of New York.\n       ``Its a problem job,'' he said when Mayor Wagner named him \n     to fill the unexpired term of Michael J. Murphy. ``It always \n     has been a problem job, and it always will be. But I think I \n     have the capacity to handle it.''\n       Judge Broderick wasted no time making clear where he stood. \n     In his first major appointment after assuming office, he \n     named a black captain, Eldridge Waith, to command the 32d \n     Precinct in Harlem. Two weeks later, at a time of racial \n     tensions throughout the country, Judge Broderick issued a \n     warning at a police officers' promotion ceremony:\n       ``If you will tolerate in your men one attitude toward a \n     white citizen who speaks English, and a different attitude \n     toward another citizen, who is a Negro or speaks Spanish--get \n     out right now. You don't belong in a command position.\n       ``If you will tolerate physical abuse by your men of any \n     citizen--get out right now. You don't belong in a command \n     position.\n       ``If you do not realize the incendiary potential in a \n     racial slur, if you will tolerate from your men the racial \n     slur--get out right now.''\n       In that same speech, Judge Broderick made clear where he \n     stood on the subject that prompted Mayor Lindsay to deny him \n     reappointment the following February: Judge Broderick opposed \n     a civilian review of the police. Recalling testimony he had \n     just given the City Council, he said, ``I opposed it on the \n     ground that we have civilian control of the Police \n     Department; that we have civilian review of citizens' \n     complaints; that outside review would dilute the quantum and \n     quality of discipline within the department, and that outside \n     review would impair the effectiveness of the police officer \n     in coping with crime on the streets.''\n       On leaving the Police Department, Judge Broderick, a \n     Democrat, returned to the private practice of law until 1976, \n     when he was appointed to the Federal bench by President \n     Gerald R. Ford, a Republican.\n       As a senior judge of the United States District Court for \n     the Southern District, he remained active until shortly \n     before his death. He presided over one of the longest \n     criminal trials in the Federal courts, an organized-crime \n     racketeering case that lasted more than 18 months. And, in a \n     ruling sustained by the Untied States Supreme Court that \n     resulted in new hiring practices by governments, he held for \n     the first time that political considerations had no place in \n     selecting personnel for nonpolitical government jobs.\n       He served from 1990 to 1993 as chairman of the criminal law \n     committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, \n     the policy-making arm of the judiciary, a position from which \n     he led a fight to permit judicial flexibility in sentencing.\n       In 1993, he told a House subcommittee that an inherent vice \n     of mandatory minimum sentences is that they are designed for \n     the most culpable criminal, but they capture many who are \n     considerably less culpable and who, on any test of fairness, \n     justice and proportionality, would not be ensnared. The 1994 \n     crime bill incorporated his view by permitting departures \n     from the mandatory guidelines.\n       Judge Broderick's father, Joseph, was Superintendent of \n     Banks for New York State and a governor of the Federal \n     Reserve Board. His brother Francis was a chancellor of the \n     University of Massachusetts in Boston.\n       Judge Broderick, who grew up in the Washington Heights \n     section of Manhattan, graduated from Princeton in 1941, began \n     studies at Harvard Law School and then enlisted in the Army. \n     As a member of the amphibious engineers he served in Cape \n     Cod, New Guinea, the Philippines and postwar Japan before \n     leaving service with the rank of captain to resume his \n     studies at Harvard. He graduated in 1948.\n       For the next six years, Judge Broderick practiced with the \n     Wall Street firm of Hatch, Root & Barrett. Then he was chosen \n     for the job of deputy commissioner for legal matters. After \n     two years, Judge Broderick left to become general counsel of \n     the National Association of Investment Companies.\n       In 1961, Robert M. Morgenthau, then the United States \n     Attorney for the Southern District, named him chief \n     assistant, and he served as acting United States Attorney in \n     1962, when Mr. Morgenthau ran unsuccessfully for governor \n     against Nelson A. Rockefeller.\n       In addition to his daughter Kathleen, Mr. Broderick is \n     survived by his wife, the former Sally Brine, of Pelham \n     Manor; three other daughters, Mary Broderick of East Lyme, \n     Conn., Ellen Broderick of East Chatham, N.Y., and Joan \n     Broderick of East Sandwich, Mass.; two sons, Vincent J. \n     Broderick of Westwood, Mass., and Justin Broderick of \n     Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Joseph, of Chapel Hill, N.C., \n     and eight grandchildren.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3867-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  What is the pending question before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business before the Senate is the \nKassebaum amendment, No. 331, to H.R. 889.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, although this amendment only directly affects workers \ninvolved in Government contracts, there is a deeper principle--a \nprinciple which goes to the rights of other workers to act in concert--\nin other words, to strike--to bring about improved working conditions, \nbetter wages, safety and health protection, and so on.\n It is a principle for which many men have given their lives, and, as \none who grew up in the southern coal mining counties of West Virginia, \nI rise today in opposition to this amendment.\n\n  I was raised by a coal miner; I married a coal miner's daughter; my \ndays as a boy and as a young man were spent in coal mining \nsurroundings, and as a young man I worked in the coal mining company \nstores in Raleigh County and Fayette County, West Virginia. I lived at \nvarious times in Mercer and McDowell and Raleigh and Fayette Counties--\nall of which were big coal producers--and my uncle, who raised me, \nworked in the mines of Mercer, McDowell and Raleigh counties. \nTherefore, I shall reflect in my remarks today, on the conditions under \nwhich the coal miners worked when I was a boy and which led to the \nunionization of the miners. I shall refer to the social conditions \nunder which the coal miners labored to raise their families, and I \nshall also speak of the trials and turmoils that attended the coming of \nthe union to the southern counties of my State. To fully comprehend the \nimportance of the ability of workers to collectively bargain--in other \nwords, to strike--and to belong to a union, no industry is more \nillustrive than the mining industry in West Virginia.\n  Geologists place the beginnings of the Coal Age at about 315 million \nyears ago, at the start of what is known in geologic time as the \nPennsylvanian period. This, together with the earlier Mississippian \nperiod, make up the Carboniferous Age. The first Coal Age is thought to \nhave lasted approximately 45 million years. Almost all of the valuable \ncoal seams were laid during the Pennsylvanian period. These deposits \nstretched from the Canadian maritime provinces south to Alabama, \ngenerally paralleling the Appalachian Mountain chain. West Virginia was \nblessed with a great concentration of this natural resource, and from \nthe beginnings of coal mining in the early 1800's, the economy, \nwelfare, and political life of West Virginia had been largely dependent \nupon this ``black gold,'' which underlies a great portion of my State. \nCoal was not a very important resource in West Virginia until after the \nCivil War, when the advent of the railroads made the coal fields \naccessible and brought thousands of miners into the State.\n  Since the advent of coal mining, West Virginia has been fertile \nground for outside exploitation, massive labor confrontations, union \norganizing, and a multitude of political intrigues. The coal fields \nhave provided great wealth to individuals and to corporations--many or \nmost of which, as I have stated, were outsiders--while many of the \nminers and their families have known equally great poverty. Great \nwealth for the outside interests; great poverty for the men who toiled \nin the mines to bring out the coal. West Virginians have seen their \nState's landscapes altered by underground mining and more recently by \nthe impact of strip mining, and the State's economy has been buffeted \nby the up-and-down cycle brought on by vacillating prices and other \neconomic factors, many or most of which were beyond the immediate \ncontrol of the coal miners themselves.\n  As Stan Cohen states in his fascinating treatise, titled ``King Coal, \na Pictorial Heritage of West Virginia Coal Mining,'' coal was sighted \nas early as 1790 in the northern part of the State, which, at that \ntime, was a part of the State of Virginia. As transportation methods \nimproved, the thick Pittsburgh coal seam, prominent in northern West \nVirginia, assured the area of a steady growth in coal production as \ntransportation methods improved. I quote from Mr. Cohen's work:\n\n       Mines were operating in the Fairmont region by 1850 for \n     local consumption. When the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad \n     reached Fairmont in 1853, markets opened up as far East as \n     Baltimore. The coal fields around Wheeling, and the Northern \n     Panhandle, were also mined prior to the Civil War; the coal \n     was needed for a fledgling iron industry in that city that \n     had begun before the War of 1812. The Baltimore and Ohio \n     reached Wheeling in the early 1850's, providing access to \n     eastern markets.\n       The northern coal fields assumed greater importance during \n     the Civil War, when supplies from Virginia were cut off. The \n     larger cities of the East needed a steady supply of coal for \n     heating purposes and war-related industries. Union forces \n     were able to keep the Baltimore and Ohio and the Norfolk and \n     Western railroads open to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, \n     notwithstanding constant raids by the Confederates. The end \n     of the war saw the expansion of coal mining in Marion, \n     Taylor, Preston, Monongalia, Barbour, and Harrison Counties.\n       The coal fields in southern West Virginia--those in Logan, \n     Mingo, Wyoming, Mercer, McDowell, Wayne, and Summers--had to \n     wait for the coming of the railroads to that section in the \n     late 19th century to realize their vast potential.\n\n  Mr. President, coal mining in southern West Virginia is a vast \nstorehouse of history. It is a story of struggle, oftentimes violent \nstruggle--a story of courageous men and women demanding and fighting \nfor their rights, for their dignity, and for their freedom. As David \nAlan Corbin, relates in his work titled ``The West Virginian Mine \nWars'':\n\n       Like the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's, the miners' \n     organizing effort had good and bad characters. Each\n      story involved brutality, destruction, and death. And both \n     movements are stories of oppressed, exploited people \n     fighting for dignity, self-respect, human rights, and \n     freedom. Both are stories of courageous men and women \n     doing heroic things under extraordinary circumstances \n     against extraordinary foes.\n\n  Corbin refers to the Matewan massacre in 1920 as having parallels to \nthe\n\n     Old-West-style shootout on the main street of town. The \n     killings of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers on the steps of the \n     McDowell County courthouse in Welch was a gangland type \n     ``hit'', and the ensuing march on Logan was Civil War.\n\n  And if ever my colleagues have the opportunity, I hope they will \nvisit Matewan, in Mingo County, the southernmost part of West \nVirginia. \n[[Page S3870]] McDowell County is an adjoining county. I lived in \nMcDowell County as a little boy, and my coal miner dad worked in mines \nat Landgraff.\n  There on the courthouse steps, ascending the hill leading to the \nMcDowell County Courthouse in Welch, can still be seen the bullet \nholes. Sid Hatfield and his wife, Ed Chambers and his wife, were \nascending the steps. Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers were shot dead by the \nBaldwin-Felts gunmen.\n  Mr. President, the West Virginia mine wars involved nearly every form \nof violence. Automatic rifles, machine guns, shotguns, handguns, and \ngrenades were utilized, and there was a train, ``Bull Moose Special.'' \nIt was fitted with guns and armor. There were passwords, spies, scouts, \nsentries, medical units, medics, and officers. It was a war fought also \nwith legal artillery--injunctions, yellow-dog contracts, housing \ncontracts and evictions, economic sanctions--as well as by jailings, \nbeatings, and murders. The West Virginia mine wars have been the \nsubject of several interesting historical studies, including Lon \nSavage's, ``Thunder in the Mountains,'' Howard Lee's ``Blood Letting in \nAppalachia,'' and David Corbin's work titled ``Life, Work, and \nRebellion in the Coal Fields.''\n  I do not recommend watching movies except excellent ones and there \nare not many American movies that are excellent. But I do recommend, if \nmy colleagues ever have the opportunity of doing so and they have not \ndone so already, I recommend they see ``Matewan.''\n  The coal miners' struggle for unionization was the culmination of \ndecades of exploitation and oppression, and it was fought for dignity, \nand political and social rights. Coal mining operations ran an \nauthoritarian system, the heart of which was the coal company town. The \ncoal companies, owned by outside interests, exercised enormous social \ncontrol over the miners. The coal company town was really not a town in \nthe usual sense of the word. But it was a complete, autonomous system. \nIn addition to owning and controlling all the institutions in the town, \ncoal company rule in southern West Virginia, according to David Corbin, \nand I can bear witness to the facts that he describes, because I grew \nup in those surroundings.\n  Coal company rule in southern West Virginia,\n\n     included the company doctor who delivered the babies, the \n     mines in which the children went to work, and the cemeteries \n     where they eventually were buried.\n\n  I have helped to bury coal miners on those hills. It is an \nexperience, carrying those heavy caskets along the hillsides and \ndigging the graves, as well. Company rule also included the company \npolice in the form of mine guards, who would toss the miners into the \ncompany jail--not into the county jail but the company jail--or \nadminister the company beating when the miners attempted to organize \ninto a union. It was a complete rule, and it was a ruthless rule in \nmany instances. Consequently, when the miners went on strike for their \nunion, they did so not for simple wage increases always, but, in many \ninstances, for their very dignity and freedom.\n  For millions of centuries, the hills and low mountains that cover so \nmuch of West Virginia slumbered in solitude. Mountain people were hard \nworking, tough, clannish, and, while normally friendly, they looked \nupon strangers with suspicion. Life on the whole was simple.\n  In the early days of the mining industry, a miner learned how to mine \nby experience. He would work with another miner or with his father \nuntil he felt confident enough to work at the coal face alone. The \nearly miner performed all mining tasks himself, including laying the \ntrack for the coal car, loading the car, and supporting the mine roof. \nAs production increased and companies grew, a division of labor was \ninstituted, with each miner having a specific task to perform. Young \nboys--12-year-olds, for example--often went into the mines with their \nfathers to learn the job. They were given odd jobs at first, such as \ndoor-tending, or ``trapping,'' which consisted of sitting near a \nventilation door and opening it--this is along the mine entrance. The \nmine perhaps had been driven a mile, two miles, or three miles or more \ninto the bowels of the Earth, and there were large fans that would \ncirculate the air through the entries. There were trap doors through \nwhich the motor, or earlier, the mules or ponies that pulled the mine \ncars, would travel. These boys would be employed to open the door and \nclose the door after the cart or the mine car had passed through the \ndoor with its load of coal.\n  So these boys were given odd jobs at first, such as door-tending or \n``Trapping,'' which consisted of sitting near a ventilation door and \nopening it as the mule drivers, or ``skinners,'' as they were sometimes \ncalled, passed through with their loads of coal.\n  In the days when my coal miner dad worked in the coal mines, the coal \nwas dug and loaded by hand, and the miner's work area around him was \nreferred to as his ``place.'' That is why a few days ago, when speaking \nagainst this amendment, I referred to, on one occasion, the ``coal \nminer's place.'' If he did not clean it up during the 9 or 10 or 12 \nhours, then someone else might take his job. The miners were told to \nclean up their ``place,'' and there was always someone waiting on their \njob. That meant he had to shovel up the coal, the rock, the slate--\nwhatever fell down when the dynamite went off--and clean it up, load it \ninto the car. Many times the miner worked on his knees, loading that \ncoal into the mining car.\n  Dynamite was used to bring down the coal, and the fallen coal was \nshoveled into one of the empty mine cars--a difficult job, especially \nin the low seams. There were some mines and some seams which enabled \nthe miners to stand erect and work, but there were some seams that were \nso low, the miners had to work on their knees--they could not stand \nerect--with millions of tons of rock overhead, working in the darkness \nto bring out the coal. Especially in low seams, as I say, it was a \ndifficult job and, in many instances, the miners worked in water holes.\n  While loading the coal, the miner had to remove the larger pieces of \nrock and slate so that he would not be ``docked'' for sending out \n``dirty'' coal. Lump coal sold at a premium price while pea-sized or \nslack coal sold for a lesser price. A miner hung a brass ``check'' on \neach car that he loaded in order to get proper credit for the coal that \nhe dug.\n  My dad's check number, I recall, was 232. Each car of coal that he \nloaded, he attached his brass check with No. 232 on it, so that when \nthe coal car was unloaded into the tipple and later into the railroad \ncars, he would get credit for having dug and loaded that carload of \ncoal.\n  In the mid 1920's, a miner would sometimes load more than 10 tons of \ncoal a day. Companies in those days would haul the coal to the surface \nusing mules or ponies, until small electric locomotives were \nintroduced.\n  One source of constant tension between miners and coal companies in \nthose days was the matter of fair payment to the miner for the coal \nthat he had dug and loaded. ``Short weighing,'' practiced by some \nunscrupulous companies to cheat the miners, occurred when the company \nweighman would record a weight less than the actual amount of coal in \nthe car. ``Dockage,'' to which I referred a little earlier, was an \narbitrary reduction in payment for impurities such as slate and rock \nloaded in the coal car. These practices became so commonplace that one \nof the first demands of the miners when the union was formed was for \ntheir own check-weighman to monitor the company check-weighman, because \nthe miners felt that only with such a system would they be paid a fair \namount for the coal that they had so arduously dug and loaded.\n  With the coming of hydraulically controlled machines, mining has \nbecome an automated industry, and highly skilled men and women operate \nthe complicated mining machinery of today. The pick and shovel mining, \nwhich constituted the life and times of the coal miners of my dad's \nday, are gone forever.\n  So, Mr. President, the West Virginia mountains had stood in untouched \nsolitude throughout the hundreds of millions or billions of years. With \nthe coming of large coal mining operations, in my boyhood and early \nmanhood years, coal mining camps were to be found all over the southern \ncounties of West Virginia. Large mine-mouths gaped bleakly from the \nhillsides. You travel along and see these mine openings in the Earth--\nlarge mine entry \n[[Page S3871]] openings. Gaunt tipples, miners' bathhouses, and other \nbuildings stared down upon the mining community itself from the slopes \nof the mountains. Railroads sent their sidings in many directions, and \nlong lines of squat mine cars ran along the narrow gauge tracks and \ndisappeared around the curves of the hills.\n  When unionism invaded these peaceful valleys, it made itself familiar \noften through bloody scenes. To the miner, his employment in the mines \nwas his only way of making a living--he knew no other trade--and if a \nconsiderable number of mines closed down, whole mining communities sat \naround idle. Many times, I have looked into family cupboards of miners \nand they contained only a little food, perhaps for a single meager \nmeal. I have seen the haunted look in the eyes of men who did not know \nhow they were going to provide for the immediate wants of their \nchildren and wives.\n  Outside interests, as I have stated, had bought up the land in large \nquantities, and many corporations sprang into existence, some of them \nwith the intention of mining the coal themselves, while others planned \nto lease their land to those who would do the mining. Some of the land \nwas bought by railroad companies that wanted it for the coal that it \nheld, as well as for rights of way. They used the coal to propel the \nlarge steam engines that pulled the long lines of coal cars over the \nhills and down the valleys. Manufacturing establishments in northern \nand eastern cities acquired some of it for their own future supplies of \ncoal, and public utility corporations did the same thing.\n  The first railroads into the State were the Chesapeake and Ohio, the \nBaltimore and Ohio, the Norfolk and Western and the Virginia.\n Miners came into the West Virginia valleys from western and central \nand southern Europe, as well as from the southern cotton fields of the \nUnited States. Operators would advertise for workers to take mining \njobs, and they came even from European countries and in the cotton \nfields of the South.\n\n  Welsh coal diggers came from the pits of Kidwelley; Englishmen came \nfrom Lancashire, and these mingled with Scotsmen and Hungarians and \nCzechoslovakians and Germans, Poles, and Austrians. There were large \nnumbers of Italians. As many as 25 or 30 nationalities can still be \nfound in the city of Weirton, in West Virginia's northern panhandle.\n  The typical coal mining community was not a town in the ordinary \nsense. The place where the town stood was the point at which a coal \nseam had been opened, buildings had been erected, and machinery had \nbeen installed. The dwellings, or shacks, clustered about the tipple or \nstraggled along the bed of the creek, and there seemed to be always a \ncreek in those coal mining communities. And these dwellings were \noccupied solely by the men who worked in the mines. Oh, there were some \nmanagement personnel--the store manager, company doctor, principal of \nthe nearby school. But other than that type of personnel, the houses \nwere occupied by miners.\n  These communities were really not called towns. They were more often \ncalled ``camps''--the mining camp down the way, or the Glen White \nmining camp, the Stotesbury mining camp, or the Slab Fork mining camp, \nthe Tams mining camp, or the mining camp at Helen, West Virginia.\n  No one owned his own house. He could not acquire title to the \nproperty. No one owned a grocery store or a garage or a haberdashery. \nThere was no Main Street of small independent businesses in the mining \ncamps. There was no body of elected councilmen to pass on repairs for \nthe roads or sanitation problems. There was no family physician who \nbuilt up a successful practice by competing with other physicians. The \ncoal company owned all of the houses and rented them to the miners. It \nowned the company store. It owned the pool room. It owned the movie \ntheater. It built the church. The company employed the physician and \ncollected a small sum monthly from each miner to help pay the company \ndoctor. The coal company controlled life and activities of the little \ncommunity. It was responsible for the sanitation and sewage disposal. \nThe company's ownership usually extended to the dirt roads that ran \nalongside the railroad tracks or through the middle of the mining camp \nalong by the creek.\n  Semimonthly paydays occurred and miners were given statements showing \nhow much they owed the company and how much the company owed them. \nAmong the items charged against the miners in this account were the \nindebtedness incurred by the miners at the company store, rent for \ntheir house, electricity for their house, heating, meaning coal; the \nminers heated their houses with coal, and they bought this coal from \nthe company for which they worked. They got it at a cheaper price, but \nthey paid for their coal. And also included in this account was a \nmonthly checkoff for doctor services or use of the hospitals. The \nhospitals usually were several miles away and located in the \nincorporated towns. There was a charge for use of the company washhouse \nin which to clean up after a day's work. The miner paid the same amount \nfor doctor and hospital services whether there was an illness in his \nfamily or not. An additional sum would be paid for such services as \noccurred with childbirth.\n  I was employed by the coal mining community company store at \nStotesbury. I first worked in a gas station pumping gas. We did not \nhave service stations in those days. Those were gas stations. And then \nI was a produce salesman for the coal company, at the coal company \nstore, and I was also a meat cutter. And when our first daughter was \nborn, my wife and I had two rooms in one of those coal company houses. \nThe company doctor attended my wife on that occasion. The doctor and I \nsat in the kitchen beside a wood-burning stove. My wife gave birth to \nour older daughter in the adjoining room. My wife's mother attended my \nwife.\n  The next morning, after the baby was born, the doctor was leaving the \nhouse. I said, ``How much do I owe you, Doctor?'' He said, ``$15.'' So \nmy wife and I still refer to our older daughter, Mona, as our ``$15 \nbaby.'' But that is the way it was in those days.\n  The miners used scrip largely in making purchases at the company \nstore. The scrip was in the form of small metal tokens rounded like \ncoins, stamped in various denominations. The companies accepted this \nscrip in lieu of real money at the pool room, at the movie theater, and \nat the company store.\n  Some mining towns were unsightly, unhealthful, and poorly looked \nafter. The surface privy was nearly everywhere in evidence and was a \nprevalent cause of soil pollution and its contents usually washed \ntoward the bed of the creek. There was not a sidewalk in many of the \nmining communities. On the other hand, some of the mining communities \nwere neat and attractive in appearance and well cared for. I can say \nthat about the mining community in which I lived as a boy. Many coal \nmining companies offered prizes for the best gardens, and they tried in \nother ways to keep the town pleasant in appearance. It was a \nsubservient existence--a civilization within a civilization. There was \nno escape from it.\n  One might leave this mining community, if he could get a job in \nanother mining community, but he just moved from one mining community \nto another mining community, and it was all the same--a civilization \nwithin a civilization.\n There was no escape from it, and its paternalism touched the miners' \nlives at every point. Any collective voice among them was smothered.\n\n  The United Mine Workers of America came to southern West Virginia \nwhen I was in my teens. By belonging to a labor union strong enough to \nnegotiate with the organized groups of coal operators--and the coal \noperators were organized--the miners were able to insist on better \nworking conditions, and they were able to bring about higher wages and \nshorter hours of work. They were able to exert collective pressure for \na greater degree of safety in the mines, and thus to reduce the number \nof fatalities, as well as the number of maimed and broken men. To \nminers who were pressed down by the pervading dependence of their \nexistence in company towns, the opportunity afforded by unions for \njoining with their fellow miners in some kind of collective effort was \na welcome escape.\n  From the cradle to the grave, the miners lived by the grace of the \nabsentee coal owner, one of whose visible \n[[Page S3872]] representatives was a deputy sheriff, who was often in \nthe pay of the coal owner. Everything belonged to the coal owners, and \nas I have already stated, home ownership was not permitted. To quote \nDavid Corbin:\n\n       The lease of the Logan Mining Company reads that when the \n     miner's employment ceases, ``either for cause or without \n     cause, the right of said employee and his family to use and \n     occupy premises shall simultaneously end and terminate.''\n\n  Almost every coal operation had its armed guard--in many instances \ntwo or more guards. Mine guards were an institution all along the \ncreeks in the nonunion sections of the State. As a rule, they were \nsupplied by the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency of Roanoke, Virginia and \nBluefield, West Virginia. I again quote from David Corbin's work. David \nCorbin is writing about the mine guards, about the employees of the \nBaldwin-Felts Detective Agency:\n\n       It is said the total number in the mining regions of West \n     Virginia reaches well up to 2500. Ordinarily they are \n     recruited from the country towns of Virginia and West \n     Virginia . . . and frequently have been the ``bad men'' of \n     the towns from which they came. And these towns have produced \n     some pretty hard characters. The ruffian of the West Virginia \n     mining town would not take off his hat to the desperado of \n     the wildest town of the wildest west.\n       These Baldwin guards who are engaged by the mining \n     companies to do their ``rough work'' take the place of the \n     Pinkertons who formerly were used for such work by the coal \n     companies.\n\n  No class of men on Earth were more cordially hated by the miners than \nwere those mine guards. If a worker became too inquisitive, if he \nshowed too much independence or complained too much about his \ncondition, Corbin states,\n\n       . . . he is beaten up some night as he passes under a coal \n     tipple, but the man who does the beating has no feeling \n     against him personally; it is simply a matter of business to \n     him.\n\n  In reference to the mine guards, Corbin writes,\n\n       They are the Ishmaelites of the coal regions for their \n     hands are supposed to be against every miner, and every \n     miner's hand is raised against them. They go about in \n     constant peril--they are paid to face danger and they face it \n     all the time. But they are afraid, for they never know when \n     they may get a charge of buckshot or a bullet from an old \n     Springfield army rifle that will make a hole in a man's body \n     big enough for you to put your fist in.\n\n  On May 19, 1920, several Baldwin-Felts agents with guns came to Mingo \nCounty to evict employees of the Stone Mountain Coal Company, who had \nbecome union members. An altercation arose between the Baldwin-Felts \nmen and persons gathered around the little railroad station in \nMatewan--miners and citizens--the Mayor was shot to death, a battle \nensued, seven Baldwin-Felts men were shot dead, along with two union \nminers, and, as I have already stated, the Mayor of Matewan.\n  When the UMWA began organizing in southern West Virginia, mine owners \nwould discharge men as rapidly as they joined the union--a spy system \nfurnished the information in many instances--and the discharged men \nwere also dispossessed, without advance notice, from company-owned \nhouses. As one coal miner was quoted in Dave Corbin's book,\n\n       I joined the union one morning in Williamson, and when I \n     got back to the mine in the afternoon, I was told to get my \n     pay and get out of my house before supper.\n\n  County Sheriffs and their Deputies were often in the pay of the coal \noperators, and the State government itself was clearly in alliance with \nthe employers against the mine strikers. Scores of union men were \njailed, and Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers, two union sympathizers, were \nshot dead by Baldwin-Felts Detectives on the courthouse steps at Welch, \nin McDowell County, on August 1, 1921. At Blair Mountain, in Logan \nCounty--I have crossed that mountain many times--a 3-day battle was \nfought. Quoting from a piece by James M. Cain, which appeared in the \n``Atlantic Monthly,'' October, 1922:\n\n       The operators hired four airplanes and bombed the miners. \n     Both sides used machine guns; both sides had a number of men \n     killed. Civil War had broken out afresh. It did not stop \n     until 2,000 federal troops were sent in on September 3. This \n     aroused the public again, but the thing was quickly \n     forgotten, and except for a Senatorial investigation, nothing \n     was done.\n\n  Corbin wrote:\n\n       Upon moving into a company town, a miner had to live in a \n     company house and sign a housing contract--\n\n  I had to do that. My wife's father had to do that.\n\n     that the courts of West Virginia subsequently ruled created a \n     condition not of landlord and tenant, but of ``Master and \n     Servant.''\n  Consequently, the coal company was allowed to unreasonably search and \nseize a man's house without any notice.\n\n       If we rent a miner a home, it is incidental to his \n     employment. And if a miner would undertake to keep anyone at \n     that home that was undesirable or against the interest of the \n     company, we will have him leave or have the miner removed.\n\n  On August 7, 1921, 6 days after the murder of Hatfield and Chambers \non the steps of the McDowell County courthouse, 5,000 coal miners met \nin Charleston, the State capital. Meetings were held in Kanawha, \nFayette, Raleigh, and Boone Counties to protest martial law in Mingo \nCounty and the Governor's refusal to lift it. There occurred an \nuprising of the southern West Virginia miners against the coal \nestablishment. Exploitation, oppression, and injustice had created a \ncommon identity and solidarity among the miners, and their geographic \nmobility had turned the hundreds of seemingly isolated company towns \ninto a single gigantic community.\n  Thousands of miners descended upon a place called Lens Creek, about \n10 miles south of Charleston. Their announced intentions were to march \nthrough Logan County, hang the county sheriff, blow up the county \ncourthouse on the way, and then to move on Mingo County, where they \nwould overthrow martial law and liberate their union brothers from the \ncounty jail. In the process, they would abolish the mine guard system \nand unionize the remainder of southern West Virginia. The marchers were \ngoing to fight for their union.\n  On August 26, the miners arrived at a 25-mile mountain ridge that \nsurrounds Logan and Mingo Counties. Here they met an equally strong, \ndetermined and well entrenched army composed of deputy sheriffs of the \ntwo counties, State police, State militia, and Baldwin-Felts guards. I \nquote from Corbin's work once more:\n\n       The miners who participated in the events swore themselves \n     to secrecy * * * the marcher used sentries, patrols, codes, \n     and passwords to guard the secrets from spies and reporters. \n     The secrecy was so tight that agents for the Department of \n     Justice and the Bureau of Investigation, as well as \n     reporters, though disguised as miners, were unable to attend \n     the most important meetings.\n       About 4,000 miners constituted the original army that \n     gathered at Lens Creek, but more miners joined the march \n     after it was underway. * * * Ten days after the miners had \n     assembled at Lens Creek, Governor Morgan reported that the \n     ``number of insurrectionaries are constantly growing.'' \n     Although an army officer sent to the battle observed that it \n     is ``humanly impossible\" to say how many miners participated, \n     an estimate of between 15,000 and 20,000 is probably safe.\n       The marchers had their own doctors, nurses, and hospital \n     facilities. They had sanitary facilities. The marchers were \n     fed three meals a day. The marchers bought every loaf of \n     bread, 1,200 dozen, in Charleston and transported the loaves \n     to their campsites * * *. To guard against infiltrators and \n     spies, the marchers used patrol systems and issued passes. \n     Orders were given on papers that carried the union seal and \n     had to be signed by a union official. The marchers used \n     passwords and codes. To attend a meeting during a march, a \n     miner had to give the password and his local union number to \n     the posted sentries. Discovering the password, a reporter \n     from the Washington Evening Star attempted to infiltrate a \n     meeting by giving a fake local union number. As he approached \n     the platform from which Keeney was about to talk, two miners \n     grabbed him from behind and carried him toward the woods. A \n     last minute shout to Keeney, whom he had interviewed before \n     the march, saved the reporter * * *. Keeney instructed the \n     miners merely to escort the reporter out of the meeting \n     grounds.\n       The miners were prepared to fight; they had to be, for they \n     not only sustained a week-long fight, but they also defeated \n     Sheriff Chafin's army of over 2,000 men, who were equipped \n     with machine guns and bombing planes. [Bill] Blizzard was \n     probably the generalissimo of the march. Approximately 2,000 \n     army veterans were the field commanders, and they instructed \n     the other miners in military tactics. A former member of the \n     National Rifle Team of the U.S. Marine Corp and a former \n     Captain in the Italian Army \n     [[Page S3873]] gave shooting lessons. Several former \n     officers, including an ex-Major drilled the miners. * * * \n     After watching several ex-servicemen drill the miners * * *, \n     a reporter walked to another area and heard an ex-serviceman \n     tell a squad of miners how to fight machine guns: ``lie down, \n     watch the bullets cut the trees, out flank'em, get the \n     snipers. * * *'' The local at Blair, having been given prior \n     instructions, had dug trenches in preparation for the \n     marchers. An advance patrol of 500 to 800 miners cut down the \n     telephone and telegraph lines and cleared a 65-mile area of \n     Baldwin-Felts guards. * * * The armed marchers were in \n     complete control of the area from South of Charleston to the \n     mountain range surrounding Logan and Mingo Counties. * * * \n     Company officials and their families fled the area.\n       Sentries were posted along the Blair Mountain ridge. Sharp \n     shooters with telescopic rifles were stationed at strategic \n     locations to ``clean out Sheriff Chapin's machine gun \n     nests.'' The battle raged for over a week. Both armies took \n     prisoners, * * * and both sides killed. * * * The federal \n     government moved to end the struggle that President Harding \n     called a ``Civil War''. The U.S. War Department sent \n     Brigadier General Henry Bandholtz to the battle front * * * \n     and ordered the miners to disburse. On August 30, the \n     President placed the entire state of West Virginia under \n     marshal law and issued a proclamation instructing the miners \n     to cease fighting and to return home.\n       By the morning of September 1, the miners had captured one-\n     half of the 25-mile ridge and were ready to descend upon \n     Logan and Mingo Counties. The President had already issued \n     orders for 2500 federal troops, 14 bombing planes, gas and \n     percussion bombs and machine guns to be sent into the area. \n     The armed march and the Mingo County strike were doomed; \n     Chafin, the Baldwin-Felts mine guard system, and the southern \n     West Virginia coal establishment were saved.\n\n  The depression came, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President, the \nUMWA organized miners in West Virginia, and the long struggle was \nended. The coal miners had fought bloody battles, and they had won. The \nevictions stopped, the mine guards became a thing of the past, and \ncollective bargaining brought better living conditions to the families \nof those who worked for King Coal. The coming of the miner's union also \nresulted, over a period time, in improved health and safety conditions \nin and around the mines.\n  Many terrible mining tragedies occurred during the early half of the \n20th century, and it will be my purpose here to afford only a brief \nglimpse of some of these. My purpose is not to condemn or to blame \nthose in charge of the industry, nor the State government inspectors \nwho, at times, may have been lax or coerced politically and who may \nhave looked the other way when dangerous situations prevailed, hoping \nthat such conditions would go away. But in some such cases, the mine \nblew up and many men died.\n  From January 21, 1886, when the explosion occurred in the mine at \nNewburg, West Virginia, to November 20, 1968, at least 43 major mine \nblasts in West Virginia took place. There were even more lesser ones, \nfor example, the explosion at McAlpin, West Virginia, a mining \ncommunity adjoining the Stotesbury community, where I lived as a boy \nand as a young man; where I married, where our first daughter was born, \nwhere I worked in the company store. The McAlpin explosion took place \non Monday, October 22, 1928.\n  I can remember it as though it were yesterday.\n  It was a dust explosion, since the mine had never shown any methane \ngas reading. One of my classmates at Mark Twain School suffered the \nloss of a brother in that explosion. Sitting at the Mark Twain School, \nwhere I was a student, one could look out the window across a little \nvalley to the mountain on the other side of the Virginian and C \nRailroads and there on that mountain was the opening of the drift mine, \nowned by the McAlpin Coal Company.\n  When the blast went off, no word of mouth was needed to tell the \npeople that something was wrong at the mine. The running and shouting \nof the men outside the mine was dreadful news to those in view. It \nhappened about 2:30 in the afternoon on an overcast day, weather being \nalmost always adverse when a mine disaster happened. There were 60 men \ninside the mine who were unhurt, because the blast was confined to a \nsmall area. It was decided that a miner had used a ``dobie'' shot which \nblew him several feet down the entry. The five other victims presumably \ndied from afterdamp or asphyxiation from smoke and fumes. By 8:30 that \nevening, all bodies had been brought from the mine. I can recall being \nat the foot of the hill leading to the mine that evening, when miners' \nwives boiled coffee over fires built at the foot of the hillside and \nserved it to the rescue men and to other workmen and onlookers. I shall \nnever forget the tearful faces of women who were wives or mothers or \nsisters of the men who were in the explosion. Relatives at the scene \nasked to see the bodies that were brought to the outside of the mine to \nget a glimpse or to identify their kin. The weeping and wailing of \nwives and mothers and children were a sight that never leaves one's \nmemory.\n  The calamity at Newburg in 1886 was West Virginia's initiation into \nthe horrors of mine explosions. The explosion killed 39 miners in the \ntwinkle of an eye on that cold afternoon on January 21, 1886, in this \nsmall community just 12 miles east of Grafton in Taylor County. Not a \nsoul is alive today who remembers the Newburg mine disaster. However, \nthe town of Newburg keeps its history well. The people are aware that, \nonce upon a time long ago, 39 men and boys died horribly underground. A \ncemetery on the hill holds the remains of nearly all of them. The town \nno longer has a mine. The spot where the shaft was sunk is now a barren \nspace. The old crumbling coke ovens are now buried in a jungle of \nundergrowth and big trees. Newburg was once an exciting town with its \ncrack B passenger train with sleek pullmans, pulled by \nhigh-wheeler coal- burning engines en route from Baltimore to \nCincinnati and points West. All stopped at Newburg. There were grist \nmills, good hardware stores, and numerous businesses. A bank stood on \nthe corner, and nearby was a drugstore. Of course, today, the railroad \nstation is no more. The bank is gone. And, as always, there were \ninteresting stories to be told. Two men who died in the blast were \nmarried together on Christmas Eve, they lived under the same roof, and \nthey died together in the explosion 28 days later, on January 21. The \ncemetery where many of the victims lie is still visible.\n  Men who volunteer to enter a blast-torn mine are a breed of men who \nstand alone--men who dare to go where an explosive element may \nregenerate and blow again or to enter where the deadly afterdamp or \nvarious gas combinations may destroy them. They hope that men alive may \nbe huddled inside a barricaded room awaiting rescue, not death. Miners \nnever hedge, but prepare, and then go inside if heat and smoke do not \ndrive them back.\n  For many years, Mr. President, there was only charity--only charity--\nto assist families that were left destitute by the loss of the family \nprovider. There was no Social Security. There were no welfare programs. \nThere was no workers' compensation. Many years passed and many miners \nsuffered before a system of compensation and Social Security was set \nup.\n  The most devastating mine explosion in West Virginia history occurred \nat Monongah, West Virginia. Those are the first eight letters in the \nname of the river, the Monongahela River. The town was named Monongah.\n  This devastating mine explosion took place on December 6, just a few \ndays before Christmas, in 1907. Lacy A. Dillon, in his book ``They Died \nin the Darkness,'' tells the awful story.\n\n       On Friday morning, December 6, 1907, the men and boys \n     walked to the pits in a cold, drizzling rain. The barometer \n     was low and the humidity high. . . . When 361 men entered the \n     mine that December 6 morning, they took 361 reasons for an \n     explosion by carrying 361 open-flame lights.\n\n  My dad worked in the mines. He used a cloth cap and affixed to that \ncloth cap was a carbide lamp. He would send me to the store to buy some \ncarbide or a flint for his carbide lamp. And the carbide lamp furnished \nthe light for the working place. It was an open flame. And so, 361 men \nwalked into that mine on that morning with 361 carbide lamps, open-\nflame lights.\n\n       Every time the motor arm arced on the trolley wire, a \n     chance for a blowup existed; as did countless other ways that \n     today are prohibited by State and Federal laws. The method of \n     forcing air into a mine, or sucking the air through a mine, \n     as the case might be, was not so well tested in 1907.\n      . . . The Monongah mine blew with a jar, an artillery-like \n     report, a flame, and earth-shake, and billows of smoke. \n     Concrete sidewalks buckled and broke, the streets opened \n     in fissures, buildings shook, and some old weak ones \n     collapsed. People rushed outside in horror and amazement, \n     knowing what had happened, \n     [[Page S3874]] since mining towns near ``hot'' mines are \n     always aware that the mines can explode. Soon, panic broke \n     loose with people rushing downhill toward the mines, . . . \n     that such a blast must have killed all men and boys inside, \n     was felt by all. Those related to the men inside, especially \n     the women, became near crazed. One woman pulled her hair out \n     by the handful; another woman disfigured her face with her \n     fingernails, screaming frantically in the meantime. The force \n     of the explosion blew away the fan house, wrecked the fan's \n     workings, destroyed the boiler house completely, . . . some \n     of the buildings near the drift mouth were blown across the \n     Westfork River, landing in pieces on the far bank. In 1907, \n     there were no organized and equipped rescue squads as came \n     into use later. Rescue and recovery of bodies depended on \n     volunteers. . . . Women, children, and other relatives \n     grouped as near as possible to the pit-mouths hoping for a \n     miracle. Some of the women had become stoically \n     philosophical, showing much restraint, while others gave vent \n     to their grief. . . .\n       Mechanics worked frantically to restore air into the mines \n     . . . crews went inside hanging brattices . . . the men began \n     finding the dead ponies and mules following the explosion, \n     the coal company employed a troop of doctors from Fairmont to \n     report to Monongah. They stood around bonfires all night \n     waiting to administer to survivors. None ever came. They \n     remained through Saturday, and by that time, it was known \n     that the only big need for professionals was undertakers. \n     Coffins by the carload were ordered from Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania and Zanesville, Ohio. They were nothing more \n     than plain rectangular wooden boxes with no inside lining. \n     Additional men were employed to tack cloth inside them to \n     keep the body from the bare walls. By Tuesday night, 149 \n     bodies had been recovered. The full crew of men were digging \n     graves on the hillsides in Monongah. The town was overrun \n     with curious spectators. When evening began to fall, everyone \n     tried to leave at the same time and on the same street car. \n     As soon as possible after the explosion, an appeal was sent \n     out, first, to the people of West Virginia, and then to the \n     nation, to come to the assistance of Monongah. Money, lots of \n     it, was needed at once (in those days, as I stated, there was \n     no compensation, no Social Security), as well as clothing, \n     food, medicine. It was winter, and snow fell two days after \n     the blast. The Fairmont Coal Company gave $17,500 while \n     Andrew Carnegie of Pittsburgh sent $2,500. Other \n     organizations and individuals all over the nation began to \n     respond.\n       Over 250 women became widows, and 1,000 children became \n     fatherless. A survey indicated that 64 widows were pregnant. \n     The company cancelled all debts for the widows and other \n     dependents at the company store. Credit was then allowed for \n     all of them. Those who lived in the company houses were \n     notified that no house rent would be collected so long as \n     they remained single. By noon Monday, December 12, there had \n     been recovered 297 bodies. The temporary morgue was working \n     overtime. As soon as a body could be prepared it was taken to \n     the home of the victim to await funeral services, for burial \n     quickly was necessary. Extra ministers of different faiths \n     came in to assist. On December 19, just 6 days before \n     Christmas, superintendent W.C. Watson announced that 338 \n     bodies had been brought from the mine. The blast mangled and \n     burnt some of them beyond recognition and some were never \n     identified.\n       Human interest stories, as I said a moment ago, always \n     occur in times of tragedy, one pitiful case was when the \n     corpse was brought home, seven days after the explosion, the \n     widow gave birth to a child two hours later. Then there was a \n     Mrs. Davies, who lived on the west side of Monongah, lost her \n     husband in the explosion and his body was never found. She \n     went down the hill each day the mines ran after the explosion \n     and got a burlap sack of coal from the mine cars, carried her \n     burden home up the mountainside and deposited it near her \n     house. She never burned a lump of it or allowed anyone else \n     to do so. When asked why she piled this unused coal daily, \n     she stated that she had hopes of retrieving some of her lost \n     husband's body. She was a young woman when the tragedy \n     happened, and she lived to be an old lady. At her death, her \n     sons gave the coal to the churches of Monongah. The coal pile \n     had grown to an enormous size.\n\n  Many of the widows were foreigners and unaccustomed to American ways. \nAfter the catastrophe, several of them were frustrated and wanted to \nreturn to their homelands. Money was given and arrangements made for \nthem to go. Several widows were also in Europe when the mine blew. One \nboarding house in Monongah kept only miners, and all of them reported \nfor work on that fateful morning. None of them came to supper that \nevening, leaving 17 empty chairs at the dining table. Their bodies lay \nsomewhere under the mountain sprawled in total darkness, burned and \nmangled. The final count showed that 171 Italians, 52 Hungarians, 15 \nAustrians, 31 Russians, and 5 Turkish subjects were killed.\n  The last major mine explosion in West Virginia occurred at \nFarmington, in Marion County, on November 20, 1968, and perhaps some of \nmy colleagues will remember having read about that catastrophe. The \nmine was owned and operated by the Consolidation Coal Company. After \nseveral days had passed, and repeated efforts had been made to reenter \nthe mines and remove the bodies, the mine officials made their final \ndecision. They concluded that the 78 men who remained in the mine were \ndead, and that the mine must be sealed. The officials sent word to the \nrelatives of the entombed men and other concerned citizens to meet at \nthe little Methodist Church. The people assembled in the evening, a \nsomber time and in dreary weather. The lights inside dispelling the \noutside gloom, and the fact that all assembled were in the House of \nGod, relieved some of the despair of man's inevitable fate.\n  The company official announced the decision to the weeping and \npraying people who felt that this announcement was coming. The official \nwas humble and brotherly and his statements showed much compassion for \nthe bereaved. The 78 humans, created in God's own image, lay inert and \ntoday they lie in the totally dark caverns of the Consol Mine to await \nthe day when mankind will kindly bring their bodies or their skeletons \nto daylight.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the many tragic stories of \nsorrow and death that have occurred in the history of coal mining in \nWest Virginia. It was not until the union came to West Virginia, that \nenlightened state and federal governments acted to legislate health and \nsafety laws to protect the lives of the men who bring out the coal. It \nhas been a long history--a long history--of struggle and deprivation, \nof poverty and want, of harassment, intimidation, and murder, and it \nhas been a story of courage and determination. The coal miner is a \nbreed almost to himself. He lives dangerously, and he has borne humbly \nthe edict, pronounced by the Lord when Adam and Eve were driven from \nthe Garden of earthly paradise: ``In the sweat of thy face shalt thou \neat bread, til thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou \ntaken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.''\n  Mr. President, this short history of the introduction of collective \nbargaining in the coal mining towns of West Virginia is illustrative of \nmany struggles waged by other working people throughout the United \nStates. In those days about which I have spoken, unions and strikes \nwere instrumental in winning minimum safety, health, and wage levels \nfor workers. Management fought against the unions, and against any \nimprovements in working conditions or benefits that cost them money and \nate into their profits.\n  Today, however, unions are fighting a rearguard action. They are \nfighting to protect wages, safety and health benefits and pensions from \ncuts that owners and managers claim are necessary in order to be \ncompetitive. Unions have been willing to make concessions, many \nconcessions, in order to keep the companies their members work for \ncompetitive and profitable. American productivity has been increasing. \nToday in West Virginia, we have roughly 20,000 coal miners. They \nproduce the same amount of coal that was produced by 125,000 coal \nminers when I first came to the Congress 42 years ago. But the unions \nowe it to their members to protect them from deep cuts in wages and \nbenefits, from cuts that push workers and their families to the poverty \nlevel. Unions also owe it to their members to protect the pensions that \nwill allow union workers to maintain a reasonable standard of living \ninto their old age.\n  This is important work. Many nations do not have unions, or they \nactively discourage workers from bargaining collectively. In the \noverview of the ``1994 Report to Congress on Human Rights Practices,'' \nreleased in February, 1995, the Department of State notes that\n\n       [t]he universal right most pertinent to the workplace is \n     freedom of association, which is the foundation on which \n     workers can form and organize trade unions, bargain \n     collectively, press grievances, and protect themselves from \n     unsafe working conditions. Just as they did, Mr. President, \n     in the mining communities of West Virginia when I was a boy \n     and when my dad was a coal miner, when my wife's father was a \n     coal miner, when my brother-in-law's father was a coal miner \n     and was killed in a slate fall, when my brother-in-law was a \n     coal miner, my brother-in-law who later died of \n     pneumoconiosis, black lung.\n   [[Page S3875]] The report goes on to say,\n\n       In many countries, workers have far to go in realizing \n     their rights. Restrictions on workers range from outright \n     state control of all forms of worker organization to webs of \n     legislation whose complexity is meant to overwhelm and disarm \n     workers . . . Trade unions are banned outright in a number of \n     countries, including several in the Middle East, and in many \n     more, there is little protection of worker efforts to \n     organize and bargain collectively. Some protesting workers \n     have paid with their lives; others, most notably in China and \n     Indonesia, have gone to jail simply for trying to inform \n     fellow workers of their rights. We also see inadequate \n     enforcement of labor legislation, especially with regard to \n     health and safety in the workplace.\n\n  These, then, Mr. President, are the countries that U.S. businesses \nare trying to compete with. These are the kind of working conditions \nthat American workers, through their unions, have fought so hard \nagainst.\n  If American workers lose their ability to strike--and I do not \ncondone all strikes or all strikers; I have never condoned lawlessness \nin the course of a strike--never--but most of the strikes have been \nlawful strikes. Lawful--that is what we are talking about here today, \nin connection with this amendment and in connection with the \nPresident's order. And I say parenthetically that I am not enthusiastic \nabout Executive Orders. It is my information that there have been over \n14,000 Presidential Executive orders going back over the many decades, \nand I am doing a little research on that. I hope one day I will have a \nlittle more information than I now have in that regard.\n  But I have to oppose this amendment. How can anyone do otherwise \ncoming from my background--my background--with flesh and blood ties \nwith the men who bring out the coal?\n  If American workers lose their ability to strike and play their trump \ncard against owners and management, many will not accede to reasonable \nconcerns about reductions and working conditions, hours, wages or \nbenefits, and American workers could return to the days of the coal \nminers before collective bargaining.\n  The miner's only capital, the miner's only capital are his hands, his \nback, his feet, and his salty sweat.\n  Furthermore in Canada, Japan, France, Germany, and other countries of \nEurope, the rights of employees to strike are protected, and the use of \npermanent replacement workers is not permitted. These restrictions \napply to the use of permanent replacement workers during all legal \nstrikes, not just workers involved with government contracts.\n  If the Senate upholds the amendment now before us, I think it sends a \nterrible signal. If this amendment is passed, management is given a \ngreen light to simply replace workers who do not accept whatever \nmanagement decrees. It sends a red light to workers and unions to stop \nstriking, no matter how unreasonable the cuts or conditions, and no \nmatter how obdurate the management negotiators. Not all management is \ncold and heartless, not all by any means. But we do not want to go \nbackward in time, and the coal miners do not rush to return from whence \nthey came. If you strike, no one will support you, and management will \njust hire new workers, desperate for any job, no matter if it is \nunsafe, or for wages and benefits more suitable to a Third World \ncountry than to the United States.\n  The amendment before us, opponents will say, affects only the \nPresident's Executive order, which only affects Federal contracts in \nexcess of $100,000. That is true, but the message that the passage of \nthis amendment sends, affects far more than the Executive order. It \nspeaks as a matter of principle to the entire spectrum of labor \nrelations and undermines the basic right of workers to organize, to \nbargain collectively, and to strike if necessity demands it.\n  Mr. President, I have seen what life in the United States can be like \nwithout that right, as I have recalled today, and I cannot support what \nthis amendment would do. I urge the defeat of the cloture motion and \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The absence of a quorum having \nbeen noted, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3869-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3875-S3889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 1) \n     to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on \n     States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership \n     between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal \n     governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, \n     local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a \n     manner that may displace other essential governmental \n     priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays \n     the costs incurred by those governments in complying with \n     certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations; \n     and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of March 13, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 3 hours debate equally divided \non the conference report.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nvote on the conference report on S. 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is my understanding that vote will occur tomorrow, \nimmediately following the 10:30 cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we have certainly come a long way \nsince May 1993 when we first began this effort. Now, 22 months later--\nwith Governors, mayors, county commissioners, tribal leaders, school \nboard members, and business leaders throughout the country looking on--\nCongress is about to end the debate on mandate relief, and begin a new \npartnership with States, cities, counties, tribes, schools, and the \nprivate sector by voting on final passage of the conference report on \nS. 1 the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  This bill has been described as landmark legislation, as far-reaching \nand visionary. It is all of those. Ever since 1791 when the 10th \namendment was first ratified the Federal Government has slowly eroded \nthe power of the States. Today, with passage of S. 1, we begin to \nreverse that role. S. 1 is founded on the premise of responsibility and \naccountability. This will change the mind set of Washington, DC, from \nthis point forward.\n  First, it requires the Federal Government to know and pay for the \ncosts of mandates before imposing them on State, local, and tribal \ngovernment.\n  Second, the Federal Government should know the costs and impacts of \nmandates before imposing them on the private sector.\n  S. 1 thoroughly reforms the process by which Congress and Federal \nagencies impose new mandates on the public and private sector. Congress \nmust identify the costs of new mandates imposed on State and local \ngovernments and the private sector. Congress must pay the costs of the \nnew mandates on State and local governments by either providing \nspending, increasing receipts or through appropriations. If a mandate \nis to be paid for with a future appropriation, the appropriation must \nbe provided for the mandate to take effect. If subsequent \nappropriations are insufficient to pay for the mandates, the mandates \nwill cease to be effective unless Congress provides otherwise by \n[[Page S3876]] law within 90 days of the beginning of the fiscal year.\n  This process is enforced by a point of order. Legislation\n   that does not meet these requirements can be ruled out of order, \nblocking further consideration in the House and Senate. Debate \ncontinues only if a majority of the House and Senate votes to do so. A \nrollcall vote will decide whether the Senate and House should consider \nunfunded mandate legislation. S. 1 applies to all legislation--\ncommittee bills, House and Senate floor amendments, motions and \nconference reports--containing mandates.\n\n  Required cost estimates of legislated mandates will be done by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CBO will consult with State \nand local officials in preparing estimates.\n  Existing State and local government mandates will be reviewed by the \nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. This Commission, \ncomprised of State, local and Federal officials, will report to the \nPresident and Congress on existing mandates that should be modified or \nrepealed. The Commission's final report is due in 12 months.\n  In developing legislation and Federal rules affecting State and local \ngovernments, Congress and Federal agencies are to consult with State \nand local government officials in the drafting of legislation.\n  S. 1 does not apply to certain mandates, including those that enforce \nconstitutional rights of individuals, prohibit discriminations on the \nbasis of race, age, religion, national origin, handicapped or \ndisability status, are necessary to protect national security or \nprovide for emergencies.\n  S. 1 applies to legislation being considered in Congress that imposes \nmandates of greater than $50 million on State and local governments and \n$100 million on the private sector. S. 1 applies to regulations being \nconsidered by Federal agencies that are greater than $100 million. S. 1 \nwill apply to legislation considered in Congress either 90 days after \nadditional appropriations are provided to CBO to do required cost \nestimates or January 1, 1996, whichever comes first.\n  S. 1 got better and smarter during the legislative process. S. 1 was \nbetter than last year's bill; after floor consideration, S. 1 was \nbetter than when it was first introduced. The record will show that a \nnumber of Senators made important contributions to this bill. My \napproach to amendments was simple. If they improved the bill, if they \nclarified the bill, if they made the bill smarter, I wanted to get \nthose amendments in this bill. There were 9 strengthening amendments to \nS. 1 that were agreed to and we tabled 18 weakening amendments. Two \nexamples of amendments that strengthen S. 1 were Senator Byrd's \namendment that improved and perfected the point of order and Senator \nMcCain's amendment that applied the point of order to appropriations.\n  I felt we took a solid bill in S. 1 to the conference committee, and \nas chairman of the conference, I worked to protect the Senate position. \nVirtually every amendment adopted by the Senate is in this report.\n  As Senators know, it took several weeks of negotiations between the \nHouse and Senate to write this final conference report. I want to \nreview the major issues that the conferees had to resolve.\n  First, there is the issue of judicial review. As Senators know S. 1 \nsaid that nothing in this bill was judicially reviewable. The House \nbill provided that virtually everything contained in its unfunded \nmandates bill would be reviewed by courts.\n  To understand the significance of these two approaches, remember that \nin S. 1 we required that federal agencies do cost/benefits analyses of \nmandates imposed on State, local and tribal Governments. In S. 1 we \nadded a cost benefits analysis for the private sector. This requirement \nbegan as a codification of the Reagan Executive order on federalism and\n was designed to provide general direction to agencies and foster \ngreater sensitivity on the issue of mandates. The Executive order did \nnot provide for review of agency compliance with the Executive order's \nrequirements and it also allowed agencies to seek waivers of the \nrequirements imposed by the Executive order for cause.\n\n  I supported the lack of judicial review in S. 1 for good reason. \nFirst, my State of Idaho has been devastated by the ability of private \nindividuals and philosophically motivated groups to slow down or stop \nlegitimate and necessary natural resource industries in my State \nthrough the use of judicial review of agency decisionmaking. Timber and \nsalvage sales for one have been delayed to the point that the forests \nof Idaho have been turned into a tinder box for yearly summer forest \nfires. Second, I supported the concept of no judicial review in the \noriginal S. 1 because I did not think that the requirements of title I \nof this bill, with their emphasis on legislative operation should allow \njudicial review. I saw a possibility of unconstitutional interference \nif we were to invite the judicial branch into the workings of Congress.\n  The House bill, H.R. 5, differed from S. 1 in a most significant way. \nThe House did not include in its bill a prohibition of judicial review. \nIn fact instead of addressing it, the House bill simply avoided the \nissue entirely. As a result, under H.R. 5, all agency rulemakings would \nbe subject to the Administrative Procedures Act in title 5 of the \nUnited States Code. Under the House bill, virtually everything could be \nreviewed and interpreted by the courts. Courts could have the power to \nsay whether a cost estimate was correctly prepared, whether agencies \nhad consulted enough economists, or had consulted the right experts. \nFurther, courts could have stopped any and all rules from being issued \npending the completion of this analysis.\n  I am no fan of agency rulemakings. I support agency rulemaking \nmoratoriums. We have had enough rules and the people of America want \nand need a rest from the heavyhanded Federal bureaucrats who make their \nlivelihoods from dictating Federal policy to the people who pick up the \ntab. But neither am I a proponent of putting lawyers to work \nchallenging rules for the sake of delay or wasting the taxpayers money \nin time consuming Federal rules that languish in the courts.\n  Therefore, in conference we were faced with a couple of very \ndifficult problems. We had a Senate bill which passed with a 90-percent \nmajority without judicial review and we had a House bill which had \npassed with an almost identical percentage of approval which had \nvirtually unfettered judicial review. The main reason that the House \nwanted judicial review was the belief that Federal agencies were \nignoring the requirements of Congress. One of the statutes they cited \nin support of their assertion was the Regulatory Flexibility Act. That \nact is not judicially reviewable and there is general belief that the \nagencies have a poor record of compliance. The House therefore wanted \nto make sure that the executive branch would observe the requirements \nof Congress--not an unreasonable request.\n  As a result of the inherent conflict between the parties on this \nissue, I suggested that we develop a checklist approach to a limited \njudicial review. The theory would be that we should provide a method \nwhich would ensure that agencies would provide the analysis without \nallowing courts to impose their judgement on the subjective quality of \nthe agency's compliance. It is important to note that the analyses \nrequired by S. 1 act as additional requirements on statutes creating \nmandates. We call the statute actually creating the mandate the \nunderlying statute. We wanted to ensure that the cost/benefits \nrequirements of S. 1 would not supersede cost/benefit analyses in \neither an existing law or require a cost benefit analysis where one was \nspecifically prohibited in an underlying statute.\n  The conference committee reviewed what title II directed agencies to \ndo to make sure that agencies could meet the requirements. We cannot \ncomplain of an agency's failure of compliance with the requirements of \nCongress if\n we are irresponsible in what we ask them to do and if we are vague in \nour instructions. Therefore we had to redraft the requirements of title \nII in S. 1 to make sure that those requirements were tighter, more \nefficient and addressed the problem we sought to resolve.\n\n  Let me take a second to talk about the changes to title II of S. 1 as \nit comes out of conference. Recognize that most of the changes to title \nII are as a result of our need to tighten up \n[[Page S3877]] the requirements if we are going to have judicial \nreview.\n  S. 1 as passed by the Senate provided that agencies would assess the \neffect of mandates on State, local government and the private sector \nand seek to minimize the burdens. However, if you are going to allow \njudicial review, minimizing the burden is so unspecific and so \nsubjective that virtually every rulemaking would be challenged on that \nbasis alone.\n  S. 1, as passed by the Senate, provided that agencies would develop a \nplan to allow elected State, local and tribal officials to have input \ninto agency rulemakings, but there was some fear that the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act could be used to prevent local officials from \nmeeting with Federal officials. Judicial review of this issue would be \na haven for lawyers. As a result of some of these problems and others, \nwe knew that some redrafting of title II would be in order and would be \nnecessary.\n  Title II as it comes out of conference is more objective, more \nachievable and more effective than in either the House or Senate passed \nbills.\n  Title II provides that for every rulemaking each agency should assess \nthe effects of regulatory action on States, local governments and the \nprivate sector. For significant rulemakings, which are judicially \nreviewable, an agency shall provide; a written statement of the \nauthority under which the agency is proceeding; a qualitative and \nquantitative assessment of the cost and benefits of the rule; \nestimates, to the extent its feasible to determine it, of the future \ncompliance costs of the mandate and any disproportionate effect on \nparticular regions of the country or sectors of the economy; a macro \neconomic analysis of the effect of the rule on the national economy; \nand, a description of the agency's contacts with State, local and \ntribal governments.\n  New in title II is a provision which clarifies that the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act does not apply to meetings between Federal \nofficials and elected officers of State, local and tribal governments \nwhere those officials want to make their views, and the views of their \nconstituents known. Local officials should not be shut out of the \nprocess. We want to know their views and get their advice.\n  We also added a provision previously in the House bill which requires \nthat agencies identify and consider the least costly, most cost-\neffective or least burdensome alternative to achieve the objective of \nthe rule containing a federal mandate. We require the OMB director to \nreport specifically on this least burdensome regulation requirement in \n1 year and we require an annual statement from the OMB director on \nagency compliance with title II.\n  The judicial review provision in the conference report of S. 1, \nprovides limited scope of review under the APA if an agency unlawfully \nwithholds or unreasonably delays compliance with the requirements of S. \n1. A court would look to see if the agency had prepared the written \nstatement required by section 202 and 203. If the analyses, statement, \ndescription or written plan were not completed the court could compel \nthe agency to complete the requirements of section 202 and 203. \nHowever, to ensure that Federal rules were not delayed by endless \nlitigation, S. 1 provides that failure by the agency to provide the \nanalyses, statement, description or written plan could not be used to \nstay, enjoin, invalidate or otherwise affect the rule.\n  We also wanted to make sure that the underlying analysis needed to \nsubstantiate a rule under the requirements of S. 1 couldn't be used to \ninvalidate the rule under some\n other rulemaking requirement in the underlying statute which imposed a \nmandate. But, if the analysis which was used to meet S. 1 requirements \nwas provided pursuant to the underlying statute which imposed a \nmandate, then a court in review could invalidate the rulemaking based \non that underlying statute.\n\n  Finally, S. 1 provides a limitation of 180 days on the time under \nwhich an action could be filed unless the underlying statute provided a \ndifferent period. The judicial review provisions apply to proposed \nregulations issued after October 1, 1995.\n  No other provision of S. 1 is judicially reviewable. Title I deals \nwith the requirements of Congress, and judicial review is not \nappropriate for the internal actions of Congress. Title III deals with \nACIR's review of existing mandates and judicial review is not at issue. \nThe remainder of title II deals with either general requirements that \ndo not lend themselves to judicial review or with analyses which are \nessentially subjective--like the least burdensome option requirement \nadded to the conference report on S. 1.\n  In all, I think we have developed a system which addressed the \nconcerns in the House compelling agencies to comply with the \nrequirements of Congress while being responsible to the agencies we \nhave asked to perform.\n  Last December I spoke at the annual meeting of the Council of State \nGovernments. On the stage, next to the podium, was the flag of the \nUnited States of America. And behind us, as a backdrop, were the flags \nof each of the 50 States. I told the folks who were gathered there, \n``That flag of the United States of America represents the greatest \nnation in the world! But let us not lose sight of the fact that its \ngreatness is comprised of the 50 sovereign states that make up the \nUnited States. We are the United States of America, we are not the \nFederal Government of America!''\n  For the past two decades, the Federal Government has dominated our \nStates and cities. Congress and the executive branch have not been \npartners with States and cities. The Federal Government has been the \noverseer and the mandate maker, telling States and cities what to do, \nwhen, where, and how, but never paying for it.\n  Congress passed legislation without ever knowing the costs or \nconsequences of their actions on State and local governments. The \nmandates made Congress feel good, and, for a while, even look good back \nhome.\n  But this is not the federalism that our Founding Fathers intended. \nStanley Aranoff, who is the senate president in Ohio, stated,\n\n       The Constitution, and specifically the 10th Amendment, \n     guarantees that certain functions will be performed by \n     certain levels of government, thus ensuring direct \n     accountability of the elected official to the voters. Our \n     Constitution guarantees a federal, state, and local \n     partnership. Unfunded mandates undermines, blurs, and \n     corrupts that fundamental understanding upon which our \n     governmental framework is based.\n\n  One of the big steps forward, I believe, in helping to reaffirm the \n10th amendment rights is the effort to stop these unfunded Federal \nmandates which are simply hidden Federal taxes. We should not be paying \nfor national programs with local property taxes.\n  This legislation forces Congress and agencies to know the mandate \ncosts it imposes on the public and private sector. It requires Congress \nto pay for mandates imposed on State and local governments, and go on \nrecord with a vote when it does not.\n  S. 1 reflects a philosophy of limited government, that the best \ngovernment is the government that governs least and to let local issues \nbe decided by local officials and their citizens.\n  Those local officials set their priorities based on their finite \nresources. But for years, Congress has not had to\n worry about that. We come to the floor, and stand up and argue \nrighteously and with great passion about the problems that are facing \nthe United States, knowing full well that until now, we have not been \nheld accountable. Congress has not had to pay for it. Those mandates \nhave not been part of the Federal budget process, and the local \ngovernments end up paying for it, because it is mandated by Congress.\n\n  The Federal Government has, in essence, made local and State elected \nleaders nothing more than Federal tax collectors. Those officials have \nbeen very vocal about how they resent that, and they have every right \nto resent it.\n  Ben Nelson, the Democratic Governor of Nebraska, pretty well sums up \nthe frustration of the States when he says: ``I was elected Governor, \nnot the Administrator of Federal programs for Nebraska.''\n  Now, people say, ``How much do these Federal mandates cost?'' Nobody \nknows. Congress does not know, because we have never, ever asked that \nquestion before voting on them.\n  And so we must be intellectually honest. If it is a Federal program, \npay for it with Federal money, if it is State, pay for it with State \nmoney, and if it is local, pay for it at the local level.\n   [[Page S3878]] Mr. President, this moment would not be possible \nwithout my partners in State and local government, and the private \nsector. I close my remarks by reminding Senators that S. 1 is strongly \nendorsed by the: U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of \nCounties, National Governors Association, National Conference of State \nLegislatures, National Association of School Boards, National League of \nCities, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of \nHomebuilders, National Association of Realtors, NFIB, and the Small \nBusiness Legislative Exchange Council.\n  I want to thank the citizens of Idaho for the opportunity they have \ngiven me in serving in the Senate. I hope they will take a small \nmeasure of pride that the effort to reform unfunded mandates was born \nin Idaho.\n  There are many people who made significant contributions to this \nprocess that I would like to thank. I want to especially thank our \nmajority leader, Senator Bob Dole. His support and commitment to \nmandate relief was critical to our success. His designation of our \nmandate legislation as S. 1 insured that we would have the highest \npriority for the 104th Congress. I also want to acknowledge the \ndedication and hard work for my Senate colleagues on the conference \ncommittee. First, of course, is my long time partner on mandate relief \nSenator John Glenn. As we began this crusade we repeatedly stressed \nthat relief from Federal mandates was not a Republican issue or a \nDemocratic issue. We knew that if we were to be successful we had to \nkeep the debate nonpartisan and focused on the merits of the issue. \nWithout John Glenn that would not have been possible and we would not \nbe here today voting on final passage of mandate relief legislation. I \nbelieve our friendship and partnership have deepened during this \nprocess.\n  I note that last session, when the Democratic Party was the majority \nparty and Senator Glenn was the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, this was not necessarily a popular issue to take up. But he \nscheduled the hearings, he held the hearings, and he forged a \npartnership with me so we could come forward. It has allowed us to be \nwhere we are today. Ohio is rightfully proud of Senator Glenn.\n  Two key members of our conference team were the Republican chairmen \nof the two committees of jurisdiction, Senator Roth of Governmental \nAffairs and Senator Domenici of the Budget Committee. These two \nexperienced and knowledgeable leaders gave me valuable advice and \nconstant support throughout the conference process and were \ninstrumental in moving us toward the successful conclusion we have \nbefore us today.\n  Also my friend Senator Jim Exon, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee who offered valuable insight during the committee process. \nSenator Exon has been a long-time supporter of relief from mandates and \ncosponsored my original bill in the last session of Congress.\n  Many other Senators--Democrats and Republicans--on both sides of the \naisle have made enormous contributions to this legislation. I want to \nthank Senators Craig, Burns, Coverdell, and Gregg for being the \noriginal cosponsors of the first bill I introduced in Congress, and to \nSenators Hatch and Brown for their help.\n  And I must give a great amount of credit and thanks to our House \ncolleagues.\n  Speaker Gingrich also made this a high priority, and he so stated \nrepeatedly. Chairman Bill Clinger of the Government Reform and \nOversight Committee and Congressman Rob Portman were terrific teammates \nand diligent partners on this legislation. We have had other strong \npartners in Congressmen Gary Condit, David Dreier, and Tom Davis.\n  I have often mentioned that mandate relief legislation was my top \npriority when I came to Congress. I want to acknowledge those members \nof my personal staff that worked so long and hard in helping me \naccomplish this important personal goal. My lead person in conference \nand the principal author of the final bill, my legislative director \nW.H. ``Buzz'' Fawcett, who was my city attorney when I was mayor of \nBoise, Gary L. Smith, my deputy legislative director who also came with \nme from Boise where he was a city council member and my administrative \nassistant, and my current administrative assistant in the Senate, Brian \nWaidmann who brought his invaluable experience and expertise on \ncongressional process to our team.\n  But most of all I would like to share this victory with my family: my \nwife Patricia, my daughter Heather, and son Jeff. Perhaps only other \nMembers of Congress can fully appreciate the sacrifices our families \nmake on our behalf. I have a very special family that I appreciate very \nmuch.\n  I want to conclude by reading to you a quote from a Founding Father, \nJames Madison. Here is what he said:\n\n       Ambitious encroachments of the federal government on the \n     authority of the state governments, would not excite the \n     opposition of a single state, or of a few states only. They \n     would be signals of general alarm. Every government would \n     espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be opened, \n     plans of resistance would be concerted, one spirit would \n     animate and conduct the whole.\n\n  James Madison, the great visionary, predicted that this sort of thing \nwould happen by the Federal Government. But he also said that someone \nwill band together and stop it. And that is what S. 1 is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this is a day that has been long in coming. \nWe have worked for the better part of 2 years to get this legislation \nto the point where it is now, out of conference and here to get its \nfinal stamp of approval by the U.S. Senate. And with the same action \ntaking place over in the House, that means this legislation will \nfinally go to the President, who has announced his support for this \nlegislation.\n  This has been a long process. To those not directly involved in all \nthe committee work and I do not know how many hundreds of meetings and \nso on involved with all of this, without having been involved directly \nwith some of that, I think it is difficult to appreciate what has \nhappened with regard to this legislation.\n  It is landmark legislation. I think we have come up with a very \nexcellent product here, one that literally does change the relationship \nbetween the Federal, State and local governments for the first time in \nprobably 55 or 60 years.\n  This is legislation that passed the Senate back in January by a vote \nof 86 to 10, and my hope is that we will be able to pass this bill \nthrough the House and Senate tomorrow morning and get it to the \nPresident shortly.\n  Before I go into a description of the conference report, I would like \nto provide just a little bit of background to the whole unfunded \nFederal mandates debate.\n  On October 27, 1993, State and local elected officials from all over \nthe Nation came to Washington and declared that day to be ``National \nUnfunded Mandates Day.'' These officials conveyed a very powerful \nmessage to Congress and the Clinton administration on the need for \nFederal mandate reform and relief. They raised four major objections to \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  First, unfunded Federal mandates impose unreasonable fiscal burdens \non their budgets.\n  Second, they limit State and local government flexibility to address \nmore pressing local problems like crime and education.\n  Third, Federal mandates too often come in a one-size-fits-all box \nthat stifles the development of what might be more innovative local \nefforts--efforts that ultimately may be more effective in solving the \nproblem the Federal mandate is meant to address.\n  And, fourth, they allow Congress to get credit for passing some \nworthy mandate or program, while leaving State and local governments \nwith the difficult task of cutting services or raising taxes in order \nto pay for it. And that fourth item was probably the most important of \nall.\n  In hearings held by the Committee on Governmental Affairs in both \nthis and the last Congress, we heard testimony from elected State and \nlocal officials from both parties representing all sizes of \ngovernment--State, local, county, townships, all levels and all sizes \nof government. It was clear from \n[[Page S3879]] the testimony that unfunded mandates hit small counties \nand townships just as hard as they do big cities and larger States.\n  I think it is worth stepping back and taking a look at the evolution \nof the Federal-State-local relationship over the last decade and a \nhalf, so we can put this debate into some historical context. I believe \nthe seeds from which sprang the mandate reform movement can literally \nbe traced clear back to the so-called policy of new federalism, a \npolicy which resulted in a gradual but steady shift in governing \nresponsibilities from the Federal Government to State and local \ngovernment over the last 10 to 15 years. During that time period, \nFederal aid to State and local governments was severely cut or even \neliminated in a number of key domestic program areas. At the same time, \nenactment and subsequent implementation of various Federal statutes \npassed on new costs to State and local governments. In simple terms, \nState and local governments ended up receiving less of the Federal \ncarrot and more of the Federal stick.\n  The actual cost of Federal mandates.\n  Let us examine the cost issue first. While there has been substantial \ndebate on the actual costs of Federal mandates, suffice it to say that \nalmost all participants in the debate agree that there is not complete \ndata on Federal mandates to State and local governments. In fact, one \nof the major objectives of S. 1 is to develop better information and \ndata on the cost of mandates and to force that to be considered up \nfront. Likewise, there is even less information available on estimates \nof what potential benefits might be derived from selected Federal \nmandates--a point made by representatives from the disability, \nenvironmental, and labor community in the committee's second hearing in \nthe last Congress.\n  Nonetheless, there have been efforts made in the past to measure the \ncost impacts of Federal mandates on State and local governments.\n  And those efforts do show that costs appear to be rising. Since 1981, \nCBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has been preparing cost estimates \nof major legislation reported by committee with an expected annual cost \nto State and local governments in excess of $200 million. According to \nCBO, 89 bills, with an estimated annual cost in excess of $200 million \neach, were reported out of committee between 1983 and 1988.\n  I would point out one major caveat with CBO's analysis--it does not \nindicate whether these bills funded the costs or not, nor how many of \nthe bills were eventually enacted. Still, even with a rough \ncalculation, CBO's analysis shows that committees reported out bills \nwith an average estimated new cost of at least $17.8 billion per year \nto State and local governments. In total, 382 bills were reported from \ncommittees over the 6-year period with some new costs to State and \nlocal government. So, if anything, the $17.8 billion figure is a \nconservative estimate for reported bills.\n  Federal environmental mandates head the list of areas that State and \nlocal officials claim to be the most burdensome. A closer look at two \nof the studies done on the cost of State and local governments of \ncompliance with environmental statutes does indicate that these costs \nappear to be rising. A 1990 EPA study, titled ``Environmental \nInvestments: The Cost of a Clean Environment,'' estimates that total \nannual costs of environmental mandates from all levels of Government to \nState and local governments will rise from $22.2 billion in 1987 to \n$37.1 billion by the year 2000--an increase in real terms of 67 \npercent.\n  EPA estimates that the cost of environmental mandates to State \ngovernments will rise from $3 billion in 1987 to $4.5 billion by the \nyear 2000, a 48-percent increase. Over the same timeframe, the annual \ncosts of environmental mandates to local governments is estimated to \nincrease from $19.2 billion to $32.6 billion. That is a 70-percent \ngain.\n  According to the Vice President's National Performance Review, the \ntotal annual cost of environmental mandates to State and local \ngovernments, when adjusted for inflation, will reach close to $44 \nbillion by the end of this century.\n  The city of Columbus, in my home State of Ohio, also noted a trend in \nrising costs for city compliance with Federal environmental mandates. \nThe mayor of Columbus, Gregg Lashutka, has taken a personal interest in \nthis and has done a superb job in detailing what the impact is on a \nmedium-sized U.S. city from Federal mandates.\n  Our Governor, George Voinovich, has represented the National \nGovernors Association in his representation of wanting this legislation \nthrough all and has given a lot of information that has come from the \nGovernors across the country on this. Probably the most definitive \nstudy of all, as far as the impact on the city, is what Mayor Lashutka \nhas done in Columbus, OH.\n  In his study, the city concluded that its cost of compliance for \nenvironmental statutes would rise from $62.1 million in 1991 to $107.4 \nmillion in 1995. That is--in 1991 constant dollars--a 73-percent \nincrease. The city estimates that its share of the total city budget \ngoing to pay for the mandates will increase from 10.6 percent to 18.3 \npercent over that timeframe. This is just one medium-sized American \ncity.\n  In addition to environmental requirements, State and local officials \nin our committee hearings cited other Federal requirements as \nburdensome and costly. They highlighted compliance with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and the Motor-Voter Registration Act, complying \nwith the administrative requirements that go with implementing many \nFederal programs and meeting Federal criminal justice and education \nrequirements.\n  Now, I note that while each of these individual programs or \nrequirements clearly carries with them costs to State and local \ngovernments, costs which we have too often ignored in the past, I \nbelieve that on a case-by-case basis, each of these mandates has \nsubstantial benefits to our society and our Nation as a whole.\n  Otherwise I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, would \nnot have voted to enact them in the first place. State and local \nofficials readily concede that individual mandates on a case-by-case \nbasis may indeed be worthy, but when looking at all mandates spanning \nacross the entire mammoth of Federal laws and regulations, we begin to \nunderstand that it is the aggregate impact of all Federal mandates that \nhas spurred the calls for mandate reform and relief.\n  The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations testified in \nour April hearings that the number of major Federal statutes with \nexplicit mandates on State and local governments went from zero during \nthe period of 1941 to 1964. In other words, we did not pass along the \nbill during that period from 1941 to 1964.\n  But then it went to the Federal mandates during the rest of the \n1960's, went to 25 in the 1970's, and 27 in the 1980's. However, to \ntruly reach a better understanding of the Federal mandates debate, we \nmust also look at the Federal funding picture, vis-a-vis State and \nlocal governments.\n  Addressing that first under Federal aid and to State and local \ngovernments, the record shows that Federal discretionary aid to State \nand local governments to both implement Federal policies and \ndirectives, as well as complying with them, saw a sharp drop in the \n1980's.\n  An examination of Census Bureau data on sources of State and local \ngovernment revenue shows a decreasing Federal role in the funding of \nState and local governments. In 1979, the Federal Government's \ncontribution to State and local governments' revenues reached 18.6 \npercent. By 1989, the Federal contribution of the State and local \nrevenue pie had instead daily shrunk to 13.2 percent before edging up \nto 14.3 percent in 1991, the latest year data was available.\n  What contributed to the declining trend in the Federal financing of \nState and local governments? A closer look at patterns in Federal \ndiscretionary aid programs to State and local governments during the \n1980's provides the answer. According to the Federal Funds Information \nService, between 1981 and 1990, Federal discretionary program funding \nto State and local government rose slightly from $47.5 to $51.6 \nbillion.\n  However, this figure, when adjusted for inflation, tells a much \ndifferent story. Federal aid dropped 28 percent in real terms over the \ndecade. A number of vital Federal aid programs to State and local \ngovernment experienced \n[[Page S3880]] sharp cuts, and in some cases outright elimination, \nduring the decade.\n  In 1986, the administration and Congress agreed to terminate the \nGeneral Revenue Sharing Program. We all remember that one. That was a \nprogram that provided approximately $4.5 billion annually to local \ngovernments and allowed them very broad discretion on how to spend the \nfunds.\n  Since its inception in 1972, general revenue sharing has provided \napproximately $83 billion to State and local government. Unfortunately, \nthe Reagan administration succeeded in terminating the program. \nCongress followed its lead and approved that. There were other \nimportant Federal and State and local programs that were substantially \ncut back between 1981 and 1990. They include the economic development \nassistance, community development block grants, mass transit, refugee \nassistance, and low-income home energy assistance.\n  Luckily, under both the Bush and Clinton administrations, we managed \nto restore some of the needed funding--I repeat, needed funding--to \nthese programs. And still, in real dollars, funds for discretionary aid \nprograms to State and local governments remain today 18 percent below \ntheir 1981 levels. That is despite the fact we have put more of an \nunfunded mandates load onto the backs of the State and local \ngovernments.\n  Looking at our committee's legislative efforts in the last Congress, \neight bills were referred to the Governmental Affairs Committee that \ntouched on this aspect of the unfunded mandates Federal mandates \nproblem.\n  After two hearings, we marked up a bill. I think it could be called, \nat least in part, a compromise bill. The basic part of it, though, was \nthe bill that Senator Kempthorne has submitted, and it became the \nvehicle that borrowed the best of the various provisions and \nrequirements from the bills that had been submitted. It was basically--\nthe basic bill--his work.\n  We worked closely in a deliberative, bipartisan fashion, and he was \nthe de facto leadership on this issue. Along with other Members, and \nwith the administration, we moved ahead with this legislation. What \nbecame known as the Kempthorne-Glenn compromise has the endorsement and \nstrong support of the seven groups representing State and local \ngovernments. They are the National Governors Association, the National \nConference of State Legislators, the Council on State Governments, the \nNational League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National \nAssociation of Counties, and the International City Management \nAssociation. It had the backing of the Clinton administration, and was \nendorsed by such editorial boards as the New York Times, the Cleveland \nPlain Dealer, and other newspapers across the country, both large and \nsmall. That largely embodies or includes, also, all that we had last \nyear in Senate bill 993.\n  Let me just say that on this bill, if there is anyone who can be \nlooked at as the father of this bill and the one who really kept going \non this and kept interest going, it is Senator Kempthorne. He did a \nmagnificent job on this bill, not only here in Washington, but he \ntraveled all over the country, meeting repeatedly with different groups \nrepresenting those seven organizations that I just mentioned in getting \ntheir views on this legislation and bringing it back, putting it \ntogether. And he did a superb job in keeping contact with all these \npeople. He deserves the full credit for being the sparkplug for this \nlegislation.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me explain what the bill does.\n  It requires the Congressional Budget Office to conduct State, local \nand tribal cost estimates on legislation that imposes new Federal \nmandates in excess of $50 million annually onto the budgets of State, \nlocal, and tribal governments. The current law requires these estimates \nat a $200 million threshold, and I believe that that high a figure \nallows a lot of Federal mandates to slip through without being scored. \nTwo hundred million dollars spread equally among all the States may not \nbe much, but if it falls particularly hard on any one State or any one \nregion, which does happen with legislation, it can be a substantial \nimpact.\n  Let me make clear, however, that what CBO will score here are new \nFederal mandates--new Federal mandates--not what State, local, and \ntribal governments are spending now to comply with existing mandates, \nnor what they are spending to comply with their own laws and mandates.\n  Second, and I think most importantly, is that the bill holds Congress \naccountable for imposing additional unfunded Federal mandates. We do \nthis by requiring a majority point-of-order vote on any legislation \nthat imposes new unfunded Federal mandates in excess of a $50 million \nannual cost to State, local, or tribal governments.\n  To avoid the point of order, the sponsor of the bill would have to \nauthorize funding to cover the cost to State and local governments of \nthe Federal mandate or otherwise find ways to pay for the mandate. This \ncould come from the expansion of an existing grant or subsidized loan \nprogram or the creation of a new one or perhaps a raising of new \nrevenues or user fees.\n  The authorizing committee must also build into the legislation \ncertain provisions to go into effect if funds for the mandate are not \nfully appropriated or not appropriated at all. This was the basic \nthrust of the Byrd amendment which the House receded to in conference \nand accepted in its entirety. The House bill would have left the fate \nof an unfunded or underfunded mandate in the hands of the Federal \nbureaucracy rather than in the hands of Congress where it properly \nlies.\n  Under the Byrd amendment, the authorizing committee would have to put \nexpedited procedures into the underlying intergovernmental mandates \nbill that would direct the relevant Federal agency to submit a \nstatement based on a reestimate done in consultation with State, local, \nand tribal governments that appropriations are sufficient to pay for \nthe mandate or the agency submits legislative recommendations to \nimplement a less costly mandate or to render the mandate ineffective \nfor the fiscal year.\n  Under the expedited procedures, the authorizing committee must \nprovide for consideration in both Houses of the agency statement or \nlegislative recommendations within 60 calendar days. After the 60-day \ntime period expires, the mandate ceases to be effective unless Congress \nprovides otherwise by law. And I will discuss the Byrd amendment in \ngreater detail a little later in my statement.\n  The conference report on S. 1 also includes provisions for the \nanalysis of legislation that imposes mandates on the private sector. \nCBO would have to complete a private sector cost estimate on bills \nreported by committee with a $100 million or more annual cost \nthreshold. In the Senate bill, we had a threshold of $200 million and \nthe House had $50 million as their threshold, so we split the \ndifference and wound up with $100 million being our threshold.\n  We do exempt certain Federal laws from this bill. Civil rights and \nconstitutional rights are excluded. National security, emergency \nlegislation, and ratification of international treaties are also \nexempt.\n  I want to also point out that the bill does not prohibit Congress \nfrom passing unfunded Federal mandates. Let me repeat that. It does not \nprohibit Congress from passing unfunded Federal mandates. There may be \ntimes when it is appropriate, for whatever purpose, to ask State and \nlocal governments to pick up the tab for Federal mandates. But the \nlegislation does force us to take into consideration the cost of the \nunfunded mandates up front, consider it in its entirety with a point of \norder to lie against it if it is not funded. But the debate over \nwhether it is appropriate to ask State and local governments at times \nwhether it is a constitutional matter or whatever it might be, to pick \nup the tab across the country--all States--let that debate take place \non the Senate floor, as it will under this legislation, and let the \nmajority work its will on the specific mandate in the legislation.\n  The Kempthorne-Glenn bill also addresses regulatory mandates. We all \nknow how the Federal bureaucracy can impose burdensome and inflexible \nregulations on State and local governments, as well as on others who \nend up trapped in the bureaucracy's regulatory net. In the committee's \nNovember hearing in 1993, we heard testimony from Susan Ritter. She is \ncounty auditor for Renville County, ND. Ms. Ritter \n[[Page S3881]] noted that she comes from the town of Sherwood in her \nState with a total population of 286 people, and they will have to \nspend $2,000, which is one-half of their annual budget on testing the \nwater supply in order to comply with certain EPA regulations.\n  Clearly, there is no way that that town is going to be able to meet \nthis kind of a requirement. So, consistent with the President's \nExecutive orders, we have required that Federal agencies conduct cost-\nbenefit analysis and assessments on major regulations that impact \nState, local, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector. We \nhave allowed a limited judicial review of agency preparation of some of \nthose assessments and analysis. The House would have allowed full scale \njudicial review of practically everything, of both the agency analysis \nand the CBO cost estimates. This could have been a way of almost \nshutting down the whole regulatory process, as we saw it.\n  Enactment of these provisions also would have resulted in what I \ntermed the Lawyers Full Employment Act, and would have had the law \nfirms along K Street breaking out the champagne all over. So we \nsignificantly curtailed and narrowed and focused the judicial review \nrequirements, which I will discuss in a little more detail a little \nlater on also.\n  Further under S. 1, agencies must develop a timely and effective \nmeans of allowing State and local input into the regulatory process. \nGiven the State and local governments are responsible for implementing \nmany of our Federal laws, it is not only fair they be considered \npartners in the Federal regulatory process, but it is also good public \npolicy as well.\n  The bill also requires Federal agencies to make a special effort in \nperforming outreach to the smallest governments. Then maybe we will be \nable to minimize the occurrence of situations like the one that took \nplace in the town of Sherwood that I mentioned a moment ago.\n  Let me put the issue into a larger perspective. As we all know, the \nFederal, State, and local relationship is a very complicated, a very \ncomplex one. It is a blurry line between where one line's level of \nresponsibility ends and another begins. All three levels of government \nneed to work together in a constructive fashion to provide the best \npossible delivery of services to the American people in the most cost-\neffective fashion. After all, as Federal, State, and local officials, \nwe all serve the same constituency.\n  Further, we serve the American people at a time when their confidence \nin all three levels of government may be at an all-time low. There are \nnumerous explanations for this lack of confidence in government, and we \nwill not go into a long discussion of those here. Vice President Gore's \nNational Performance Review attributes ``an increasingly hidebound and \nparalyzed intergovernmental process'' as at least a part of the reason \nwhy many Americans feel that government is wasteful, inefficient, and \nineffective. We need to restore balance to the intergovernmental \npartnership, as well as strengthen it so that government at all levels \ncan operate in a more cost-effective manner.\n  Both the administration and a number of my colleagues have made \nproposals to shift a number of Federal programs and responsibilities to \nState and local governments. Clearly, as this mandates debate has shown \nus, I believe we ought to at least experiment to see if State and local \ngovernments can carry out some of these programs in a more effective \nfashion than we have been doing at the Federal level.\n  I know from my years as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee that Americans do want more efficient and less costly \ngovernment, and I, for one, do not believe that efficiency and \ngovernment need necessarily be an oxymoron statement. We worked on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to bring forth better ways of dealing \nwith efficiency in the Federal Government, such as the Chief Financial \nOfficer Act, the Inspectors General Act, Financial Management Act, and \nso on, and a number of different things we have done in that area. So \nit is not that we have ignored the efficiencies of government, but \ncertainly we want to make the Government a more efficient and better \nand less costly government.\n  That certainly is a big move. Maybe one way to help accomplish that \nobjective is to grant more flexibility to State and local governments \nand let them run some of these programs.\n  Where I think we should proceed with some degree of caution, we need \nto remember the reason many of these programs became part of the \nFederal level was back some 50 or 60 years ago when the country was in \ndire straits and we were not able, either would not or could not, at \nthe State and local level to address problems and concerns of our \ncitizens that had been dealt with in the family and local communities \nup to that time. We found soup kitchens on the corners, and we had \npeople because of weather changes also--we remember the movies, famous \nmovies of the Okies going West with a mattress on top of the car, and \nso on. The United States had lost its way at that time.\n  I grew up in that Great Depression. I learned that State and local \ngovernments do not have sometimes the wherewithal and resources to meet \nall human needs. That is why President Roosevelt came through with the \nNew Deal. That was to address economic and social problems that \npreviously were dealt with by State and local governments or by the \nlocal communities and families themselves more likely. And we followed \nthe New Deal up with the Great Society and moved more of these programs \nup to a national level.\n  Now, I am the first to say many of these programs may have gone too \nfar and so we need to tailor things back somewhat. But there has been \nand will continue to be the need for Federal involvement and \ndecisionmaking in many domestic policy areas. But that should not \npreclude us from maybe loosening the reins on State and local \ngovernments in some areas or even dropping them entirely.\n  But we should be careful and look at it on a case-by-case basis, not \nwith a meat ax approach, not just swinging the ax and taking whole \nprograms out without considering what is going to happen to a lot of \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, the House, in its race to devolve, as they call it, \nand seemingly block grant the entire Federal Government, I believe, is \nmoving much too quickly in areas which should require closer scrutiny \nand greater deliberation.\n  I believe that the conference report on S. 1 will help to restore the \nintergovernmental partnership and bring needed perspective and balance \nto future Federal decisionmaking.\n  I think S. 1 is landmark legislation, as I said in starting out my \nremarks. I think it is landmark legislation that will help to redefine \nfor the first time in 60 years the entire Federal, State and local \nrelationship. And so I obviously urge my colleagues to vote for passage \nof this legislation.\n  I have some remaining remarks concerning the conference report, and I \nwould like to clarify some of the provisions of the proposed \nlegislation.\n  I would first refer to section 425(a)(2)(B)(iii)(III) of the \nconference report. Subsection (III) establishes a timeframe for \nexpedited procedures under which Congress will consider the agency \nstatement or legislative recommendations under subsections (aa) or \n(bb). The timeframe is 60 calendar days from which the agency submits \nits statement or legislative recommendations. Under such an expedited \nprocess, the mandate would cease to be effective 60 calendar days after \nthe agency submission unless Congress provides otherwise by law.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian has provided us with his interpretation of \nthe 60-day time period in a letter which has been attached as an \nappendix to the conference report. The letter states that a sine die \nadjournment ``will result in the beginning again of the day counting \nprocess and that the sine die adjournment of a Congress results in all \nlegislative action being terminated and any process [the counting of \nthe 60 days] ended so that it must begin again in a new Congress.''\n  Thus, if Congress adjourns sine die prior to the end of the 60-day \ntime period after the agency submission of its statement or legislative \nrecommendations then the the 60-day time clock terminates and would \nstart all over again, beginning with day one, when Congress convenes \nthe next year. In those instances, Congress would then have 60 calendar \ndays to act on the agency submission or the mandate would cease to be \neffective after the 60- \n[[Page S3882]] day period expires. Depending on when we convened in \nJanuary, the time period would likely expire sometime during the month \nof March.\n  After a discussion with the Parliamentarian, I understand that his \ninterpretation on the counting of days would also apply after sine die \nadjournment of the 1st session of a Congress as well.\n  This clarification by the Parliamentarian over the counting of days \nunder S. 1 is critically important. During election years we usually \nadjourn sometime in early October. My concern had been that with a \ncontinuous 60-day clock we might be forced in those years to reconvene \nfor a lame-duck session in December to vote on an agency statement or \nlegislative recommendation\n or otherwise the mandate would cease to be effective. I think as a \ngeneral rule we should avoid having to convene lameduck sessions except \nin emergencies and times of national crisis.\n\n  So I am pleased that the Parliamentarian's ruling would avoid putting \nus in a situation of having to schedule lameduck sessions to deal with \nagency statements or legislative recommendations.\n  I would like to clarify another provision in the act. Section \n202(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to prepare qualitative and \nquantitative assessments of the costs and benefits of Federal mandates \nas well as its effect on health, safety, and natural environment. I \nbelieve that the meaning of the word ``effect'' would include both \nqualitative and quantitative costs and benefits to health, safety and \nthe environment as well as other impacts in those areas. Further, the \nstatement of conferees states that included in the agency written \nstatement under section 202 ``must be a qualitative, and if possible, \nquantitative assessment of the costs and benefits of the \nintergovernmental mandate.'' The word ``intergovernmental'' should be \ncrossed out to make the sentence consistent with the statutory \nlanguage. However, the sentence properly notes that a quantifiable \nassessment of the costs and benefits of a particular mandate may not be \npossible. This difficulty in preparing accurate quantitative \nassessments and estimates is noted in the statutory language for both \nsection 202(a) (3) and (4). Indirect costs and benefits are \nparticularly difficult to quantify and may be better addressed as part \nof an agency qualitative assessment of the Federal mandate.\n  In addition to addressing indirect costs and benefits, such a \nqualitative assessment would also include an assessment of \nconsiderations other than economic costs and benefits but are still \nnecessary and important in guiding an agency in the promulgation of a \nmajor rule.\n  I would also like to discuss section 204, dealing with State, local, \nand tribal government input into the Federal regulatory process. Both \nthe House and Senate bills required Federal agencies to develop an \neffective process to permit elected State, local, and tribal officials \nto provide timely and meaningful input into the development of agency \nregulatory proposals containing significant intergovernmental mandates. \nThe language in both bills was consistent with the President's \nExecutive order. The House bill, however, implicitly exempted all \nmeetings and communications between Federal and\n State, local, and tribal officials under this process from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act. The House felt that FACA was a bureaucratic \nencumbrance that impeded closer coordination between Federal, State, \nand local officials in the administration of programs with shared \nintergovernmental responsibilities. The Committee on Governmental \nAffairs has examined problems with FACA in the past and 3 years ago \nreported out unanimously legislation I wrote to reform FACA. The bill \nexempted elected State and local officials from some of its \nrequirements. So I was sympathetic with the House position in this \ncase. However, I believed that the House language needed to be \ntightened and narrowed so as not to give State and local officials an \nunfair advantage over others in the administrative process. So we \ndeveloped compromise language in section 204(b) to provide an exemption \nfrom FACA for elected State, local, or tribal officials--or their \ndesignated employees with authority to act on their behalf--for \nmeetings concerning the implementation or management of Federal \nprograms that ``explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental \nresponsibilities or administration.'' So we have been careful to limit \nthe FACA exemption to instances where Federal officials and State, \nlocal, and tribal officials are coimplementers or managers of a \nprogram. We did not want to allow a FACA exemption in instances where \nState and local officials are acting as advocates, which is what the \nHouse bill would have likely allowed. Further, we have asked the \nadministration to promulgate regulations to implement section 204 and \nto ensure that there are proper safeguards in place.\n\n  I would note that the effective date of title I is January 1, 1996 or \n90 days earlier if CBO receives appropriations as authorized. Thus, \ntitle I would apply to any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, \nor conference report considered by the House or Senate on or after \nJanuary 1, 1996.\n  Finally, I would like to describe and explain the provisions of \nsection 401, which deals with the subject of judicial review.\n  The version of S. 1 that passed the Senate contained an absolute bar \non all judicial review. However, the bill that passed the House \nauthorized judicial review of regulatory agency compliance with many \nrequirements in the bill.\n  The conferees agreed to a compromise between the Senate and the House \npositions. Our goal was to provide for meaningful judicial review, so \nas to reassure the regulated community that agencies will prepare \ncertain key statements and plans that are called for under S. 1. \nHowever, we also wanted to assure that agency rules and enforcement \nwould not be stayed or invalidated by the judicial review, and that the \nregulatory process would not get bogged down in excessive litigation. I \nbelieve that section 401 achieves these goals.\n  Sections 401(a) (1) and (2) provide for limited judicial review of \nagency compliance with section 202 and sections 203(a) (1) and (2). As \nI discussed a moment ago, section 202 requires preparation of \nstatements to accompany significant regulatory actions, and sections \n203(a) (1) and (2) require agencies to develop small agency plans \nbefore establishing certain regulatory requirements.\n  Subparagraph (A) of section 401(a)(2) provides that judicial review \nis available only under section 706(l) of the Administrative Procedure \nAct. Section 706(l) of the APA authorizes a court to compel agency \naction unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. Subparagraph (A) \nalso states that such review will only be as provided under \nsubparagraph (B). Subparagraph (B) states that, if an agency fails to \nprepare the written statement under section 202 or the written plan \nunder section 203(a) (1) and (2), a court may compel the agency to \nprepare such a written statement.\n  Sections 401(a) (1) and (2) specify that the only remedy that a court \nmay provide is to compel the agency to prepare the statement. So, for \nexample, the court may not stay, enjoin, invalidate, or otherwise \naffect a rule. Nor may the court postpone the effective date of the \nrule, stay enforcement of the rule, or take any other action to \npreserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceeding \nor pending compliance by the agency with any court order to prepare a \nstatement.\n  Furthermore, in this review under sections 401(a) (1) and (2), the \ncourt may not review the adequacy of a written statement under section \n202 or of a written plan under sections 203(a) (1) and (2). This is \nbecause paragraph (2)(B) provides that a court may compel preparation \nof a written statement only if the agency actually fails to prepare the \nwritten statement under section 202 or actually fails to prepare the \nwritten plan under sections 203(a) (1) and (2).\n  Sections 401(a) (1) and (2) deal with the situation where rules that \nare subject to sections 202 and 203(a) and (b) undergo judicial review \nunder Federal law other than section 401(a) (1) and (2).\n  Paragraph (3) states that, in any such judicial review, the failure \nof an agency to prepare a required statement or plan shall not be used \nas a basis for staying, enjoining, invalidating, or otherwise affecting \nthe agency rule. Subparagraph (3) further provides that, if the agency \ndoes prepare a statement \n[[Page S3883]] or plan, any inadequacy of the statement or plan shall \nnot be used as a basis for staying, enjoining, invalidating, or \notherwise affecting the agency rule. Subsection (3) not only forbids a \ncourt to use the inadequacy or failure to prepare a statement or plan \nas the sole basis for invalidating or otherwise affecting a rule; the \nsubsection also prohibits the court from using such inadequacy or \nfailure as any basis, even if considered together with other \ndeficiencies in the rulemaking, for invalidating or otherwise affecting \na rule.\n  Subparagraph (4) states the circumstances when the information \ngenerated under section 202 or section 203(a) (1) and (2) may be \nconsidered by a court in the course of reviewing the rule under law \nother than sections 401(a) (1) and (2). Subparagraph (4) has two \nelements. First, the information may be considered by the court only if \nit is made part of the rulemaking record for judicial review. Second, \nif the information is made part of the record for review, then the \ninformation may be considered by the court as part of the entire record \nfor the judicial review under the other law.\n  The question of whether the information is made part of the record \nfor judicial review is not determined by any provision of S. 1; the \ncontents of the record is governed by the law and court procedures \nunder which the judicial review takes place. In judicial review of \nagency rules, the agency makes the initial decision of what documents \nto include in the rulemaking record for judicial review. Thus, the \nagency would make the initial decision of whether to include any \ninformation generated under sections 202 and 203(a) (1) and (2) in the \nrecord for judicial review. If the agency makes such information part \nof the record for judicial review, the court may then proceed to \nconsider such information as part of the record for judicial review \npursuant to the other law.\n  In no event may a court review whether the information generated \nunder sections 202 or 203(a) (1) or (2) is adequate to satisfy \nrequirements of S. 1. Such review is clearly prohibited by subparagraph \n(3). However, in reviewing a rule under law other than sections 401(a) \n(1) and (2), if information generated under section 202 or 203(a) (1) \nor (2) is included in the record for review, the court may consider \nwhether such information is adequate or inadequate to satisfy the \nrequirements of such other law.\n  Any information that is made part of the record subject to judicial \nreview, including information generated under sections 202 and 203(a) \n(1) and (2) that is made part of the record, may be considered by the \ncourt, to the extent relevant under the law governing the judicial \nreview, as part of the entire record in determining whether the record \nbefore it supports the rule under the arbitrary capricious or \nsubstantial evidence or other applicable standard. Pursuant to the \nappropriate Federal law, a court looks at the totality of the record in \nassessing whether a particular rulemaking proceeding lacks sufficient \nsupport in the record.\n  Section 401(a)(5) states that a petition under paragraph (2) to \ncompel the agency to prepare a written statement shall be controlled by \nprovisions of law that govern review of the rule under other law. This \napplies to such matters as exhaustion of administrative remedies, the \ntime for and manner of seeking review, and venue. Consequently, the \npetition under paragraph (2) may be filed only after the final rule has \nbeen promulgated, at which time review of the rule may be available \nunder other law. The petition under subparagraph (2) may be filed only \nin a court where a petition for review of the rule itself could also be \nfiled under other law. And the same requirements for exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies that would apply in review of the rule shall \nalso apply to the petition under paragraph (2). However, if the other \nlaw does not have a statute of limitations that is less than 180 days, \nthen paragraph (5) limits the time for filing a petition under \nparagraph (2) to 180 days.\n  Section 401(a)(6) states the effective date for the judicial review \nprovided under subsection (a). The effective date is October 1, 1995, \nand subsection (a) will apply to any agency rule\n for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is promulgated on or \nafter such date. Consequently, in the case of rules for which a general \nnotice of proposed rulemaking is promulgated before October 1, 1995, \nsubsection (a) does not apply. For these rules that are not subject to \nsubsection (a), a petition under subsection (a)(2) may not be filed, \nand information generated under section 202 and 203(a) may not be \nconsidered as part of the record for judicial review pursuant to \nsubsection (4).\n\n  Section 401(b)(1) broadly prohibits all judicial review except as \nprovided in subsection (a). Thus, all of title I, those portions of \ntitle II not expressly referenced in subsection (a), and all of title \nIII are completely exempt from judicial review. This section also \nprohibits judicial review of any estimate, analysis, statement, \ndescription or report prepared under S. 1. This list is intended to \ncover all forms of documentation or analysis generated under S. 1, so \nthat no such documentation or analysis is subject to any form of \njudicial review except as provided in subsection (a). For example, not \nonly is an agency's compliance with section 205 not subject to judicial \nreview; but also the regulatory alternatives and the explanations \nprepared under section 205, and other records of the agency's \nactivities under section 205, may not be reviewed in any judicial \nproceeding.\n  Subsection (b)(2) further states that, except as provided in \nsubsection (a), no provision of S. 1 shall be construed to create any \nright or benefit enforceable by any person.\n  Finally, the provisions of S. 1 do not affect the standards of \nunderlying law, under which courts will review agency rules. In other \nwords, insofar as they provide the basis for judicial review of a rule, \nneither the standards of the statute that authorizes promulgation of \nthe rule, nor the procedural standards for rulemaking under the \nauthorizing statute or the APA, nor the standards for judicial review \nof the rule, nor agency or court interpretations, are affected by the \nprovisions of S. 1.\n  Likewise, to the extent that applicable law vests discretion in an \nagency to determine what information and analysis to consider in \ndeveloping a rule, nothing in S. 1 changes the standards under which a \ncourt will review and determine whether the agency properly exercised \nsuch discretion. Thus, even where the authorizing statute is vague or \nsilent about what factors the agency must or may consider in \npromulgating a rule, a court reviewing the rule may not consider the \nrequirements of section 202 or of any other provisions of S. 1 in \ninterpreting the requirements of the statute. This is because, except \nas provided by a petition under section 401(a)(2), section 401 \nprohibits all judicial review of compliance or noncompliance with S. 1. \nIf courts were allowed to interpret S. 1 as implicitly amending or \nsuperseding the provisions of another statute or to constrain the \nagency's discretion under another statute, and if the conference report \nhad been written to allow a court to consider an agency's compliance or \nnoncompliance with these amended or superseded provisions of the other \nstatute, this would be the same thing as judicial review of the \nagency's compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of S. 1. But \nsection 401 of the conference report clearly prohibits courts from \ndoing this.\n  Furthermore, even when an agency prepares any statement under section \n202, nothing in section 202 authorizes or requires consideration of the \nstatement in development of the rule. Where the conference report \nintends to require that agencies consider certain factors, the language \nof the bill is drafted to say so explicitly, as in the provision of \nsection 205 requiring that agencies consider a reasonable number of \nregulatory alternatives under certain circumstances. Furthermore, an \nagency may choose to prepare a statement even if consideration is \nclearly prohibited under other statute, and an agency may prepare a \nstatement even if the applicable statute affords discretion to the \nagency to consider or not to consider the statement. Therefore, neither \nthe provisions of S. 1 nor the fact that an agency prepares any \nstatement under S. 1 affects the standards and interpretations under \nwhich courts will review the rule and the agency's exercise of \ndiscretion in developing the rule.\n   [[Page S3884]] Mr. President, I would like to close by acknowledging \nsome people who deserve a great deal of credit for this legislation. \nThis has been tough legislation to bring through, and we had a long \ndebate in the Chamber about it after it came out of committee. We \nremember some of the difficulties of getting it out of the committee, \nand I will not go into all the details of that.\n  I indicated earlier in my remarks, of all the people who have brought \nthis through, Senator Dirk Kempthorne certainly deserves credit as the \nspark plug for this legislation. I have been glad and honored to join \nhim in it. W.H. ``Buzz'' Fawcett, who is sitting here with \nhim today, deserves credit for his work on this, and Gary Smith, who is \non the floor also today.\n  On our side of the aisle, those people who deserve a tremendous \namount of credit are Sebastion O'Kelly, who is with me here today, who \nhas worked on very little but this for the last couple of months, I \nguess, or ever since we came back into session; Larry Novey, who is not \non the floor with us today--yes, he is back in the back. Larry worked \non this legislation also, as did our minority staff director on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Len Weiss, who is here with us today.\n  Congressman Rob Portman over in the House, who was the real sponsor \nof this and the prime mover of it, deserves a lot of credit, along with \nhis principal staff person who worked on this, John Bridgeland; \nCongressman William Clinger over there, and the person on his staff, \nChristine Simmons, who worked so hard on this; Congresswoman Cardiss \nCollins and her staff person, Tom Goldberg, who met repeatedly with the \ngroup; Gary Condit over there, and his staffer, Steve Jones, played a \nvital role in this.\n  And back on our side again, Senator Jim Exon and Meg Duncan on his \nstaff, and on our Governmental Affairs staff again Senator Carl Levin \nand Linda Gustitis, who has done such yeoman work on a number of pieces \nof legislation on our Governmental Affairs Committee staff.\n  I know to people out there maybe who watch this on television, the \nnames are not associated directly with the people involved. You may or \nmay not have seen them in the Chamber from time to time when we were \ndebating the bill, sitting here beside us, keeping some of the \nlegislative matters straight as we were debating some different parts \nof this bill. But they are people who should be known because they are \nthe ones who have to write things up overnight, spend two-thirds of the \nnight writing things up for our approval in the morning to go to \nanother meeting and try to work things out, work differences out and \ndifferent views on legislation. And this legislation did have a lot of \nthings we had to work out together. It was together that we worked \nthese things out. There was a lot of togetherness, legislative \ntogetherness that let us get to the point where we are today.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill. I think it \nis landmark legislation, and we have so many people who have been part \nof this I probably have left some people out. I regret that. But I am \nglad we have come to this day, and I look forward to tomorrow when we \nwill have a record rollcall vote. I hope it will be unanimous.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the remarks of \nthe Senator from Ohio and the great role that he has played in bringing \nus to this point where we can have successful passage of this \nconference report.\n  I should like to associate myself with his remarks about the \ndifferent staff members who have all played a key role. I would now \nlike to yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, who again has \nbeen one of those Senators on this issue who every time we needed to \nhave assistance was there.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the unfunded \nmandates conference report.\n  By forcing Congress to know the costs of any legislation it passes \ndown to our States, counties, cities, and townships, by forcing \nCongress to vote--openly in the light of day--to specifically impose \nthose costs if it does not come up with the dollars itself, this \nlegislation is a good first step toward loosening the noose of costly \nFederal requirements.\n  And it is also a good first step toward a return to States rights, \nand an end to what has too often amounted to taxation without \nrepresentation by the Federal Government.\n  In Redwood Falls, MN, former Mayor Gary Revier echoes what I have \nheard time and time again since debate began in Washington on unfunded \nmandates.\n  He said to me recently:\n\n       How can cities like Redwood Falls meet their own needs when \n     our scarce dollars are continually going to meet Washington's \n     needs?\n       How do we tell our residents that we may need to reduce \n     services or raise local taxes because a bureaucrat 2,000 \n     miles away thinks he knows best how to spend our dollars?\n\n  I agree with Mr. Revier. In fact, I have asked him to chair my \nunfunded mandates task force, where he will play a key role in \nformulating a strategy to reduce the Federal Government's reach into \nMinnesota pockets.\n  Even with the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act in place, we must be \nvigilant of the unintended costs our actions here in Congress may \nrepresent on the local level.\n  Future legislation needs to be carefully scrutinized so that we avoid \nnew and unwelcome financial pressures on the local level.\n  Other regulatory relief measures we consider this year will further \nenable local governments to get back to doing local business, and away \nfrom having to do the Federal Government's bidding.\n  We could learn a lot from Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, who wants to \nrepeal at least half of his State's nearly 29,000 regulations and \nreplace them with loose guidelines, guidelines that promote \naccountability.\n  While trading archaic rules for common sense may not make sense to \nthe Washington bureaucrats, it makes a lot of sense back home, and it \nis an approach we ought to encourage on the Federal level.\n  For all the good accomplished by the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act, it \nleaves untouched most of the 200 previously enacted unfunded mandates \npassed by this institution--and passed on to local governments--over \nthe last two decades.\n  Implementing the requirements of the 10 costliest mandates--contained \nin bills like OSHA, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, and the \nEndangered Species Act--cost cities an estimated $6.5 billion in 1993.\n  By the year 2000, the price tag for those mandates will rise to \nnearly $54 billion.\n  It may be too late to change things with this bill, but it is not too \nlate to change things with the next.\n  In the House, Speaker Gingrich will begin monthly Corrections Days, \nand I urge my colleagues in the Senate to follow suit.\n  We will pull out the most inefficient Federal laws and regulations \nand bring them up for a vote.\n  We will begin stripping away the layers of Federal bureaucracy that, \nlike bad varnish over good wood, have obscured for too long the role of \nthe Government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n  Maybe, with the help of the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act and 2 years \nof Corrections Days, we will be able to say by the end of the 104th \nCongress that we have truly made a difference to the people back home \nwho sent us here to change Washington.\n  I reiterate, this change begins with passage of the Unfunded Mandates \nRelief Act.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I note Senator Hutchison was here a \nshort time ago. She had hoped to speak on this issue but unfortunately \na previous commitment had caused her to leave the floor. I wish she \ncould have been able to remain because during the 11 days of the debate \nthat we had on S. 1, there were different occasions when it was \nnecessary to seek someone with her background in State government to \ncome be an advocate and spokesperson for this bill. Whenever we called, \nshe \n[[Page S3885]] was there. I want to acknowledge her role in this as \nwell.\n  With that, Mr. President, I know there are additional speakers who \nare on their way to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the time be divided \nequally on both sides, under the quorum call?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Idaho for \nyielding.\n  Mr. President, I have been most interested in what I think is our \nfirst major success in both Chambers. And certainly it is due to the \nperseverance of the Senator from Idaho that we are where we are today. \nI watched with interest what is happening in the House and, of course, \nwhat is happening over here. I think it is so significant because this \nsymbolizes what I think is one of the products of the revolution that \ntook place on November 8.\n  I have often joked around with many Members of both bodies in \nWashington. I said, ``If you want to know what a real tough job it is \nto become a mayor in a major city, there is no hiding place there. If \nthey do not like you, they trash you and they throw it in your front \nyard.''\n  Of all the problems--and even though there are people serving in this \nbody, distinguished Senators, who have had distinguished careers, \nincluding being mayor of major cities such as the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and many of us may disagree philosophically \non certain subjects, but if you were to ask any city official, any \nmayor, any city commissioner, city council member in America what the \nmost serious problem is, they will not say, as you might expect, the \ncrime problem or the welfare problem or other problems like that. They \nwould say it is unfunded mandates. I had the honor of serving as mayor \nfor three terms in the city of Tulsa, OK, with a half-million people.\n  There are so many aspects of unfunded mandates that people do not \ntalk about because sometimes it is politically sensitive to talk about \nit, such as the Davis-Bacon Act and how that affects what we do with \ncapital improvements in many of our large cities.\n  I can remember when I became mayor of the city of Tulsa, even though \nI was conservative it was very uncomfortable to do this. I had to pass \na 1-cent sales tax increase for capital improvement because our city \nhad been neglected in its infrastructure. Unfortunately, it is a \npolitical reality. Until you can visibly see the problems, you do not \nreally do anything about it. So we passed it.\n  We calculated afterward that, if we had not had to comply with the \nDavis-Bacon Act, the taxpayers would have benefited so much more than \nthey did. Without the Davis-Bacon Act, we could have produced 17 \npercent more in capital improvements for the citizens of Tulsa. Keep in \nmind this is all totally funded within the city with a 1-cent sales tax \nincrease--6 more miles of roads and streets within one city, Tulsa, OK; \n34 more miles of water and sewer lines. And we could have hired--this \nis simply the labor issue that you hear so much about--we could have \nhired 500 more people during that timeframe. At that time our \nunemployment was high. It was something that we needed. So it was one \nof those deals where no one would have been punished by our \nsuccessfully not having to serve under the mandates of the Davis-Bacon \nAct.\n  A lot of us in Oklahoma put the pencil to these things so that we \nwould know how many dollars it saved. The motor-voter law that came in \nis going to cost about $1 million a year. We are still working with \nthat right now. That was something that came in that sounded very good \nwhen it surfaced. A lot of the authorities were certainly well meaning. \nBut it was a very expensive thing for the people of Oklahoma. We went \nand looked at some of the things that happened in the city. Certainly \nwe all know or are sensitive today to the League of Cities which is \nhaving their annual meeting here in Washington.\n  In one city, Oklahoma City, the compliance with storm water \nmanagement and the Clean Water Act, in Oklahoma City alone it is \nestimated to be $2.7 million. The transportation regulations, which is \nthe metric conversion, some of their anticipated fees are in excess of \n$2 million over the next 5 years. Land use regulations--that is the \nrecycling and landfill requirements that have come--$2.5 million; the \nClean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act is somewhere in the millions. \nWe cannot even put the pencil to that.\n  In my city of Tulsa, OK, the other large city in Oklahoma, the Clean \nWater Act compliance was $10 million. The Safe Drinking Water Act was \n$16 million. The solid waste regulations, $700,000. And the lead-based \npaint, because it is a unique industry which we have there, it will \ncost in excess of $1 million.\n But when you look at the smaller communities like Broken Arrow, OK, \nthe Clean Water Act, the storm water regulations were $100,000; the \nsafe drinking water regulations were $40,000. This is a small community \nthat has a very difficult time making ends meet. Yet, they look at \nthese and they wonder why is it that we in Washington somehow have this \ninfinite wisdom that we know what is better for them and we are willing \nto mandate things for them to do. Yet, we are not going to fund it.\n\n  I think if we face the reality and the truth, Mr. President, I \nsuggest that it is because people in Washington, after being here for a \nwhile, cannot resist the insatiable appetite to spend money we do not \nhave. One tricky way of doing that is to take credit for something \npolitically at home in terms of the environment or something that we \nare needing to do that generally the people want and turn around and \ncause the people at home to pay for it.\n  I think we should look at this in another way, also. That is, what is \ngoing to happen with the frustration around the country if we do not do \nthis? I was heartened the other day to see what is happening in Catron \nCounty, NM. In the frustration of dealing with the U.S. Forest Service, \nthey enacted the U.S. Constitution as a county ordinance and put the \nFederal officials on notice to show up at the county supervisors \nmeeting to get permission to impose future mandates.\n  I think we are looking at something here that either we do, or it is \ngoing to be done for us. I have never been prouder of an organization \nthat is able to come in on both the House and Senate side and recognize \nthat this is not a Republican program, this is not a Democratic \nprogram, this is not a conservative or liberal program; this is \nsomething that everyone is for if they are really for getting the \nmaximum out of the tax dollars that are paid.\n  So, again, let me throw all the accolades I can on the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, who has been so effective in getting this through. \nThank you on behalf of all America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nOklahoma. Not only is he a tremendous addition to the U.S. Senate, but \nhis experience as a former mayor--I really think there are few training \ngrounds that can better equip you for the issues we deal with than to \nbe a mayor who deals with the pragmatic issues of government. He is a \nwelcome addition here.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know that the occupant of the chair \nwould like the Senate to finish its business at the earliest possible \nmoment. While he has not told me that, it seems to me that is the \nattitude he exhibited when I told him I was going to speak. I promise \nyou that it will be reasonably interesting and very, very short.\n  First, let me say that this bill could not be passed by the U.S. \nSenate, this conference, at a better time, because in the confines of \nthis city over the last 72 hours, councilmen and mayors and \n[[Page S3886]] councilwomen from all across America were here as part \nof the National League of Cities' conference. I used to belong to that \norganization many years ago when I was an ex officio mayor of my home \ncity. And our distinguished Senator, to whom we extend accolades here \ntoday, Senator Kempthorne, also served as mayor, but much later than I. \nI knew about the government way back then, and he knew about it even \nmore vividly.\n  But I might say to the Senate that there is no question that the \nexhilaration in the language and words of thanks and profuse gratitude \nfrom those who came from far and wide across America as mayors and \ncouncil people, saying this was the first step in some kind of \nrevitalization of federalism in a prudent and realistic manner, seem to \nme to be right on the mark. We were on the mark when we passed it.\n  So this bill begins a redefinition of the relationship between the \nFederal Government, States, and local governments and even our Indian \ntribes. In addition, due to the provisions of title II of this bill, it \nalso begins a little bit to move the relationship of the Federal \nGovernment's regulatory processes, vis-a-vis the private sector, in a \ndirection of somewhat more accountability for the bureaucracy's actions \nthat bind our American people and business people. We are not there yet \non private sector mandates. This is the very first step.\n  In the past, we have piled mandates on the States and the American \npeople with very little idea of their economic impact. It seems to me \nthese mandates were imposed with too much confidence that we could \nleave very open-ended, generalized kinds of authority to the \nregulators, expecting them to establish commonsense regulations. \nInstead, we have found the exact opposite. In many instances, you have \nto stretch your mind in terms of trying to figure out how they could \narrive at certain regulations from the laws we have passed.\n  So, at the very best, we did not fully understand the cost of our \nlaws, the cost and implications of our regulations on State and local \ngovernments and tribal governments, or the private sector. At the \nworst, we had no idea how much these laws and regulations cost the \nAmerican people. One estimate places the aggregate cost of existing \nmandates from hundreds of laws and thousands of regulations at $580 \nbillion annually.\n  Somebody pays that and somewhere it finds itself in either the cost \nof living of our people, or the cost of buying goods and services from \nour companies, because this huge cost does not just disappear into the \nether. It is there every day, in our front rooms, kitchens, on our \ngrocery shelves, the furniture and gasoline we buy, and all of the \nother things that we have seen fit to regulate without any real \nevidence of the risk and the cost and how it affects people.\n  In my own State--I repeat to the Senate--local officials, whether it \nbe the secretary of state or labor implementing motor vehicle \nregistrations, or the mayor of the little town of Las Vegas, NM, \nattempting to meet the needs of his small city, I have heard their \nappeals and they clearly are tired of the Federal Government telling \nthem precisely how to do things by regulation when they believe they \ncould do just as well in different ways at less cost to their people.\n  Small business in New Mexico first points to Federal regulations when \nasked what is slowing down employment and economic growth and causing \nthem to expand less than they think they could. Their answer, I repeat, \nis most frequently: Regulations that burden us unduly, that cost more \nthan they are worth. They are even raising this today more frequently \nthan they are talking about higher taxes and how taxes burden them.\n  That is not to say that taxes are not a burden to small business and \nthat they would not like to see some relief. But I am giving you my \nbest version of what I have heard for the last 14 months, because I did \ncall small business together in New Mexico. We had an advocacy group \nand we hold it together, and we have had about 800 small businesses go \nto five cities and just lay before me what is wrong with the Federal \nGovernment. It comes up over and over again that they are being \nregulated beyond belief, at costs that are significant, with \nachievements and goals that are irrelevant or very misleading in terms \nof their worth.\n  So I am hopeful that this bill will change the culture of the Federal \nGovernment by modifying the process by which we impose mandates on our \npeople. This bill requires Congress and Federal regulatory agencies to \nconsider the impact of mandates before they are legislated and \nimplemented.\n  I congratulate Senator Kempthorne on this bill. I congratulate his \nstaff and my staff, some of them from the Budget Committee. He is just \na freshman Senator, but actually we have all found that he is a \npowerful one and a good one. He introduced the bill, and our leader, \nSenator Dole, said, ``Manage it, since you feel so strongly about it.''\n  I remember him asking me, ``Do you think I can do it? What is \nmanaging a bill all about?''\n  And I said, ``Nobody can tell you until you have done it.''\n  I asked him the other day, and he had a mixed reaction to it all. He \nis not so leery about managing another one, but he was not totally \nsanguine about what he had to go through either.\n  We do have to go through some contortions here on the floor to \naccommodate fellow Senators. He, obviously, had to do that. And for \nsome who wanted to delay this process, he had to do that.\n  But over the past 2 years I helped where I could and I believe we \nstrengthened the bill in many respects. First, through Senator Exon's \nand my efforts, the point of order in this bill has been broadened to \napply to all legislation and the bill's new legislative mandate control \nprocedures have been folded into the Budget Act, where we have \nestablished precedents to show us how a point of order will work and \nhow it will not work.\n  Second, Senators Nickles, Dorgan and myself have worked to make sure \nthat the new procedures in this bill apply to the private sector.\n  This bill may be just a start in that direction, but let me suggest \nfor those who are overburdened in the private sector, this bill will \nsend a signal that we have not forgotten about them as we talk about \nmandates. Because many small businesses in America, because of the type \nof regulations being imposed and the attitude of those who impose it, \nbelieve the Federal Government is their adversary, their enemy, not \ntheir friend, not working in partnership and cooperation to see that \nregulations and the mandates of our laws get carried out. This bill is \ngoing to make one first step. Agencies are going to have to assess the \nimpact on small business, and it holds agencies accountable for their \nactions. There is one judicial review process that will be available to \nthem.\n  I am very hopeful that, as we move through regulatory reform, we will \nfind some more precise and better ways to address the huge, huge almost \nmalaise that is out there from the regulations and that we will start \nto make sense of it. And if, in a couple of years, the small business \ncommunity is saying, ``Our Government cares about us, they work with \nus, the regulators work with us instead of starting as enemies and \nwanting to penalize us, to fine us,'' we will have made a very giant \nstep in the right direction.\n  I thank Senator Kempthorne for yielding me time and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Domenici for \nhis comments. Again, we have a former mayor who has just spoken, and \nwho, from experience, knows what these unfunded mandates are all about, \nbut more importantly helped do something about it. During what was the \nChristmas recess, when, traditionally, there is some time off, we did \nnot take the time off. We worked diligently so that we could be ready \nwith S. 1, so that it could be ready the first day.\n  So I appreciate Senator Domenici's help on that. And to acknowledge \nhis staff, Bill Hoagland, Austin Smythe, and Kay Davies, who worked \ndiligently with us through this process.\n  Mr. President, I also think it is worth noting--and this is \nimportant-- \n[[Page S3887]] that of the conferees that were appointed--5 in the \nSenate, 8 in the House; a total of 13--we stated going into this, \nSenator Glenn has affirmed this point repeatedly, that this was a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I think it is significant that three Democrat Members of the House \nwere appointed to the conference and not all three had voted for this, \nwhich, at that time, was H.R. 5 in the Senate. Not all voted for it \nbut, significantly, all Members, all 13 conferees, signed this \nconference report. Cardiss Collins, Edolphus Towns, and Joe Moakley, we \nwant to thank them for their efforts throughout this process. Again, \nyou have a conference report now that has been unanimously signed by \nall conferees.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I am pleased to join with the Senator from Idaho in bringing \nto the floor this conference agreement on the unfunded mandates \nlegislation. In chairing the conference on S. 1, Senator Kempthorne did \nan excellent job of preserving the strong bipartisan support for this \nimportant reform that was the hallmark of its passage in both Houses.\n  This bill, as it now appears before us, is a careful balance of the \ndemands for strong, effective reform, with the necessity for reasonable \nprocedures and practical requirements. For example, we have provided \nfor judicial review of agency compliance with requirements for certain \ntypes of analysis of regulatory impacts but without allowing such \nreview to become a device that grinds the regulatory process to a halt. \nWe require agencies to seek the least costly or least burdensome option \nwhen developing regulations but we only require that they do so for a \nreasonable number of alternatives.\n  We have also struck fair compromises where the two versions of the \nlegislation imposed differing requirements. For example, we now require \na Congressional Budget Office analysis of any mandate on the private \nsector that exceeds $100, million per year in costs while the original \nSenate bill had set the threshold at $200, million and the House \nthreshold had been $50, million. We have also tailored the point of \norder provisions to the unique procedural needs of each of the two \nHouses.\n  And while the legislation aims primarily at future Federal mandates \nin its point of order and regulatory procedures provisions, it also \nacknowledges that existing mandates may need to be rethought. It does \nthis by charging the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations \nwith studying and reporting to us on effects of the current burdens \nimposed by such mandates. It asks ACIR to recommend how best to end \nmandates that are obsolete or duplicative. It also asks for \nrecommendations on how we might grant State and local governments more \nflexibility in complying with those mandates that ought to be retained.\n  In doing all of this, the conferees have developed a final version of \nthis much-needed reform that I can strongly commend to my colleagues. \nThis is due in large measure, as I have already mentioned, to the \ndiligent work of Senator Kempthorne, who has long championed this \nreform. He and his staff are to be commended for bringing us this far.\n  I also want to acknowledge the active role of Senator Glenn in \nshaping this final product. Senator Glenn and his staff have worked \nvery hard over the past year and a half, to ensure that this \nlegislation was able to have solid bipartisan support.\n  I am pleased to have worked with my two colleagues, and with the \nother conferees, to get us to this point. I know that my own staff has \nspent many long hours over the past several months to help in this \neffort, working closely with the staffs of the other conferees.\n  The bill now before us represents a landmark reform in the \nrelationship between the Federal Government, and State and local \ngovernments. I urge all Senators to give it their strong support.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth again, as I \nmentioned earlier, for his leadership and for the assistance of his \nstaff, Frank Polk and John Mercer.\ntreatment of disability laws under the unfunded mandates reform act of \n                                  1995\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nSenators Exon and Glenn, floor managers of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct of 1995, regarding the impact of this legislation on the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act [ADA], title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \nand the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA].\n  Mr. EXON. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague, Mr. Harkin, who served as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Disability Policy of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources from \n1987-95 and is currently ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. GLENN. I too would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with Mr. \nHarkin, who was also the chief sponsor of the ADA and the most recent \nbills reauthorizing the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the IDEA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The ADA and sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 are civil rights statutes protecting individuals from \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. It is my understanding that \nthese statutes are explicitly excluded from coverage under the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator is correct. The ADA and sections 503 and 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are explicitly excluded from coverage \nunder the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. Specifically, the bill \nprovides that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any \nprovision in a bill or joint resolution before Congress and any \nprovision in any proposed or final Federal regulation that establishes \nor enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of * * * handicapped or disability status.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. It is also my understanding that the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 includes a definition of the term \nFederal intergovernmental mandate and this definition explicitly \nexcludes discretionary grant programs--except certain entitlement \nprograms--that is, any provision in a bill or joint resolution that \nincludes a condition of Federal assistance or a duty arising from \nparticipation in a voluntary Federal program.\n  IDEA is a voluntary discretionary Federal program. Therefore, it is \nmy understanding that IDEA is not subject to the provisions of the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 because it is not considered a \nFederal intergovernmental mandate. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator is correct. Because IDEA is a voluntary \ndiscretionary Federal program, it is not considered a Federal \nintergovernmental mandate. Therefore, none of the provisions applicable \nto Federal intergovernmental mandates included in the legislation apply \nto IDEA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As the Senator knows, part B of IDEA--also known as \nPublic Law 94-142--was enacted in 1975. Both the House and Senate \nreports that accompany the original legislation clearly attribute the \nimpetus for the act to two Federal court decisions rendered in 1971 and \n1972. As the Senate report states, passage of the act followed a series \nof landmark court cases establishing in law the right to education of \nall handicapped children. The U.S. Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson, \n468 U.S. 992, recognized that part B of IDEA is a comprehensive scheme \nset up by Congress to aid the States in complying with their \nconstitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped \nchildren. The Court cited another portion of the Senate report, which \nstated, ``It is the intent of the Committee to establish and protect \nthe right to education for all handicapped children and to provide \nassistance to the states in carrying out their responsibilities under \nState law and the Constitution of the United States to provide equal \nprotection under the law.'' The Supreme Court then explained that ``The \n[IDEA] was an attempt to relieve the fiscal burden placed on States and \nlocalities by their responsibility to provide education of all \nhandicapped children.''\n  It is my understanding that the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995 do not apply to any provision in a bill or joint \nresolution before Congress that enforces constitutional rights of \nindividuals. In light of the statements of congressional intent and the \nconclusions reached by the U.S. Supreme Court, would you agree \n[[Page S3888]] with me that IDEA enforces constitutional rights of \nindividuals and as such is excluded from coverage under the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995?\n  Mr. EXON. I agree with the Senator's conclusion in light of the \nstatements of congressional intent he cited to and the conclusions \nreached by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is also my understanding that the provisions of the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to IDEA because, like \nthe ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, IDEA is a \ncivil rights statute that establishes or enforces statutory rights that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of handicapped or disability \nstatus.\n  Mr. EXON. I agree with that conclusion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for entering into this colloquy with \nme. I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum prepared by the American \nLaw Division of the Congressional Research Service regarding the \napplicability of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 to the ADA, \nIDEA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator for raising these important issues.\n  Mr. EXON. I also wish to thank him for raising these issues.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 1995.\n     To: Senator Harkin, Attention: Bob Silverstein.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Unfunded Federal Mandates Bill and the Americans \n       with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities \n       Education Act.\n\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for an analysis of the language of S. 1 and H.R. 5, 104th \n     Cong., 1st Sess., to determine if the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12101 et seq., \n     and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), \n     20 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1400 et seq., would be covered under \n     these bills. It should be emphasized that these bills are \n     currently undergoing extensive debate and amendment. This \n     memorandum is based on the language contained in the Senate \n     bill as reported out of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on January 11, 1995 and the Senate Budget Committee \n     on January 12, 1995, and on the language contained in the \n     House bill as reported out of the House Committee on Rules on \n     January 13, 1995.\n       These bills are both referred to as the ``Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1995.'' Basically, both bills, with some \n     variance in details, would establish new congressional \n     procedures for identifying and controlling certain existing \n     as well as new unfunded federal mandates. The bills set forth \n     new congressional procedures that would prohibit the House \n     and Senate from considering legislation that creates new \n     mandates or changes existing mandates from direct costs over \n     a statutory threshold unless it also includes a source of \n     financing or a guarantee that any such mandates will be \n     repealed if the financing is not provided. Other provisions \n     in the bills relate to the establishment of a Commission on \n     Unfunded Federal Mandates that is required to review existing \n     federal mandates to state, local, and tribal governments and \n     to the private sector, and to make recommendations regarding \n     possible changes in these mandates. There are also provisions \n     requiring federal agencies to assess the effect of federal \n     regulations on state, local and tribal governments and on the \n     private sector and to make public such assessments for \n     federal mandates costing more than $100 million to implement.\n       Both bills contain a section entitled ``Limitation on \n     Application.''\\1\\ Section 4 of S. 1 provides that ``this part \n     shall not apply to any provision in a Federal statute or a \n     proposed or final Federal regulation that--(1) enforces \n     constitutional rights of individuals; (2) establishes or \n     enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on \n     the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, \n     handicapped or disability status, (3) requires compliance \n     with accounting and auditing procedures with respect to \n     grants or other money or property provided by the Federal \n     Government; (4) provides for emergency assistance or relief \n     at the request of any State, local government, or tribal \n     government or any official of such a government; (5) is \n     necessary for the national security or the ratification or \n     implementation of international treaty obligations; or (6) \n     the President designates as emergency legislative and that \n     the Congress so designates in statute.'' It would appear that \n     both the ADA and IDEA would be exempted from the requirements \n     of the Unfunded Mandate Act based upon these exceptions, and \n     IDEA would also come under the exception to the definition of \n     Federal Intergovernmental Mandate for conditions of financial \n     assistance.\n     Footnotes at the end of the memorandum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The ADA would apparently be covered by the second \n     exception, and possibly the first. The ADA provides, in part, \n     that its purpose is ``to provide a clear and comprehensive \n     national mandate for the elimination of discrimination \n     against individuals with disabilities.'' \\2\\ The legislative \n     history of the statute is replete with discussions of \n     discriminatory actions and comparisons with civil rights \n     protections given to individuals on the basis of race.\\3\\ An \n     examination of statutes that are commonly referred to as \n     civil rights statutes, for example, title VI of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000d, indicates that the \n     broadest common denominator is that these statutes prohibit \n     discrimination against a particular class or particular \n     classes of individuals. Using this criteria, it would appear \n     that the ADA would be considered to be a civil rights statute \n     as the term is used in the second exception to the unfunded \n     mandates legislation. It is also possible that the first \n     exception, regarding statutes that enforce constitutional \n     rights, might also be applicable to the ADA. The ADA states, \n     in part, that its purpose is ``to invoke the sweep of \n     congressional authority, including the power to enforce the \n     Fourteenth Amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to \n     address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by \n     people with disabilities.''\\4\\ It could be argued that this \n     language, coupled with findings concerning the constitutional \n     rights of individuals with disabilities such as were made in \n     City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 \n     (1985), would suffice to bring the ADA under the first \n     exception in the unfunded mandates legislation.\n       IDEA would apparently be covered by the exception to the \n     definition of federal intergovernmental mandate contained in \n     Section 3 of S. 1 and Section 301 of H.R. 5 as well as by the \n     first two exceptions regarding the enforcement of \n     constitutional rights and the exception for civil rights \n     statutes contained in the ``Limitation on Application'' \n     provisions discussed above. The term ``Federal \n     Intergovernmental Mandate'' is defined in both the Senate and \n     House bills as meaning ``any provision in legislation, \n     statute, or regulation that--(i) would impose an enforceable \n     duty upon States, local governments, or tribal governments, \n     except--(I) a condition of Federal assistance; or (II) a duty \n     arising from participation in a voluntary Federal program. . \n     .''\\5\\ IDEA provides funds to the states so that they may \n     provide a free appropriate public education to all children \n     with disabilities. As a condition for the receipt of these \n     funds, the act contains detailed requirements for the \n     provision of an education. Clearly, IDEA is a grants statute \n     which imposes certain conditions upon the receipt of federal \n     funds. As such it would be covered by the exception quoted \n     above.\n       IDEA may also be exempted from coverage by virtue of the \n     two exceptions regarding constitutional rights and civil \n     rights statutes.\\6\\ IDEA was originally enacted in 1975 in \n     response to two judicial decisions\\7\\ which found certain \n     constitutional requirements for an education for children \n     with disabilities. In addition, the Supreme Court in Smith v. \n     Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), stated that ``The EHA (now \n     called IDEA) is a comprehensive scheme set up by Congress to \n     aid the States in complying with their constitutional \n     obligations to provide public education for handicapped \n     children.'' At 1009. It could be argued that IDEA is, then, a \n     statute enacted to help enforce constitutional rights. \n     Similarly, IDEA specifically states that part of its purpose \n     is to assure that the rights of children with disabilities \n     and their parents or guardians are protected.\\8\\ These rights \n     are further defined in the statute. An examination of the \n     legislative history of the act indicates that it was in \n     response to the exclusion of children with disabilities from \n     a public school education.\\9\\ Since exclusion would appear to \n     fall within the parameters of the term discrimination, it \n     would appear that IDEA could also be classified as a civil \n     rights statute.\n       We hope this information is useful to you.

Mr. President, I will soon introduce a piece of \nlegislation dealing with derivatives. The term ``derivative'' is not \nreadily understood by most.\n  We read in the newspapers and hear on television reports these days \nabout derivatives. The most recent news story, of course, was about a \n28-year-old young fellow, an employee of the Barings Bank of England, a \n230-year-old bank.\n  This young employee of the Barings Bank of England was stationed in \nSingapore. In Singapore as an employee of an English bank he was \nbetting on the Nikkei index on the Japanese stock exchange. Turns out \nthat he lost $1 billion, and a 230-year-old British bank went under.\n  This is not the first time we have heard about derivatives. We heard \nabout derivatives with respect to Orange County, CA. We heard about \nderivative failures across this country in recent years and it has \nalarmed some people, and justifiably so. Some who thought their \nretirement earnings were safe found out that the mutual fund they \nthought they invested in was, in fact, leveraged with derivatives.\n  Schoolteachers, school districts, cities, elderly people who had \nsaved for their retirement, all have discovered in recent years the \nrisk and potential danger of derivative trading when they do not know \nwhat they are doing. There are worldwide some $30 to $35 trillion in \nderivative contracts.\n  Derivatives in another manner and another name can be simple hedging, \nand hedging is a very customary thing to have happened. Banks hedge, \nfarmers hedge. Hedging is a customary transaction. I have no trouble \nwith that. Derivatives have become an international financial game and, \nin fact, some countries call it wagering or betting.\n  In this country, we have some very large banks that have begun \ntrading in derivatives on their own account. They are involved in \nproprietary trading and derivatives in their own account. Not for \ncustomers.\n  The difficulty I have with that is when a financial institution whose \ndeposits are insured by the American taxpayers with Federal deposit \ninsurance, starts putting up a keno pit in their lobby and gambling \neffectively on derivatives, believing if they lose their shirt, the \nAmerican taxpayers will pay. That is wrong. I do not believe financial \ninstitutions whose deposits are insured by the Federal Government \nshould be involved in any case or under any conditions in trading for \ntheir own proprietary accounts in derivatives. It is far too risky and \nfar too fraught with potential failure.\n  In this case, the failure will be underwritten by the American \ntaxpayers. We have seen a chapter of this in the past. It was called \njunk bonds in savings and loans. Let us not see that repeat itself in \nthis country with banks and derivatives.\n  Now, most American banks are not involved in derivative trading. \nNinety-nine percent of them are not. But we have several very large \nbanks in the country, some of the largest, that are involved in \nderivatives, with risks up to 500 percent of their entire capital \nstructure.\n  I will introduce legislation that I introduced in the previous \nCongress. It is very simple. It does not prohibit traditional hedging \nby financial institutions for the purposes of hedging risk. It does \nprevent and prohibit institutions whose deposits are insured by the \nFederal Government from trading on a proprietary basis in derivatives. \nThat makes no sense, and we ought to stop it.\n  The fact is we have Federal regulators involved in looking over their \nshoulders on derivatives trading, but is like having traffic cops \ninvolved in looking at computer crime. It simply does not work.\n  We have a $30 to $35 trillion dollar worldwide derivative business, \nand we see what can happen. We see what happens when a 28-year-old, \nworking for a British bank, living in Singapore, bets on Japanese \nstocks and loses $1 billion, and everyone stands around looking \nsurprised.\n  We saw everyone scratching their heads looking surprised that Orange \nCounty went bankrupt. It is fine to stand up and decide that the \nregulators have to do their jobs, and we as legislators ought to do \nours, and ours ought to be to say to all financial institutions in this \ncountry, if you have Federal deposit insurance, you have no business \ntrading in derivatives.\n  The American taxpayers do not deserve to be stuck with your losses if \nyou want to gamble with their money. I hope some of my colleagues would \nsee merit in this legislation and help me pass it.\n  I recall the legislation that I offered that finally passed the \nCongress prohibiting savings and loans from buying junk bonds. There \nwas a struggle to get that passed, but I finally did. The reason I got \nit passed was, unfortunately, we had already lost a bundle by having \nS's buy junk bonds. They are up to their neck in debt with junk \nbonds.\n  It should never have happened. The ultimate absurdity was the Federal \nGovernment ended up owning junk bonds in the Taj Mahal Casino because \nan S that went bankrupt owned Taj Mahal junk bonds that were \nnonperformers and the Federal Government ended up owning bank junk \nbonds in a casino.\n  That is the absurdity where we got with junk bonds, and we will head \nthe same way with derivatives, mark my words, unless we decide that \ninstitutions whose deposits are insured ought not to bet on \nderivatives.\n  That is the purpose of my legislation. My hope is that several \ncolleagues will see fit to pass this legislation in the near future. I \nthank may colleague from Ohio for indulging me with his statement.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I ask that the time be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3889-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3889-S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, in thanking people who were instrumental in \nputting together this kind of legislation, I think we probably were \nremiss in not thanking Tony Coe, who did so much in the legislative \ncounsel's office in putting together draft after draft after draft of \nthis.\n  I saw him walking through the Chamber a moment ago, and I want him to \nstep outside just for a moment. I say to Tony, we thank him for all his \nefforts. I know he does long hours over in the legislative counsel's \noffice putting together some of these legislative proposals which have \nto be written and rewritten, as this one was.\n  We were spelling out a while ago people instrumental in getting this \nlegislation through, and Tony certainly deserves to be commended for \nhis efforts on behalf of this legislation, too, and we are glad to \nrecognize him for it.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to add my thanks also to Mr. \nTony Coe and all that he has done. I think so often people do not \nrealize the intricacies of this and the hours that are put in, and yet, \ntime after time, we require staff to answer the call. Tony \n[[Page S3890]] has done that in an exemplary fashion. We thank him for \nthat. He has helped significantly, I think, in changing the mindset of \nhow Congress will operate and he can be proud of it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, was leader's time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, one of the first decisions I had to make as \nmajority leader was which bill should be designated S. 1. When I \nconsidered the message the American people sent us last November, the \ndecision was easy. I chose Senator Kempthorne's unfunded mandates bill, \nbecause it shows we are serious about reining in the power of the \nFederal Government.\n  The 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.\n\n  When the 104th Congress convened, I pledged that we would dust off \nthe 10th amendment, and restore it to its rightful place in the \nConstitution.\n  The unfunded mandates bill is the first step in the important process \nof returning power to the States and to the people. For far too long, \nCongress has operated under the false assumption that legislation that \ndid not affect the Federal Government had no cost. But, ask any mayor, \nGovernor, county commissioner, or school board official--or any State \nand local taxpayer--and they will tell you otherwise.\n  This law will change the way we do business in Washington. Under \nbusiness-as-usual, Congress had the costly habit of giving State and \nlocal governments new\n responsibilities without supplying the money to pay for these new \nobligations. Those unfunded mandates have forced State and local \nofficials to cut services or increase taxes in order to keep their \nbudgets in balance.\n\n  The unfunded mandates law will be a reality check for advocates of \nnew mandates: the Federal Government should know and pay for the costs \nof mandates before imposing them on State and local governments, and \nthe Federal Government should know the costs and impacts before \nimposing them on the private sector.\n  This law will provide real relief to State and local governments, and \nto the people who ultimately pay the bills for unfunded mandates--\nindividual American taxpayers.\n  I am pleased that this bill will pass with strong bipartisan support, \nand there are a lot of Senators who deserve credit for this \ninitiative's success. Senator Glenn has led the effort on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, and Senators Domenici and Roth are among \nthose who have also worked hard for this bill.\n  But no Senator worked harder than our colleague from Idaho, Senator \nDirk Kempthorne. He came to the Senate as a mayor, with front-line \nexperience coping with the Federal Government telling him how to run \nBoise, ID. When he ran for the Senate, he promised the people of Idaho \nhe would fight to stop unfunded mandates. He kept his promise. The \nfirst bill he introduced was an unfunded mandates bill--and it \nattracted only three cosponsors. But that did not stop him. He kept \npushing, and\n he helped mobilize the mayors, county commissioners, and Governors, \nwho stepped up their efforts. After he got more than 51 cosponsors on \nhis unfunded mandates bill, he worked across the aisle to write a \nbipartisan bill. After that effort was blocked late last year, he spent \nthe recess writing a better, tougher bill. He then spent 11 days and \nnights tirelessly debating and managing the bill on the floor, and 40 \ndays and nights--it seems there is something else about 40 days and \nnights--getting it through the conference, successfully resisting \nefforts to weaken it.\n\n  All that work has produced a strong bill that all of us can be proud \nof, and all of us should vote for.\n  A few weeks ago, I told mayors they should send Senator Kempthorne \nand Senator Glenn keys to their cities to thank them for their efforts.\n  I do not know if they have received any keys yet, but if you can use \nsome, maybe I can round them up. Maybe by now you both have a pocketful \nof keys, and I am certain there are more on the way.\n  After all, our Nation's mayors, Governors, county commissioners, and \ntaxpayers would be hard pressed to find a better friend than Senator \nDirk Kempthorne.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for S. 1, and I \nurge President Clinton to sign it into law at the earliest possible \ndate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I wish to echo what America's mayors, \nGovernors, and county commissioners are saying, and that is their \ngratitude to Senator Dole for designating this bill S. 1. That sort of \nstamp of priority by the majority leader of the Senate went a long way \ntoward helping propel this legislation toward what we believe tomorrow \nwill be its successful conclusion.\n  So again, on behalf of America's mayors, Governors, and myself, I \nthank the Senator for the honor of having this legislation designated \nS. 1.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The vote is scheduled to \nbe held tomorrow.\n  Mr. GLENN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. The vote, as I \nunderstand it, will be the second vote tomorrow. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide quality standards for mammograms performed \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n         the women veterans' mammography quality standards act\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for a number of years, I have \nbeen active--both through legislation and oversight activity--in \nseeking to improve VA's response to women veterans. While there has \nbeen some progress, much remains to be done. During the last Congress, \nwe were poised to make some significant improvements, particularly in \ndefining which services VA must furnish to women veterans. \nUnfortunately, that legislation, along with other vital measures, died \nin the closing hours of the Congress. While those issues may still be \nbrought into play on legislation later on this year, one element of our \nprior effort can clearly be separated out at this time and dealt with \non its own merits--and that's what the bill I am introducing today will \ndo.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing, which is cosponsored by \nSenators Akaka, Jeffords, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, and Murkowski, would \nensure that women veterans will receive safe and accurate mammograms. \nUnder this measure, VA facilities that furnish mammography would be \nrequired to meet quality assurance and quality control standards that \nare no less stringent than those to which other mammography providers \nare subject under the Mammography Quality Standards Act. VA facilities \nthat contract with non-VA facilities would be required to contract only \nwith facilities that comply with that act. I will now highlight briefly \nthe provisions contained in this legislation.\n\n\n                         summary of provisions\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would establish quality standards for \nmammography services furnished by VA which would:\n  First, require that all VA facilities that furnish mammography be \naccredited by a private nonprofit organization designated by the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Second, require the Secretary to designate only an accrediting body \nthat meets the standards for accrediting bodies issued by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services for purposes of accrediting mammography \nfacilities subject to the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992--\nPublic Law 102-539.\n  Third, require the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, to issue quality assurance and quality \ncontrol standards for mammography services furnished in VA facilities \nthat would be no less stringent than the Department \n[[Page S3892]] of Health and Human Services regulations to which other \nmammography providers are subject under the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act of 1992.\n  Fourth, require the Secretary to issue such regulations not later \nthan 120 days after enactment of this legislation.\n  Fifth, require the Secretary to inspect mammography equipment \noperated by VA facilities on an annual basis in a manner consistent \nwith requirements contained in the Mammography Quality Standards Act \nconcerning annual inspections of mammography equipment by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, except that the Secretary of Veterans' \nAffairs would not have the authority to delegate inspection \nresponsibilities to a State agency.\n  Sixth, require VA health care facilities that provide mammography \nthrough contracts with non-VA providers to contract only with \nmammography providers that comply with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services' quality assurance and quality control regulations.\n  Seventh, require the Secretary, not later than 180 days after the \nSecretary prescribes the mammography quality assurance and quality \ncontrol regulations, to submit a report to the House and Senate \nCommittees on Veterans' Affairs on the implementation of those \nregulations.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I emphasize just how vital improving VA \nhealth services for women veterans is to VA's future. Regardless of the \noutcome of national health care reform efforts, progress on health care \nreform at the State level dictates that VA must compete directly with \nnon-VA providers. In addition, the State plans probably will provide \nveterans entitled to VA care, many of whom are presently uninsured, a \nwider range of health care choices. Under this scenario, VA would have \nto furnish a full continuum of health services, including quality \nmammography, in order to compete successfully for women veteran \npatients.\n  This bill would hold VA to the mammography standards required of \nother providers. Anything less would deny the great debt we owe to the \ncourageous women who have sacrificed themselves in service to our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the chairman of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Simpson, the cosponsors of this \nbill, and the other members of the committee to gain prompt action on \nit in our committee and the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Women Veterans' Mammography \n     Quality Standards Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MAMMOGRAPHY QUALITY STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Performance of Mammograms.--Mammograms may not be \n     performed at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility unless \n     that facility is accredited for that purpose by a private \n     nonprofit organization designated by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. The organization designated by the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall meet the standards for \n     accrediting bodies establishing by the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services under section 354(e) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b(e)).\n       (b) Quality Standards.--(1) Not later than 120 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall prescribe quality assurance and \n     quality control standards relating to the performance and \n     interpretation of mammograms and use of mammogram equipment \n     and facilities by personnel of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs. Such standards shall be no less stringent than the \n     standards prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services under section 354(f) of the Public Health Service \n     Act.\n       (2) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall prescribe \n     standards under this subsection in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       (c) Inspection of Department Equipment.--(1) The Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs shall, on an annual basis, inspect the \n     equipment and facilities utilized by and in Department of \n     Veterans Affairs health-care facilities for the performance \n     of mammograms in order to ensure the compliance of such \n     equipment and facilities with the standards prescribed under \n     subsection (b). Such inspection shall be carried out in a \n     manner consistent with the inspection of certified facilities \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section \n     354(g) of the Public Health Services Act.\n       (2) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may not delegate the \n     responsibility of such secretary under paragraph (1) to a \n     State agency.\n       (d) Application of Standards to Contract Providers.--The \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure that mammograms \n     performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs under \n     contract with any non-Department facility or provider conform \n     to the quality standards prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services under section 354 of the Public \n     Health Service Act.\n       (e) Report.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives a report on the quality \n     standards prescribed by the Secretary under subsection \n     (b)(1).\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit the report not later than \n     180 days after the date on which the Secretary prescribes \n     such regulations.\n       (f) Definition.--In this section, the term ``mammogram'' \n     shall have the meaning given such term in section 354(a)(5) \n     of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b(a)).\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 550. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailway Labor Act to prevent discrimination based on participation in \nlabor disputes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       Labor dispute legislation\n\n  Mr. EXON.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which I hope--and I \nemphasize ``I hope''--will serve as a common ground for the two warring \nfactions very prominent in our society today.\n\n  My bill amends the Federal labor law by providing a short-term ban on \npermanent replacement workers for the first 60 days of a strike. Then \npermanent replacements could be gradually phased in over a 12-month \nperiod so that an employer could hire 100 percent of their work force \nas permanent replacements by the end of a year.\n  I believe that those two warring factions--management and labor--need \nto focus more on what is in our Nation's long-term best interests and \nless on getting and keeping an upper hand. I caution either side from \nthinking that crushing blows or complete victories are within reach. \nThey are not. I have proposed my idea before but neither side wanted to \ntake the first step.\n  To management I say you have leveraged a rarely used practice into \nwhat is now the sledgehammer of negotiations. The right to strike hangs \nby the thread that separates the difference between being fired and \nbeing permanently replaced. To labor I say the global economy has \nremade the rules. International competitiveness may mean that labor \nwill have to settle for less than the whole loaf sometimes.\n  I voted against NAFTA and against GATT for various reasons, but some \nof the most important involved my concern that our chase for cheap \nlabor would erode the ground under our workers and the standard of \nliving in America. But that is over and done with. We can shore up as \nbest we can, but I fear the erosion may continue, not subside.\n  The two old bulls, labor and management, are still at it, with their \nhorns locked, straining. The harmful effects of that intransigence can \nbe seen in the festering sore of professional baseball. They often \nthreaten to pull the Senate into the trenches and seem to have done so \nonce again.\n  Mr. President, I make this appeal: Congress has the power to step in \nand set some ground rules instead of being pushed this way and pushed \nthat. Let us take this opportunity to impose some order, set some \nrules, then hopefully set this issue aside and see if such a resolution \nworks.\n  Under my bill, management is barred from simply replacing workers \npermanently the day after the strike. Certainly management can keep the \nplant open, if they choose, with temporary workers. Labor knows, \nhowever, that the meter is running under my bill and that the effect of \nthe strike is diminished with time.\n  For example, after 60 days, the employer can hire 10 percent of the \nwork force as replacements, permanent replacements; after 90 days, 20 \npercent; \n[[Page S3893]] after 4 months, 30 percent; after 5 months, 40 percent; \nafter 6 months, 50 percent; after 9 months, 75 percent; and after 1 \nyear, 100 percent, if that is the desire of management.\n  Management will say that the 60-day ban is too long, while labor will \nsay that a year before being completely replaced is too short. I say \nthat sounds like the start of a good compromise.\n  Congress can break this logjam, and I think it should. I do not \nbelieve this is a matter to be resolved by Executive order but, rather, \nby law. I think this proposal can satisfy well-meaning and well-\nintentioned people on both sides of the issue and may help us to look \nforward in both the Senate and this country to something better.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that we look ahead to the 21st century. Let \nus quit sticking our heads in the sand with meaningless gestures. \nAnyone who is looking beyond next year or the next election, who truly \nbelieves in collective bargaining, should recognize that international \ncompetition in the 21st century demands labor/management cooperation \nand not war.\n  I submit it is not fair or reasonable to expect a union worker to \nstrike for economic grievances when he or she could lose their job the \nvery first day that they dare walk the picket line.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow for the orderly transfer of a license for the operation of a \nsmall hydroelectric facility in my State of Montana. This operation is \nno longer generating electricity. The utility that owns it, Montana \nPower, no longer finds it economical to continue to do so. Montana \nPower would like to turn the operation and ownership of the dam over to \nsomeone else. And there is a potential buyer, the county of Granite. \nThe county would like to buy the facility, refurbish it, and continue \nto generate low-cost electricity for itself and its neighbors.\n  However, FERC, the agency that must approve the license request is \ndemanding that the buyer pay for the rent of Forest Service land that \nlies under the lake that was created by the dam. The Forest Service \ngets no benefit from the land. It's under several feet of water. And \nthe Federal Government already owns one-third of my State of Montana.\n  I believe that this bill, which will defer the rental costs for 5 \nyears which will allow the county to get its repair work done and get \nthe generation on-line, is an equitable solution to the problem posed \nby FERC. I hope that they will support the bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN:\n  S. 553. A bill to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n1967 to reinstate an exemption for certain bona fide hiring and \nretirement plans applicable to State and local firefighters and law \nenforcement officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n        the age discrimination in employment amendments of 1995\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I introduce the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Amendments of 1995, legislation designed \nto give State and local governments the same right to set mandatory \nretirement ages and maximum hiring ages for their police and \nfirefighters that the Federal Government currently enjoys.\n  Throughout the 104th Congress, there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion about the need for those of us in this body to hold \nourselves accountable to the same standards other Americans have to \nmeet.\n  We have debated and passed congressional coverage legislation, which \nwill apply to Congress a number of laws that have already been applied \nto the private sector. We have also debated and passed unfunded \nmandates legislation in order to ensure that the Federal Government \ndoes not impose mandates on State and local governments without the \nfunding necessary to cover the cost of those mandates.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on this same basic \ntheme. Currently, the Federal Government enjoys a permanent exemption \nfrom the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that allows it to set \nmandatory retirement ages and maximum hiring ages for its public safety \nofficers. In effect, this exemption authorizes Federal public safety \nagencies to use mandatory retirement ages and maximum hiring ages for \ntheir police officers and firefighters including:\n  The U.S. Park Police; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Department \nof Justice Law Enforcement personnel; District of Columbia \nfirefighters; U.S. Forest Service firefighters; the Central \nIntelligence Agency; the Capitol Police; and Federal firefighters.\n  However, this same exemption from the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act is not available to State and local governments.\n  My legislation corrects this disparity by allowing State and local \ngovernments the right to set mandatory retirement and maximum hiring \nages if they so choose.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that last point. This legislation \nmerely allows State and local governments to set mandatory retirement \nand maximum hiring ages if they so choose.\n  The bill does not set national, mandatory retirement and maximum \nhiring ages for police and firefighters. It does not require State \nlocal governments to create their own mandatory retirement and maximum \nhiring ages. It does not even encourage them to do so. It merely grants \nState and local governments the same rights in this area which are \ncurrently being enjoyed by the Federal Government.\n  As a general rule, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits \nemployers from discriminating against workers solely on the basis of \nage, and generally prohibits the use of mandatory retirement and \nmaximum hiring ages.\n  Prior to Congress enacting an exemption in 1986, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act allowed State and local governments to \nuse mandatory retirement and maximum hiring ages for their public \nsafety officers only if they could prove in court that these rules were \nbona fide occupational qualifications [BFOQ's] reasonably necessary for \nthe normal operation of the business.\n  Although this approach sounds reasonable, courts in some \njurisdictions ruled limits permissible while identical limits were held\n impermissible in other jurisdictions. For example, the Missouri \nHighway Patrol's maximum hiring age of 32 was upheld while Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff's maximum hiring age of 35 was not. East Providence's \nmandatory retirement age of 60 for police officers was upheld while \nPennsylvania's mandatory retirement age of 60 was struck down.\n\n  As a result, no State or local government could be sure of the \nlegality of its hiring or retirement policies. They could, however, be \nsure of having to spend scarce financial resources to defend their \npolicies in court.\n  The 1986 amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \nauthorized State and local governments to set maximum hiring ages and \nmandatory retirement ages until January 1, 1994. It also ordered the \nEEOC and the Department of Labor to conduct a study to determine:\n  Whether physical and mental fitness tests can accurately assess the \nability of police and firefighters to perform the requirements of their \njobs; which particular types of tests are most effective; and what \nspecific standards such tests should satisfy.\n  Finally, the 1986 amendment directed the EEOC to promulgate \nguidelines on the administration and use of physical and mental fitness \ntests for police and firefighters.\n  Despite the very clear mandate in the 1986 amendment, neither the \nEEOC nor its researchers complied with that mandate.\n  While the Penn State researchers who conducted the study concluded \nthat age was a poor predictor of job performance, they failed to \nevaluate which particular physical and mental fitness tests are most \neffective to evaluate public safety officers and \n[[Page S3895]] which specific standards such tests should satisfy.\n  Nor did the EEOC promulgate guidelines to assist State and local \ngovernments in the administration and use of such tests, as Congress \ndirected. As a result, State and local governments find themselves \nwithout a public safety exemption from the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, and also without any guidance as how to test their \nemployees.\n  I firmly believe that, as a rule, Congress should avoid exempting \nwhole classes of employees from the protection of civil rights laws. We \nshould not carve out exemptions merely because an employer finds civil \nrights compliance to be too costly or inconvenient. Exemptions must be \nmade only when there is a strong compelling need to do so and there is \nno other reasonable alternative.\n  That is the situation here. State and local fire and police agencies \nmust be exempt from ADEA in order to protect and promote the safety of \nthe public. This is literally a life or death matter; if police \nofficers and firefighters cannot adequately perform their duties, \npeople die and people get hurt.\n  Numerous medical studies have found that age directly affects an \nindividual's ability to perform the duties of a public safety officer. \nThis is not a stereotype. This is not ageism. This is a medical fact.\n  Consider the facts the American Heart Association found that clearly \ndemonstrate the increased risk of heart attack and death in older \nindividuals. One in six men and one in seven women between the ages of \n45-64 has some form of heart disease. The ratio soars to one in three \nat age 65 and beyond. For people over age 55, incident of stroke more \nthan doubles in each successive decade.\n  The diminishing of physical capabilities can also be seen in \nstatistics in the field of public safety. For example, although \nfirefighters over 50 comprise only one-seventh of the total number of \nfirefighters, they account for one-third of all firefighter deaths\n  Now, you may ask why State and local governments cannot just develop \ntests to screen out those individuals who may still retain their \nstrength at the age of 60 or 70. However, there is no adequate test \nthat can simulate the conditions that firefighters and police officers \nface in the line of duty.\n  The fact that an individual passes a fitness test one day does not, \nin and of itself, mean that the individual is capable of performing the \nsustained, strenuous, constant, physical activity required of a public \nsafety officer. If a 75-year-old walks in and takes a test, and happens \nto be healthy on that particular day, a State or local government would \nhave to hire that individual, even though that individual may not, day \nin and day out, be capable of physically performing his or her job.\n  Mr. President, as many of you in this body know, I come from a law \nenforcement background. My father was a police officer. My uncle was a \npolice officer. My brother still is a police officer. I feel very \nstrongly that we in Congress need to do everything we can to ensure \nthat our rank and file officers have everything they need to do their \njobs.\n  The legislation I offer here today is widely supported by rank and \nfile public safety officers. In fact, my office has been besieged by \ncalls and letters and visits from police officers and firefighters who \nwant to see a permanent exemption enacted into law. I would like to \nread a list of organizations that support this legislation:\n  The Fire Department Safety Officers Association; the Fraternal Order \nof Police; the International Association of Firefighters; the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police; the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers; the International Society of Fire \nService Instructors; the International Union of Police Associations, \nAFL-CIO; the National Association of Police Organizations; The National \nSheriffs Association; the National Troopers Coalition; the American \nFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the National \nPublic Employer Labor Relations Association; the New York State \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; and the City of Chicago Department of \nPolice.\n  This legislation is also supported by the following State and local \ngovernmental organizations:\n  The National League of Cities; the National Association of Counties; \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures; and the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support and quickly \nenact this carefully drawn, greatly needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 553\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I introduce a bill to amend the \nEqual Access to Justice Act.\n  This legislation makes some needed improvements to the act to speed \nup the process of awarding attorney's fees to private parties who \nprevail in certain suits against the United States.\n  Mr. President, there has been considerable attention paid in the past \nfew weeks to legislation such as regulatory reform, tort reform, and \nvarious pieces of the Republican contract which claim to address the \nconcerns of many Americans that substantial change needs to take place \nin many areas.\n  My bill deals with some aspects of these concerns by assisting \nordinary citizens who face legal conflicts with their Federal \nGovernment and prevail. The basic premise of EAJA is about giving \nindividuals and small businesses the ability to confront the Government \non a more equal footing. It is another step toward getting Government \noff the backs of the average citizen and small business owner.\n  I am convinced the improvements I have proposed will make the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act work better and reduce the overall costs to \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, this is an area in which I have worked for several \nyears before coming to this body.\n  My interest in this issue arises from my experience both as a private \nattorney and a member of the Wisconsin Senate.\n  When I was in private practice, I was aware of how attorneys' fees \nand the other costs associated with litigation could be a burden to a \nplaintiff with limited resources, even if the claim was just.\n  Once I entered the State senate, I authored legislation modeled on \nthe Federal law. The State law, found in section 814.246 of the \nWisconsin statutes, was enacted in 1985.\n  It seemed to me then, and does now, that we should do what we can to \nremove this burden to plaintiffs who need their claims reviewed and \ndecided by an impartial decisionmaker.\n  When I joined the U.S. Senate, I began looking at how these two \nFederal statutes operate and whether change was needed. I was \nparticularly interested in how we could make the system work better.\n  I am convinced change is necessary and that we can bring the system \nup to date to reflect 14 years worth of experience.\n  Mr. President, the Equal Access to Justice Act was enacted in 1980 \nand made permanent in 1985. The original intent of the act was to make \nthe task of suing the Federal Government less daunting for small \nbusiness owners. It was perceived that these owners suffered onerous \nGovernment regulation and other indignities rather than sue for relief \nbecause of the prohibitive costs of litigation.\n  Much of the work of this original Federal legislation was done by \nthen-Representative Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, who represented my \nhome town of Middleton with distinction and served on the House \nJudiciary Committee for many years.\n  By giving prevailing parties in certain kinds of cases the right to \nseek attorney's fees and other costs from the United States, the act \nsought to prevent business owners from having to risk their companies \nin order to seek justice. It was, in effect, a way to give David \nanother rock for his sling.\n  And it is the Davids, not the Goliaths, who benefit from this act.\n  Although I have reservations about the general concept of loser-pays \nrules, when a citizen faces the overpowering resources of the Federal \nGovernment, it is only fair that, when that citizen wins in court, the \nGovernment ought to reimburse the costs.\n  An individual with a net worth greater than $2 million may not \nrequest fees under EAJA, nor may a business or other organization with \na net worth greater than $7 million and which employs more than 500 \npeople, unless it qualifies either as a nonprofit under certain Federal \ntax laws or as an agricultural cooperative.\n  Collaterally, the act sought to provide a deterrence to excessive \nGovernment regulation, a subject in which we all share an interest.\n  Some would certainly argue that latter goal has not been achieved. \nBut the Equal Access to Justice Act has been successful in other areas, \nalthough perhaps not quite as planned, Mr. President.\n  For one thing, the cost has been much smaller than originally \nanticipated. The Equal Access to Justice Act was originally estimated \nto cost at least $68 million per year, but according to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, annual EAJA awards from 1988 \nto 1992 generally hovered around $5 to $7 million.\n  This is despite the fact that litigants are winning more cases than \nanticipated.\n  A study conducted by Prof. Susan Gluck Mezey of Loyola University at \nChicago and Prof. Susan M. Olson of the University of Utah found that \nplaintiffs have been more successful than original estimates believed.\n  Professors Mezey and Olson examined 629 Federal district and \nappellate court decisions involving EAJA claims during the 1980's.\n  The Mezey-Olson study, published in the July-August 1993 edition of \nJudicature magazine, pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office \noriginally assumed plaintiffs would receive fees under the act in about \n25 percent of the claims filed against the Government.\n  However, the professors found in their sample that about 36 percent \nof litigants other than those suing the Department of Health and Human \nServices have won fees. Plaintiffs suing HHS, many of them seeking \nSocial Security disability benefits, have a success rate most lawyers \nwould envy, about 69 percent.\n  The Mezey-Olson study shows that most successful plaintiffs who seek \nfees have been these Social Security disability benefits applicants.\n  Another study, prepared in 1993 by Prof. Harold Krent of the \nUniversity of Chicago law school for the Administrative Conference of \nthe United States, found that, while the original intent of the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act was supposed to make things a little easier on \nthe applicants for fees, as currently written, it ``probably creates a \nperverse incentive to litigate'' on the part of Government attorneys.\n  This is because the act gives the government a chance to avoid paying \nfees, even when it loses its case, to the small business owner or \nindividual who would otherwise see their costs paid. The Government can \ndo this by showing it had substantial justification for its actions, \ndespite the fact that those actions proved onerous to that small \nbusiness owner or individual.\n  Professor Krent argues that the issues of whether fees should be \nawarded or whether the Government had substantial justification to act \nas it did can be nearly as exhaustive to litigate as the original \ncomplaint. This despite the fact that the substantial justification \nargument is successful in a relatively small number of cases.\n  We can fix that. We can bring the administrative costs of the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act down.\n  My bill amends the act in several ways, and it is intended to make \nuse of the act's provisions more acceptable to its original \nbeneficiaries, the small business owners.\n  First, my bill raises the current $75-per-hour fee award cap to $125 \nper hour. It keeps the cost-of-living increase as a possible factor in \nsetting the award, but it eliminates language which permits further \nincreasing the award due to some special factor, defined by example in \nthe existing statute as ``the limited availability of qualified \nattorneys or agents for the proceedings involved.''\n  This brings the fee cap more closely into line with current hourly \nrates charged by attorneys. It also makes these suits more attractive \nto attorneys, which in turn means prospective plaintiffs will have a \nlarger pool of attorneys from which to choose. This, I think, obviates \nthe need for the special factor language. I also believe eliminating \nthat provision simplifies the process.\n  Second, my bill makes more specific the method of computing cost-of-\nliving increases to fee awards. Under existing \n[[Page S3897]] law, courts have been forced to make these \ndeterminations without adequate statutory guidance. Professor Krent \nnotes in his study that ``courts have split as to when the cost-of-\nliving increase is applicable--for instance, whether it should be \ncalculated as of the date of the work performed, or as of some later \ndate.''\n  My bill states that a cost-of-living adjustment should be calculated \nfrom the date of final disposition. In other words, if the work was \nperformed in 1988 but the final disposition occurred in 1994, we should \nbase the fee calculation on 1994.\n  Third, my bill eliminates language in the act that allows the \nGovernment to escape paying attorney's fees even if it loses a suit if \nit can show substantial justification for its actions.\n  I believe that if an individual or small business owner go up against \nthe Federal Government and win, they win. If you are successful in your \nsuit against the Government or in your defense against Government \nenforcement, and the law provides for Government payment of your fees, \nthe government should pay the fees.\n  Further, Professor Krent's study indicates that fee awards were \ndenied in only a small percentage of EAJA cases because of the \nsubstantial justification defense.\n  It may sound as though we're actually increasing the cost of this \nact, but these steps may well have the opposite effect. Even though fee \nawards may go up somewhat, the time and cost of litigation to the \ngovernment will be reduced, and we should have a more cost-effective \nsystem.\n  Let me refer again to Professor Krent's study for guidance as to \npossible increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n  Professor Krent noted that it is probably impossible to make an exact \ndetermination of the expense of litigating the substantial \njustification issue.\n  It is his opinion, based on a study of cases between June 1989 and \nJune 1990, that the substantial justification defense may save some \nmoney in awards, but not enough to justify the cost of litigating the \nissue.\n  In short, this has not proven cost effective, except in a few Social \nSecurity cases involving large awards, unless you count some deterrent \neffect, which Professor Krent believes is impossible to quantify.\n  Fourth, the bill would set up a process to encourage settlement of \nthe fee issue without litigation.\n  The legislation will provide the government the opportunity, similar \nto the process described in rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, to make an offer of settlement up to 10 days prior to a \nhearing on the fee claim. If that offer is rejected and the party \napplying for reimbursement later wins a smaller award, that party shall \nnot be entitled to receive attorney's fees or other expenses incurred \nafter the date of the offer.\n  This, I think, will speed up the process, thereby reducing the time \nand expense of litigation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill also requires review of the act and \nlooks ahead to possible future expansion.\n  Expanding the coverage of the Equal Access to Justice Act to \nadditional areas of litigation is not directly addressed, but it is an \nissue on which I hope there can be future discussion.\n  My bill requires the Justice Department to submit a report to \nCongress within 180 days that provides an analysis of the variations in \nthe frequency of fee awards paid by specific Federal districts under \nEAJA and include recommendations for extending the application of the \nact to other Federal judicial proceedings.\n  According to the Administrative Conference of the United States, it \nremains unclear ``whether EAJA covers all litigation against the United \nStates in article I courts, even though such proceedings are often \ndirectly analogous to those covered by the act in article III courts.''\n  Congress has taken some steps. In 1985, for example, EAJA was amended \nto cover the U.S. Claims Court. The Court of Veterans Appeals, which \nhad decided in 1992 it was not covered by EAJA, is now covered by \nlegislation.\n  Likewise, my bill requires the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts to submit a report to Congress within 180 days that provides an \nanalysis of the variations in the frequency of fee awards paid by \napplicable Federal agencies under EAJA and include recommendations for \nextending the application of the act to other Federal agencies and \nadministrative proceedings.\n  The United States Supreme Court, in a 1991 decision, Ardestani versus \nINS, held that EAJA fees are available only in cases where hearings are \nrequired by law to conform to the procedural provisions of section 554 \nof the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  However, Congress had already created a statutory exception. In 1986, \nCongress extended EAJA's coverage to include the Program Fraud Civil \nRemedies Act.\n  It is reasonable, I believe, to investigate whether certain agency \nproceedings, such as deportation cases, that are nearly identical to \nproceedings covered by section 554 should be likewise covered by EAJA.\n  It may be appropriate to expand EAJA to cover certain cases subject \nto proceedings which are substantially the same as, but not \nspecifically covered by, the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  The study provision is also meant to be responsive to recommendations \nmade by members of a business advisory group with whom I meet on a \nregular basis. It was suggested that there was a need to examine why \nsome agencies have had fee judgments awarded against them at a higher \nrate than others.\n  Let me here acknowledge the work of the Administrative Conference of \nthe United States, which has been very helpful by conducting research \ninto this issue, making recommendations that helped form the basis of \nthis bill and providing valuable assistance to me in preparing this \nlegislation.\n  We all know the small business owner has a rough row to hoe and that \nunnecessary or overburdening Government regulation is sometimes an \nobstacle to doing business. The Equal Access to Justice Act was \nconceived to help overcome that obstacle, and my amending bill is \nsubmitted to make the act work better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 554\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to consolidate \nand reauthorize health professions and minority and disadvantaged \nhealth education programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       Health Professionals Consolidation and Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, Senator \nFrist, and myself, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed at \nimproving the supply and distribution of health professionals for our \nNation's underserved communities.\n  The Health Professions Consolidation and Reauthorization Act of 1995 \nwould consolidate over 44 different health professions programs \nadministered by the U.S. Public Health Service. Furthermore, this \nlegislation would target Federal health professions funding to support \ntraining initiatives designed to improve the health of citizens in our \nNation's underserved areas.\n  For three decades, through the Public Health Service and Medicare, \nthe Federal Government has funded the training of health professionals. \nOnce perceived to be in undersupply, physicians are now in oversupply \nas a result of this Federal intervention. However, the uneven \ndistribution of physicians still leaves many areas underserved. \nFurthermore, many believe the Nation now has too many subspecialist \nphysicians and too few primary care providers. To correct these \nproblems, a better targeted Federal health professions strategy is \nneeded.\n  Currently, through titles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health \nService Act, the Federal Government provides over $400 million for 44 \nseparate initiatives. When the title VII and VIII programs were last \nreauthorized in 1992, the General Accounting Office [GAO] was requested \nto review their effectiveness in: First, increasing the supply of \nprimary care providers and other health professionals; second, \nimproving their representation in rural and medically underserved \nareas; and third, improving minority representation in the health \nprofessions.\n  GAO recommended that Congress or the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices should establish:\n  First, national goals for the title VII and VIII programs.\n  Second, common outcome measures and reporting requirements for each \ngoal;\n  Third, restrictions limiting the use of funds to activities whose \nresults can be measured and reported against these goals; and\n  Fourth, criteria for allocating funding among professions based on \nrelative need in meeting national goals.\n  The Health Professions Consolidation and Reauthorization Act of 1995 \nbuilds on GAO's recommendations and is based on defined goals for these \nprograms. In addition, all programs would include a strong evaluation \ncomponent to ensure that they are really improving national, regional, \nand State work force goals.\n  The act targets Federal funding based on the following goals:\n  First, Federal health professions education programs and distribution \nprograms should assure health through: improvements in the distribution \nof and quality of health professionals needed to provide health \nservices in underserved areas; and enhancement of the production and \ndistribution of public health personnel to improve the State and local \npublic health infrastructure.\n  Second, the bureaucracy required to administer the current 44 \nindependent programs should be simplified and reduced.\n  Under this proposal, future Federal support for health professionals \nprograms would be targeted to: primary and preventive care; minorities \nand the disadvantaged; community-based training in underserved areas; \nadvanced degree nursing; and the National Health Service Corps. In \nrecognition of the need for fiscal restraint, funding for these \nprograms would be decreased by 10 percent at the end of 4 years.\n  Mr. President, the Health Professions Consolidation and \nReauthorization Act of 1995 maintains the traditional goal of Federal \nhealth professions programs, which is to improve the supply and \ndistribution of health professionals in underserved areas. I believe, \nhowever, that it offers a more effective and targeted approach by \nmoving away from small, narrowly defined categorical programs toward \nbroad areas of focus. In addition, my proposal places an emphasis on \noutcomes measurement--a feature sadly lacking in our current efforts.\n  As discussion of these issues develops, I would welcome any \nsuggestions my colleagues or others may have for improving this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  [[Page S3899]] There being no objection, the summary was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n     Summary of the Health Professions Education Consolidation and \n                      Reauthorization Act of 1995\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Titles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Service Act \n     authorize 45 different programs. The goal of these programs \n     is to improve the supply and distribution of a variety of \n     types of health professionals and to improve the \n     representation of minorities and disadvantaged individuals in \n     the health professions.\n       The focus of Title VII programs is on the training of \n     physicians, general dentists, physician assistants, allied \n     health personnel, public health professionals, and \n     veterinarians. Title VIII provides for nurse training. Title \n     III deals with the National Health Service Corps, which helps \n     to place providers in underserved areas. These Titles include \n     programs for direct student assistance, such as loans and \n     scholarships, loan repayments programs, and expansion and \n     maintenance of training programs.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n            I. Primary care and preventive medicine training\n\n       Under this provision, funds for family physician, general \n     pediatrician, general internists, preventive medicine \n     physician, and physician assistant training would be \n     authorized. These providers are generally needed to fill both \n     rural and underserved health professional shortage areas and \n     to help improve staffing in public health departments. \n     Generally, priority would be given to programs which have a \n     history of training health professionals who eventually enter \n     practice in rural and urban underserved areas.\n\n                II. Minority and disadvantaged training\n\n       Under this provision, the Secretary would have broad \n     discretion to fund projects which improve the number and \n     quality of minority and disadvantaged health professionals. \n     Many believe that an increased number of minority and \n     disadvantaged providers would result in improvements of \n     services in underserved areas, because such individuals are \n     more likely to practice in those areas than are others. \n     Generally, most minorities are currently under-represented in \n     the health professions relative to their representation \n     within the entire U.S. population.\n\n           III. Community-based training in underserved areas\n\n       This authority would be similar to the current Area Health \n     Education Center program. These centers are located in \n     underserved areas. They train medical students and other \n     health professionals to provide services in rural and \n     underserved areas. Exposure to these settings is generally \n     recognized as a determinant in whether a health professional \n     would return to practice in such settings. In addition, these \n     centers help support practicing providers in such areas \n     through continuing medical education support.\n\n                  IV. Consolidated student assistance\n\n       This section would have a few authorities, but only one \n     appropriation. This proposal would combine most of the \n     current scholarship and loan programs into the current \n     National Health Service Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment \n     program. As such, individuals would receive financial support \n     only in return for service provided in primary care \n     underserved areas. This would help to eliminate the 4,000 \n     positions currently available in underserved areas. In \n     addition, transfer of the current funding for scholarship \n     programs to the Corps would help it fund more applications. \n     Currently the National Health Service Corps is only able to \n     provide scholarships in return for service to one out of \n     every 10 applicants.\n       In addition, the current scholarship programs for minority \n     and disadvantaged individuals would be consolidated into a \n     single scholarship program for disadvantaged students.\n       The authorities which would be left in place from current \n     law are those which do not require appropriations, but rather \n     are revolving loan funds which currently exist at schools.\n\n                               V. Nursing\n\n       The provisions of this proposal would be similar to those \n     included in the Nursing Education Act reauthorization which \n     was approved by the Senate last year. Under it, six current \n     nursing programs would be consolidated into three to \n     emphasize primary care nursing and the production of minority \n     and disadvantaged nurses.\n\n                        VI. Other priority areas\n\n       The Secretary could fund any number of other projects for \n     health professionals training which meet national workforce \n     needs to improve health services in underserved areas. For \n     instance, under this provision, the Secretary could fund \n     projects to train allied health professionals.\nVII. Other provisions from last year's Minority Health Improvement Act \n                           Conference Report\n\n                       Office of Minority Health\n\n       The authority for the office would be extended through FY \n     1999. Furthermore, the provision assures that the office is \n     only coordinating services--not conducting its own services \n     and research program. The authorization would be $19 million \n     for each fiscal year through FY 1999. This would be a 10% \n     reduction from the current appropriation of $20.668 million. \n     (This is consistent with the general reductions in \n     authorizations throughout the health professions bill).\n\n                     State Offices of Rural Health\n\n       There would be ``such sums as necessary'' authorized \n     through FY 1997. The cumulative appropriations would be \n     capped at $20 million. In FY 1998, after these offices have \n     been established in every state, the program would be \n     repealed. The current appropriation for this program is \n     $3.875 million.\n\n                             Birth Defects\n\n       An enhanced program for an intramural program on birth \n     defects at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) would be authorized. Through this program, research \n     centers would be established, epidemiologic review of data \n     would occur, and a national information clearing house would \n     be established. This program is consistent with current CDC \n     plans in this area. No funds would be authorized specifically \n     for this program, but funding would occur under the general \n     CDC program authority.\n\n                         Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n       This provision is identical to that in the conference \n     report. It would provide for the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) to conduct research on traumatic brain injury \n     without an authorization for a separate appropriation. It \n     would also authorize $5 million a year for a demonstration \n     program to be administered through the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration, subject to the availability of \n     funding, for the development of state systems of care for \n     persons with traumatic brain injury. Finally, the provision \n     would authorize a consensus conference at NIH regarding the \n     treatment of individuals with this illness.\n\n                 Health Services for Pacific Islanders\n\n       This would extend the Pacific Islanders initiative, with \n     technical changes only. The program would be authorized at $3 \n     million in FY 1996 and in each year through FY 1999. Finally, \n     a study would be authorized to determine the usefulness of \n     this initiative.\n\n          Demonstration Projects Regarding Alzheimer's Disease\n\n       There would be $5 million authorized in each of the fiscal \n     years from FY 1996 through FY 1999. There are many technical \n     revisions.\n\n  Miscellaneous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Provisions\n\n       Epidemiologic Intelligence Service officers, funded through \n     state and local governments, would not count in FTE \n     determinations of CDC. Current fellowship programs at CDC \n     would be authorized.\n                  minority and disadvantaged training\n\n       Purposes: (1) Provide for the training of minority and \n     disadvantaged health professionals to improve health care \n     access in underserved areas and to improve representation in \n     the health professions; and (2) Provide administrative \n     flexibility and simplification.\n       General Description: Under this provision, the Secretary \n     would have broad discretion to fund projects which improve \n     the number and quality of minority and disadvantaged health \n     professionals. Many believe that an increased number of \n     minority and disadvantaged providers would result in \n     improvements of services in underserved areas because such \n     individuals tend to practice in those areas more than others. \n     Generally, most minority groups are currently under-\n     represented in the health professions relative to their \n     representation within the entire U.S. population.\n       Current Law Authorities Consolidated: (The numbers before \n     each program are keyed to the Labor Committee document: \n     ``Health Professions Education: Summary of Federal Training \n     Programs.''\n       9. Centers of Excellence in Minority Health\n       10. Health Careers Opportunity Program\n       11. Minority Faculty Fellowships\n       12. Faculty Loan Repayment\n       Summary of Provisions:\n\n                           Eligible entities\n\n       Schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, \n     pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary medicine, \n     public health, allied health professions schools; schools \n     offering graduate programs in clinical psychology; state or \n     local governments; a consortia of health professions schools; \n     or other public or private nonprofit entities could apply.\n\n                               Activities\n\n       Grants and contracts would be made, as appropriate, to \n     plan, develop, or operate:\n       1. Demonstrative programs.\n       2. Minority faculty development and loan repayment \n     programs.\n       3. Programs to develop the pipeline for individuals from \n     disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and remain in health \n     professions schools.\n       4. Programs of excellence in the health professions \n     education for minority individuals, including centers of \n     excellence at certain historically black colleges and \n     universities.\n       5. For the provision of technical assistance, work force \n     analysis, and information dissemination.\n       Any grant which is funded could incorporate one or all of \n     these activities. In addition, a preference would be given to \n     projects which involve more than one health profession \n     discipline or training institution and, beginning in fiscal \n     year 1999, for centers of excellence at certain historically \n     black colleges and universities.\n       [[Page S3900]] The Secretary would fund grant applications \n     which have the greatest chance of improving minority \n     representation in the health professions and which have an \n     above average record of retention and graduation of \n     individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n                          Outcomes evaluation\n\n       Each program would be required to set performance outcomes \n     and would be held accountable for meeting such outcomes. The \n     performance outcome standards would be consistent with state, \n     local, and national work force development priorities.\n\n                          Non-Federal matching\n\n       The Secretary would have discretion to require \n     institutional or state and local government matching grants \n     to ensure the continuation of the project once federal aid \n     ends.\n\n                               Transition\n\n       Current grantees would continue to operate under existing \n     authorities through the remainder of their funding cycles. \n     The new provisions would apply only to new grants.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $51 million authorized for fiscal year 1996 \n     and such sums as necessary through fiscal year 1999. Combined \n     funding for these authorities in fiscal year 1995 is $50.806 \n     million. For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, there would be a \n     4.25% setaside for the centers of excellence at certain \n     historically black colleges and universities.\n             primary care and preventive medicine training\n\n       Purposes: (1) Provide for the training of primary care \n     providers and preventive medicine public health personnel to \n     improve access to and quality of health care in underserved \n     areas and to enhance state and local public health \n     infrastructure; (2) Provide administrative flexibility and \n     simplification.\n       General Description: Under this provision, funding for \n     family physician, general pediatrician, general internist, \n     preventive medicine physician, and physician assistant \n     training would be authorized. These providers are generally \n     needed to fill both rural and underserved health professional \n     shortage areas and to help improve staffing in public health \n     departments. Generally, priority would be given to programs \n     which have a history of training health professionals who \n     eventually enter practice in rural and urban underserved \n     areas.\n       Current Law Authorities Consolidated: (The numbers before \n     each program are keyed to the Labor Committee document: \n     ``Health Professions Education: Summary of Federal Training \n     Programs.'')\n       1.

Preventive Medicine and Dental Public Health\n       12. Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry Faculty Development\n       Summary of Provisions:\n\n                           Eligible entities\n\n       Health professions schools, academic health centers, or \n     other public or private nonprofit entities could apply.\n\n                               Activities\n\n       Grants and contracts would be made as appropriate to \n     develop, operate, expand, or improve:\n       1. Departments (or academic administrative units) of family \n     medicine.\n       2. Residency training programs in family medicine, general \n     internal medicine, general pediatrics, or preventive \n     medicine.\n       3. Physician assistant training programs.\n       4. Faculty development initiatives in primary care, \n     including geriatrics.\n       5. Medical school primary care training initiatives.\n\n                     Departments of Family Medicine\n\n       Departments of family medicine would be funded. Such units \n     lead to a greater number of medical students choosing careers \n     in primary care.\n\n                      Residency Training Programs\n\n       Family medicine, general internal medicine, and general \n     pediatrics residency programs would compete with one another \n     for funding. Two outcome standards would be established to \n     determine a funding preference. First, those programs with \n     the highest percentage of providers who enter primary care \n     practice upon the completion of training would receive a \n     priority. In addition, programs which successfully produce \n     professionals who go on to provide service in underserved \n     areas would receive a preference.\n       Preventive medicine residencies would not compete for \n     funding with family medicine, general internal medicine, or \n     general pediatrics. Rather, they would receive an appropriate \n     amount of funding, as determined by the Secretary. A \n     preference would be given to those programs which train a \n     high percentage of individuals who enter practice in state \n     and local public health departments.\n\n                 Physician Assistant Training Programs\n\n       Physician assistant training programs would receive an \n     appropriate amount of funding, as determined by the \n     Secretary, from the appropriation for this section. Those \n     programs which have a higher output of providers who \n     eventually enter practice in underserved areas would receive \n     a preference for funding.\n\n                          Faculty Development\n\n       The Secretary would determine which type of faculty \n     development projects to fund based on national and state work \n     force goals. Geriatric fellowships and faculty development \n     could be funded.\n\n                  Medical School Primary Care Training\n\n       Primary care training activities at medical schools would \n     be funded through departments (or administrative units) of \n     family medicine, general internal medicine, or general \n     pediatrics. Applications from general internal medicine and \n     general pediatrics administrative units would be required to \n     demonstrate their institution's commitment to primary care \n     education by: (1) A mission statement which has a primary \n     care medical education objective; (2) faculty role models and \n     administrative units in primary care, and general pediatrics; \n     and (3) required undergraduate community-based medical \n     student clerkships in family medicine, internal medicine, and \n     pediatrics.\n\n                          Outcomes evaluation\n\n       Each program would be required to set performance outcomes \n     and would be held\n      accountable for meeting such outcomes. The performance \n     outcome standards would be consistent with state, local, \n     and national work force development priorities.\n\n                          Non-Federal matching\n\n       The Secretary would have discretion to require \n     institutional or state and local government matching grants \n     to ensure the continuation of the project once federal aid \n     ends.\n\n                               Transition\n\n       Current grantees would continue to operate under existing \n     authorities through the remainder of their funding cycles. \n     The new provisions would apply only to new grants.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $76 million authorized for fiscal year 1996 \n     and such sums as necessary through fiscal year 1999. Combined \n     funding for these authorities in fiscal year 1995 is $75.285 \n     million. Family medicine departments would receive no less \n     than 12 percent of the overall funding. This is consistent \n     with the current set-aside that such departments receive.\n\n\n             community-based training in underserved areas\n\n       Purposes: (1) Provide support for training centers remote \n     from health professions schools to improve and maintain the \n     distribution of health providers in rural and urban \n     underserved areas; (2) Provide the Secretary the option of \n     funding geriatric training centers; (3) Provide \n     administrative flexibility and simplification.\n       General Description: This authority, most similar to the \n     current Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program, would \n     enhance the community-based training in underserved areas of \n     various health professionals. This goal would be achieved \n     through greater flexibility in the design of such programs \n     and through the leveraging of state and local resources. \n     AHECs are generally located in underserved areas remote from \n     academic health centers. They train health professionals to \n     provide services in rural and underserved areas. Exposure to \n     these settings is generally recognized as a determinant in \n     whether a health professional returns to practice in such \n     settings. In addition, these centers help support practicing \n     providers in such areas through continuing medical education \n     programs. Finally, the current program for funding geriatric \n     training centers could continue at the discretion of the \n     Secretary.\n       Current Law Authorities Consolidated: (The numbers before \n     each program are keyed to the Senate Labor Committee \n     document: ``Health Professions Education: Summary of Federal \n     Training Programs.'')\n       40.

Improve the distribution, supply, quality, utilization, \n     and efficiency of personnel providing health services in \n     urban and rural underserved populations.\n       2. Encourage the regionalization of educational \n     responsibilities of the health professions schools into urban \n     and rural underserved areas.\n       3. Are designed to prepare individuals effectively to \n     provide health services in underserved areas through: \n     preceptorships, the conduct or affiliation with community-\n     based primary care residency programs, agreements with \n     community-based organizations for the delivery of education \n     and training in the health professions, and other programs.\n       4. Conduct interdisciplinary training of the various health \n     professions.\n       5. Provide continuing medical and health professional \n     education to professionals practicing in the underserved \n     areas served by the grantee.\n       A preference would be given to projects which involve one \n     or more health professions discipline or training \n     institution, train individuals who actually enter practice in \n     underserved areas, and have a high output of graduates who \n     enter primary care practice.\n       [[Page S3901]] In addition, the Secretary may fund \n     geriatric training centers if the Secretary determines such \n     entities are needed to improve the geriatric skills of health \n     providers.\n\n                          Outcomes evaluation\n\n       Each program would be required to set performance outcomes \n     and would be held accountable for meeting such outcomes. The \n     performance outcome standards would be consistent with state, \n     local, and national work force development priorities.\n\n                          Non-Federal matching\n\n       The Secretary would have discretion to require \n     institutional or state and local government matching grants \n     to ensure the continuation of the project once federal aid \n     ends.\n\n                               Transition\n\n       Current grantees would continue to operate under existing \n     authorities through the remainder of their funding cycles. \n     The new provisions would apply only to new grants.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $39 million authorized for fiscal year 1996 \n     which would be reduced to $25 million by fiscal year 1999. \n     Combined funding for these authorities in fiscal year 1995 is \n     $39.159 million. The $14 billion in funding reductions over \n     the three-year period is equivalent to the current combined \n     appropriations for the Health Education and Training Centers, \n     Rural Health Interdisciplinary Training Programs, and the \n     geriatric training centers.

The three-year period to phase down this \n     funding would allow for the completion of current project \n     award periods.\n                     NURSING WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT\n\n       Purposes: (1) Provide for the training of advanced degree \n     nurses and other nurses to improve access to and quality of \n     health care in underserved medical and public health areas; \n     and (2) Provide administrative flexibility and \n     simplification.\n       General Description: This proposal would provide for the \n     training of advanced degree nurses, including nurse \n     practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, and public \n     health nurses. In addition, projects to improve nursing work \n     force personnel diversity and to expand the training of \n     nurses in certain priority settings would occur. The \n     Secretary would have broad discretion to determine which \n     projects to fund. Generally, projects which would ultimately \n     lead to a greater number of nursing providers for rural and \n     underserved areas, including local and state public health \n     departments, would receive a funding preference.\n       Current Law Authorities Consolidated: (The numbers before \n     each program are keyed to the Labor Committee document: \n     ``Health Professions Education: Summary of Federal Training \n     Programs.'')\n       18.

Programs to increase nursing work force diversity.\n       3. Projects to strengthen the capacity for basis nurse \n     education in certain priority areas.\n       Amounts provided under any one of these areas could be used \n     for faculty development, demonstrations, trainee support, \n     work force analysis, technical assistance, and dissemination \n     of information.\n       In determining which projects to fund under each of these \n     areas, the Secretary would give priority to those projects \n     which would substantially benefit rural or underserved \n     populations, including public health departments. Generally, \n     those programs which tend to produce nurses for these areas, \n     including primary care nurses, would receive funding \n     priority. In addition, the Secretary would have broad \n     discretion to distribute the appropriation among these \n     different activity areas. Funds would be allocated among \n     these activities to meet the priority for underserved areas \n     and to meet relevant national and state nursing work force \n     goals.\n       The National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and \n     Practice would continue to advise the Secretary regarding \n     nursing issues. Funding for this council would be provided \n     through the appropriations under this section.\n\n                    Advance Practice Nurses Training\n\n       Projects that support the enhancement of advanced practice \n     nursing education and practice would be funded. In addition, \n     a grantee could use a portion of the funds to provide for \n     traineeships. Such traineeships would provide stipends to \n     students to help cover the costs of tuition, books, fees, and \n     reasonable living expenses. Programs which could receive \n     support under this authority are those which train nurse \n     practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, public \n     health nurses, and other advanced degree nurses.\n\n           Programs To Increase Nursing Work Force Diversity\n\n       Projects to increase nursing education opportunities for \n     individuals who are from disadvantaged racial and ethnic \n     backgrounds under-represented among registered nurses would \n     be funded. Such projects could provide student stipends or \n     scholarships, pre-entry preparation, or retention activities.\n\n              Projects To Strengthen Basic Nurse Education\n\n       Funding priority would be given to basic nurse education \n     programs designed to: (1) improve nursing services in schools \n     and other community settings; (2) provide care for \n     underserved populations and other high-risk groups such as \n     elderly, individuals with HIV-AIDS, substance abusers, \n     homeless, and battered women; (3) provide skills needed under \n     new health care systems; (4) develop cultural competencies \n     among nurses; (5) and serve other priority areas.\n\n                          Outcomes evaluation\n\n       Each program would be required to set performance outcomes \n     and would be held accountable for meeting such outcomes. The \n     performance outcome standards would be consistent with state, \n     local, and national work force development priorities.\n                          Non-Federal matching\n\n       The Secretary would have discretion to require \n     institutional or state and local government matching grants \n     to ensure the continuation of the project once federal aid \n     ends.\n\n                               Transition\n\n       Current grantees would continue to operate under existing \n     authorities through the remainder of their funding cycles. \n     The new provisions would apply only to new grants.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $62 million authorized for fiscal year 1996, \n     which would be reduced to $59 million for fiscal year 1999.\n\n\n       consolidated financial assistance and other loan programs\n\n       Purposes: (1) Provide consolidation of current loan \n     repayment, scholarship, and scholarship payback programs into \n     a flexible National Health Service Corps program requiring \n     service payback in underserved areas in return for federal \n     financial assistance; (2) \n     [[Page S3902]] Continue certain loan programs which do not \n     require federal appropriations or that guarantee the \n     availability of loan sources in the market for health \n     professions students; (3) Consolidate scholarship programs \n     for the disadvantaged; and (4) Provide administrative \n     flexibility and simplification.\n       General Description: This proposal would combine most of \n     the current targeted scholarship and loan repayment programs \n     into the existing National Health Service Corps Scholarship \n     and Loan Repayment program. As such, individuals would only \n     receive ``free'' financial support in return for service \n     provided in underserved areas. This would help to eliminate \n     the shortage of over 4,000 positions in primary care \n     underserved areas and in underserved public health positions \n     in state and local health departments.\n       The three scholarship programs for minorities and \n     disadvantaged students would also be consolidated into a \n     single scholarship program for disadvantaged students.\n       The authorities which would not be consolidated are those \n     which do not require appropriations but, rather, are \n     revolving loan funds which currently exist at schools. In \n     addition, the current Health Education Assistance Loan \n     Guarantee program would also be left in place.\n       (This consolidated program is meant to complement and other \n     federal financial assistance programs for which health \n     professional and public health professional students qualify. \n     Generally, the funds provided under the Perkins and Stafford \n     Loan programs, administered through the Department of \n     Education, provide sufficient resources to allow anyone the \n     opportunity to pursue a career in any health professions \n     training program. For instance, medical students may qualify \n     for $23,500 annually in loans under these two programs--more \n     than enough to finance the average medical school education.)\n       Current Law Authorities Consolidated: (The numbers before \n     each program are keyed to the Labor Committee document: \n     ``Health Professions Education: Summary of Federal Training \n     Programs.''\n       23.

National Health Service Corps Scholarship and Loan Payback\n\n                           Eligible entities\n\n       Health professionals and public health professionals (for \n     loan payback only).\n\n                               Activities\n\n       The Secretary would have broad authority to offer the \n     following scholarship or loan repayment options to persons \n     who agree to provide services through the National Health \n     Service Corps in underserved areas. This consolidated \n     authority would be patterned after the existing National \n     Health Service Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment programs.\n       1. Provide scholarships to health professional students in \n     return for a commitment for such students to practice in the \n     National Health Service Corps in underserved areas once their \n     education is completed.\n       2. Provide loan repayment to:\n       a. Health professionals and public health personnel in \n     return for a commitment from such persons to practice in the \n     National Health Service Corps designated underserved sites \n     or, in the case of public health personnel, state and local \n     health departments with public health professional shortages.\n       b. Nurses for an amount no greater than 85 percent of their \n     debt for persons who agree to practice in National Health \n     Service Corps designated underserved areas.\n       3. Provide funding to states to operate their own loan \n     repayment or scholarship programs. States could designate \n     their own underserved areas utilizing their own criteria if \n     such criteria are approved by the Secretary.\n       The Secretary would determine how much to provide for each \n     activity to meet the goals of providing service to \n     underserved areas and retaining providers in underserved \n     areas. States applying for grant funding to run their own \n     programs would receive priority.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $90 million authorized for fiscal year 1996 \n     and such sums as necessary through fiscal year 1999. This \n     amount of funding is consistent with the combined current \n     appropriations for these programs.\n\n               B. Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students\n\n                           Eligible entities\n\n       Health professions schools.\n\n                               Activities\n\n       The Secretary would award grants to health professions \n     schools for the awarding of scholarships to disadvantaged \n     students. Eligible entities would receive a preference based \n     on the proportion of graduating students going into primary \n     care, the proportion of minority students, and the proportion \n     of graduates working in medically underserved areas.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $32 million authorized for fiscal year 1996 \n     through 1999. This amount of funding is consistent with the \n     combined current appropriation for these programs.\n\n   Part II. Current Loan Authorities Continued Without Appropriations\n\n                               Activities\n\n       The current Nursing Student Loan (NSL) program, Primary \n     Care Loan (PCL) program, Health Professions Student Loan \n     (HPSL) program, and the Loans for Disadvantaged Students \n     (LDS) programs would continue. These programs would continue \n     using the revolving funds which remain at health professions \n     schools.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       There would be $8 million authorized in each of fiscal \n     years 1996 through 1998 for the LDS program. For fiscal year \n     1999, the authority for appropriations would be repealed \n     after the revolving funds begin to be paid back by current \n     loan recipients.\n       The NSL, PCL, and HPSL programs, which do not currently \n     receive appropriations, would not be authorized to receive \n     appropriations.\n\n                          Part III. HEAL Loans\n\n                               Activities\n\n       The HEAL loan program would continue in its current form.\n\n                             Authorization\n\n       This program would continue to be authorized at such sums \n     as necessary to guarantee sufficient funds for the insurance \n     pool for loan defaulters. The current premiums provided by \n     borrowers are insufficient to meet the needs of this fund. As \n     a result of reforms made in this program in fiscal year 1992, \n     HHS is improving its loan collection and the insurance fund \n     is growing. Over time, this program may not require \n     appropriations. The current appropriation is $24.972 million.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 556. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to improve the \nprovisions of trade readjustment allowances during breaks in training, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              trade adjustment assistance improvement act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last October I received a letter from a \nMrs. Myra Hoey of Blandford, MA. Mrs. Hoey detailed a problem that her \nhusband, David, was having with the Trade Adjustment Assistance program \nwhich oversees the benefits provided to workers displaced by the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. David Hoey was an employee at the \nWestfield River Paper Co. in Massachusetts. Along with over 100 other \nemployees, David lost his job when the paper company moved to Canada \nafter Congress approved NAFTA.\n  When we passed NAFTA in 1993, we recognized the importance of \nassisting those working families, like the Hoeys, who might be \ndisplaced by this agreement in obtaining gainful employment in another \nfield through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. For many years \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has been very helpful to the \ncitizens of this Nation by helping them to seize an opportunity for a \nsecond chance--for another career or further education. However, Mr. \nPresident, occasionally some Federal guidelines fall behind the times \nand need to be adjusted in order to continue to be effective. Mrs. Hoey \nand the other workers in Westfield, MA, discovered--the hard way--that \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has problems that need to be \nfixed.\n  Workers displaced because of import-related movement of companies are \neligible for trade adjustment assistance [TAA]. Workers displaced \nspecifically because of NAFTA related movement are eligible for trade \nreadjustment allowances [TRA]. TAA and TRA provide 52 weeks of \nunemployment insurance-like payments to these workers and pay for \napproved training programs to train these workers.\n  Because their employer moved to Canada, the Westfield River Paper Co. \nemployees were eligible for TRA, and a number of them began a \nretraining program at Springfield Technical Community College during \nthe fall of last year. These workers dedicated themselves to the task \nof learning new skills so that they could support their families. \nHowever, during Christmas \n[[Page S3903]] break from their training, these hard-working former \nemployees found out that their benefits were cut off for a full month.\n  This is because the law that created TAA includes a provision that \nlimits TAA and TRA payments during scheduled breaks in training to the \nfirst 14 days of these breaks.\n  Consequently, those workers who are out of work and are training for \nnew jobs and who are enrolled in programs with 6-week winter breaks \nlose a month of benefits, even though they are willingly participating \nin good faith in a training program and have no other source of income. \nThe missed weeks of benefits are tacked on to the end of the displaced \nworkers' benefit year so that a total of 52 weeks of TRA is still \nprovided.\n  The motivation behind this provision is to encourage workers to chose \ntraining\n programs with shorter breaks so that the workers will be moved into \nthe workforce with greater speed. In addition, workers are implicitly \nencouraged to select programs that train them quickly because benefits \nonly last 1 year.\n\n  However, not all workers have a plethora of programs from which to \nchoose. Some are limited to only those programs offered by their local \ncommunity college. Most colleges and universities have winter breaks \nlonger than what is allowed by TRA, and as a result, benefits are \ntemporarily suspended to those people enrolled in this program at those \ncolleges.\n  Extending to 45 calendar days the period of a break in training \nthrough which TAA and TRA benefits can be paid would be helpful to \ndisplaced workers. It would be very nearly cost-neutral, because no \nadditional weeks of benefits would be provided, and it would eliminate \ninequities in the existing system. And at the risk of redundancy, \nworkers would still be encouraged to choose programs with smaller \nbreaks, because the total amount of time that they will receive \nbenefits will still be only a year. Finally, a 45 calendar day training \nbreak limitation would encourage workers to engage in summer programs \nif their period of retraining overlaps summer recess.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram Improvement Act, provides this increase in the training break \nduring which benefits may continue to be paid. It also would clear up \nanother problem as well, one that touches only on TRA's. I welcome my \ndistinguished senior colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, as \nan original cosponsor.\n  In order to qualify for a TRA, the law currently requires a displaced \nworker to enroll in training by the end of the 16th week after his or \nher initial unemployment compensation benefit period. the rationale for \nthe time limit is that adjustment assistance is generally more \neffective if adjustment decisions are made relatively early in the \nunemployment period. However, the current language creates some \ninequities because the initial benefit period is triggered by initial \nlay offs and continues to run even if a worker is recalled.\n  For example, if a worker is recalled 4 weeks after an initial layoff, \nthen is laid off a second time after 12 weeks of employment, that \nworker would not qualify for TRA even if the worker immediately \nenrolled in training because the 16 weeks of his initial benefit period \nwould have expired.\n  It makes a lot more sense to allow the worker 16 weeks from his or \nher most recent separation in order to determine whether retraining is \nneeded. This would provide the worker an opportunity to conduct a job \nsearch and to explore other options before making an enrollment \ndecision, while at the same time encouraging the person to make a \ndecision at a point early enough to promote effective adjustment.\n  Therefore, this bill takes into account situations involving recalls \nand would require that in order to qualify for TRA, a worker must \nenroll in training by the end of the 16th week after his or her most \nrecent separation from the impacted firm.\n  These two changes, one to both TAA and TRA, and one only to TRA, \nwould improve the entire TAA system in small but tangible ways, and at \nslight additional cost enable these programs more effectively to help \nthe people they were designed to aid. People like David and Myra Hoey, \nand other workers in Michigan, Tennessee, Washington, Pennsylvania, and \naround the Nation will get the assistance they need to get back on \ntheir feet and into the work force.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for more than a decade now, I \nhave argued here on the Senate floor, and often in print, that in order \nto make any real progress in reducing gun violence, we must seek to \ncontrol ammunition. I have put it that ``Guns don't kill people, \nbullets do.''\n  This is not to say that I do not support gun control; I certainly do. \nI was an original cosponsor of the Brady bill when it was first \nintroduced in 1989, and was proud to vote for it when it finally passed \nthe Senate in 1993. We are all pleased at the very real difference the \nBrady law has made. Just 1 year after it became effective, background \nchecks under the Brady law have already prevented 45,000 felons and \nother prohibited persons from purchasing handguns. No doubt a \nsignificant number of lives were saved as a result.\n  Yet the fact remains that there are already some 200 million firearms \nin circulation in the United States. These weapons are not going away. \nWith a minimum of care they will last indefinitely. I recall that as an \nofficer of the deck in the Navy of the 1940's, I was issued a Colt \nmodel 1911 .45 caliber sidearm. That particular handgun was first sold \nto the U.S. military in 1912, and continued to be used in the Navy \nuntil very recently. Use of weapons 35 or even 50 years old has been \ncommon in our Armed Forces--and these guns still work perfectly.\n  We probably have a two-century supply of guns in circulation today. \nOn the other hand we have something like a 4-year supply of bullets. \nThis has led me to conclude that a different approach is needed.\n  Gun violence is a public health epidemic and therefore demands an \nepidemiological response. An epidemiologist will tell you that in order \nto cope with any epidemic, you must eliminate the pathogen, or the \nagent causing the disease. In 1992, Dr. Lester Adelson made precisely \nthis argument in an article entitled ``The Gun and the Sanctity of \nHuman Life: the Bullet as Pathogen'' in the ``Archives of Surgery.'' In \nthe case of gun violence, the pathogen is the bullet. I say again, guns \ndon't kill people, bullets do.\n  I have been making this point for many years now, but with only the \nslightest success in getting it across. We have had two small but \nsignificant achievements: in 1986 and again in 1994, I was able to \nsecure enactment of provisions to ban the manufacture or importation of \narmor-piercing ammunition: the so-called cop-killer ballets. This was \ndone with considerable difficulty in the first instance because, \nalthough the police groups, led by Phil Caruso and the New York \nPatrolmen's Benevolent Association, were strongly supportive, the \nNational Rifle Association was not, and in the end only \n[[Page S3906]] grudgingly supported the bill. That bill, the Law \nEnforcement Officers Protection Act of 1986, was the first law to \noutlaw a round of ammunition. In 1994 in the crime bill, we updated the \n1986 act to cover a new round of armor-piercing ammunition being made \nin Sweden.\n  These were important but really only incremental steps. The slaughter \nin the streets goes on. But Mr. President, we may have some good news. \nAn editorial in the March 1, 1995, edition of the Los Angeles Times \ndescribes a bold new initiative in Pasadena, CA, where the city council \nhas adopted one of the first ordinances in the Nation restricting the \nsale of ammunition. I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  Gun dealers in Pasadena must now record not only their sales of guns, \nbut also of ammunition. And why? Pasadena Chief of Police Jerry Oliver \nsummed it up nicely when he said\n\n       In Pasadena tonight, at this very moment, it is easier to \n     buy a box of 9-millimeter rounds than it is to buy a can of \n     spray paint.\n\n  Last September, I noted on this floor that the city of Chicago had \nbecome the first municipality in the Nation to ban the sale of all \nhandgun ammunition. Now Pasadena has taken steps to regulate the sale \nof bullets. This won't prevent buyers from going to neighboring Los \nAngeles to buy ammunition, but similar steps are now being considered \nin Los Angeles, and in nearby Azusa as well.\n  Mr. President, I hope the actions of Chicago and Pasadena represent a \nturning point in our thinking about this problem. I hope other cities \nand towns recognize the potential of ammunition control to bring about \nreal progress in the fight against gun violence. I hope the States and \nthe Federal Government will come around to this idea as well. We need a \nnew approach, we need bold action, and we need it soon. Pasadena has \nthe right idea. Let us hope the rest of the Nation is paying attention.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 1, 1995]\n\n                     How Desperation Becomes a Tool\n\n\nprodded by ever-rising mayhem, Pasadena passes a law regulating bullet \n                                 sales\n\n       Bravo to the members of the Pasadena City Council. By a \n     vote of 5 to 2, the council adopted what is believed to be \n     the nation's first municipal law restricting bullet sales.\n       Approval did not come easily, however. Emotions ran high: \n     Ordinance supporters, outraged by street violence, verbally \n     battled with gun enthusiasts who reject even the most \n     reasonable restrictions. The vote did not occur until shortly \n     before midnight, after five hours of debate. Dozens of \n     backers and opponents of the ordinance offered impassioned \n     testimony before a standing-room-only crowd. Tempers flared; \n     one council member temporarily left the proceedings in \n     angrily reacting to pro-ordinance comments by the police \n     chief. Cheers and catcalls broke out often.\n       And what was all the fuss over? The new ordinance requires \n     anyone buying bullets in Pasadena to provide identification \n     showing proof of age and to complete a registration form \n     listing the amount, brand and type of ammunition purchased.\n       The measure is intended to curtail sales of bullets to \n     juveniles--such sales are already illegal but nonetheless \n     widespread--and to provide police with information that may \n     help link bullets found at a crime scene with suspects.\n       Pasadena has taken but the tiniest of steps with this \n     ordinance. But it is a measure of the headlock in which the \n     gun lobby has held federal, state and local lawmakers that \n     even these tepid, sensible restrictions on bullet sales can \n     be so strongly resisted as an infringement on the right of \n     self-defense. After all, as Pasadena Police Chief Jerry \n     Oliver noted at the start of the council meeting, ``Tonight, \n     it is easier to buy 9-millimeter ammunition than it is to buy \n     a can of spray paint.'' That discrepancy is nuts.\n       The most powerful criticism of the new ordinance is that it \n     may not be very effective. Pasadena kids and adults bent on \n     violence may simply seek their bullets in nearby Glendale, \n     Los Angeles or La Canada. Alone, Pasadena can realistically \n     do little to reduce gun violence.\n       But the true worth of Pasadena's ordinance--its value as an \n     example--was apparent even before its passage. Monday \n     afternoon the Los Angeles City Council took the first steps \n     to follow Pasadena's lead. The council's Public Safety \n     Committee asked the city attorney to draft an ordinance \n     patterned on Pasadena's. Then, on Tuesday, Azusa's police \n     chief vowed to seek such an ordinance there.\n       If Los Angeles and Azusa--as we hope--pass bullet laws, \n     more cities are sure to follow. Then, what began as, in part, \n     a symbolic gesture reflecting the desperation of Pasadena's \n     leaders to ``do something'' about gun crime will become a \n     tough tool against criminals throughout this violence-weary \n     region.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3905-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3906-S3907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       DISCOVERY OF THE TOP QUARK\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nPaul D. Grannis and the New York State D-Zero collaboration members on \nthe discovery of the Top Quark.\n  Dr. Grannis is a physicist at the State University of New York at \nStony Brook and is a leader of an international collaboration of \nscientists working at Fermi National Accelerator Lab in Batavia, IL.\n  The D-Zero collaboration includes scientists from Brookhaven National \nLaboratory, Columbia University, New York University, and the \nUniversity of Rochester as well as those from the State University of \nNew York at Stony Brook. Scientists from Rockefeller University also \nparticipated in the discovery.\n  The discovery of the Top Quark is one of the most important \nachievements in high energy physics this decade. The Top is the last of \nsix Quarks to be discovered and is an integral part of the Standard \nModel of modern physics. This Standard Model not only serves as the \nbasis for our understanding of physics but defines the fundamental \nbuilding blocks of the Universe.\n  Dr. Grannis has headed the D-Zero collaboration at Fermilab for over \na decade. During this tenure he has commuted to Illinois nearly every \nweek while never failing to meet his commitment to academics and \nteaching in New York.\n  I commend him on his extraordinary commitment--which I believe \nexemplifies the high standard of dedication to both research and \neducation in New York. It is a great credit to New York State \ninstitutions that their leadership has culminated in this exciting \ndiscovery.\n  Again, I congratulate Dr. Grannis on this tremendous achievement and \nwish him continued success. Dr. Grannis lives in Stony Brook, NY with \nhis wife Barbara and has four children: Jennifer, Eliza, Helena, and \nDavid.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the March 3, 1995, New York Times article \nby Malcolm W. Browne describing this discovery be included in the \nRecord following the text of these remarks.\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 1995]\n\n              Elusive Atomic Particle Found by Physicists\n\n                         (By Malcolm W. Browne)\n\n       Batavia, Il., March 2--Culminating nearly a decade of \n     intense effort, two rival groups of physicists announced \n     today that they had found the elusive top quark--an ephemeral \n     building block of matter that probably holds clues to some of \n     the ultimate riddles of existence.\n       The announcements brought sustained applause and a barrage \n     of questions from an overflow audience of physicists at the \n     Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where the work was \n     done. Fermilab has the world's most powerful particle \n     accelerator.\n       The two competing scientific teams, each with about 450 \n     scientists and each using a separate detection system, \n     reported that after a long chase in which there had been \n     several false sightings of the top quark, this monstrously \n     heavy but elusive particle has finally been cornered and \n     measured. The results of the two groups' independent \n     measurements differed somewhat, but when margins of error \n     were taken into account, the scientists agreed that the \n     results were consistent.\n       One of the teams, the CDF Collaboration (standing for \n     Collider Detector at Fermilab) reported last April that it \n     had found evidence of the quark's existence. But at the time, \n     the group lacked enough statistical evidence to claim \n     discovery, and the competing group, the D0 (for D-Zero) \n     Collaboration, which had even less evidence of its own, \n     branded the CDF announcement as premature.\n       The achievement claimed today by both teams leaves \n     virtually no room for doubt, however, and the discovery was \n     hailed as a landmark in science. Hazel O'Leary, who as \n     Secretary of Energy heads the Federal agency providing most \n     of the money for research at Fermilab, called the discovery a \n     ``major contribution to human understanding of the \n     fundamentals of the universe.''\n       The finding confirms a prediction based on a theory known \n     as the Standard Model that nature has provided the universe \n     with six types of quarks; the other five, the up, down, \n     strange, charm and bottom quarks had all been known or \n     discovered by 1977. Since the infancy of the universe shortly \n     after the Big Bang--estimated at 10 billion to 20 billion \n     years ago--only\n      the up and down quarks have survived in nature, and the \n     protons and neutrons that make up the nuclei of all atoms \n     are built from combinations of these two quarks; the other \n     quarks disappeared \n     [[Page S3907]] from the observed universe, but have been \n     recreated by modern particle accelerators.\n       Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in \n     Physics and the former director of Fermilab, said at today's \n     meeting that he doubted there could be any more quark types \n     but that ``we know there's a lot of dark matter out in the \n     universe that we can't identify.''\n       ``We're still in for a lot of surprises,'' he added.\n       But more important than merely completing the table of \n     quarks predicted by theory, the top quark may now begin to \n     shed light on a deep philosophical question: everything in \n     the universe, from the most distant galaxy to a rose petal, \n     is made of quarks. Were the masses and other properties of \n     these particles determined by random chance, or by some \n     fundamental unifying plan? If so, what is that plan, and how \n     might gravity, the least understood of the four forces of \n     nature, be related to it?\n       ``This monster, compared with all the other quarks, is like \n     a big cowbird's egg in a nest of little sparrow eggs,'' said \n     Dr. Paul D. Grannis, a leader of the DO group. ``It's so \n     peculiar it must hold clues to some important new physics.''\n       ``The top quark has turned out to be so heavy,'' added Dr. \n     John Peoples, director of Fermilab, ``that it's kind of a \n     laboratory in itself, from which many new experiments will \n     certainly yield important insights.''\n       It may be, scientists believe, that quarks (and the higher \n     forms of matter they make up) are endowed with mass by \n     interacting with an all-pervading universal ``field,'' with \n     which they communicate through a hypothetical particle called \n     the Higgs boson. To find and measure the Higgs boson would be \n     as exciting for a physicist as the creation of life in a test \n     tube would be for a biologist.\n       One of the questions high-energy physicists regard as \n     fundamental is whether there is a single type of Higgs boson, \n     or several types. Theory predicts that if it is possible to \n     accurately measure the masses of two known particles--the top \n     quarks and the W particles that transmit the weak nuclear \n     force--it will be possible to determine whether there are one \n     or more than one Higgs bosons.\n       ``We're so elated by the discovery of the top quark that we \n     haven't yet begun to sift all the data,'' said Dr. Boaz Klima \n     of Fermilab, one of the leaders of the successful search. \n     ``But this particle is so astonishingly heavy that its decay \n     may give us hints of a lot of other things, perhaps even of \n     supersymmetric particles.''\n       The quest for supersymmetric particles by the world's most \n     powerful accelerators during the last decade has failed to \n     turn up any evidence that they exist, but according to some \n     theories, they may be so heavy they are beyond reach of \n     present-day accelerators. If supersymmetric particles could \n     be shown to exist, they might offer scientists a tool for \n     learning how gravity is related to the other forces of \n     nature: the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak \n     nuclear forces.\n       Even when trillions of protons and antiprotons are made to \n     collide in Fermilab's huge accelerator at combined energies \n     of two trillion electron-volts, the creation of top quarks by \n     the miniature fireballs remains a rare event.\n       Dr. Grannis of the D0 collaboration said today that his \n     group, which has been running its detector on and off since \n     1992, has found 17 collisions resulting in evidence of the \n     creation of a top quark. The team was able to calculate the \n     mass of the particle as 199 billion electron-volts, give or \n     take about 30 billion electron-volts. (Particle physicists \n     measure mass in terms of its energy equivalent, because the \n     units are more practical. Einstein's famous equation \n     E=mc2 defines the equivalency of mass and energy.)\n       For their part, according to Dr. William Carithers Jr., a \n     leader of the rival CDF Collaboration, two separate counting \n     techniques using the CDF detector have turned up a total of \n     about 21 top quark events. The group calculates the mass of \n     the top quark as about 176 billion electron-volts, give or \n     take about 13 billion.\n       These results, the competing teams say, are in reasonably \n     close agreement. At any rate, they agree that they have found \n     the quark, and that there is only one chance in about one \n     million that the results could have been caused by anything \n     besides the decays of pairs of top and antitop quarks.\n       One of the main difficulties in identifying the top quark \n     is that it cannot be seen directly. When one is created from \n     the immense pool of energy formed in the collisions of \n     protons and antiprotons accelerated by\n      Fermilab's Tevatron, its lifetime is so brief that no \n     detector could sense it. But the top quark disintegrates \n     into hundreds of daughter particles, which in turn decay \n     into cascades of other particles.\n       From the patterns of ``jets,'' particle types and other \n     characteristics of these decays, theorists have learned to \n     identify the parent particles like the top quark which cannot \n     be detected directly. A jet is a spray of particles moving in \n     the same general direction away from a collision.\n       High-energy physics is expensive. The Fermilab Tevatron \n     accelerator, a ring of superconducting magnets four miles in \n     circumference, cost about $250 million to build, and each of \n     the two detectors built into the accelerator cost about $60 \n     million. An upgrade of the Tevatron called a main injector, \n     costing $228 million, is scheduled for completion by 1999.\n       The Superconducting Supercollider, a project that would \n     have been Fermilab's successor, would have cost more than $8 \n     billion if Congress had not canceled it last year. For the \n     foreseeable future, Fermilab will remain America's most \n     powerful particle accelerator, and scientists say that the \n     machine has at least 15 more years of useful life.\n       The stakes for the high-energy physics community are \n     enormous, in terms of job security, the risks of failure and \n     the promise of great prestige for leaders of successful \n     experiments. Competition between physicists is often intense \n     and sometimes bitter.\n       The CDF and D0 detector collaborations have gone to great \n     lengths to avoid even looking at each others' experiments--a \n     policy that persisted even today minutes before their joint \n     seminar began.\n       ``We know that some of the younger physicists on both sides \n     have been exchanging pirated copies of our reports, but we've \n     tried to suppress such exchanges,'' one physicist said. ``Of \n     course there is friction, but that's a healthy aspect of \n     science. This way, we know that our results are in no way \n     influenced by those of our competitors, and when both our \n     versions of the top quark are published side by side, \n     scientists will be able to judge for themselves.''\n       Despite a joking undertone of bickering between the two \n     collaborations, which include scientists from a dozen \n     nations, a holiday mood today eclipsed old rivalries and the \n     collective anxiety about future financing of high-energy \n     physics.\n       ``We're ecstatic about this discovery,'' Dr. Peoples said. \n     ``Non-scientists often ask me what the point of all this may \n     be. I say it's important because it makes the universe \n     knowable, in the same sense that our discovery of DNA has \n     made the nature of life knowable. We have a long, long way to \n     go, but it's one of the most intellectually satisfying \n     pursuits there is.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/14/senate-section/article/S3906-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.
