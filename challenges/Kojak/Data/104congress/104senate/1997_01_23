When we commit to You \nour lives and each of the challenges we face, we are not only released \nfrom the tension of living on our own limited resources, but a \nmysterious movement of Your providence begins. The company of Heaven, \nplus people and circumstances, begin to rally to our aid. Unexpected \nresources are released, unexplainable good things start happening. The \ntime to begin is now, and the place is here. We all have personal and \nprofessional burdens on our shoulders. Commitment is to roll them off \nour shoulders onto Your strong shoulders, Almighty God. We commit the \nchallenges of this day to You and press on to our work with freedom and \njoy. We claim the promise of Proverbs 16:3, ``Commit your works to the \nLord and your thoughts will be established.'' We claim that, Lord.\n  Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S671-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S671-S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Good morning, Mr. President.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, we will be in a period for morning \nbusiness in order for all Senators to introduce legislation and to make \nstatements in connection and support of those pieces of legislation, or \nto make statements on other issues, if they so desire.\n  As we announced last night, no rollcall votes will occur during \ntoday's session, and when the Senate completes its business today, it \nwill stand in adjournment until Monday, January 27, for a pro forma \nsession only. No business will be conducted during Monday's session, \nand the Senate will automatically adjourn over until Tuesday, January \n28.\n  As all Members are aware, throughout the past week, and continuing \ninto next week, committees are holding hearings with regard to various \nnominations for the President's Cabinet. That is one reason why we are \ntrying to not force activity on the floor of the Senate, so that the \ncommittees can do their work and so the proper investigations and \nhearings can be held. It is my hope that next week the Senate will be \nable to consider additional nominations that may become available to \nthe full Senate. It looks like there may be one or two that would be \navailable next week sometime.\n  So I remind all Senators that rollcall votes are possible, and \nhopefully likely, beginning on Tuesday and throughout the week on those \nnominations or other matters that may become available.\n  Finally, I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation in \nallowing us to finish action on the two nominations yesterday. It was \nnot planned and it was not easy, because some Senators had made other \narrangements. We had some Senators that wanted to go to Massachusetts \nfor the wake of Senator Tsongas, and then we have the funeral \nproceedings today. But we were able to work through that, and there was \na little give and take and I appreciate that.\n\n  I will be sending a letter--hopefully joined by the Democratic \nleader--if not tomorrow, early next week, to also ask Senators at the \nbeginning of the session to be helpful to the leadership by not making \nunreasonable requests as to when votes will occur. I was shocked last \nyear, when I came in as majority leader, at the requests we got from \nSenators who said, ``Can we not have a vote until 11 o'clock on \nTuesday?'' ``Could we not have any votes between 4 o'clock and 7 \no'clock on Thursday?''\n  If we want to have a family friendly Senate, it begins with \nindividual Senators. We will always try to accommodate all Senators \nwherever we can, and we work with the staff on both sides of the aisle \nwhen there are extenuating circumstances--planes are delayed, or when \nthere are funerals that must be attended--and that's fine. But I really \nthink that the practice that has evolved--and I believe it has evolved \nover several years--where 1 Senator is willing to ask 99 Senators to \ninconvenience themselves for their one need, is out of control. It is \nridiculous and unfair. We are not going to be able to get our work done \nand be able to go home at a reasonable hour at night if we can't have \nvotes on Monday, if we can't have any votes until 11 o'clock on \nTuesday, and cannot vote on Thursday\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nafternoon. So, frankly, we are not going to honor those requests when \nthey are ridiculous and of that nature.\n  Senators should know that beginning at 9 o'clock on Tuesday until 6 \nor 7 o'clock on Tuesday, they will be expected to be here to vote, \nunless it is extraordinarily important. We are going to make sure we do \nit in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way. But I think we may have to prove a \npoint here a couple of times. One of the reasons why we always want all \nSenators present is so they can record their constituents' views \nthrough their vote, but also because sometimes absentees lead to defeat \non one side or the other. So Senators need to be here during normal \nworking hours on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and probably some \nMondays and Fridays. We will try to give as long a notice as possible. \nThis is not an election year. We need to change our approach as to how \nwe do our work.\n  I plead with the Senators, don't continue that practice. It will not \nbe our intent to honor it when it borders on the verge of being, as I \nsaid twice before, ridiculous. We will send a written letter to every \nSenator from the leaders on both sides, hopefully, asking that this \nrequest be honored.\n  Seeing no Senator seeking recognition at this point, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S671-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could just be recognized momentarily, I \nam pleased to join with the Democratic leader and Senator Byrd in \npresenting this resolution for Alan Scott Frumin.\n  He is a Parliamentarian Emeritus who has already served 20 years. He \nis in his 21st year in the Senate with all of those years in the \nParliamentarian's Office, and he says he has actually started \nunderstanding and learning the rules. But it has taken 21 years because \nit is not an easy thing to do.\n  But he, obviously, has done outstanding work. He has been \nnonpartisan, as he should be in that position. He has been the \nParliamentarian of the Senate for 8 years.\n  He is a New York native with a law degree from Georgetown. He \ncertainly has earned this distinction and this recognition. And I \nexpress our appreciation on behalf of the grateful Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof the distinguished majority leader. I, too, want to congratulate Alan \non his honor. It is certainly well-deserved.\n  He has made many of us look good as we sat in the chair of the \nPresiding Officer time and again, late at night and early in the \nmorning. He turns around in his own tactful and subtle way and gives us \nthe instructions to pass on to our colleagues as the Presiding Officer. \nSo it is not only his knowledge but his demeanor that has meant a lot \nto me.\n  We respect him. He knows he has a lot of friends as Members who have \ncome to rely upon him because of that respect. And today we call \nattention to his 21 years contributing to the Senate in the \nParliamentarian's Office in such a professional way. We congratulate \nhim, and we thank him for his service.\n  We thank Senator Lott, Senator Byrd, and others who have seen fit to \noffer this resolution today.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this morning, several of our colleagues \nare traveling to Lowell, MA to say goodbye to one of our own, Senator \nPaul Tsongas. They carry with them the thoughts and prayers of every \nSenator.\n  Whether or not we knew him personally, whether we served in this \nChamber with him or came after him, we are all indebted to Paul Tsongas \nfor the lessons he taught us in his too brief time here, and his too \nbrief life.\n  Paul Tsongas taught us important lessons about how to balance \ncompassion and fiscal reality.\n  He taught us, by example, how to reach beyond party labels to \nsomething bigger. He taught us about how to live with purpose. And, in \nthe end, he taught us something about how to die with dignity.\n  Paul Tsongas was the son of immigrants. His parents owned a dry-\ncleaning shop in Lowell, MA. Paul Tsongas spent every afternoon and \nevery Saturday working behind the counter in his family's business. It \nwas there, he said, that he learned the dignity of work.\n  Like many Americans of his generation, Paul Tsongas answered \nPresident Kennedy's call to join the Peace Corps. His experience in \nEthiopia first sparked his interest in public service.\n  He was elected to the House in 1974 and to the Senate in 1978. He was \na young man when he came here, only 38 years old. His disciplined yet \nopen mind and his capacity for original thought brought him deserved \nattention quickly.\n  Paul Tsongas was a man of ideas and vision. He was a man of good \nhumor who wasn't afraid to laugh at himself.\n  In a town in which decibel levels are too often mistaken for \nconviction, Paul Tsongas stood out for his low-key, reasoned approach \nto lawmaking. It was an approach that served him--and our Nation--well. \nSenator Tsongas accomplished more in one term than many Senators who \nserved here much longer.\n  Paul Tsongas was 42 years old when he was diagnosed with lymphoma. He \ndecided to step down after only one term in order to spend more time \nwith his family--his wife, Niki, and their young daughters, Ashley, \nKatina, and Molly.\n  Having lost his own mother when he was only 6, he knew how important \nit was that his own children know their father. You have to ``pour \nyourself into your children,'' he explained, ``so that when you're not \naround, you're still around.''\n  Paul Tsongas won his battle against cancer. He came back to establish \nthe Concord Coalition with another of our former colleagues, Senator \nWarren Rudman, and even to run for President in 1992.\n  In a newspaper interview that year, he was asked why he would spend \nhis time on a long-shot bid for the White House. He replied, ``I guess \nmy answer is kind of syrupy. I survived, and there is an obligation \nthat goes with that . . . I have an obligation to give something \nback.''\n  Paul Tsongas was a man of unusual courage. He fought until the end--\neven through pain and disappointment--to fulfill that obligation, to \ngive something back. And, in the opinion of this Senator, he succeeded.\n  Senator Tsongas's determination to tell the truth, even when it was \nnot\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\npopular, earned him a nickname. Some called him ``St. Paul.'' Now St. \nPaul has gone on to meet St. Peter. And I suspect he is still working, \ntrying to arrange some divine intervention to help us balance the \nbudget.\n  Years ago, when Paul Tsongas still sat in this Chamber, he spoke to a \nreporter about his hopes for his political career. He admitted that he \nmight like to be President, if the opportunity were given to him.\n  But, he said, ``if it turns out that my job in this business is to \nhelp provide direction--if that's what I end up being remembered for \nwhile someone else carries the ball--well, I could live with that. With \na severe pang every once in a while, but I could live with that.''\n  Paul Tsongas gave us a sense of direction. He lived with purpose and \npassion. And we will all miss him.\n  Today, our thoughts and prayers go out to Senator Tsongas immediate \nfamily, to his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger and stepsister Victoria \nPeters, and to those who remember him as we remember him today. And we \nthank him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S672-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FAREWELL AND THANKS TO SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say farewell and thanks to \nthis class of Senate pages.

Mr. President, today the Senate must bid farewell to a \ngreat group of young people who served as U.S. Senate pages during the \nfall semester.\n  These young men and women from across the country witnessed history \nduring their service to the Senate. Among other things, this class of \npages saw the inauguration of President Clinton, the first Democrat to \nbe reelected President since Franklin Roosevelt. They also were here \nfor the confirmation of the first woman to become Secretary of State, \nMadeleine K. Albright.\n  These pages witnessed the final weeks of Senate service of our \ncolleagues who retired at the end of the 104th Congress, many giants of \nthe Senate among them. In the last few weeks, they also saw the \nswearing in, the first speeches, and the first votes of our new \nfreshmen Senators, any one of whom may be a Senate giant of the future.\n  Having seen our debates and deliberations up close, this group of \npages will take away from here many memories and valuable learning \nexperiences. But they also should take with them our gratitude for \neverything they have done for us and recognition for a job well done.\n  Mr. President, a page's life is not easy. They are up before dawn, at \npage school at 6:15, then here in the Senate for the rest of the day. \nWhile they are here, their duties run the gamut. They help set up the \nChamber, deliver messages all over the Capitol complex, help things \nwork here on the Senate floor, and pack up the Chamber at the end of \nthe day. Then, it is back to the dorm for homework, a little down time, \nand a little sleep before they wake up and do it again the next day.\n  On behalf of all Democratic Senators, I would like to thank the \nfollowing Democratic pages for all their hard work and contributions to \nthe Senate: Rachel Bravman of Massachusetts; Cameron Crow of South \nDakota; Taylor Fitzgerald of Montana; Lewis Golden of Mississippi; Amy \nKitzmiller of Vermont; Amanda McMenamin of Maryland; Kevin McMillan of \nCalifornia; Melissa Schultz of New Mexico; Kathryn Sheldon of \nWisconsin; Nathan Sydnor of Virginia; William Wright of Maryland; and \nNathan Zukas of Wisconsin.\n  I hope that each member of this page class takes back to his or her \nhome State a better understanding of how this government works and a \nbetter appreciation of the need to work together to achieve a common \ngoal. These young people are our future leaders. Measured by their \nbrief service here in the U.S. Senate, we can all feel confident about \nour country's future. Perhaps someday, one or more of them will return \nas Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, let me associate myself with the remarks of the \nminority leader. I never really had a chance to serve with Senator \nTsongas, and I really never had a chance to get to know him, but it is \nhard not to admire his work. He will be missed by his family and loved \nones, and he will also be missed by our country. As a Senator from \nMinnesota, I certainly want to send my love to Paul Tsongas' family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S673-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S673-S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for just a brief period of time today, \nI want to talk about reform because I think the whole issue of the mix \nof money and politics and what we are going to do to change the system \nis going to become the key issue of this 105th Congress.\n  People have been reading in the newspapers and they have been hearing \non the radio or they have been seeing on TV all sorts of comment about \nthe abuses which took place in this past campaign. My argument is that \nthese abuses are embedded in the very ways in which we finance our \ncampaigns.\n  What has happened--and I do not think any of us should fool ourselves \nhere, whether we are Republicans or Democrats--is that to most of the \npeople in the country, from Pennsylvania to Minnesota to California, it \ndoes not even look like elections; it looks like auctions, and I think \nall too many people believe that national political leaders are for \nsale.\n  I would like to say today on the floor of the Senate that I do not \nbelieve that is the case. I do not want to have anything to do with \nbashing of people in public service. I believe in public service. That \nis why I am here. That is why we are here.\n  I also want to say today on the floor of the Senate that as a matter \nof fact we are talking about a certain kind of corruption, not as in \nthe wrongdoing of individual officeholders, but it is systemic, and it \nis more serious. It has to do with the ways in which money determines \nwhat issues are on the table. It has to do with the ways in which money \ndetermines who has the disproportionate amount of access to \ndecisionmaking. It has to do with the relationship between money and \npolitical clout. It has to do with the political system where too few \npeople probably have too much wealth, power and say and the vast \nmajority of the people feel locked out, not well represented.\n  I would argue that the way big money has come to dominate politics \nhas become the ethical issue of our time. I say to all of my \ncolleagues--I make this appeal, and I want to follow\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\nup on this appeal with every bit of leverage I have as a Senator--that \nall of us in office should hate this system. On the one hand, it is a \nbit like the play ``Fiddler on the Roof''--you can argue that, well, \nno, people should not hate the system because in a way the current \nsystem is wired for incumbents. They can raise more money. But I really \nthink all of us should hate this system, because even if you believe in \nyour heart of hearts, even if you are absolutely convinced that the \ncompelling need to raise money never has affected any position you have \ntaken on any issue, even if you believe that, and hopefully it is the \ncase, it sure does not look that way to people. If we want people to \nbelieve in this political process, and we want people to believe in our \nwork, and we want people to believe in the Congress, and we want people \nto believe in us, then we better get this big money out of politics and \nwe better turn this system not upside down--it is upside down right \nnow--we better turn this system right side up.\n  It is just crystal clear. The spending continues to skyrocket, and in \n1996 spending was up and participation down--more disillusionment, more \nindignation, more people in the country losing faith in the elections \nand losing faith in this political process.\n  There are any number of different approaches that can be taken, and I \nwant to talk about three. I have for the better part of last year, year \nand a half, worked with Senators Feingold and McCain, Senator Kassebaum \nwas involved in this--she will be sorely missed--Senator Thompson, \nSenator Graham, and this effort, this piece of legislation, which still \nkeeps too many big private dollars in politics, sure represents a very \nimportant and positive step forward: getting rid of all the soft money, \nall of the huge amounts of money that people can contribute in the name \nof party building, getting the costs of campaigns down, voluntary \nspending limits, some resources for candidates to help challengers. It \ngoes in the right direction, and I will work hard with Senator McCain \nand Senator Feingold.\n\n  There is a separate issue of soft money and all the ways in which \npeople can contribute huge amounts of money, way beyond any spending \nlimit, again, all in the name of party building. With more time, I will \ngo into all of this in specifics. We ought to abolish that. And that \nwould be a focus of mine. I will have a bill on soft money.\n  In the best of all worlds, if you want to talk about desirability, I \nwill tell you something. People in the country are in a downright anti-\nstatus-quo mood, and I really think we ought to model ourselves after \nwhat Maine has done. Maine led the Nation. Maine passed the clean money \noption. And I will be introducing a bill, I hope with other Senators, \nas well, that essentially says, look, we are going to get all of the \ninterested money out, and what we are going to essentially say to \npeople in the country is, look, for around $5 per person, how about a \nsystem where the people own the elections? It is your election. And \nbecause it is your capital, it becomes your Government and we move all \nof this interested, big, private money out. We really do have a level \nplaying field between challengers and incumbents, and we really do have \nclean money politics.\n  I think that is the best system of all, and I look forward to \nintroducing that bill with other Senators and pushing that forward as \nwell.\n  A final point. It may be that none of these approaches in their \nentirety will pass the Senate. And other people will have other ideas.\n\n  But first, to people in the country who might be watching, and I will \nfigure out other ways of having a wider forum: You have to turn up the \nheat, people. The citizens in this country have to turn up the heat. On \nFebruary 22, in Minnesota, we are going to have a town meeting, \nhopefully with the whole congressional delegation. Lots of people are \ngoing to be there from Minnesota. They are going to come, and they are \ngoing to say: Senators and Representatives, we may not know all the \nspecifics of each bill, but we want reform. We want you to change this \nsystem. We are tired of all the big money and we are tired of all the \nvicious attacks.\n  People need to turn up the heat. I think we need something like Earth \nDay. I think we need Reform Day. I think we need to have congressional \ndelegations from every State meeting with people back in the States on \nthe same day within the next couple of months, because this Congress \nhas to take action. And anybody listening, citizens who are listening, \nit has to happen in the first 100 days, because if it does not happen \nat the beginning of this Congress, the atmosphere is going to become \npoisonous. There will be finger pointing and accusations on both sides. \nEverybody is going to try to figure out their own angle, and it will \nnot get done. But this is the time for the reform. Let us move towards \nreal grassroots citizen action.\n  Second, President Clinton, it is important for you to be outspoken. \nPresidential leadership, Presidential power--you need to push for the \nreform. Both parties have made plenty of mistakes. There have been \nplenty of transgressions. There is plenty of wrong, and the accusations \ncan go back and forth in perpetuity. Why do we not, once and for all, \nchange the system?\n  Finally, for myself, at the beginning of this Congress--for a short \nperiod of time I had an interesting discussion with both leaders in \nwhich I maintained I did not know whether we should even go into \nrecess. I thought between January 7 and January 20 we ought to focus \njust on reform. Now we have another recess period coming up in mid-\nFebruary. I think we need to give very serious thought to focusing on \nreform at the very beginning. I am going to try to use whatever \nleverage I have as a Senator to push in that direction.\n  In the Labor and Human Resources Committee the other day I suggested \nanother possibility. Again, these are just proposals as we try to \nfigure out how we can move this process forward. I suggested that \nmaybe, until we have the reform, what we need to do in every committee \nis to have people come in and testify, file written testimony as to \nwhether or not they have given contributions or the organizations they \nrepresent have given contributions to the members of the committee in \nthe year prior to testimony and the year after testimony. I do not know \nwhether that is something to push forward and have a vote on or not.\n  But I think, again, all of these approaches are not efforts to point \nthe finger at a Senator or Representative. That is bashing. I want \nnothing to do with it. Or, for that matter, at anybody who is \ntestifying. But I want to bring into sharp focus what is wrong with \nthis process, the perceptions people have about it around the country, \nall the ways in which it has undercut democracy. You cannot have all of \nthese huge amounts of money pouring into politics and elections and at \nthe same time have real democracy where each person counts as one and \nno more than one. This is the compelling issue for this Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have to take action.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is sort of exciting to begin to move \ninto a\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\nnew Congress, the 105th Congress. You and I and others came first here \nto the Senate 2 years ago with some dedication to principles that we \nstill hold. Now, we have a new opportunity to continue to work toward \nthe implementation of those things that we came away from the election \n2 years ago thinking that people in our States wanted, and people in \nthis country continue to want those things. So we have a great \nopportunity now.\n  I think we had success, particularly in the last few months of the \nlast session, as we moved toward doing something with health care. We \ndid something about a couple of Federal mandates, Federal programs that \nwere in place, such as welfare and farm programs, which have been \nchanged now--and I think are more useful and effective--moving them \ncloser to the States. I think that is a good thing to do.\n  So I hope that we can continue to follow on our efforts in the 104th \nCongress, efforts that will lead us to a smaller Federal Government, a \nFederal Government that is more defined in terms of its role, a Federal \nGovernment that is more efficient and effective in delivering services, \none that is closer to the people that are governed, closer to the \npeople who receive the services and benefits, more efficient in the \ndelivery of those services, less bureaucratic and more accountable. I \nthink that's what all of us would like to do. These are principles that \nmost of us agree to.\n  I am pleased that the President has, in the last year, as well as in \nhis inaugural address and other statements, indicated his support for a \nGovernment that has a balanced budget, that is financially and fiscally \nresponsible not only to taxpayers now, but, maybe even more important, \nto our children and grandchildren in the future. The President has \nspoken of the era of big Government being passed. I think we would find \na lot of agreement to that in the country and here in the U.S. \nSenate. It is very easy to talk about those concepts, and it is \nsomething else to do it. It is something else to put it into place. We \nhave seen and will continue to see--and, of course, I understand that \nthis is the place of great debate, and frankly it is a place of \ndifferences of view. That is what the system is all about. That is what \nelections are about--to put out there alternative choices and voters \nchoose what they support. So we will see that here, as we should--and I \nthink we will debate, I hope, more civilly than we have sometimes those \ndifferences and come to an agreement. We will not have unanimous \nagreement, of course. But this place wasn't designed to have unanimous \nagreement. That is why we vote. That is what the system is all about. \nBut it is very easy to talk about concepts, and, yet, you will see \neveryone say, ``Yes, I am for a balanced budget. I want a balanced \nbudget except for * * * '' and then find many reasons why we can't do \nit.\n\n  So it is very difficult sometimes to move beyond the rhetoric, to \nmove beyond the general principles and put it into place. That, I \nthink, will be our challenge, and we are starting now to do that. So \nthe challenge is, if these are the principles, if these are the \nphilosophies, let us just do it. That is what I would like to talk \nabout a little bit today. I would like to talk about doing some things \nwithin the Government that we have had as a policy for many years and \nreally have not done, and that is more contracting in the private \nsector; some privatization of those kinds of functions of the \nGovernment that could well be carried on in the private sector.\n  Last year I introduced a bill called the Freedom From Government \nCompetition Act. We supported that. As a matter of fact, the Senate \nvoted 59 to 39 on an amendment which was offered as part of the \nTreasury-Postal bill which required, in the instance of activities that \nwere not inherently governmental, that agency to test the alternative \nof doing it in the private sector and seeing if that would be cost \nefficient and cost effective.\n  The bill was not considered last year, but we intend this year to put \nit back in again. It will be something that I believe will move us \ntoward the broader concepts that we are looking for. We can help save \nmoney. We can balance the budget. That is what it is all about. It will \nhelp eliminate some of the programs that are now there by the \nGovernment and bureaucracy that will help us move toward smaller \ngovernment. The privatization of the contracting often can be done on a \nmore local level, which moves it more, of course, toward the people who \nare, indeed, in the private sector. It strengthens the private sector \nand creates a broader tax base. These are the purposes of this kind of \napproach.\n  For some 40 years it has been the policy of government to contract \nwherever possible in the private sector. Unfortunately, that has not \nbeen done. CBO estimated that in 1987 nearly 1\\1/2\\ million Federal \nemployees were engaged in the kinds of functions, the kinds of \noperations, that are commercial in nature. That is a lot of folks doing \nsome things.\n  So what we need to do is to get this principle that has been there, \nthis policy that has been in place but not implemented, I think, in \nsome kind of statutory language which would be fairly simple. The bill \nsimply requires that OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, go \nthrough all the functions of government and segregate those that are \ninherently government--and there are some, of course, which are only \nproperly done by the Government and the bureaucracy but many that are \nnot--and separate those and then have a system in place so that the \nwork in those areas where it can be done easily be contracted or at \nleast be offered for contract. And if they can be done more \ninexpensively and more efficiently by contract, then that would be \ndone.\n\n  Let me add that it is a little more difficult than that in that it \nwill take some change of culture of the agency to adjust itself to the \nidea of putting together specifications of bidding, the bidding \nprocess, and overseeing and carrying out of the bidding process, and it \nwill take some changes in the agency to do that. If the agency stays \nthe same and simply takes some of these functions and contracts, there \nwill be nothing gained. There will just be additional things. But it \ncan be done, and in fact is being done. The agency that probably does \nthe most of that and does it the best is the Department of Defense. \nThey do a number of things of that kind.\n  This is not a new idea. It is an idea that was talked about and \nsuggested in the Reagan Office of Privatization, Citizens Against \nWaste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Defense Science Board, and the \nGrace Commission. Interestingly enough, all three sessions of the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business, 1980, 1986, and 1994, listed unfair \nGovernment competition as one of the top issues impacting small \nbusiness. So it is not new. We have worked during the last 6 months \nsubstantially with groups in the private sector who now are involved in \nthis activity of promoting this bill, and we look forward to it.\n  Lots of things could easily be done. Let me give you some examples: \njanitorial services, printing, map making, engineering services, \nsurveying, and laboratory. In our Wyoming Legislature a number of years \nago when I was a member there, we did this kind of thing, and the focus \nwas sort of on laboratories. We had private laboratories that were very \ncapable of doing these kinds of things that government labs were set up \nto do, and we were able to do that, and we were able to move those \nactivities from the bureaucratic activity to a private one, which \ncreates more jobs, creates more tax base, and creates less cost. So \nthese are the things that we look forward to doing.\n  So, Mr. President, we will have an opportunity certainly over the \nnext number of months to look at the Government, to take the philosophy \nthat most of us have and put it in place to decide how we can make some \nchanges. Change is not easy to make, of course. There is great \nresistance to change. There will be resistance to this kind of change. \nThere will be resistance largely from labor unions that represent some \nof the workers in the Government agencies. But I think that there is a \nreasonable and logical explanation and reasonable and logical reason \nfor taking a look at saving money, smaller Government, more in the \nprivate sector, and more tax base. These are the kinds of benefits that \nwill accrue to families and to America if we can move forward in this \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, we look forward to introducing the bill. We look \nforward to\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nhaving the opportunity to implement the things that we have been \ntalking about in general terms for the last several years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join the millions of Americans whose \nholidays were made just a little brighter this year by the sight of the \nmagnificent 70-foot Engleman Spruce from Utah's Manti-LaSalle National \nForest.\n  I speak not only of those fortunate enough to see the tree in \nWashington, but of others who saw this giant tree of the great American \nwest pass through their cities and towns en route to Washington. Like \nthe relay that brought the Olympic flame to Atlanta, the journey for \nUtah's centennial Christmas tree required no less in the way of \nplanning and cooperation.\n  Many individuals and organizations contributed to this project. In a \ntrue holiday spirit, Mack trucks, which has a subsidiary in Pleasant \nGrove, UT, generously transported this special tree, along with 40 \nsmaller trees to be displayed at other sites in the Nation's Capital, \nthe 2,000 miles to Washington.\n  Stops along the way included Salt Lake City, UT; Cheyenne, WY; \nSpearfish, Rapid City, Pierre, and Sioux Falls, SD; LaCrosse, WI; South \nBend, IN; Pittsburgh and Allentown, PA; and Hagerstown, MD. At each \nstop, people came out to see this great symbol of the season and to \nspread holiday cheer and good will.\n  At its final destination, in Washington, on the west lawn of the U.S. \nCapitol, the tree was appropriately welcomed with holiday carols sung \nby the Salt Lake Symphonic Choir and the Congressional Chorus. Speaker \nGingrich's two nieces threw the switch that illuminated this \nspectacular Christmas tree. The staff of the Architect of the Capitol \nshould be commended for the wonderful job they did erecting the tree \nand decorating it with the ornaments made by Utah's children.\n  Mr. President, Utah takes special pride in having provided the \nnational holiday tree from its soil, particularly during the year \ncommemorating our centennial anniversary as a State. And, we were proud \nthat Utah's history was also a part of this holiday display. Under the \ntree was a miniature railroad to commemorate another great Utah event: \nthe joining of the Nation's railway system with a golden spike at \nPromontory, UT, in 1869. Those who conceived and constructed these \nrailroad cars did a fantastic job.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to reiterate a special note of thanks \nto the organizations and companies that worked diligently to make the \ntree the great success that it became. They include the many local \ncommunities surrounding Orem, UT; Utah's U.S. Forest Service personnel; \nthe Utah Automotive Club; and such corporate sponsors as Mack trucks, \nD.M. Bowman, Inc.; Poulan weedeater; and the Hale Brake and Wheel Co. \nFew efforts like this are successful without the support of the \ncommunity, and these organizations among many others helped to make \nUtah's centennial tree to the District of Columbia project possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S676-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-841.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a \nportion of the Columbia River as a recreational river, and for other \npurposes;\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the columbia river hanford reach protection act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that, in \none act, will do more to protect and restore the threatened salmon runs \non the Columbia River than anything else this Government has tried. \nThis bill will designate the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia \nRiver, the Hanford Reach, as a recreational river under the Wild and \nScenic Rivers Act.\n  The bill I introduce today, with Senator Ron Wyden, is identical to \nS. 1489, my bill from the 104th Congress. That bill was developed with \na broad spectrum of local interests who worked for months to create a \nbill with widespread support. While the 104th Congress did not take \naction on this bill, I feel confident that my colleagues of the 105th \nCongress will see the tremendous economic and environmental benefits of \ndesignating the reach a wild and scenic river and will help me pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Much has happened in the year since I introduced S. 1489. Most \nimportant, the scientific community has verified what many locals \nalready knew: The Hanford Reach will make an enormous contribution to \nsalmon recovery on this embattled river. The Independent Scientific \nGroup [ISG], an expert panel of fisheries scientists, reviewed the full \nrange of salmon recovery programs now in place on the Columbia River. \nThe ISG concluded that the Hanford Reach will be critical to our \nefforts to recover salmon throughout the Columbia Basin. It suggested \nthat chinook salmon from the reach may serve as a core population from \nwhich adults could stray to upstream and downstream tributaries and, \ngiven good conditions, may reestablish lost or declining runs.\n  In this last year, we have fostered a growing consensus that the \nreach is too precious to risk harming. The Governors of the three \nStates of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska recommended protection for the \nreach, citing it as critical to maintaining healthy stocks of salmon \nvital to sustaining the region's fishing economy. The Northwest Power \nPlanning Council has endorsed designation of the reach as a wild and \nscenic river. Likewise, a number of tribal governments have supported \ncontinuing Federal protection of the Reach. Many other wildlife and \nconservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy, \nAmerican Rivers, and the Audubon Society have recognized the importance \nof this stretch of the Columbia and have joined the effort to save it. \nFinally, newspapers in Seattle, Portland, Yakima, and elsewhere have \nendorsed wild and scenic designation.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the splendors of this 50-mile section \nof the river. While most of the Columbia River Basin was being \ndeveloped for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and other economic \nactivities, the Hanford Reach and other buffer lands within the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation were kept pristine. Ironically, it was the veil of \nsecrecy and security surrounding the Manhattan project that \nsimultaneously protected the now scarce shrub-steppe ecosystem and \ncreated tremendous nuclear and chemical contamination. Fortunately, the \narid land, the river's tremendous volume, and new cleanup and \nrestoration technology has minimized the harm done to this vital river.\n  And vital it is. Its free-flowing nature provides superb habitat that \nproduces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as \nwell as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only \ntruly healthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River. As the \nPacific Northwest is struggling to restore declining salmon runs--and \nspending hundreds of millions of dollars annually to do so--protecting \nthe Hanford Reach is the most cost-effective step we can take since it \nis already federally owned.\n  The reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald \neagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer, elk, and a diversity \nof other wildlife depend on the reach. It contains dozens of rare, \nthreatened, and endangered plants and animals. Biologists have \nidentified several new plant species that they believe are unique and \nfound only on lands near the reach.\n  This part of the Columbia Basin is also of great importance to native \nAmericans, who have lived along the shores and islands of the reach for \nmillennia. There are over 150 archaeological sites along the Hanford \nReach, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The reach's naturally \nspawning salmon remain a vital part of the modern culture and religion \nof native Americans in the area.\n  Another area of importance within the reach is the White Bluffs. \nThese fragile cliffs offer dramatic scenery, unique habitat, and \nfascinating geologic history. Unfortunately, a downstream section of \nthe bluffs has been impacted by irrigation water flowing through the \nunstable Ringold formation sediments causing it to slide into the \nriver, smothering spawning beds, reducing water quality, and deflecting \nthe course of the river. Should these slumps continue or migrate \nupstream, some scientists fear the river could become contaminated when \nit is pushed onto the nuclear reactors lining its south shore. Wild and \nscenic river designation might help prevent such catastrophes.\n  The reach also provides an abundance of recreational opportunities. \nIt is very close to the tri-cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, \nWA, and several hours drive from the major urban centers of Seattle and \nPortland. It affords residents and visitors opportunities to hunt, \nboat, fish, hike, kayak, water ski, bird watch, or simply relax and \nenjoy the solitude. The reach adds tremendously to the quality of \nlife--and economy--of the area.\n  It is because of the reach's importance to the local residents and \neconomy that I convened a diverse group of area citizens in 1995 to \ndevelop this bill that I reintroduce today. This Hanford Reach Advisory \nPanel had a wide array of interests and concerns that we addressed in \nthis bill. For example, there was a concern about the potential impact \na wild and scenic river designation could have on the traditional uses \nof the water and nearby lands. So, the panel incorporated specific \nlanguage to protect current economic activities, such as agriculture, \npower generation and transmission, and water withdrawals. This bill \nexcludes the 3 percent of private property recommended in the National \nPark Service's Record of Decision in order to honor the request of \nthose private land owners. The legislation also guarantees that local \ngovernment and interests have a formal role in the management of the \nriver corridor, which will come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service.\n  In addition, this bill includes the advisory panel's recommendation \nthat the Secretary of the Interior and relevant Federal agencies work \nwith local and State sponsors to develop a program of education and \ninterpretation related to the Hanford Reach. The city of Richland and \narea tribes, among others, have been working with the Department of \nEnergy on a museum and regional visitor center proposal and are eager \nto make the natural and human history of the reach part of the project.\n  This legislation includes provisions urged by the advisory panel to \nimprove the habitat value, access, and appearance of the Columbia River \nshoreline in the tri-cities' area. Much of the rivershore is now lined \nwith high, steep levees that were put in place before the network of \ndams controlled the flow of the river and reduced the need for such \nflood control structures. This bill directs the Army Corps of \nEngineers, which built, owns, and maintains the levees, to coordinate \nwith local sponsors on demonstration projects to restore the \nrivershore. The bill directs the corps to undertake some small levee \nmodification projects in partnership with Kennewick, Pasco, and the \nPort of Kennewick in the short-term. For the longer term, the corps is \ndirected to undertake a comprehensive study of the levees and determine \nif rivershore restoration is feasible and should become a Federal \npriority.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by again thanking my Hanford Reach \nAdvisory Panel and reiterating to my colleagues the importance of \nprotection of the Hanford Reach. The reach is the last free-flowing \nsection of the mighty Columbia and as such produces outstanding salmon \nhabitat, superb recreational opportunities, and vital economic \nbenefits. I urge my colleagues to take speedy action, pass this \nimportant bill and permanently protect the Hanford Reach as a wild and \nscenic river.\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 201. A bill to provide for the establishment of certain \nlimitations on advertisements relating to, and the sale of, tobacco \nproducts, and to provide for the increased enforcement of laws relating \nto underage tobacco use, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, pertaining to that bill I have just sent to \nthe desk, Mark Twain used to tell the story about a businessman known \nfor his ruthlessness. The man once told him that before he died he \nwanted to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, climb Mount Sinai, and \nread the Ten Commandments aloud at the top. ``I have a better idea,'' \nTwain said. ``Why don't you stay home and keep them.''\n  As I reintroduce my legislation to combat youth smoking, that is the \nsame message I would like to send to the antitobacco zealots. They are \nmore than happy to shout from the mountaintop their message against \nyouth smoking, but I have a better idea--sit down and make it happen.\n  The antitobacco advocates talk forcefully about the numbers of \nteenagers who begin smoking every day. In citing those figures, those \nadvocates are nothing short of negligent if they reject my legislation \nand allow this issue to be delayed indefinitely by a court fight. They \nwill clearly be choosing delay over compromise, self-promotion over \ncertain progress.\n  The fact of the matter is that while they are willing to spend \nmillions of dollars on glitzy ad campaigns, they are not willing to \nspend any energy forging a compromise. They will not even come to the \ntable. That kind of hardheadedness may mean they can enjoy the \nlimelight a little bit longer, but what about the kids they say they \nwant to protect?\n  Back in August, just a day after receiving word that the \nadministration was set to sign off on FDA's new regulations on youth \nsmoking, I stood before a gathering of the Kentucky State Farm Bureau \nand told them that this was an issue that would be decided either in \nthe courts or in Congress. I told them that without a doubt, the voice \nof the Kentucky farmer stood a much better chance of being heard in \nCongress.\n  But, what my colleagues and the American people need to understand is \nthat our children also stand a much better chance if we solve it in \nCongress. That is why I am back to reintroduce legislation to solve the \nproblem of youth smoking.\n  Why legislation over regulation? Because FDA regulation is tantamount \nto years of court wrangling, creates an entire new bureaucracy at a \ntime of Government downsizing, and perhaps most disturbing to farmers, \ngoes well beyond what is needed to target youth smoking.\n  The Federal Register notice accompanying the regulation says, ``FDA \nintends to classify cigarettes and smokeless tobacco at a future time, \nand will impose any additional requirements that apply as a result of \ntheir classification * * *'' If farmers look to FDA interpretation of \nthat language, they see a grim future for tobacco. Bringing in the FDA \nalso creates a whole new bureaucracy when tobacco is already regulated \nby at least seven Federal agencies. Listen to these. They are regulated \nby USDA, they are regulated by HHS, BATF, IRS, SAMHSA, EPA, and FTC.\n  If you want to know all those initials, I would be glad to do that. \nSAMHSA is important. That is the so-called Synar amendment, our \ndeparted colleague from Oklahoma, that he passed, as it related to \nyouth smoking and set up criteria for States. My State has passed a law \nto meet the requirements of the SAMHSA legislation produced for and by \nour late, departed Congressman. My legislation seeks to reach the same \ngoal, but under the framework already in place, which is the SAMHSA \nlaw.\n  But what should be most disturbing to all Americans about taking the \nregulatory route is the fact that the regulation will amount to nothing \nmore than rhetoric, because it will inevitably be tied up in court for \nyears and years over constitutional questions. What this problem calls \nfor is reason, not more rhetoric. That is why I introduced legislation \nlast year, and that is why I am introducing legislation this year.\n  My legislation represents serious, enforceable measures to combat \nteenage smoking. But it does not interfere with the legal, private \ndecisions of adults, nor does it trample on the first amendment's \nprotection of free speech. The same cannot be said for FDA regulations, \nwhich have already sent advertising, tobacco industry and FDA lawyers \nscrambling to the courts, setting up for lengthy legal challenges, \nwhere the fight will go on for years and years.\n  Even if FDA jurisdiction is upheld in the pending North Carolina \nlawsuit, litigation is still sure to go for years and years, with the \nproblem of teen smoking continuing unabated.\n  My legislation is an effort to reach what I believe should be our \ncommon goal, reducing youth smoking, but reaching that goal within the \nlimits set down by the Constitution, without creating a new \nbureaucracy, and most important, reaching it today rather than \ntomorrow.\n  The bill I introduced last year and the bill I am introducing today \nwould ban outdoor advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \nproducts within 500 feet of schools, prevent advertising of cigarettes \nand smokeless tobacco products in publications with any significant \nyouth subscribership, and prohibit sampling of cigarettes and smokeless \ntobacco products to young people.\n  I believe the bill I introduced last year was sufficient to reach our \ncommon goal. However, this year I have broadened that legislation to \naccommodate many of the other provisions of the FDA regulations, \nincluding a ban on advertising at sports and entertainment events \nattended by youth, and requiring the presentation of photo ID for the \npurchase of tobacco products. Many of our stores today are requiring \nphoto ID. This will make it a law that they must present a photo ID for \nthe purchase of tobacco products.\n  In many areas, my legislation actually goes beyond FDA regulations. \nFor example, my bill bans both paid tobacco advertisements or props in \nmovies and cigarettes or smokeless tobacco advertising in videos, video \ngame machines, or family amusement centers.\n  My legislation this year is different from last year's legislation in \none other important way. I believe it can represent a bipartisan effort \nto solve the problem. In the end, that might be the most important \ndifference because, as my colleagues are well aware, no major tobacco \nlegislation has ever been approved without bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, antitobacco advocates--Democrats and Republicans--all \nshare a common goal: reducing the number of youths smoking. If we put \nour collective efforts together resolving that problem rather than \nadvancing personal agendas, I believe we can solve the problem. I look \nforward to doing so this year in the spirit of bipartisanship and \ncooperation.\n  Mr. President, I know that I am suspect because I am here \nrepresenting a tobacco-growing State. But let me tell you that the \nUniversity of Kentucky commissioned a poll, and almost 90 percent of \nthe people in my State oppose youth smoking. I am not here representing \njust tobacco people, I am here representing my constituents who say \nthat youth should not smoke.\n  All we are trying to do is make it an adult decision, trying not to \ncreate another layer of bureaucracy to stop youth smoking sooner than \nlater. If these people who are antitobacco or antismoking want to \nreally help, come to the table. Let's sit down and work these things \nout. Put it into law. The President will sign it, I have no question \nabout that. But if we send this to the President, we get it signed, and \nit goes into force, we can stop it sooner than later. Five years from \nnow it will still be in court. We have had some first-amendment \nquestions before the Court recently--last year--that shook up the whole \nthrust of the FDA regulations.\n  So I am here with an honest effort, only armed with the silver tongue \nof the truth, as I have heard it said, but I would like for everyone to \nknow that this is a serious, honest effort on behalf of my constituents \nand on behalf of the youth of this country that we get on with the \nbusiness that we were sent here to do and to make this effort \nmeaningful, and meaningful in the direction I think all of us want to \ngo.\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1.

PROHIBITION ON REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       ``Nothing in this Act or any other Act shall provide the \n     Food and Drug Administration with any authority to regulate \n     in any manner tobacco or tobacco products (as such terms are \n     defined for purposes of section 5702(c) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.''.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Ford's introduction of the Tobacco \nProducts Control Act of 1997 is a good first step toward addressing the \nproblem of youth access to tobacco products. I shall work with Senator \nFord and other colleagues in solving it.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco industry has made it absolutely clear that \nthe choice to smoke must be for adults only to make. There is not one \ntobacco farmer in North Carolina who approves of children and teenagers \nsmoking.\n  However, the transparent vendetta waged by overzealous bureaucrats in \nthe Food and Drug Administration against the tobacco family has been \noutrageous. It is a misguided attempt to expand the jurisdiction of FDA \nat a time when the agency is clearly failing in its stipulated mission, \nand is an obvious attempt to usurp congressional authority. Congress \nhas considered--and rejected--numerous FDA attempts to regulate \ntobacco.\n  Mr. President, I thank my able colleague, Senator Ford, who has \nworked so faithfully on behalf of America's tobacco farmers. Once \nagain, I am honored to stand with him.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Ford for \nintroducing legislation regarding the regulation of tobacco.\n  With respect to this very controversial issue, let us set one thing \nstraight--no one supports teen smoking. We need to do more to \ndiscourage youths from smoking. No one is opposed to reasonable \nlegislation that would curb young people from smoking. That much is \nclear and everyone agrees on it.\n  Also, the tobacco companies have pledged that they will do more to \ncurb teen smoking.\n  What is questionable is the notion of the FDA regulating tobacco as \nif it were a drug. This is a stretch by anyone's standards. President \nClinton has said that the era of big government is over, and yet he has \nallowed the FDA to vastly increase its regulatory authority. Ask \nyourselves this question, should the Food and Drug Administration be \nregulating the color of race cars at NASCAR events? This is no--\nabsolutely no.\n  What we need is a bill to address the problems of teen smoking, and \none that protects small North Carolina farmers. I was not elected to \nthe Senate to see small farmers slide into bankruptcy because of the \nClinton administration.\n  The Ford bill is a good start. I continue to work with Senator Helms, \nSenator McConnell, and other Senators to develop a consensus document \nthat can actually pass this Congress.\n  Our goal here is to get something passed so that we don't set the \ndangerous precedent of the FDA deciding that some product is suddenly \ndecreed a drug--and that it will now be regulated.\n  Thank you Mr. President, and thank you Senator Ford for your \nleadership on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 202. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the earnings test for individuals who have attained \nretirement age; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE OLDER AMERICANS FREEDOM TO WORK ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Older Americans \nFreedom To Work Act and request my colleagues' support. This \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nwould remove the limitation on the amount of outside income which \nSocial Security beneficiaries, who have reached retirement age, may \nearn without incurring a reduction in benefits. It would abolish the \nonerous earnings best and allow senior citizens to work without being \npenalized.\n  As you know, the Social Security retirement earnings test reduces \nbenefits to persons between ages 65 and 69 who earn more than $13,500. \nThese reductions amount to $1 in reduced benefits for every $3 in \nearnings above the limit.\n  This limitation is unfair and poses a serious threat to the labor \nwork force. Demographers tell us, that between the years 2000 and 2010, \nthe baby boom generation will be in their retirement years. With fewer \nbabies being born, this Nation is looking at a severe labor shortage. \nWe need the skills, wisdom, and experience of our older workers, and \nthis measure will encourage them to remain in the labor force.\n  Elimination of the retirement earnings test begins the process of \nproviding employment opportunities for older Americans without \npunishing them for their efforts. In the 1930's when the earned income \nlimit was devised, encouraging senior citizens to leave the workplace \nwas seen as a positive act, designed to increase job opportunities for \nyounger workers. Today, with our shrinking labor force, such a policy \nis senseless.\n  It is a pleasure to again sponsor legislation in the Senate to \nabolish the onerous retirement earnings test. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this vitally important legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949 to authorize the transfer to State and local \ngovernment of certain surplus property for use for law enforcement or \npublic safety purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n      federal property and administrative services act amendments\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, for Senator Boxer and myself, \nto introduce legislation that amends the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act of 1949 to allow the Federal Government to \ntransfer to State and local governments surplus Federal property for \nuse for law enforcement or public safety purposes. This bill expands \ncurrent authority which restricts this type of property transfer to \nState and local governments for use only as correctional facilities.\n  Our law enforcement and public safety officials need the flexibility \nthat this legislation provides. While continuing to allow prisons to be \nbuilt, this legislation provides communities with the options they need \nto establish or expand needed law enforcement training facilities, fire \nfighting academies, and the like given an area's particular need.\n  The one thing communities need after a military base closure is the \nflexibility to reuse bases to fulfill their greatest local needs. This \nbill will continue to facilitate the successful reuse of base \nrealignment and closure sites, like March Air Force Base in California, \nfor civilian and public safety purposes. Fighting crime continues to be \na top priority for communities throughout the Nation. It makes sense to \nallow communities to put former military bases to use in that fight.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. Our communities \naffected by base closures deserve all options to facilitate successful \nreuse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 11. A joint resolution commemorating Juneteenth \nIndependence Day, June 19, 1865, the day on which slavery finally came \nto an end in the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     THE JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY COMMEMORATION JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, on behalf \nof myself and Senator Daschle, the distinguished minority leader, a \njoint resolution concerning what has long been known as Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.\n  Joining us as original sponsors of this resolution are Senators Levin \nand Moseley-Braun, who offered similar legislation in the 104th \nCongress.\n  The observance of Juneteenth has long been a tradition among black \nAmericans. It commemorates the days in mid-June, 1865, when news of the \nend of slavery finally reached frontier areas of the country, \nespecially in the American Southwest.\n  The African-Americans who then moved into freedom, and began new \nlives as citizens of the Republic, kept alive the memory of that \noccasion for their descendants.\n  Generation by generation, the experiences of the past have been \npreserved and shared. They have given us lessons in faith, in courage, \nand in perseverance.\n  Today, the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage fosters the \nobservance of Juneteenth Independence Day, not only among those \nfamilies whose ancestors were directly affected by it, but also among \nthe general public. The association will be meeting this year in Dallas \nfrom January 23 to January 25.\n  The introduction of this joint resolution by the two Senate leaders \nis a timely expression of the Senate's regard and appreciation for the \nassociation's efforts.\n  I should mention that this joint resolution is especially appropriate \nas we prepare to observe February as Black History Month, which, to \nborrow the words of the resolution, ``provides an opportunity for all \nAmericans to learn more about our common past and to better understand \nthe experiences that have shaped our nation.''\n  With that in mind, I know Senator Daschle joins me in inviting our \ncolleagues, from all regions of the country, to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery came late to frontier \n     areas of the country, especially in the American Southwest,\n       Whereas the African-Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest thereafter celebrated June 19 as the anniversary of \n     their emancipation,\n       Whereas their descendants handed down that tradition from \n     generation to generation as an inspiration and encouragement \n     for future generations,\n       Whereas Juneteenth celebrations have thus been held for 130 \n     years to honor the memory of all those who endured slavery \n     and especially those who moved from slavery to freedom,\n       Whereas their example of faith and strength of character \n     remains a lesson for all Americans today, regardless of \n     background or region or race, now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       That the annual observance of June 19 as Juneteenth \n     Independence Day is an important and enriching part of our \n     country's history and heritage, and\n       That the celebration of Juneteenth provides an opportunity \n     for all Americans to learn more about our common past and to \n     better understand the experiences that have shaped our \n     nation, and\n       That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the \n     National Association of Juneteenth Lineage as an expression \n     of appreciation for its role in promoting the observance of \n     Juneteenth Independence Day.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we recognize the date upon which \nslavery finally came to an end in the United States, June 19, 1865, \nalso known as Juneteenth Independence Day. It was only on this day that \nslaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Since \nthat time, for over 130 years, the descendants of slaves have \ncelebrated this day in honor of the many unfortunate people who lived \nand suffered under slavery. Their suffering can never be repaired, but \ntheir memory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever \nperpetrated again on American soil. We commemorate Juneteenth \nIndependence Day to honor the struggles of these slaves and former \nslaves, to acknowledge their suffering and so that we may never forget \neven the worst aspects of our Nation's history.\n  But this day and this joint resolution in honor of the end of slavery \nshould also make us feel proud, proud that we as a nation have come so \nfar toward advancing the goals of freedom and justice for all of our \ncitizens. While we must continue ever forward in the search for \njustice, we should be thankful that the tireless efforts of vigilant \nAmericans have enabled us to achieve a society built on democratic \nprinciples and the recognition that all men and women are created \nequal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S676-5", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 99\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee] was added as a cosponsor of S. 99, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow companies to donate \nscientific equipment to elementary and secondary schools for use in \ntheir educational programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 9\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Florida [Mr. \nMack] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 9, a joint \nresolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates to require two-thirds majorities for increasing taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 23--DESIGNATING ALAN SCOTT FRUMIN AS A \n                        PARLIAMENTARIAN EMERITUS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Byrd) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, the law of the land, specifically section \n(1) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, declares that the United States \nshall have a merchant marine sufficient, among other things, to:\n\n       Carry a substantial portion of our international waterborne \n     Commerce; and to serve as a fourth arm of defense in time of \n     war and national emergency.\n\n  The importance of these requirements has been dramatically \nillustrated by the vital role of our merchant marine in World War II, \nKorea, Vietnam, during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and \nmost recently in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia.\n  While the privately owned and operated U.S. flag merchant marine has \nperformed so magnificently and effectively in times of crisis, it has \nalso made extraordinary efforts to ensure that a substantial portion of \ncommercial cargo bound to and from the United States moves on U.S. \nbottoms. Given the chronic overtonnaging in international shipping, \ncut-throat competition, and the competitive edge our trading partners \ngive their national flags, this has not been easy. In addition to \ncompetition with subsidized foreign carriers, U.S.-flag carriers are \nforced to compete with flag of convenience carriers. Over two-thirds of \nthe international vessels operating in commerce are operating under \nflags of convenience. Flag of convenience registries include such major \nmaritime powers as Panama, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu. \nThese registries only require their vessel owners to pay registration \nfees, and shipowners are not required to pay tax on revenues earned, \nnor do employees have to pay income tax, and the shipowner has little \nor no obligation to comply with the nation's law.\n  Nevertheless, if our commercial fleet is to continue to be an \neffective auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, it must \nfirst be commercially viable in times of peace. Otherwise, there will \nbe no merchant fleet when the need arises.\n  I think we all would agree that there is a substantial national \ninterest in promoting our merchant fleet. I think, also, that we would \nall agree that U.S. national security and economic security interests \nshould not be held hostage for lack of U.S.-controlled sealift assets. \nGiven the increasing diminution of the flag fleets of our NATO allies \nit will be more important in the future to sustain a viable U.S.-flag \npresence. Indeed, several laws of our land recognize that national \ninterest and spell out specifically how the U.S. Government is to go \nabout promoting it. Federal laws require that all U.S. military cargo, \ncargo purchased with all loan funds and guarantees from the Eximbank, \n75 percent of concessionary agricultural, and at least 50 percent of \nall other international ocean borne cargo generated directly or \nindirectly by the Federal Government, be carried on U.S. flag vessels. \nThe alarming news is that according to Maritime Administration [MarAd] \nthe total volume of cargo moving under these programs is declining and \nwill continue to do so.\n  According to a report by Nathan Associates, Inc., the 1992 economic \nimpact of cargo preference for the United States is 40,000 direct, \nindirect, and induced jobs, $2.2 billion in direct, indirect, and \ninduced household earnings, $354 million in direct, indirect, and \ninduced Federal personal and business income tax revenues--$1.20 for \nevery dollar of Government outlay on cargo preference, and $1.2 billion \nin foreign exchange.\n  It is, therefore, imperative that U.S. flag vessels carry every ton \nof cargo which these programs and the law intend them to carry. This \nbrings me to the reason for the resolution I am introducing today. \nThere are two substantial problems which threaten the viability of \nthese programs and, therefore, the viability of our merchant fleet.\n  Several agencies administering cargo reservation programs continue to \ndo their almighty best to evade the spirit and letter of the \nreservation laws, that is, find the law inapplicable to a particular \nprogram, or employ other loopholes.\n  Because of this problem of evasion and uneven confidence, the \nCongress amended the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 to centralize \nmonitoring and compliance authority for all cargo reservation programs \nin MarAd. Nevertheless, the problem remains. Critics of MarAd maintain \nthe agency is too timid, and does not discharge its obligation \naggressively. MarAd, on the other hand, says it has limited enforcement \npowers over those Government agencies which are not in compliance.\n  In light of recent proposals to consolidate the Department of \nTransportation's operating divisions, I believe it is more important \nthan ever for the Congress to reiterate its support for our cargo \nreservation laws, so that their administration and enforcement will not \nsuffer from any departmental reorganization.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today merely expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that all of these Federal agencies do what they \nare supposed to be doing now, under existing law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S682-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S683-S684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 25--RELATIVE TO THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to submit a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Postal \nService should issue a series of postage stamps honoring\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nyoung Americans for their extraordinary achievements.\n  It is an unfortunate reality today that America's young people face \nmore difficult challenges than ever before. The lure of gangs, drugs, \nalcohol, and sex increases the potential for irresponsible behavior and \nviolence at ever earlier ages. On a daily basis, young people are \nexposed to a confusing array of messages and sometimes dubious role \nmodels. And even the best-intentioned working parents find it hard to \nspend the kind of quality time with their children that would help them \nsort through these pervasive influences. All too often, the media \nfocuses on negative stories about America's young people.\n  Yet, there are many examples of exceptional young Americans who have \nrisen above these challenges to accomplish extraordinary things for \ntheir community and for their country. Samantha Smith, who lived in \nManchester, ME, is a prime example. In 1982, at the age of 10, Samantha \nwrote a letter to Chairman Yuri Andropov of the Soviet Union urging \npeace at the height of the cold war. As a result, she was invited by \nthe Soviet leader to visit his country the following year. Samantha's \ntrip received worldwide attention, and the schoolgirl became widely \nrecognized as a spokesperson for peace and international understanding. \nTragically, Samantha's life was cut short in 1985 in a fatal plane \ncrash when she was only 13.\n  Other young Americans have demonstrated the same kind of initiative \nand vision which Samantha embodied. The youth of our country need to be \naware of these positive role models from among their own age group. I \nam, therefore, introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today \ncalling upon the U.S. Postal Service to issue a series of stamps \nrecognizing young Americans, starting with Samantha Smith, for the \nextraordinary contributions they have made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S683-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 4, the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this important measure. By amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938, this act would provide employees with flexible work schedules, \nand increase their choices and options for their time at work and \nquality time with their families. Ensuring that such opportunities are \nprovided to our workers, better known as mothers and fathers, can only \nserve to strengthening our American families.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 63 percent of mother and \nfather households now see both parents working outside of the home. \nMoreover, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children now work. That \nis why we must take action now to help employees balance the demands of \nwork and family lives. I believe the Family Friendly Workplace Act is \nan important first step in helping our Nation's working parents do just \nthat.\n  In 1993, the President signed the Family and Medical Leave Act into \nlaw. While well intended, the Federal Government took a 13-page law and \ntransformed it into 300 pages of regulations. It then became a true \nadministrative nightmare. Instead of targeting employees with choices \nand options for their work schedules, the President decided instead to \ntarget employers with a mandated mound of paperwork. To make matters \nworse, the President announced during the 1996 campaign his intention \nto expand the Family and Medical Leave Act by forcing employers to \nprovide school activity and community leave for their employees. Such \nmisguided mandates resurrect the words of Abraham Lincoln who said, \n``You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.'' As \nlawmakers, we have the ability to prevent this Nation from traveling \nfurther down the road of federally mandated workplace conditions. By \npassing the Family Friendly Workplace Act, we will avoid the creation \nof an environment littered with friction and litigation and embrace \nmutual cooperation and respect.\n  Wage payers are not heartless and cruel reincarnations of Ebenezer \nScrooge. Having played the wage payer role for over 26 years, I take \ngreat offense when employers are characterized as being the bad guys. \nThe majority of employers cherish their most valuable assets--their \nemployees. It is truly misleading and deceptive for anyone to say \notherwise. For without the employee, management will ultimately have no \nstaff, no profits--and no business. Watching out for employees is just \ngood business.\n  As an alternative to employer mandates, this legislation would \nprovide compensatory time off that would allow employers to offer and \nemployees to choose to use compensatory time for school and family \nactivities and a whole range of other personal reasons--without getting \nthe Government involved in certifying and documenting these events. The \nPresident's expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act would require \nemployees to get certification for taking time off to attend a child's \nsoccer match, piano recital, or even a meeting with a school-teacher. \nUnder this bill, employees have the right to choose compensatory time \ninstead of cash wages at a rate not less than 1\\1/2\\ hours of each hour \nof overtime worked. Employees would be able to accrue up to 240 hours \nannually and have the opportunity to cash-out their accrued hours at \nleast once a year. That's a lot of time we should be spending with our \nchildren--an investment in our future.\n  Federal employees have enjoyed flexible work schedules, chock full of \nchoices and options, since 1978. Legislation that amends the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 is long overdue. We appear to have no confidence \nin private sector employees' ability to make rational decisions on how \nto spend their time.\n  I have been blessed with a wife and three wonderful children. Like \nmany who place value in time shared with family, I believe that such \nmoments are a priceless commodity that can never be replaced--or \nregained--once lost. At a time when our society clings to every fiber \nof family life, I can see no better way for Congress and the President \nto express our support for the American family than by passing and then \nurging the President to sign into law, S. 4, the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving employees the opportunity \nto balance their work and family obligations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S684-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S684-S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FLOOD OF 1996\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, while people in Washington and \naround the country celebrated the Presidential inauguration this past \nweekend, people in New York State observed the 1-year anniversary of an \nevent of a very different kind--one of the worst natural disasters we \nhave ever faced. In New York, especially upstate New York, January 19, \n1996, will forever be known as the day the waters came.\n  A combination of severe thunderstorms and melting snow led to one of \nthe worst floods in our State's history. Forty-one of the State's 62 \ncounties were declared disaster areas. According to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, damages were greater than $100 million. My \nhome county, Delaware, was the hardest hit; bridges were washed away, \nhomes were ruined, roads were destroyed, fields were inundated, and \nentire villages were left under water. Six of the eleven fatalities \ncaused by the flood were in Delaware County.\n  Over the past year, the people of New York have tried to rebuild \ntheir homes and their lives. Our towns, villages, and counties have \ntried to rebuild their roads and municipal facilities. FEMA and the \nState Emergency Management Office, or SEMO, have been there to help, \nbut it has not been easy. The flood of January 19 was not the only one \nof the year. It came just 2 weeks after the great blizzard of 1996. \nThen in October, the New York City area was hit by a severe flood, and \nonly a month later, large parts of upstate New York were flooded again. \nAlthough not as severe as the January floods, heavy rains again caused \ndamages in several areas of the State, especially Clinton and Essex \nCounties in the northeast corner, and once again, Delaware County was \nhit.\n  Ask any local official in upstate New York what they will remember \nmost\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nabout 1996 and invariably he or she will say the floods. We have spent \nthe last year trying to recover and rebuild, and I thank FEMA Director \nJames Lee Witt and Regional Director Lynn Canton and SEMO Director Ed \nJacoby for all their help. We have made a lot of progress but, as \nDelaware County Board of Supervisor's Chairman Ray Christensen will \noften tell you, ``We have to realize things will never be the \nsame.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S684-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEFENDING AMERICA ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ndistinguished majority leader, and my colleagues, in cosponsoring \nSenate bill S. 7, the Defending America Act of 1997. This legislation \nbuilds on the significant, but still insufficient, progress we \naccomplished in the 104th Congress. During the last session of \nCongress, we were able to secure the funding necessary for the eventual \ndeployment of a missile defense system capable of protecting the United \nStates. But we were not able to explicitly direct that we deploy the \nmissile defense system as soon as possible. This leaves us with no \nassurance that the funding we have secured will be used, efficiently \nand expeditiously, for its intended purpose.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the majority leader, in close cooperation \nwith Congress' national defense leadership, has crafted a proposal that \nwould secure our Nation's missile defense through prudent development \nof policies and force structures. To begin with, we would produce the \nsystem necessary to protect the United States from limited, \nunauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks. We then would \naugment that capability to defend our Nation against larger and more \nsophisticated ballistic missile threats. I am especially heartened that \nthe most promising antiballistic missile technologies, including sea-\nbased systems such as Navy Upper Tier, are fast approaching the point \nat which we will be able to make them operational.\n  We need this technology, in my view, because the post-cold-war world \nremains a dangerous place. Ballistic missile proliferation to rogue \nregimes continues apace. The security of nuclear armed ballistic \nmissiles in the former Soviet Union has declined sharply. Given these \nfacts, old strategies and treaties can no longer meet our national \nsecurity needs. We must develop and deploy a ballistic missile defense \nsystem capable of protecting our cities and citizens from disastrous \nattack.\n  I mentioned old treaties, Mr. President. I would like in particular \nto discuss the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty and its relationship to \nmissile defense. Congress has repeatedly stated that the ABM Treaty \ndoes not, in any way, hinder the development of theater ballistic \nmissile defenses. It has also called for a renegotiation of the ABM \nTreaty so as to allow the development of more robust national missile \ndefense systems.\n  Mr. President, the times have changed since the ratification of the \nABM Treaty. Our primary threats no longer come from a general nuclear \nattack by thousands of Soviet weapons--an attack that would probably \noverwhelm a ballistic missile defense system. Today our immediate \nthreats come from rogue, unintentional, or unauthorized attacks of \nlimited size and duration. I believe we are quickly approaching the \npoint of our last, best hope in properly modifying the ABM Treaty, and \nprotecting America from ballistic missile attack.\n  The majority leader has displayed the foresight and perceptiveness \ncritical for developing effective national security strategies. There \ncan be no doubt that a fully operational and technologically capable \nballistic missile defense system is crucial to that strategy. Nor can \nthere be any doubt that antiquated treaties which fail to adapt to \nvastly different national security threats must be either changed or \ndiscarded.\n  The majority leader's bill constitutes a reasonable and moderate \nattempt to bridge the philosophical gap that exists between Congress \nand the administration. We should not let this opportunity be \nlost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S685-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S685-S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncommemorate, with very deep patriotic pride, the 50th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Pacific Command.\n  On January 1, 1947, the U.S. Pacific Command was established to unify \nwith the Alaskan and Far East commands.\n  As the largest of nine unified commands within the Department of \nDefense today, the U.S. Pacific Command interacts daily with foreign \nmilitary and civilian leaders, serving as a key link for the United \nStates in the most dynamic region of the world--a region that contains \n44 countries, two-thirds of the world's population, and 7 of the \nworld's largest armed forces.\n  During the past 50 years, the Asia-Pacific theater has grown from a \nwar-torn region recovering from the devastation of World War II to the \nmost dynamic economic region in the world. The importance of the United \nStates' interest in the Asia-Pacific theater is best illustrated by the \npivotal role of East Asia's economies in the world's economic order. \nThe Asia-Pacific gross national product surpassed the European Union in \n1990, and today, our trans-Pacific trade now exceeds $503 billion per \nyear.\n  Fostering peace, providing security, and meeting the challenges \nwithin an area totaling more than half of the Earth's surface, the U.S. \nPacific Command is represented by more than 300,000 trained and highly \ndedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  Mr. President, after World War II, our Nation's military leaders \nrecognized the importance of unity of forces worldwide. On December 14, \n1946, President Truman approved the first unified command plan, and on \nJanuary 1, 1947, the U.S. Pacific Command was established.\n  During the past 50 years, the U.S. Pacific Command's responsibilities \nhave expanded to include the west coast of the United States, the \neastern shores of Africa, all points in Asia, and the Arctic to the \nAntarctic.\n  Mr. President, during the past 50 years, U.S. Pacific Command Forces \nhave been engaged in three major conflicts and numerous military \nactions. During the Korean conflict, Vietnam conflict, and the Gulf \nwar, the United States Pacific Command Forces have fought bravely.\n  The United States Pacific Command provided forces to support the \nUnited States, Far East and U.N. Commands during the Korean conflict. \nThese support forces were primarily in the form of naval assets which \nconducted patrolling missions and aided amphibious operations by \nproviding naval gunfire, sealift and airstrikes from carrier task \nforces. The naval airstrikes were an integral part of the overall air \ncampaign.\n  The United States Pacific Command oversaw our involvement through all \nphases of the Vietnam conflict--from the build-up and military actions \nto the withdrawal of United States combat forces. However, Mr. \nPresident, as many will sadly agree, memories of the Vietnam conflict \nwere not over for the United States Pacific Command. The command \nbecame deeply involved in the emotional repatriation of American \nprisoners of war during Operation Homecoming. Additionally, the United \nStates Pacific Command assisted with the movement of Vietnamese \nnationals to the United States and the airlift of Vietnamese children \nduring Operation New Life and Operation Babylift, respectively.\n\n  During Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the United States Pacific \nCommand Forces provided vital ground, sea, and air assets in support of \nU.S. Central Command Operations conducted in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nIraq, and off-shore in the Arabian Sea.\n  The United States Pacific Command deployed forces to Haiti during \nOperation Uphold Democracy and continues to deploy forces in support of \nthe United States' interests in the European and Middle Eastern \ntheaters.\n  Today Mr. President, the U.S. Pacific Command's mission is to foster \npeace, deter aggression, and rapidly respond to crisis. If necessary, \nthey will fight to maintain security and stability throughout the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  In order to maintain security in the vast Asia-Pacific region, the \nU.S. Pacific Command has the U.S. Army Pacific, the Pacific Fleet, the \nPacific Air Forces, and the Marine Forces Pacific as its service \ncomponents. Additionally, its sub-unified command includes United \nStates Forces Korea, United\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nStates Forces Japan, the Alaskan Command, and the Special Operations \nCommand, Pacific.\n  The U.S. Pacific Command leads two task forces. The Joint Task Force \nFull Accounting was established to achieve the fullest accounting of \nAmericans still missing in Southeast Asia as a result of the Vietnam \nconflict. Through the task force's efforts, more than 2,000 \ninvestigations have been completed and 350 sets of remains repatriated. \nThe Joint Interagency Task Force West, the second standing task force, \nbrings DOD resources to bear in support of law enforcement agencies to \ndisrupt international drug traffickers from Southeast and Southwest \nAsia.\n  Mr. President, most recently and at my urging, the Asia-Pacific \nCenter for Security Studies was established to strengthen existing \nbilateral relationships through the multilateral study of security, \neconomic, social, and political issues in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  This further compliments the U.S. Pacific Command's mission of \nbuilding bilateral and multilateral bonds within the Asia-Pacific \nregion. Annually, the command conducts more than 400 exercises, and \nother bilateral and multilateral training events. The command assists \n29 different nations with humanitarian and civic assistance funds and \nprovide more than $12 million in equipment to developing and emerging \nnations. The U.S. Pacific Command also responds to natural disasters. \nThe command has provided needed assistance in the wake of devastation \ncaused by the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, the destructive winds of \nHurricane Omar on Guam, and the earthquake and flooding in China, and \nhelped their neighbors on the Island of Kauai following Hurricane \nIniki. The U.S. Pacific Command actively engages our friends and allies \nthrough training exercise participation, military contacts, \nhumanitarian aid, and disaster relief.\n  Mr. President, since its establishment, the U.S. Pacific Command has \nremained a beacon of democracy and freedom in the region. Today, it is \nan active living embodiment of U.S. security to the Asia-Pacific area. \nIt is a commitment which has been maintained during the past 50 years--\nand a commitment I am confident they will fulfill well into the 21st \ncentury.\n  It is indeed a pleasure for me to salute the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and civilian employees, both past and present, of the \nU.S. Pacific Command on its 50th anniversary. Thank you for your many \ncontributions--lives saved, lives improved and enhanced for a better \ntomorrow. This was achieved, on occasion, at the cost of U.S. lives and \nU.S. blood spilt. We honor the memory of those brave men and women who \nmade the supreme sacrifice for the sake of peace and stability in the \nregion.\n  Adm. Joseph W. Prueher has the distinct honor of leading the U.S. \nPacific Command on its 50th anniversary. I have no doubt that he will \nlead the command forward with the same valor and distinction as those \nwho have come before him. Congratulations and best wishes to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S685-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S686-S687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, January 22, 1997, I \nintroduced S. 112, the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1997. \nOne day after its introduction, the Law Enforcement Steering \nCommittee--a committee of 10 police associations, representing 500,000 \nlaw enforcement officers nationwide--wrote me to endorse this bill in \nthe strongest terms.\n  This legislation will require the Treasury Department to work with \nthe Justice Department in order to develop uniform ballistics standards \nfor testing the capability of ammunition to pierce police body armor. \nThis bill will, I hope, mark my final step in a 15-year journey to ban \nall cop-killer bullets in America. In 1986 and 1994, Congress \nrecognized the importance of this issue, and we passed bills that \nestablished a content-based ban on this type of ammunition. But, until \nwe ban these bullets based on performance, rather than on their \nphysical characteristics, policemen everywhere will remain in extreme \nperil.\n  As the Law Enforcement Steering Committee wrote in their letter to \nme, ``This is an issue of life-or-death importance to every law \nenforcement officer in America.'' I have faith that my colleagues will \nonce again recognize the crucial nature of this issue and enact S. 112 \nearly in the 105th Congress.\n  I ask that the full text of the Law Enforcement Steering Committee's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                           Law Enforcement Steering Committee,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: On behalf of the Law Enforcement \n     Steering Committee, an organization representing \n     approximately 500,000 law enforcement officers nationwide, we \n     write in strong support of the Law Enforcement Officers \n     Protection Act of 1997, your legislation to require uniform \n     ballistics standards for testing the capability of ammunition \n     to pierce police body armor. This is an issue of life-or-\n     death importance to every law enforcement officer in America.\n       The existing statutory ban on armor-piercing bullets, which \n     you wrote and successfully shepherded through Congress in \n     1986, and updated in 1993, has worked flawlessly for more \n     than a decade. As you have pointed out, however, new styles \n     of armor-piercing bullets continue to appear, making it \n     impossible for the current content-based ban on ``cop-\n     killer'' bullets to remain effective indefinitely. This is \n     why we applaud your efforts to revise the law to ban any new \n     bullets that are determined by a standardized ballistics test \n     to have armor-piercing capability.\n       These ``cop-killer'' rounds have no legitimate sporting \n     use, and it is imperative to ensure that criminals do not \n     gain access to them. Now that the Commerce Department's \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has \n     demonstrated that it is possible to develop a ban based on \n     performance standards, we agree with you that immediate \n     action should be taken to enact such a ban.\n       Our members appreciate your continued attention to this \n     issue since 1982, when you first introduced legislation to \n     ban armor-piercing ammunition, and we hope that the Law \n     Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1997 will be enacted \n     early in the 105th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         James A.

Rouse Caffey will retire from Louisiana State \nUniversity, completing a career of notable accomplishments and a tenure \nof extraordinary leadership and service.\n  It is most appropriate, therefore, on the occasion of his retirement \nthat the State will proclaim, January 24, 1997, as H. Rouse Caffey Day \nin Louisiana, a tribute of which he is most deserving.\n  For about 30 of those 36 years, I've known Dr. Caffey personally. \nI've worked closely with him on many occasions. I will miss him, as \nwill many others who've had the privilege to work with him.\n  Distinguished leadership and service have been the hallmarks of Dr. \nCaffey's career, including his most recent role as chancellor of the \nLSU Agricultural Center, a position which he has held for 13 years.\n  His genuine devotion to the LSU Agricultural Center and the people of \nLouisiana has kept farmers, families, and youth knowledgeable about the \nmost recent information available to help improve their lives.\n  Dr. Caffey's service to this country as national cochair of the \nInternational Science and Education Council from 1986 to 1991 and as \nnational cochair of the Joint Council for Food and Agricultural \nSciences from 1989 to 1995, earned him the respect and admiration of \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and land grant institutions across \nthe Nation.\n  In addition, Dr. Caffey's international agricultural activities in 30 \nforeign countries have earned for him, for LSU, for Louisiana, and for \nthe Nation the respect and admiration of leaders abroad and have led to \nimproved and lasting relationships with them.\n  His other LSU appointments have included superintendent of the LSU \nRice Research Station at Crowley, LA; associate director of the \nLouisiana Agricultural Experiment Station in Baton Rouge; vice \nchancellor for administration of the Center for Agricultural Sciences \nand Rural Development; director of International Programs; and \nchancellor of LSU at Alexandria.\n  Throughout Dr. Caffey's career, he has received numerous awards and \nhonors, including the 1993 LSU Alumni Association Alumnus of the year; \n1994 Alumnus of the Year for the College of Agriculture and Home \nEconomics at Mississippi State University; and Progressive Farmer \nmagazine's 1986 Man of the Year for Louisiana Agriculture.\n  Dr. Caffey's personality, dedication, knowledge, service, and \nleadership have left a unique and lasting impression on LSU, its \nagricultural center, and the agricultural community nationally and \ninternationally.\n  Dr. Caffey will always have my respect and admiration, sentiments \nwhich are shared, I know, by the many individuals and organizations led \nand served so well by him over the years.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I take this occasion to commend Dr. Caffey \npersonally for his lifetime of distinguished leadership and service and \nto wish him every continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S687-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S687-S688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF CLARENCE TABA\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nretirement of Mr. Clarence Taba of Hawaii after 22 years of service as \nexecutive director of the Hawaii Bankers Association.\n  During World War II, Mr. Taba was one of the young men who enlisted \nand became a member of the 442d Regimental Combat Team--an infantry \nunit composed of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Taba's courage was \nprominently displayed during the rescue of the Texas ``Lost \nBattalion''--141st Infantry of the 36th Division--in France, for which \nhe earned a Silver Star and two Bronze Star Medals for leadership and \ngallantry in combat, and three Distinguished Unit Citations with 5 \nbattle stars, for his participation in pivotal battles in Italy and \nFrance.\n  As a veteran, Mr. Taba served as the first State commander of the \nHawaii Disabled American Veterans.\n  Mr. Taba is well known and well respected within Hawaii's financial \ncommunity. His financial career commenced shortly after the end of \nWorld War II, when he organized a Federal credit union for his 442d \nRegimental Combat Team comrades. Mr. Taba became the first American to \nqualify as a certified credit union executive, and was also the first \nAmerican to be awarded the Edward Filene Award for Volunteer \nAchievement. He also served the Hawaii financial community as the \nmortgage operations officer for Bank\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nof Hawaii, cashier for City Bank of Honolulu during its organizing \nyears, Senior vice president and operations officer for the State of \nHawaii's largest savings and loan at that time, and senior bank \nexaminer for the State of Hawaii.\n  Mr. Taba was appointed as the first executive director of the Hawaii \nBankers Association in September 1975. Throughout the years, he has \ndiligently worked to bring the local banks together, especially on \nsignificant issues such as the recodification of Hawaii banking laws, \nand the passage of such bills as the Credit Sales Contract Act and the \nIndustrial Loan Act. He also spearheaded the many projects \ntraditionally undertaken by the Hawaii Bankers Association throughout \nthe calendar year, including the annual convention, installation \nluncheon, and various seminars. The Hawaii congressional delegation is \nextremely grateful for the assistance and guidance Mr. Taba has \nprovided throughout his tenure at the HBA to ensure that Hawaii's \ninterests were addressed.\n  The Hawaii Bankers Association continues to be a key player in the \nState of Hawaii's economy. Despite stiff competition, the different \nbanks always work together in the spirit of aloha and harmony. Mr. \nTaba, in his own special way, has ensured all of that.\n  I wish to join the banking industry and the people of Hawaii in \nthanking Clarence Taba for his dedicated efforts over the years on \nbehalf of the State of Hawaii and our Nation, and to wish him a happy \nand fulfilling retirement.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S687-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S688-S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WINTER STORMS IN THE DAKOTAS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the agricultural statistical folks \nwho have been doing surveys in the Dakotas have told us that the winter \nstorms--successive, bitter, awful winter storms that have hit one after \nanother--in our State have killed somewhere around 13,000 cattle in \nNorth Dakota. It has been a rugged difficult time for North Dakotans \nand for livestock producers in our State.\n  I spoke the other day about the kind of bitter storms that we face, \nalmost unlike any that most of us in North Dakota can remember. And \nagain, within the last 24 hours, another storm has hit. Both interstate \nhighways, the east-west highway in North Dakota and the north-south \nhighway, were closed down completely. Snow, 50-mile-an-hour winds, and \nbitterly cold temperatures make this an awfully difficult time for \nNorth Dakotans.\n  Thousands and thousands of volunteers in North Dakota have responded \nto the crisis. And the Federal Government has too. President Clinton \nhas declared that our entire State is suffering from a major disaster. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is in North Dakota. They are \nrounding up heavy equipment from around the country to come and help us \nopen roads to help protect the lives of people and the livestock herds.\n  The Department of Agriculture has provided some feed assistance and \nsome other aid to try to help producers get to their cattle and feed \nthem. So we have had some help. But we need more. And today we are \ngoing to be visiting with the Department of Agriculture once again \nbecause the assistance they have offered so far--feed assistance for \nlivestock--is simply too narrowly drawn to be of very much help to \nanybody. It is of help to some but it is just too narrow.\n  It is interesting. In the last Congress when the freedom to farm bill \nwas passed these emergency feed programs were abolished. I thought it \nwas the wrong thing to do. And it was. But they were abolished. Now we \nhave gotten the Department of Agriculture to try to jury-rig an \nemergency approach to try to give us some help. But they need to \nbroaden that substantially so the livestock producers--farmers and \nranchers out there, many of whom have been operating on very thin \nmargins anyway--have the capability of getting their roads open, \ngetting the feed in, and feeding their herds.\n  We really do need some help not just in North Dakota but in our whole \nregion of the country.\n  So we are going to be visiting with the Department of Agriculture \nagain this afternoon to try to broaden this approach to see if we can't \nget some help in there. Mr. President, 13,000 cattle have died in North \nDakota. Many more are at great risk because they have survived five or \nsix blizzards now and are hit with another at the moment. We expect \nother storms. So this is a very difficult problem.\n  I spoke the other day about the heroes in our part of the country \nduring this difficult winter, and talked about going out on a snowplow \nwith a crew in conditions in which you couldn't see 2 feet in front of \nyou; nearly whiteout conditions with 50-mile-an-hour winds, bitterly \ncold; going up by a trailer court where you could not see any trailer \nhouses because even their roofs were not to be seen; snow was over the \nroof line. Conditions were about as difficult as they could get, and \nyet people made an emergency run to help get a 2-year-old boy, about \nwhom I talked the other day, to a hospital who would have died had he \nnot gotten there, a 20-mile trip that took 6 hours with four people \ndriving two ambulances, two snowplows and two trucks plowing through \nroads that were impassable, in zero visibility conditions, with 40- and \n50-mile-an-hour winds. The people who do that are public servants out \nthere to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude and who are really truly \nheroes.\n\n  I also wanted to mention another fellow in North Dakota who I think \ndeserves mention because when we have these tough times it is not just \nthe program that is put in place to help people; it is the people who \nhelp people, neighbors coming together and doing things to help each \nother.\n  On Tuesday night this week, at 10 o'clock in the evening, Jan Novak \nwas driving home, having just finished her work, in Grafton, ND. As Jan \nNovak was driving home--and that was a point when the blizzard was \nhitting and the interstates were being closed and giant winds were \ncoming up--she lost her way and could not see much in front of her. She \nhad to pull off the road and became stuck in a snowbank.\n  And there she was in the middle of this raging blizzard. This was \njust Tuesday evening of this week.\n  She did say she had blankets and she had some gas. She was not \nfeeling that she maybe would not be found. She felt that she would be \nable to hold out, and she started her car intermittently in the \nterribly cold weather, but then she worried about whether her car was \ngoing to start just based on the sounds from her engine.\n  Her husband called the Walsh County Sheriff, Lauren Wild, about 1 \no'clock in the morning, and the sheriff tried to get some people out to \ntake a look to see where she was. They tried to search the road she \nmight have taken to go home out in the country from Grafton, ND, and \nthey searched for several hours, and in conditions of almost no \nvisibility and could not find Jan Novak, who was then out there stuck \nin the car.\n  And they also called people along the route. They called a fellow \nnamed Halvorson, Don Halvorson, at 3:30 in the morning--he is a \nfarmer--got him out of bed, woke him up and told him that there was a \nwoman lost along this route and they could not seem to find her. Of \ncourse, Don Halvorson had not seen her, nor had anyone else passing \nalong the way, and because nobody could see the roads they eventually \nhad to call off the search.\n  Don Halvorson could not sleep, he said. So at 3:30 in the morning, \nafter having gone back to bed and not being able sleep, he got up, put \nhis clothes on and went out in the yard and started his tractor, which \nhad a cab on it, and went out to look. And with the tractor, in \nconditions of almost zero visibility, for 3 hours he searched up and \ndown his road and up and down his area of the country, and somewhere \naround 6:30 in the morning this fellow named Don Halvorson, in his \ntractor, pulled up to\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nJan Novak's car. And he got out of the tractor and rescued her, took \nher back to his home. She says that he is a true hero, and he said he \njust could not sleep knowing there was somebody out in that storm.\n  It is interesting to me that these stories of people helping each \nother seem to get so little attention. This one did get a little \nattention. But bad news travels halfway around the world before good \nnews gets its shoes on, they say, and I understand that. But there are \nwonderful stories of people who cannot sleep when something is wrong \nand who want to go out and help other people.\n  In our part of the country, and I expect in the part of the country \nthat is represented by the Presiding Officer, we face some pretty \ndifficult times. And the only way you get along is to work with each \nother, neighbors helping neighbors, folks helping folks. Don Halvorson \ncould have gone back to sleep, I suppose. He did not know where Jan \nNovak was. He did not know Jan Novak. Instead, he got up, put on his \nclothes, got in his tractor in bitterly cold weather, with raging wind \nand zero visibility, and risked his life to go search for a woman \nstranded in the blizzard whose life was also at risk.\n  Even as I talked today about the need for some help from the \nDepartment of Agriculture for livestock feed and for ranchers and \nfarmers out there who are struggling, I also wanted to pay homage to \nsome heroes who are out there. Some are on road crews today working \nshift after shift. Some are also in farmhouses helping neighbors get \nalong in about as difficult a winter as I can remember in the history \nof North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and make a point of order \nthat a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/23/senate-section/article/S688-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRINTING OF SENATE DOCUMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
